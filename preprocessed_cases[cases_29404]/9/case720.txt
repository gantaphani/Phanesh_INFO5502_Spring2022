barrington cove limited partnership barrington appeals from a district court order which dismissed its civil rights action against the rhode island housing and mortgage finance corporation rihmfc for allegedly violating its constitutional rights to substantive due process and equal protection by denying federal income tax credits needed to finance its construction of a housing project for families.we affirm.
background 
rihmfc,an agency established by the state of rhode island to foster development of housing,also administers the federal housing tax credit program in rhode island.see et.during,rihmfc was authorized to award approximately million in federal tax credits to qualified private developers of housing.under its rules and regulations and qualified action plan hereinafter regulations,rihmfc allocates these federal tax credits in accordance with various criteria,such as project design,site location and overall construction costs.the regulations require that rihmfc employ the same application procedures in relation to and developers.see regulations at setting application fee at and of tax credit requested.
in,barrington,whose general partner is a company owned by a massachusetts resident,constructed an apartment building for residents in barrington,rhode island,and submitted an application to rihmfc for federal income tax credits.its application was awarded more points than any other application under the criteria prescribed by the regulations,resulting in a federal tax credit.
in order to minimize its resort to rihmfc resources,however,barrington explicitly represented in its rihmfc application that it also expected to receive from the national park service in historic restoration tax credits in connection with the apartment project.although barrington had begun construction on the project before its application for national park service historic restoration tax credits was processed,it had been rihmfc would work with barrington in the event the historic restoration tax credits failed to materialize.after construction had advanced to the point that abandonment of the project would have resulted in a substantial financial loss to barrington,the national park service rejected the application for historic restoration tax credits,thereby effectively rendering the project financially unsound.
in due course,barrington applied for an additional federal income tax credit to offset its failure to obtain the national park service historic restoration tax credit.initially,rihmfc and richard godfrey,its executive director,were unreceptive,with godfrey stating not only that barrington ought not receive another dime from rihmfc,but that it should be left holding the bag and absorb the loss.nevertheless,on december,rihmfc awarded barrington an additional in federal income tax credits,provided its individual contractors agreed to make a charitable contribution to the rhode island affordable housing trust fund 
meanwhile,however,on november,another developer,gemini hotel,had remitted to rihmfc its federal income tax credit allocation for,in return for a commitment from rihmfc that gemini hotel would receive federal income tax credits the following year.the gemini hotel refund was more than enough to fund all pending applications for supplemental federal income tax credits,including that submitted by barrington.thus,the statement richard godfrey,allegedly made to barrington charitable contribution was essential in order that other qualified housing project developers not be denied additional federal income tax credits in knowingly false.
furthermore,barrington later learned that rihmfc had allocated additional federal income tax credits to several developers in,all of which unlike barrington were sponsored by rhode island residents.yet those developers were not required to make a charitable contribution.
thereafter,in december,barrington sought to determine why it was the only developer seeking additional federal income tax credits which was required to make a charitable contribution.although godfrey offered no explanation,he ventured the opinion that barrington should not have received additional federal income tax credits in the first place.finally,in may,prior to its tax deadline,barrington reluctantly disbursed to the rhode island affordable housing trust fund in order to obtain the necessary federal income tax credit documentation from rihmfc.
in due course,barrington filed its complaint against rihmfc and godfrey in rhode island superior court,which rihmfc removed to federal district court.count one alleges that rihmfc and godfrey,by requiring a charitable contribution,exceeded and abused their statutory and regulatory authority under the regulations relating to the imposition of application fees.counts two through nine allege that the defendants thereby violated barrington federal and state constitutional rights to equal protection and substantive due process.finally,count ten asserts an unjust enrichment claim under rhode island law.
after rihmfc and godfrey moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,a magistrate judge recommended that the district court dismiss,with prejudice,counts two through nine and that the pendant claims in counts one and ten be dismissed,without prejudice.the district court adopted the report and recommendation and barrington appealed.
discussiona.the standard of review 
we review rule b dismissals de novo,accepting all factual allegations in the amended complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences favorable to the appellant.bessette avco fin,cir.we are to affirm the district court ruling only if it clearly appears that barrington can not recover on any viable legal theory,given the facts alleged in its amended complaint.id.although we construe all allegations liberally at this stage in the proceedings,see,asociacion,cir see also leatherman tarrant cty.narcotics intelligence and coordination unit,d rejecting heightened pleading requirements for civil rights claims,we do not credit conclusory assertions,subjective characterizations or outright vituperation.coyne city of somerville,cir see also judge lowell,cir.
b.the substantive due process claim 
first,barrington argues that its amended complaint stated a viable claim that the charitable contribution demanded by rihmfc violated its substantive due process rights under the federal and state constitutions.in order to prevail against a motion to dismiss a substantive due process claim under rule b,however,it was essential that the complaint either i allege that rihmfc deprived barrington of a cognizable property interest,its right to acquire additional federal income tax credits without being required to pay an application fee in excess of that expressly required by the regulations,or,failing that,ii allege that rihmfc conduct was so egregious as to shock the conscience,cir citation omitted coyne,at citation omitted ray realty town of cumberland,adopting federal test.as barrington failed to plead various essential allegations,the district court correctly dismissed the substantive due process claims.we explain.
the alleged property interest in the tax credits 
first,we consider whether barrington held a cognizable property interest in further federal income tax credits.in order to qualify for substantive due process protection,an alleged property interest in a governmental benefit must consist of something more than either i an abstract need or desire for the governmental benefit,or ii a mere unilateral expectation that the claimant deserves it.thus,barrington needed to allege facts demonstrating a legitimate claim of entitlement to the supplemental tax credits.board of regents roth,d emphasis added coyne,at reed village of shorewood,cir observing that a cognizable property interest is what is securely and durably yours under state or federal law,as distinct from what you hold subject to so many conditions as to make your interest meager,transitory,or uncertain emphasis added.
since the regulations ultimately vest in rihmfc the absolute discretion to determine whether federal income tax credits are awarded to an applicant,see,cir noting that property interest is defined not by federal constitution,but by independent sources such as state law or regulations,barrington can lay claim to no cognizable property interest in the promised federal income tax credits.see,deharder inv.indiana hous.fin,addressing identical statutory scheme in,as applied and administered by state of indiana.
as the deharder court aptly noted,the federal statute simply mandates that states promulgate their own allocation plans regarding these federal income tax credits,without identifying any particular condition under which the states are obligated to allocate them.id.at see also city of santa clara andrus,cir a statute will create an entitlement to a governmental benefit either if the statute sets out conditions under which the benefit must be granted or if the statute sets out the only conditions under which the benefit may be denied.citation omitted.
like the state plan in deharder,the regulations simply prescribe the criteria for assessing the comparative deservedness of competing applicants for any federal income tax credits allocated to rhode island.see zapata,cir the mere existence of a detailed set of procedural rules is clearly inadequate to create a constitutionally protected property right.moreover,none of these prescribed criteria,many of which necessarily entail highly subjective assessments,are susceptible to objective quantification.
accordingly,even if rihmfc were to assign its highest rating to an application following a preliminary assessment of its criteria,the rihmfc plan expressly accords the agency the discretion to withhold federal income tax credits from any applicant,albeit a high scorer.see deharder.at although federal law requires that certain selection criteria must be included in the state plan,no specific directives mandate how the state authority must weigh or consider those criteria.in other words,once the criteria are considered,no particular outcome necessarily follows.see also coyne,at noting that property interests normally wane as governmental regulation waxes.thus,under the governing regulatory scheme,barrington never acquired a legitimate claim of entitlement to supplemental federal income tax credits.roth,at.
barrington attempts to distinguish deharder on the ground that the regulations contemplate that each applicant is to be assigned a set number of points,provided its proposed project meets certain criteria,and that barrington was far and away the high scorer in this instance a status which it retained even after failing to win a national park service historic restoration tax credit.be that as it may,neither the federal tax code nor the regulations required rihmfc to award federal income tax credits to the applicant.
rather,the regulations expressly preserve to rihmfc the right to rescind reservations of tax credits for projects in the event that rihmfc determines that the project is infeasible as proposed or a change of circumstances materially altered the proposal as submitted and approved.see regulations iv a.the quoted provision severely undermines barrington contention that it was entitled to,thus possessed a property interest in,the federal income tax credits.indeed,barrington acknowledged as much before the district court,by noting that t here is no regulation that says that anyone is entitled to any number or a certain number of credits.as eligibility simply can not be considered synonymous with entitlement,its substantive due process claim is fatally flawed.
the shock the conscience element 
nor is the shock the conscience element in the substantive due process test met on the basis of the motivation rihmfc allegedly harbored in demanding the charitable contribution.see,at explaining that state action shocks conscience only if it is arbitrary and capricious,run s counter to the concept of ordered liberty or violat es universal standards of decency citations omitted.assuming arguendo that the charitable contribution violated the regulations,mere violations of a state regulatory scheme are not the stuff of which substantive due process claims are constituted.see coyne,at it is bedrock law in this circuit that violations of state where arbitrary,capricious,or undertaken in bad not,without more,give rise to a denial of substantive due process under the constitution.
additionally,although the comments godfrey allegedly made about barrington might be and at harsh,callous or impolitic,see supra section i,we have held on numerous occasions that far more egregious utterances by state officials did not satisfy the shock the conscience standard.see,brown hot,sexy and safer,cir t he threshold for alleging such claims is high.santiago de castro morales medina,cir same.moreover,the supreme court itself has been chary about invoking the shock the conscience test,lest all policymaking at the state level become routine grist for substantive due process litigation in the federal courts.see collins city of harker heights,d.thus,the substantive due process claims were properly dismissed.
c.the equal protection claim 
barrington contends that it alleged a viable selective treatment claim to the effect that appellees violated its equal protection rights under the united states and rhode island constitutions by requiring the charitable contribution,since no other developer attempting to obtain additional federal income tax credits was required to make a contribution.see yerardi moody rest.lounge,board of selectmen,cir rhode island depositors econ.prot.brown,federal and rhode island equal protection standards coterminous.
under the equal protection clause,similarly situated entities must be accorded similar governmental treatment.see city of cleburne cleburne living,d.in order to establish its claim,however,barrington needed to allege facts indicating that,compared with others similarly situated,it was selectively treated based on impermissible considerations such as race,religion,intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights,or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.rubinovitz rogato,cir emphasis added citations omitted 
the similar situation standard 
in determining that the amended complaint failed the similarly situated test,the district court faulted barrington for failing to allege,inter alia,whether its coapplicants i received supplemental federal income tax credits due to their failure to obtain the historic restoration tax credits which were a prerequisite to their initial rihmfc allocation,or ii commenced construction prior to confirmation of all the financing required to construct their respective projects,or iii would have failed to complete construction absent an additional award of federal income tax credits from rihmfc.see samaad city of dallas,cir noting that an adequate similarly situated allegation is essential to a viable equal protection claim.
barrington insists that its amended complaint surmounted the rule b dismissal threshold in that it states unequivocally that barrington and its coapplicants were similarly situated,whereas the district court expected barrington to allege each and every pertinent attribute it shared,qua applicant,with its coapplicants.barrington argues that the amended complaint was adequate because it alleged that barrington and its coapplicants were similarly situated in one critical respect,each applied to rihmfc for an additional federal income tax credit.on appeal,it contends that the similar situation standard adopted by the district court is overly cramped,in that it contemplates such identicality within a particular class as to make it next to impossible to assert a viable equal protection claim.
the formula for determining whether individuals or entities are similarly situated for equal protection purposes is not always susceptible to precise demarcation.see coyne,at t he line between sufficient facts and insufficient conclusions is often blurred.citation omitted.as we have explained,however,t he test is whether a prudent person,looking objectively at the incidents,would think them roughly equivalent and the protagonists similarly situated.much as in the lawyer art of distinguis
