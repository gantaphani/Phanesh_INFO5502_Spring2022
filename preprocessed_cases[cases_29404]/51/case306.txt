jl beverage company,llc jl beverage appeals from the district court summary judgment in favor of jim beam brands company jim beam on jl beverage trademark infringement,false designation of origin,and unfair competition claims.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.because genuine issues of material fact remain,we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
this dispute centers on two alcoholic beverage manufacturers,jl beverage and jim beam,which sell competing lines of flavored vodkas.jl beverage manufactures,sells,and promotes a line of flavored and unflavored vodka called johnny love vodka.restaurant owner and bartender johnny metheny created the johnny love line of vodkas around.to promote the new line,metheny enlisted a friend to design a unique logo,and metheny quickly adopted the proposed lips image.he believed the lips were definitely sexy and could impart the flavor of the vodka if colored to denote the flavor in the bottle of vodka.the lips were colored red for unflavored,purple for passionfruit,yellow for aloha,orange for tangerine,and green for apple.in,metheny sold the johnny love vodka line to jl beverage.
since july,jl beverage has used the following two trademarks in connection with its sale of the johnny love vodka products

the first mark,called johnny love vodka or the jlv mark,was registered on august,with the united states patent and trademark office uspto as registration,in international class.jl beverage registered the second mark,called the jl lips mark,with uspto on october,under registration in international class spirits.both images appear on the johnny love line of vodkas and flavored vodkas

the jl lips mark is imprinted on the top of the bottle and on the back label,and is incorporated into the jlv mark as the o in love.the mark color on the back label also corresponds to the flavor in the bottle

the johnny love vodka bottles come in four different sizes.
after acquiring johnny love vodka and the two trademarks,jl beverage expended substantial resources developing,advertising,and marketing johnny love vodkas throughout the united states.jl beverage at one point had distributors in twenty states,and it holds a federal basic alcohol permit for national use.jl beverage nationwide marketing campaign included advertisements,publications,and the development of its own website.although in recent years its sales have been substantially reduced,its overall marketing efforts resulted in millions of dollars in sales of johnny love products throughout the country.
in,jim beam entered the flavored vodka market with a new line of flavored vodkas called pucker vodka.jim beam purchased the pucker brand from koninklijke de kuyper,kdk.kdk had marketed a line of liqueurs and cordials under the pucker brand,and,in its original design,used lips images in connection with its labeling and logos.after jim beam purchased kdk flavored vodka line,it decided to redesign and rebrand pucker to expand on the equity of the pucker brand and lips into flavored vodka.to that end,jim beam hired the design firm of libby,perszyk,kathman,lpk to independently develop a new and unique look and feel for its pucker vodka product that would communicate i ntense flavor and i ntense fun in connection with the brand.
the redesigned pucker vodka bottle contains a prominent lips image on the center of its label.like the johnny love vodka labels,the lips image varies in color depending on the vodka flavor in the bottle 
editor notes tabular or graphical material not displayable at this time.
jim beam instructed lpk to use both the pucker name and lips as part of any design it developed for pucker new label.after lpk provided jim beam with several possible design options,jim beam project team made final selections of the proposed pucker vodka products and sent their choices to the company legal department for clearance.jim beam instructed its legal counsel to perform a clearance search for lips designs.the legal department found references to lips for products.jl beverage jlv mark was in the search report.although jl beverage lips mark is incorporated into the jlv mark,it did not separately appear in the search report because jl beverage had not yet filed its registration application for the standalone lips mark.based on its research,jim beam legal department approved the pucker brand bottle shape and label.
emily johnson,a former jim beam employee,worked for jim beam as a financial and business analyst during the development of the pucker vodka product.prior to her employment at jim beam,johnson met jl beverage president,diab,and learned about jl beverage products.in march,during her employment at jim beam,she sent an email to diab from her home account,which stated i was reading through some reporting on vodka flavors and saw aloha on the list 
jim beam attempted to register the pucker lips design around march,filing applications for trademarks in the bottle and cap,the stylized pucker wording,and the lips design.after the registration process began,an official in jim beam legal department discovered that the lips mark that lpk had selected to be featured in the center of the pucker vodka label was stock art from istockphoto lp.because jim beam could not claim ownership in the lips image,it withdrew its uspto application for the lips design.
prior to withdrawal,jim beam also received notice from the uspto that it had rejected jim beam registration application.in the rejection letter,the uspto cites jl beverage lips mark as a basis for refusing the registration.
jim beam officially relaunched its pucker vodka products in march and april.jim beam advertises pucker vodka products nationally through television and cable commercials,digital advertising,print advertisements in national magazines,and and promotions at restaurants and bars.
shortly after the pucker vodka launch,shaun robertson,a jl beverage broker for johnny love vodka,began receiving phone calls and messages concerning the similarities between the two vodkas.robertson provided,in a declaration to the court,a summary of conversations,text messages,and phone calls he had with friends and acquaintances in which those individuals confused a different flavored vodka product for johnny love.
jl beverage delivered a cease and desist letter to jim beam on march.jim beam responded that it did not believe its pucker vodka logo infringed jl beverage mark.jl beverage filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of nevada in july,alleging trademark infringement,false designation of origin,and unfair competition.jl beverage moved for preliminary injunction,which the district court denied.jl beverage and jim beam then filed for summary judgment.the district court denied jl beverage motion and granted jim beam motion.the district court subsequently denied jl beverage motion for reconsideration.
we review the district court summary judgment de novo,including its decision on for summary judgment.szajer city of,cir.guatay christian fellowship cty.of san diego,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact.olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo,and its factual findings for clear error.lahoti vericheck,cir.w here it is unclear whether the district court relied on proper law,we may vacate the judgment and remand with instructions to apply the correct legal standard.lahoti,at citing united states,cir.
this appeal turns in large part on whether the district court correctly applied the standard for deciding a motion for summary judgment.the success of each of jl beverage claims turns on the same issue whether there was a genuine dispute of material fact as to the likelihood of consumer confusion.jl beverage asserts the following claims federal trademark infringement under the lanham act,false designation of origin and unfair competition under the lanham act,a and nevada common law trademark infringement and unfair competition.the likelihood of consumer confusion is central to each claim.see a providing that a person is liable for trademark infringement where he or she use s in commerce any reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive emphasis added rosoff,holding that nevada common law trademark infringement and unfair competition claims mirror their federal counterparts,and plaintiffs need only prove that they own a protectable right in the marks,and the defendant use of the mark is likely to confuse,cause mistake,or deceive an appreciable number of reasonable customers with respect to the marks.
in its summary judgment ruling,the district court used the standard applicable to preliminary injunctions instead of the standard for summary judgment rulings.the district court,having already ruled on jl beverage motion for preliminary injunction,continued to apply the standard it used at that stage when it ruled on the parties for summary judgment.in its summary judgment order,the district court concluded f or reasons articulated in the order denying the preliminary injunction,the court determines that no issues of material fact remain which could provide plaintiff a basis for success on any of its claims.defendant motion for summary judgment is accordingly granted.
the district court failure to apply the correct standard is significant on motion for preliminary injunction,the plaintiff as the moving party bears the burden of establishing the merits of its claims.see winter nat.res.def.council.in contrast,on a defendant motion for summary judgment,not only does the movant carry the burden of establishing that no genuine dispute of material fact exists,but the court also views the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.see,olsen,at.the must demonstrate that,even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,the plaintiff can not satisfy its burden to prove its claims.see celotex catrett.
but in its summary judgment order,the district court ignored the important distinctions between the two standards,and,when ruling on the defendant motion for summary judgment,ultimately placed the burden on jl beverage,the plaintiff,to prove the merits of its claims.moreover,it failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to jl beverage,and never analyzed whether a genuine dispute of material fact existed.
while the district court must apply the correct standard in any case,the necessity to do so is heightened in cases turning on the likelihood of consumer confusion.because the determination is based on a,inquiry,we have cautioned against granting summary judgment in these cases.rearden llc rearden commerce,cir.given the nature of this inquiry,it is not surprising that summary judgment on likelihood of confusion grounds is generally disfavored gold,volkswagen of,cir.because the likelihood of confusion is often a inquiry,courts are generally reluctant to decide this issue at the summary judgment stage thane int l,trek bicycle,cir we have cautioned that district courts should grant summary judgment motions regarding the likelihood of confusion sparingly,as careful assessment of the pertinent factors that go into determining likelihood of confusion usually requires a full record,superseded by statute on other grounds.where,as here,conflicting facts render it unclear whether there was a likelihood of consumer confusion,summary judgment is inappropriate.
to determine whether a likelihood of consumer confusion exists,our court relies on the sleekcraft test,which reviews the strength of the mark proximity or relatedness of the goods similarity of the marks evidence of actual confusion marketing channels used type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser the defendant intent in selecting the mark and the likelihood of expansion of the product lines.amf sleekcraft boats,cir,abrogated in part on other grounds by mattel,walking mountain,cir.the factors are and applied flexibly the sleekcraft factors are not intended to be a rote checklist.rearden,at.a determination may rest on only those factors that are most pertinent to the particular case before the court,and other variables besides the enumerated factors should also be taken into account based on the particular circumstances.id.
utilizing the test,plaintiffs may establish a likelihood of consumer confusion as a result of either forward confusion,or reverse confusion.surfvivor media,survivor,cir.jl beverage alleges both forward and reverse trademark confusion.forward confusion occurs when consumers believe that goods bearing the junior mark came from,or were sponsored by,the senior mark holder.id.reverse confusion,on the other hand,occurs when consumers dealing with the senior mark holder believe that they are doing business with the junior one.id.
in its order denying a preliminary injunction,the district court determined that factors two,five,and six of the sleekcraft test favor jl beverage and a finding of a likelihood of confusion.jim beam does not dispute that these factors favor jl beverage.rather,jim beam contends that there is no genuine dispute of material fact concerning factors one,three,four,and seven,and,accordingly,no genuine dispute of material fact concerning a likelihood of confusion.so the issue before us is whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to jl beverage,there is a genuine dispute of material fact concerning whether factors one,three,four,and seven favor jl beverage,and,accordingly,a genuine dispute of material fact as to the likelihood of consumer confusion.
jl beverage contends that there is a factual dispute as to the strength of its standalone lips logo lips mark and composite mark consisting of the lips logo and the words johnny love vodka jlv mark.we examine the strength of jl beverage mark to determine the scope of trademark protection to which the mark is entitled.surfvivor,at citing entrepreneur media,smith,cir.as the uniqueness of the mark increases,so too does the degree of protection.id.a mark strength is evaluated in terms of its conceptual strength and commercial strength,walt disney,cir.
a mark conceptual strength depends largely on the obviousness of its connection to the good or service to which it refers.fortune dynamic,victoria secret stores brand,cir.to determine a mark conceptual strength,we classify a mark along a spectrum of five categories ranging from strongest to weakest arbitrary,fanciful,suggestive,descriptive,and generic.network automation,advanced.concepts,cir.arbitrary and fanciful marks,which employ words and phrases with no commonly understood connection to the product,are the two strongest categories,and trigger the highest degree of trademark protection.surfvivor,at.in the middle of the spectrum are suggestive marks,which suggest a product features and require consumers to exercise some imagination to associate the suggestive mark with the product.fortune dynamic,at,citing zobmondo entm t,llc falls media,llc,cir.descriptive and generic marks,at the other end of the spectrum,are the two weakest categories.descriptive marks define a particular characteristic of the product in a way that does not require any imagination,while generic marks describe the product in its entirety and are not entitled to trademark protection.surfvivor,at.
after identifying whether a mark is generic,descriptive,suggestive,arbitrary,or fanciful,the court determines the mark commercial strength.miss world uk am.pageants,cir,abrogated in part on other grounds by eclipse assocs.data,cir.commercial strength is based on actual marketplace recognition.network automation,at citation omitted.as a result,advertising expenditures,which increase marketplace recognition,offer evidence of commercial strength and can transform a suggestive mark into a strong mark.id.citation omitted.
jl beverage has alleged both forward and reverse confusion claims.the jlv and lips marks conceptual and commercial strength plays a different role in each type of claim.in the usual forward infringement case,the court determine s whether the junior user is palming off its products as those of the senior user.dreamwerks prod,skg studio,cir.consequently,for jl beverage claim of forward confusion,we evaluate the conceptual and commercial strength of the jlv and lips marks to determine whether a customer interested in purchasing vodka would be confused into thinking that jl beverage produces jim beam pucker vodka,or that johnny love vodka is the same product as pucker vodka.in contrast,in claims of reverse confusion,the question is whether consumers doing business with the senior user might mistakenly believe that they are dealing with the junior user.id.at.as a result,the court evaluates the conceptual strength of jl beverage marks and compares it to the commercial strength of jim beam mark.id.at.
we turn first to analyzing the jlv and jl lips marks conceptual strength.jim beam contends the jlv mark is descriptive because it contains the word vodka,and therefore describes the product.jim beam,however,ignores the feature of the jlv mark.instead of just labeling the bottle vodka,the jlv mark has lips that match a particular flavor.reasonable jurors,viewing the mark in its entirety,could conclude that the mark is suggestive because they must use their imaginations to connect the color of the lips to the vodka flavor.
jim beam also contends that the lips mark has weak conceptual strength.jim beam overlooks that the salient feature of the lips mark the lips have no commonly understood connection with the alcohol product it represents.as a result,a could reasonably conclude that the lips mark is arbitrary,garnering the highest degree of trademark protection.
jim beam counters that the lips mark is part of a crowded field of similar lips logos,and thus there is less likelihood of consumer confusion.jim beam argues that jl beverage waived its right to contest this issue on appeal because it failed to raise it before the district court.however,because the district court considered this issue,it is not waived on appeal.cmty.house,city of boise,cir.e ven if a party fails to raise an issue in the district court,we generally will not deem the issue waived if the district court actually considered it.returning to the issue,when the marketplace is replete with products using a particular trademarked symbol,it indicates not only the difficulty in avoiding its use but also,and directly,the likelihood that consumers will not be confused by its use.entrepreneur media,smith,cir.jim beam has provided several examples of lips marks used on product labels for different types of alcohol.the lips logos jim beam presents,however,lack the crucial feature of the lips mark unlike the lips mark,they are not by flavor for an entire line of flavored vodkas.
in addition,the vast majority of the products on which lips are used are not liquor products,but rather beer,wine,or beverages.in that regard,the parties dispute how broadly the relevant market should be characterized for the purposes of evaluating whether the field is crowded with lips uses.in other words,there are genuine disputes of material fact as to what constitutes the relevant field,whether the field is crowded,and the effect of the foregoing on the likelihood of confusion analysis.see also maker mark distillery,diageo,cir.agreeing with the district court that,in a trademark dispute between a bourbon maker and a tequila maker,the relevant market was not all distilled spirits,but rather a narrower field fleischmann distilling maier brewing,cir.calling,in a case,scotch whiskey and beer related for purposes of the likelihood of confusion.perhaps most importantly,the impact of a crowded field of lips logos is not dispositive in determining a mark conceptual strength rather,it is but one factor a court considers in evaluating the overall strength of the mark.see entrepreneur media,at.
here,the district court failed to construe the evidence concerning the jlv and lips marks conceptual strength in the light most favorable to jl beverage to determine whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists.had the district court applied the correct standard,it may well have concluded that the marks conceptual strength placed the marks in a category that warranted a higher degree of protection.
we now turn to the second step of our inquiry the marks commercial strength.jim beam argues that jl beverage has a relatively weak market presence,while it maintains a relatively strong market presence.
jl beverage concedes that jim beam has a strong market presence.jl beverage correctly points out,however,that this finding supports its reverse confusion claim evidence that jim beam junior mark,the pucker vodka lips,is suggests a greater likelihood that consumers will confuse jl beverage senior mark for the pucker vodka line.see walter mattel,cir.in a reverse confusion case the inquiry focuses on the strength of the junior mark because the issue is whether the junior mark is so strong as to overtake the senior mark.the national recognition of the jim beam mark increases the likelihood that consumers will believe they are doing business with jim beam,not jl beverage,when they purchase johnny love vodka.see cohn petsmart,cir.explaining that,in reverse confusion cases,the junior mark holder commercial strength creates a potential that consumers will assume that the senior holder mark refers to the junior holder mark,and thus perceive that the businesses are somehow associated.
to support its forward confusion claim,jl beverage argues in the alternative that it too has a strong market presence.jl beverage submitted evidence that it sold its products nationally,and that it spent considerable resources on marketing through print media,publications,and internet advertising.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to jl beverage,there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to the commercial strength of jl beverage johnny love vodka in the marketplace.moreover,the determination as to whether the evidence demonstrates that jl beverage has robust commercial strength will lend support to jl beverage whatever the decides,as jl beverage has raised both forward and reverse confusion claims.
we now address factor three of the sleekcraft test,the similarity of the marks.jl beverage contends that the similarity of shape and color in the competing lips designs renders the marks similar.
similarity of the marks has always been considered a critical question in the analysis,at.three principles guide a court in determining whether marks are similar.fortune dynamic,at.first,similarity is best adjudged by appearance,sound,and meaning.id.citation and alteration omitted.second,the marks must be considered in their entirety and as they appear in the marketplace.id.citation omitted.third,similarities are weighed more heavily than differences.id.quoting,at.
in viewing the competing jl beverage and jim beam marks in their entirety,there are numerous similarities in their appearance both have puckered,human lips as the focal point of their design the lips have a similar angle and shape and the lips are with the flavor of the vodka.in addition to the photos of the marks,which suggest a similar appearance,jl beverage offered evidence from officials who concluded that the marks are similar.first,jl beverage relies upon the chief administrator of the north carolina alcoholic beverage control commission ncabcc statement that the jim beam mark looks a lot like jl beverage design.second,it provided evidence that a uspto examiner stated,in his initial review of jim beam application to register its lips,that the jim beam and jl beverage marks are highly similar lip designs oriented at a similar angle.consequently,the marks create an overall similar commercial impression.the entirety of the marks appearances,coupled with documented statements stating that the marks appear similar,establishes a genuine dispute of material fact concerning their similarity.
