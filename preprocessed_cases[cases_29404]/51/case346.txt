ii.background 
art attacks is a small airbrush art business that has sold and other items since.art attacks designs include animals,celebrities,cars,and a spoiled brats collection.the spoiled brats collection features cartoonish,predominantly female characters with oversized eyes,disproportionately large heads and feet,makeup,and bare midriffs.
art attacks sold its wares primarily from a booth at several county fairs.because art attacks is a small family business,it did business at only one location at a time.art attacks traveled to fairs in orange county,san diego county,ventura county,riverside county,san bernardino county,and,after,los angeles county.art attacks also did business at the camp pendleton exchange,a convention in the navajo nation,and several malls,amusement centers,and stores in arizona.art attacks also sold its wares at stores in california,including the santee,chula vista,and poway stores.
at county fairs and other locations,art attacks airbrushed designs onto a shirt or other garment,along with the customer name and a small caption,while the customer waited.spoiled brats designs could be tailored to resemble individual customers.art attacks sold about spoiled brats per year.art attacks copyrighted the spoiled brats characters in.
art attacks also maintained an internet website as of,during the early years of widespread internet use.the website displayed images of various art attacks airbrush designs,including animals,celebrities,cars,animals,and the spoiled brats.the website took two minutes to load.users could click through the main art attacks website to a linked spoiled page to obtain a order form.the website also lacked spoiled brats meta tags,invisible pieces of data that are embedded in websites and act as flags to internet search engines.because the art attacks website lacked such flags,an internet search for spoiled brats might not lead to the art attacks site.
art attacks never advertised in broadcast or print media.it did,however,display images of the spoiled brats on the art attacks booth.millions of fair attendees have walked past the booth over the years.the del amo fair,for example,has over one million yearly attendees,percent of whom pass by the art attacks booth near the main entrance.
in,mga began selling bratz dolls,which,like art attacks designs,feature large eyes,heavy makeup,oversized eyes,heads,and feet,and bare midriffs.art attacks filed suit against mga in,alleging causes of action including trademark,trade dress,and copyright infringement.a jury found for mga on the trademark claim,but could not reach a verdict on the remaining claims.the district judge dismissed the jury on friday,may,and entered an order declaring a mistrial on monday,may.at a status conference on monday,may,mga declared its intention to file a rule b motion for judgment as a matter of law.a law clerk indicated to mga that such a motion would have to be filed by may,ten court days after the may status conference ten days later,on may,mga filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of procedure b.the district court granted the motion.this appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
jurisdiction to consider the rule b motion 
art attacks contends that mga failed to file its motion for judgment as a matter of law within ten days of the jury discharge,as required by federal rule of civil procedure b,and that the district court therefore lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion.jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo.united states neil,cir.
whether mga motion was timely 
federal rule of civil procedure b states that if the renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law addresses a jury issue not decided by a verdict,no later than days after the jury was discharged,the movant may file a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law the period begins to run on the day after the district court dismisses the jury.a.though the district court did not enter the order granting a mistrial until monday,may,the district judge dismissed the jury on friday,may.the filing period therefore began to run on monday,may and closed on friday,may.mga renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law was untimely.
whether rule b timeliness requirement is jurisdictional 
federal rule of civil procedure b forbids courts to extend the filing period set out in rule b.accordingly,courts have sometimes characterized rule b tenday filing requirement as mandatory and jurisdictional,and therefore incapable of being waived or forfeited.see,goodman bowdoin,cir hodge ex rel.skiff hodge,cir leather,h w,cir.
since then,however,the supreme court has clarified that procedural rules formerly referred to as mandatory and jurisdictional may be,instead,simply inflexible rule s,mandatory if invoked by a party but forfeitable if not invoked.united states sadler,cir citing eberhart united states,d and kontrick ryan,d internal quotations omitted.the distinction between jurisdictional rules and inflexible but not jurisdictional timeliness rules turns largely on whether the timeliness requirement is or is not grounded in a statute.sadler,at.t ime constraints arising only from,albeit congressionally authorized,procedural rules such as the federal rules are not jurisdictional.id.at.
though this circuit has not yet specifically addressed whether the time restrictions in rule b and rule b are jurisdictional,other circuits have concluded that these restrictions are.see,dill am.life ins,cir weissman dawn joy fashions,cir.we agree.see also eberhart,at.likening federal rule of criminal procedure b,a rule,to federal rule of civil procedure b.because rule b filing deadline is a rule,it can be waived or forfeited.
whether art attacks waived its rule b argument 
art attacks never objected to the timeliness of mga rule b motion for summary judgment before the district court.accordingly,art attacks has forfeited its untimeliness objection.we therefore proceed to the merits of the appeal.
copyright infringement 
we review de novo renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law.pavao pagay,cir.a grant of such a motion is proper if the evidence,construed in favor of the nonmoving party,permits only one reasonable conclusion.id.
absent direct evidence of copying,proof of infringement involves showings that the defendant had access to the plaintiff work three boys music bolton,cir quoting smith jackson,cir.to prove access,a plaintiff must show a reasonable possibility,not merely a bare possibility,that an alleged infringer had the chance to view the protected work.id.at.where there is no direct evidence of access,circumstantial evidence can be used to prove access either by establishing a chain of events linking the plaintiff work and the defendant access,or showing that the plaintiff work has been widely disseminated.id.
chain of events 
art attacks does not explicitly raise a chain of events argument,but implicitly does so by referring to evidence that an mga may have attended a county fair at which art attacks displayed the spoiled brats designs.mga employee aileen storer storer designed the text of the bratz mark displayed on doll packagin
