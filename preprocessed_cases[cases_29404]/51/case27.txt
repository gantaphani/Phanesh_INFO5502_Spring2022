these consolidated appeals concern both disputes over ownership of interests in certain musical copyrights and claims of infringement against various entities.the musical compositions are those of guillermo gvl,a puerto rican composer who died in.because multiple issues are presented,we begin with an overview of background events and pertinent proceedings,reserving details for the discussion of individual claims.
gvl wrote,and obtained copyrights under the copyright act for,a large number of compositions.under the statute,a copyright owner obtains a number of exclusive rights over the copyrighted works for a fixed term,rights that he may license or assign.he also obtains a right to renew the copyright for a further term,a however,if this renewal right does not vest during the author lifetime,it passes to his heirs not by will but as specified by the copyright act itself.id.a c.
during his lifetime,gvl granted various rights in his compositions.of particular importance is a agreement with peer,a musical publishing company that acquires such rights and then licenses them to third parties affiliated with peer are peer international and southern music collectively,the peer defendants.gvl entered into other agreements,a series of which were made in with another publisher,pham and yet another in directly with peer affiliate southern music.
on october,gvl widow,lucy,assigned all of her copyright interests in gvl works to latin american music company lamco,a new music publisher.one of lamco affiliates is acemla de puerto rico,a society.such organizations,among them the entities ascap and bmi,obtain rights to musical compositions,license them often through blanket licenses,and collect royalties from.
a year later,in october,chávez brought suit in the superior court in puerto rico to settle a dispute with gvl four surviving children the siblings as to ownership of copyright interests in gvl works after his death.ultimately,in january,the local court of appeals of the commonwealth of puerto rico ruled that rights in gvl works belonged to his children,ostensibly under his will and a later understanding reached between chávez and the siblings in settling the estate however,just what rights were so adjudicated is a matter of dispute on this appeal.
then,in,the present actions were filed in federal district court in puerto rico by the siblings.one charged lamco,acemla,and three individuals associated with them the lamco defendants one of whom was chávez various acts of copyright infringement as to gvl works,which the siblings now claimed to own the other action,thereafter consolidated with the first,made similar charges and other related claims under contract law against the peer defendants.
in considering the siblings infringement claims,the district court first decided the ownership,as between chávez and the siblings,of such copyrights as had arisen after gvl death.in two decisions,the district court ruled that ownership of such renewal interests had not been resolved in the earlier local litigation and that chávez and the four siblings each held a percent interest in the copyrights.venegas hernandez peer int l,d,i peer,d,ii.
then,after an extensive bench trial,the district court in issued a massive decision.peer,civil may,iii unpublished opinion.in the end,the court awarded in damages against the peer defendants for one act of infringement,rejecting other infringement claims against them the court rejected as well the siblings efforts to terminate,by rescission or otherwise,certain rights that the peer defendants obtained under their earlier agreements with gvl himself,including the contract.
as to the lamco defendants,the court rejected lamco claims of ownership as to certain songs and held it liable for just over in damages for infringement.however,the court also rejected a number of other infringement claims made by the siblings importantly,although the court agreed that the lamco defendants had licensed certain gvl compositions during periods when they had no right to do so,it found,as to most of their unauthorized licenses,that no evidence of copying or performance had been provided by the siblings.
now before us are appeals by the siblings and by the lamco defendants.the standard of review is de novo for issues of law,clear error for factual findings,and varying degrees of deference on law application,procedural matters,and choice of penalties.cariglia hertz equip.rental,cir cavallaro united states,cir morley music dick stacey plaza motel,cir.we begin with the issue of ownership rights in the renewal terms,then address infringement and contract issues,and conclude with the parties remaining claims.
various of the siblings infringement claims depended on who owned renewal terms for certain gvl works.in,congress provided that copyrights still in their original term as of january,are eligible for a renewal term of years a term since extended to years under the sonny bono copyright term extension act,stat.nimmer nimmer,nimmer on copyright,at to nimmer.the right to renew belongs to the author of such work,if the author is still living,but if not,then to the widow,widower,or children of the author if none in this latter group is living,then the rights pass to the author executor or,absent a will,to the author next of kin.a c.
in the district court,the siblings took the position that the renewal terms belonged solely to them and that the issue had been settled by the local courts and was res judicata against chávez.the district court,as already noted,held that under the copyright act,chávez retained a percent interest as to renewal terms created after gvl death.on this issue,the siblings now urge that they own percent of those renewal terms lamco,which acquired whatever interest chávez might have,argues in its that her interest was percent rather than percent.
we begin with the res judicata issue.whether one speaks of claim or issue preclusion,the outcome turns in this slightly unusual situation on exactly the same question whether,when the local court of appeals said that authorship rights to gvl musical works belonged under his will and a subsequent agreement between the siblings and chávez entirely to the siblings,the court intended to embrace renewal rights that had not come into being at the time of gvl death or only those original copyrights and renewal terms that were in force and belonged to him at the time of his death.
the district court concluded that the state courts had not addressed or resolved the question of the unmatured renewal rights,which,it said,did not pass by will but were created and assigned by virtue of the copyright act,see venegas i,d at venegas ii,d at as for the agreement between the siblings and chávez governing the division of the estate,the district court found from the evidence that neither side had intended the agreement to cover renewal rights unmatured at gvl subject that the district court said they had not even considered in making their agreement.id.at.
one might have expected on this appeal that the siblings would urge that the district court had misinterpreted the local court decisions,the agreement between the siblings and chávez,or both.but in the siblings opening brief,there is no serious attempt to parse the local decisions,nor any attempt to interpret the agreement in light of its language and what the parties said or intended.
instead,the siblings brief argues primarily that the renewal rights must pass under puerto rico law in the absence of a direct conflict with the copyright act.secondarily,the siblings suggest that to treat the renewal terms arising after the author death as something other than his property would violate the constitution copyright clause,const,cl,because the clause allows congress to secure to authors not anyone fruits of their authorial work.to create rights other than in the author,say the siblings,is at odds with the constitution.
the statutory argument is defeated by the statute itself,which says that if the author is not alive when the renewal term begins,then the right to renew belongs to his wife and children.a c ii.only if such author,widow,widower,or children are not living do the rights to renew pass to the author executors,id.a c iii presumably for disposition in accordance with his will an inference reinforced by a final direction saying that the author next of kin inherit in the absence of a will,id.a c iv.
if there were any doubt,it appears to be removed by de sylva ballentine,the leading supreme court decision addressing the clause at issue.there,in deciding whether the renewal rights not matured during the author lifetime belonged to the widow alone or to both the widow and children,the court made no reference to any possible will and went out of its way to say that the author can not assign his family renewal rights and that the statute imposes a compulsory bequest so as to provide for the family of the author after his death.id.at.
as to the constitutional objection,the supreme court in de sylva apparently did not see any patent constitutional objection to this compulsory bequest.more recently,it stressed in a different context the broad scope of congress power to implement expansively the copyright clause of the constitution.eldred ashcroft,d.in all events,the siblings brief does little more than cite the authors language in the clause,and it would take a far more developed argument for us to take seriously a constitutional attack of this kind.
this brings us to the truly difficult question as to whether the renewal interest is divided between the widow and children or per capita so that the widow and each of the four children would get a percent interest.the supreme court in de sylva expressly declined to decide the issue.de sylva,at.the sixth circuit,the only circuit court squarely to address it,split,with the majority favoring the solution,broadcast music,roger miller music,cir,petition for cert.filed june,and the dissent supporting the per capita view adopted by the district court in this case,id.at daughtrey,dissenting.earlier,the second circuit had assumed a per capita division,bartok boosey hawkes.cir,but the issue was scarcely discussed and a t best bartok contains no more than dicta on this issue.nimmer,at.
there are good arguments on both sides.the phrase widow or children is opaque as to the division between them indeed,in de sylva,arguments both ways could be made as to whether the children should have any rights at all if the widow were still living.at.on the other hand,de sylva conclusion that both widow and children succeed to the renewals as members of the same class,id.at,not only rejects the position,but might be taken to suggest that widow and children succeed per capita,and some read it in this manner.broadcast music,at daughtrey,dissenting.
one should not attribute too much to a single phrase in a supreme court opinion that squarely refused to decide the apportionment issue.the class reference was made in deciding whether the children had any interest at all if the widow were alive,and the word class was in substance a shorthand way of saying that the widow and children inherit together if both are alive rather than sequentially that is,the children inherit only if the widow is not alive.the word class is not used in the statute and,however the supreme court someday decides the issue,we take it at its word in saying that it has not done so yet.
pertinent to the open question is language in adjacent statutory provisions that deal with termination interests in copyrights they are relevant because congress there specified that the widow or widower owns of the author interest if there are any surviving children or grandchildren of the author.c a.chávez can point to this as a template for resolving this case in the same way the siblings can argue that it would have been easy for congress to use the same language here.the provision is arguably more helpful to chávez the opposite inference would be stronger if the provisions had been drafted together 
policy considerations favor the solution over per capita division.as de sylva notes,the compulsory bequest is to care for widow and children.at.a majority of states give the widow a percent or greater interest in her husband estate if he dies intestate,even with multiple children,see restatement third of property wills and other donative transfers statutory notes this is hardly a surprising allocation,since ordinarily the widow will herself have a duty to support children still in their minority,and children in their majority ordinarily have earning power of their own.
a third by neither be to adopt the intestacy provisions of local law.although we are construing a federal statute,such statutes can be read to incorporate local law,see chemerinsky,federal jurisdiction,at ed,and that temptation is especially strong where domestic relations issues are presented.de sylva followed this course on the issue of who constituted a child of the author.at.yet the termination provisions of section c do provide a competing uniform federal template.
neither side in this case has urged adoption of puerto rico law,whose substantive rules as to a widow intestate share are far from straightforward.see efraín gonzález tejera,mortis causa wealth transfer and the protection of the family the rican experience,tul.we do not rule out the possibility of such a solution if and when the issue is briefed in a future case,but neither do we say that we would necessarily endorse such an approach.on the choice that has been presented to us,the solution is superior to the per capita one and,incidentally,avoids an unnecessary split with the sixth circuit.
in the district court,the siblings made a number of infringement claims against both the peer and lamco defendants based upon various acts pertaining to a number of different songs.some,but not all,depended in part on who owned the copyright to one or more pieces during the period of the alleged infringement ownership is an issue properly before the court in an infringement case since t o make out a copyright infringement,a plaintiff must show ownership of a valid copyright matthews freedman,cir.
we address in order the issues framed by the two appeals before us.the first one concerns infringement claims by the siblings against peer as to songs of gvl owned by peer under the agreement.under the terms of the agreement,gvl assigned to peer the copyrights to all compositions he had written in the past or would write during the term of the agreement,in exchange for specified royalties.the agreement continued in force until,so songs composed after that date are not covered.
the siblings urged in the district court that peer rights in the compositions had been forfeited by peer mainly because it had not paid royalties to the siblings after gvl right to the royalties having been inherited by the siblings as heirs to gvl rights under the agreement.the district court held that the statute of limitations had run on the claim and that in any case it was without merit.the latter ground is less intricate and sufficient to sustain the district court.
the main attack on peer ownership of rights under the agreement is framed by the siblings as a right to rescind the agreement on account of the failure to pay royalties after gvl death.the district court found that peer had paid royalties pursuant to the agreement until gvl death in,when it ceased to make payments in light of the underlying ownership dispute between the siblings and chávez.this in turn made it uncertain what amounts were owed to the siblings.
under new york law,which the agreement specifies as governing,rescission is an equitable remedy for breach of contract but ordinarily it requires breaches of so material and substantial a nature that they affect the very essence of the contract and serve to defeat the object of the parties.nolan williamson music.furthermore,i f the party who seeks rescission has an adequate remedy at law,ordinarily he is not entitled to rescind.callanan powers.
the district court found that the delay in paying royalties was not an equitable basis for undoing the entire agreement,which had been carried out by royalty payments from to,and that contract damages would make the siblings whole.the amount appears to have been modest peer says that between and the trial,only about in royalties had accumulated under the agreement.it adds that it had offered to pay royalties to the siblings in exchange for a to protect it against possible claims by chávez that part of the royalties belonged to her.
the siblings spend only a few paragraphs of their main brief on appeal to challenge this determination,mainly complaining that peer should have paid them something and that peer was uncooperative in providing information until discovery in the present lawsuit.they do not dispute that the district court decision is an exercise of equitable discretion to be reviewed with deference on appeal.delaney matesanz,cir.against the background events already described,the siblings spare assertions of error are no basis for overturning the district court equitable judgment.
the second,and larger,issue raised by the siblings concerns acts of alleged infringement.this presents at the outset its own threshold question,which could be of continuing importance whether a music publisher unauthorized grant of a license to a third party to perform or copy a copyrighted work is an act of infringement where there is no adequate proof that the third party ever undertook an infringing act for example,by performing or recording a copyrighted song.
often this threshold question will not matter,because ordinarily the plaintiff aims to recover damages and,if they can not be proved,the suit often will not be brought.but if wrongful authorization alone were infringement,statutory damages might be available without proof of copying,and occasionally harm might be done by such an improper authorization even without a further infringing example,it might discourage the purported licensee from seeking a license from the copyright true owner.
looking only at the statutory language,one might think that authorization alone could well be infringement.section provides that the copyright owner has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following and then lists infringing acts such as reproducing,recording,or performing the work.section a says,inter alia,that a nyone who violates any of the exclusive rights provided in section among other sections is an infringer.section a provides that an infringer is liable for actual or statutory damages.
because the right to authorize is literally one of the exclusive rights provided in section,the authorizing person could as a matter of language be treated as an infringer subject to statutory damages even if no listed infringing act for example,performance actually occurred.yet the legislative origins of the authorize language in the statute arguably support a narrower reading,and most perhaps all courts that have considered the question have taken the view that a listed infringing act beyond authorization is required for a claim.see ii goldstein,copyright,at ed.
the authorize reference was added to the statute via the copyright act.danjaq,commc ns.prior to that time,the courts had adopted a concept of contributory infringement to impose liability on someone who wrongfully authorized an infringing act by another who then committed that act,gershwin publ g columbia artists,cir.thus the concept of infringement was expanded by creating a kind of abettor liability for one deemed to have caused the infringing act committed by the wrongfully authorized person.this was hardly revolutionary doing something forbidden by proxy can lead to liability under both criminal and ordinary tort law.see lafave,substantive criminal law,at ed prosser and keeton on torts at ed.
when the new statutory language was added,the house report explained that u se of the phrase to authorize is intended to avoid any questions as to the liability of contributory infringers,at,reprinted in.if the language purpose was simply to codify the preexisting abetting doctrine that made an authorizer liable for the authorized party wrongful act of infringement,arguably the drafters did not intend to create an independent liability for authorizing where no listed infringing act,such as performance,thereafter occurred.
it has also been said,in support of this limiting interpretation,that state law provides ample remedies where there is an unlawful authorization that causes harm without a listed infringing act.for example,if the authorizing entity collected a flat payment regardless of copying or performance,a state claim for unjust enrichment might lie,restatement of restitution and if the authorization undercut efforts of the true owner to license the copyright,the true owner might sue for interference with contractual or advantageous economic relationships.see nimmer,at.
there would be nothing remarkable about such a splintering of enforcement between federal and state law.the copyright act does not draw into federal court all matters that pertain to copyright a simple dispute over who owns a copyright is usually governed by state law and would not,absent diversity jurisdiction,even be heard in federal court if it were the only issue in the case.see harms eliscu,cir,cert.denied,d.in this very case,the secondary dispute over ownership is resolved in federal court only as a byproduct of the infringement claims.
admittedly,the better reading would allow the claims in question they might add some slight protection to federal copyright interests,at the cost of more federal litigation.but the narrower interpretation appears from legislative history to be closer to congressional intent and has been followed by other courts.occasionally,and we think this true here,the case is so close and the stakes low enough that maintaining uniformity tips the balance.
this interpretation leads us to affirm the district court ruling rejecting several of the siblings infringement claims against the peer and lamco defendants.in a number of instances,the district court found that a publisher defendant had granted a license,sometimes as part of a blanket license of many songs,that included rights as to gvl works that were no longer within the publisher own rights example,because the copyright had entered its renewal period and the renewal period rights belonged to the widow and siblings.
but the court also found that there was no proof that the songs had been copied or performed under the mistaken licenses.the siblings position is that the mere fact of licensing creates a presumption that the works were the subject of infringing acts,but this ignores the reality that licensees often seek broad licenses covering a range of works,allowing them to choose what to use.depending upon the surrounding circumstances,an inference that a work was performed might be stronger or weaker,but a universal presumption is not justified.
as for the specific circumstances of the rejected claims in this case,the siblings say that lamco authorized,and was paid for,a mechanical license to sonolux for two songs and that this proves that the infringing acts occurred pursuant to the license.the siblings also say that peer,through bmi,authorized the broadcast in the united states of a gvl song,and that the online database showed this as a licensed song.in both instances,it is uncontested that lamco and peer had no rights to license during the period in question.
however,in each case there is no direct proof of an infringing act after the authorization.whether the listed infringing acts were from mere a factual issue and our review is for clear error.cariglia,at.the sonolux payment was refunded,and bmi listing a song as authorized does not mean it was played.the siblings brief on appeal does not spend much time explaining why its inference of infringement is compelling,and we see no reason for setting aside the district court judgment.
a different problem is presented by yet another infringement claim by the siblings.in,banco popular de puerto rico the bank used gvl composition génesis in cds and videos during the original copyright term,which had been inherited by the siblings.the siblings sued lamco for contributory infringement based on a retroactive mechanical license it issued to the bank in,under which the bank paid to lamco the district court awarded this
