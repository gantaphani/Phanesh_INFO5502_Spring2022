in this trademark infringement suit,icon health and fitness,icon,appeals from the order of the united states district court for the western district of washington granting a preliminary injunction in favor of,the nautilus group,nautilus.nautilus group,icon health fitness,d preliminary injunction order.the preliminary injunction,which has been stayed pending this appeal,bars icon from using its crossbow trademark to sell its exercise equipment.nautilus is the holder of the bowflex trademark,which it uses to market its patented exercise machines of the same name.because we do not find that the district court applied the incorrect law,relied on clearly erroneous factual findings,or otherwise abused its discretion in finding a likelihood of confusion to exist between the bowflex and crossbow marks,we affirm the grant of the preliminary injunction.
background 
nautilus and icon are direct competitors in the market for home exercise equipment.both produce resistance training systems that use bendable rods.in nautilus product,the bowflex exerciser,the rods are arranged vertically when a user pulls on a cable connected to the upper ends of the rods,the rods curve or bow outward.the rods are structured to resist this outward movement,requiring exertion by the user.
nautilus has continuously produced the bowflex exerciser since,and holds two patents on related technology nautilus registered the trademark for the bowflex brand in since,when nautilus began to directly market its bowflex exerciser to consumers,the company has invested in excess of million in promotion efforts.nautilus advertising has focused on infomercials,the internet,and print publications.as a result,over machines have been sold,with total revenues to nautilus of million.
in,icon,another large exercise equipment manufacturer,introduced a competing resistance training system it called crossbow.in the crossbow exerciser,the bendable rods are arranged horizontally so that they bend downward,in an inverted,rather than outward,as in bowflex vertical rod configuration.according to icon,the product resemblance to the medieval crossbow weapon inspired the brand name.in icon logo for the machine,the o in cross is replaced by a circular crosshairs.beneath the mark,in smaller type,appears an additional line,by weider,signaling the machine source since it introduced the crossbow exerciser,icon has spent million on marketing in many of the same advertising channels as nautilus,including infomercials and the internet.
nautilus commenced a suit for patent infringement against icon on december.thereafter,in april of,the district court granted nautilus motion for leave to amend its suit to include a claim of trademark infringement.on may,the district court granted icon motion for summary judgment of of the nautilus patents.this order became the subject of nautilus first appeal to this court.nautilus group,icon health fitness,fed.appx.unpublished opinion 
while its appeal of the patent infringement issue was pending,nautilus moved for a preliminary injunction to suspend icon use of the crossbow trademark.the district court,applying pertinent ninth circuit law,determined that nautilus had established likelihood of confusion between the marks such that irreparable injury could be presumed.the preliminary injunction was granted on july.before nautilus posted the required bond,icon moved for reconsideration or for a stay of the injunction pending appeal.both motions were denied by the district court,and this appeal followed we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
any word,name,symbol,or device may be treated as a trademark if it is used by a person to identify and distinguish his or her goods,including a unique product,from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods.a trademark holder may bring an action for infringement to prevent or recover for the unauthorized use of its mark.id.in a trademark case,we apply the law of the applicable regional circuit,in this case,the ninth circuit.see payless shoesource,reebok int l.under ninth circuit law,the core element of trademark infringement is whether the reasonably prudent consumer is likely to be confused as to the origin of the good or service bearing one of the marks.dreamwerks prod.group,skg studio,cir.
in the ninth circuit,a district court may grant a preliminary injunction in a trademark case when the plaintiff demonstrates either a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or the existence of serious questions going to the merits and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in his favor,walt disney,cir quoting sardi restaurant sardie,cir.probable success on the merits requires a showing that the similarity of the marks,among other factors,has created a likelihood of confusion as to the source or origin of the goods.ocean garden,marktrade,cir.if a likelihood of confusion between the marks is found,irreparable injury to the plaintiff may be presumed.see,at vision sports,melville,cir.
in accordance with ninth circuit law,a district court decision to grant a motion for a preliminary injunction will be upheld unless the court applied the incorrect law,relied on clearly erroneous factual findings,or otherwise abused its discretion.ocean garden,at quoting nec electronics cal circuit abco,cir see also,at.as far as the facts are concerned,i f the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,we may not reverse even though convinced that had we been sitting as the trier of fact,we would have weighed the evidence differently.interstellar starship servs.epix,cir citing anderson bessemer city,d.the ninth circuit views the ultimate conclusion of likelihood of confusion as a mixed question of law and fact,and it reviews that conclusion under the clearly erroneous standard.levi strauss blue bell,cir en banc.
in determining that nautilus had established a likelihood of confusion between its mark and icon,the district court applied the eight factors set forth in amf,sleekcraft boats,cir.the sleekcraft factors include the similarity of the marks,the relatedness or proximity of the two companies products or services,the strength of the registered mark,the marketing channels used,the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser in selecting goods,the accused infringers intent in selecting the mark,evidence of actual confusion,and the likelihood of expansion in product lines.see also interstellar starship,at.this eight factor test is pliant,and the relative import of each factor is case specific.id.
the district court began its analysis by considering together two complementary sleekcraft factors the similarity of the bowflex and crossbow marks,and the similarity of the associated products.the court observed that aside from the shared use of bow,the marks respective appearances and meanings were dissimilar.on the other hand,the court viewed the competing products as virtually interchangeable.because the close similarity in the products was likely to create confusion,the district court reasoned that less similarity between the marks was necessary.thus,despite acknowledged differences between the marks,nautilus was deemed to prevail on these two sleekcraft factors,similarity of marks and relatedness of goods.
the next sleekcraft factor considered by the district court was the strength of the registered mark.the district court found the bowflex mark to be suggestive,because it convey ed an impression of a good but require d the exercise of some imagination and perception to reach a conclusion as to the product nature.preliminary injunction order,slip op.at.although the district court did not view bowflex as a particularly creative mark,it found that nautilus had invested significantly in the brand name,so that it was now broadly recognized.for this reason,the district court determined that strength of the registered mark to be a factor weighing in nautilus favor.
the court found that the fourth sleekcraft factor,similarity of marketing channels,also weighed in favor of nautilus.both companies utilize identical marketing channels,including infomercials,print ads,and the internet,to promote their products.the district court rejected icon suggestion that its use of comparative advertising in these venues prevented any confusion.
nautilus sought to establish actual confusion,another sleekcraft factor,by presenting evidence of several telephone calls to nautilus sales center from customers interested in icon product.although the court noted that these consumers might have been confused by the similarity of the products,the suggestion of any actual confusion was,in the court view,sufficient to confirm the possibility of future confusion.
from circumstantial evidence,the court next surmised that this potential confusion might have been intentionally created by icon by naming its product crossbow,defendant invited comparison and reference to the bowflex.id.at.in the court opinion,icon had unfairly capitalized on nautilus successful marketing of bow in the context of exercise equipment.intent to confuse was,then,another sleekcraft factor that was found to weigh against icon.
the degree of care in purchasing was the only factor that,in the court opinion,supported icon.because the nautilus and icon machines vary in price from hundreds to thousands of dollars,the district court reasoned that it would be fair to expect that customers would carefully investigate the range of available products before purchasing.the presumptive high degree of care in purchasing would minimize the possibility that consumers would buy a crossbow based solely on their mistaken association of that machine with nautilus bowflex product,the court concluded.
balancing the seven sleekcraft factors it had considered,the court determined that a likelihood of confusion existed between the bowflex and crossbow marks 
the marks are somewhat similar,and there is evidence of actual confusion.moreover,bowflex is a strong mark,and there is circumstantial evidence that crossbow chose its name,incorporating bow,to take advantage of bowflex strong mark.although consumers may be likely to take some care in buying an exercise machine,the possibility of confusion is increased because of the use of the same advertising channels and the similarity of the products.analysis of the above factors favors bowflex,and demonstrates plaintiff probable success on the merits.
id.at.because likelihood of confusion had been found,the court could presume that irreparable injury to nautilus would result if injunctive relief were not granted.a preliminary injunction against icon was therefore entered.
on appeal,icon makes several related arguments for vacating the preliminary injunction.its primary focus is on the findings made by the district court with respect to its alleged intent to confuse,evidence of actual confusion,the strength of the bowflex mark,and the similarity between the two marks.icon also challenges the manner in which the sleekcraft factors were balanced to find likelihood of confusion in what icon views as the unique context of this case.we address each of icon arguments in turn.
we first consider icon challenge to the district court finding that icon choice of the crossbow as its brand name evinced an intent to confuse consumers.after considering circumstantial evidence,the court concluded that w hile crossbow intent may predominantly have been to compete,it was likely that defendant chose to incorporate the term bow in an attempt to capture some of the market of bowflex.id.at.
icon argues that intent to confuse should not have been found.it asserts that the crossbow brand name was chosen because the shape of the machine resembled the weapon of the same name,not because icon wanted to benefit from goodwill associated with the bowflex mark.icon contend that this explanation is supported by the dissimilarity of the two marks.had it intended to capitalize on the recognition of the bowflex name,icon states,it would have chosen a more similar term.as additional proof of its lack of intent,icon relies on the denotation of source,by weider,that appears next to the crossbow mark on its machines.in icon view,the addition of an explicit designation of source should negate any inference of intent to copy.nautilus responds that because circumstantial evidence of intent to copy is sufficient to suggest intentional infringement,it was not clear error for the district court to find intent to infringe on the facts of this case.
the law has long been established that if an infringer adopts his designation with the intent of deriving benefit from the reputation of the or trade name,its intent may be sufficient to justify the inference that there are confusing similarities.brookfield communications,coast entm t,cir quoting pac.telesis int l telesis communications,cir citation omitted.evidence of copying is not required to show intent instead,it may be inferred when a similar mark is adopted by a defendant who had actual or constructive knowledge of the plaintiff mark.id.
recently,however,the ninth circuit may have somewhat the role of the intent factor in the likelihood of confusion analysis.in brookfield communications,the defendant selected an internet domain name that was similar to the plaintiff mark.while the defendant was aware of the plaintiff mark when it chose its domain name,the court found that it was unclear whether the selection had been made with intent to confuse.because this factor did not favor either the plaintiff or the defendant,the court suggested that it was not of great assistance in determining likelihood of confusion.id.at this factor is only relevant to the extent that it bears upon the likelihood that consumers will be confused by the alleged infringer mark or to the extent that a court wishes to consider it as an equitable consideration.subsequently,in,walt disney,the ninth circuit reiterated the minimal importance of the intent factor by suggesting that even if the defendant was as innocent as a fawn with no intent to copy it would prove nothing since no intent is necessary to demonstrate a likelihood of confusion.at emphasis added.
we agree with icon that the district court analysis on this point was conclusory,and without more,could not justify placing the intent factor in nautilus column for purposes of granting a preliminary injunction.this is not an error,however,that requires reversal of the preliminary injunction.for this reason,we see no need to consider further icon specific intent.
we address next icon challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence presented to demonstrate actual confusion.nautilus submitted transcripts from four calls to its customer service center to prove that actual confusion had resulted from icon use of the crossbow brand name.icon rejoined that any consumer confusion suggested by these calls was a consequence of the virtual identity of the products,not the alleged similarity of the brand names.it further argued that evidence relating to four calls out of thousands received could not be indicative of any broader confusion.the court agreed that it was unclear where exactly this customer confusion originates.preliminary injunction order,slip op.at.it nevertheless concluded,however,that plaintiff has produced evidence of confusion such that this factor should be weighed in its favor.id.at.
on appeal,icon raises essentially the same arguments it made in the district court.first,it contends that because the source of the customers alleged confusion could not be determined,the evidence should not have been used to assess whether the bowflex and crossbow marks are confusingly similar.second,it contends that de minimis evidence of just four phone calls out of thousands is,as a matter of law,insufficient.nautilus argues in response that any showing of actual confusion is highly persuasive as to the likelihood of future confusion,particularly when the allegedly infringing mark has only been recently introduced.
as a general proposition,a showing of actual confusion among significant numbers of consumers provides strong support for likelihood of confusion.playboy,netscape communications,cir see also official airline guides,goss,cir sleekcraft,at explaining that evidence that use of the two marks has already led to confusion is persuasive proof that future confusion is likely.this confusion must be rooted in the identity of the marks confusion that arises solely from similarities in functionality can not be captured and protected as part of trademark law.see shakey covalt,cir refusing to condemn the defendants for physical similarities between their product and plaintiff because functional similarities alone can not be a valid basis for an unfair competition claim.finally,a reasonable juror may find de minimis evidence of actual confusion unpersuasive as to the ultimate issue of likelihood of confusion.entrepreneur media,smith,cir.this is appropriate because trademark infringement is only actionable when a mark is likely to confuse an appreciable number of people as to the source of the product.id.at emphasis added.
we agree with icon that the relatively small number of calls presented by nautilus renders this evidence too unreliable to establish actual confusion.we also agree that the ambiguity as to the cause of the of marks versus similarity of from the value of this evidence as an indicator of likelihood of confusion.in fact,a closer look at the call transcripts indicates that,if any confusion existed,it arose out of the similarities in the appearance of the crossbow exerciser and the bowflex machine such confusion would be expected,given that nautilus has been the only source for this type of exercise system for the last twenty years.this market dominance would lead one to expect that consumers might associate any machine of this type with the bowflex exerciser,regardless of that machine own brand name.
we agree with icon that it was improper for the district court to consider this scant and ambiguous evidence of actual confusion in nautilus favor for purposes of granting a preliminary injunction.accordingly,as with the intent to confuse factor,we merely decline to weigh this factor in favor of nautilus at this early stage in the proceeding.
icon next challenges the district court conclusion as to the strength of nautilus bowflex mark.the court found that,as a result of nautilus significant investment in advertising,bowflex has become a strong mark.preliminary injunction order,slip op.at.according to the court,this strength merited a greater degree of trademark protection.id.
the scope of the trademark protection that we give marks depends upon the strength of the mark,with stronger marks receiving greater protection than weak ones.entrepreneur media,at citing miss world uk am.pageants,cir.a strong mark is one that is inherently distinctive,such that it operates to clearly identify goods as originating with a particular source.see.in conformity with that background principle,marks have traditionally been categorized along the following range of increasing distinctiveness generic,descriptive,suggestive,arbitrary,or fanciful.see two pesos,taco cabana,d citing abercrombie fitch hunting world,cir.
a mark that is fanciful,arbitrary,or suggestive is considered to be inherently distinctive,and thus automatically qualifies for trademark protection under.see kp permanent,lasting impression i,cir explaining that such marks naturally serve to identify a particular source of a product and are thus entitled to trademark protection citations omitted genesee brewing,stroh brewing,cir.a fanciful mark is a word concocted by the trademark holder for its product,whereas an arbitrary mark is a known word used in an unexpected or uncommon way.interstellar starship,at.a suggestive mark is one for which a consumer must use imagination or any type of multistage reasoning to understand the mark significance the mark does not describe the product features,but suggests them.entrepreneur media,at quoting winery,gallo winery,cir.u nlike arbitrary or fanciful marks which are typically strong,suggestive marks are presumptively weak,but can be strengthened by achieving actual marketplace recognition.brookfield communications,at.
these creative marks are distinguished from descriptive marks,which define qualities or characteristics of a product in a straightforward way that requires no exercise of the imagination to be understood.winery,at.because they tend to consist of common words that might be the only way to describe a category of goods,a mark that is descriptive of its underlying product is only entitled to trademark protection if it has acquired secondary meaning in the minds of consumers.japan telecom,japan telecom am,cir.to possess secondary meaning,the term must have become distinctive of the applicant goods in commerce.two pesos,at.quoting e,f see also official airline guides,at a mark acquires secondary meaning if customers associate the mark with a particular source.
the line between descriptive and suggestive marks can be difficult to draw.the ninth circuit has suggested that courts look to the imaginativeness involved in the suggestion,that is,how immediate and direct is the thought process from the mark to the particular product.if the mental leap between the word and the product attribute is not almost instantaneous,this strongly indicates suggestiveness,not direct descriptiveness.fellowship church ananda church of,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted see,entrepreneur media,at holding that the entrepreneur trademark for a monthly magazine geared towards small business owners was descriptive because it describe d both the subject matter and the intended audience of the magazine and programs in such a manner that an entirely unimaginative,person would understand the significance of the reference brookfield communications,at finding the term moviebuff to be suggestive because it require d a mental leap from the mark to the product and did not merely describe the product or its purpose.as another measure of a mark descriptiveness,courts may look to use by competitors of the same term,because if there are numerous synonyms for a common trademarked word,others will have less need to use the trademarked term.entrepreneur media,at.see also playboy,at e xtensive use of a mark might tend to show that consumers are likely to associate the mark with companies and meanings other than the markholder.
fanciful,arbitrary,suggestive,and descriptive words are all capable of receiving trademark protection generic terms,on the other hand,are not.filipino yellow pages,asian journal,cir.generic terms describe a category of products,and therefore can not signal any particular source a trade mark answers the buyer questions who are you where do you come from who vouches for you but the generic name of a product answers the question what are you official airline guides,at quoting mccarthy,trademarks and unfair competition ed.it would be improper to extend trademark protection to a product generic name because it would effectively grant the owner of the mark a monopoly,since a competitor could not describe his goods as what they are.filipino yellow pages,at quoting surgicenters of,med.dental surgeries,cir.if,however,a generic term is combined with another word or words to form a distinctive term,the resulting compound can be trademarked.see cal.cooler,loretto winery,cir holding that the validity of a composite term is not judged by an examination of its parts park n fly,dollar park fly,cir rejecting the argument that because park and fly were both ordinary words,their combination was also generic.
in the case at hand,the district court applied these guiding principles to find bowflex to be suggestive,rather than descriptive.preliminary injunction order,slip op.at.because nautilus had made a significant investment in its mark to ensure that the public in general associates resilient rod exercise machines with bowflex,the court found that the presumption of weakness applied to suggestive marks was overcome in this case.id.
on appeal,icon argues that the bow component of the bowflex mark is either generic,or descriptive without secondary meaning.according to icon,the term bow describes a fundamental and distinctive characteristic common to the exercise machines that are the focus of this use of resilient rods that bend in a fashion to produce resistance.icon therefore asserts that the word,bow,is generic.in the alternative,icon contends that bow is at best descriptive,because it merely describe s a product,but does not inherently identify a particular source.two pesos,at.icon contends that granting trademark protection to a descriptive term like bow would have the effect of granting nautilus protection,via trademark law,over the functional characteristics of its product.icon suggests that to avoid this result,the words and images that describe those characteristics must remain freely available for use by nautilus competitors.
for its part,nautilus maintains that its mark,bowflex,is suggestive.first,it contends that the validity of a trademark is to be determined by viewing the trademark as a whole,cal.cooler,at,not by its component parts.second,nautilus explains that the term,bow,suggests key features of the product,rather than just describing them 
t he bowflex mark calls to mind the image of an archer repeatedly bending a bow by pulling the draw string back and forth.this image does not directly describe the bowflex exercise machine.rather,the image of an archer drawing a bowstring back and forth is a metaphor for the resistance principle employed by the bowflex exercise machine,which creates resistance in the manner of a bow resisting the archer pull on the bowstring,by providing resilient rods connected to cables,that the user pulls upon,thereby bending the rod which resists the pull on the cable.this metaphor is an intermediate stage of reasoning between the trademark and the property of the product that it suggests,which the consumer bridges by use of his or her imagination.
in the event that bowflex is found to be merely descriptive,nautilus submits that there is extensive evidence of secondary meaning,achieved through twenty years of successful marketing.
we begin with icon argument that,in the context of this case,bow is generic.the word bow could only be found to be generic if its primary significance were to describe the type of product rather than the producer,general mills fun group,cir.applying the test,see filipino yellow pages,at citing official airline guides,at,it is clear that bow does not answer the question what are you hypothetically posed by one looking at a resistance rod exercise machine.as the district court found,multiple,more plausible alternatives exist for describing this category of exercise equipment,such as,for example,rod exerciser or rod bender.in our view,the term bow is not necessarily used to describe the genus of which the particular product is a species.abercrombie fitch,at.
it is a closer question whether the term bow,as applied to this particular class of exercise equipment,is descriptive.bound by our limited scope of review,we can not say that the district court finding that the mark was suggestive was the result of an incorrect application of the law,was made in reliance on erroneous factual findings,or was an abuse of the court discretion.see ocean garden,at.
to determine if a mark is descriptive or suggestive,we look to how immediate and direct the thought process is from the mark to the particular product.japan telecom,at quoting fellowship church,at.we do not think it was error for the district court to find that bowflex differed from descriptive marks such as japan telecom,for a telecommunications business catering to japanese clientele,entrepreneur,for a magazine targeted to small business owners,entrepreneur media,at or micro colors,for the pigment used in permanent makeup,kp permanent,at.in each of these cases,the marks left little,if anything,to the imagination.on the other hand,because the mental leap between bowflex and the curving rods it describes does not strike us as almost instantaneous,see fellowship church,at,we conclude that the district court reasonably found that bowflex was a suggestive mark.as with terms such as moviebuff,for use in the entertainment industry,brookfield communications,at,for an internet search engine,at and accuride,for a slide mechanism used in drawers,accuride,at bowflex is not a particularly creative or distinctive mark,but it can at least be said that it requires imagination or any type of multistage reasoning to understand the mark significance.entrepreneur media,at quoting winery,at.we therefore can not say that,for the purposes of determining whether a preliminary injunction should issue,the court clearly erred in preliminarily finding bowflex to be a suggestive mark.for this reason,we decline to disturb the weighing of sleekcraft strength of the mark factor in nautilus favor.
further,in the context of our review of the district court grant of the preliminary injunction,we do not think the court clearly erred in finding that nautilus has strengthened a presumptively weak suggestive mark through its advertising.sufficient evidence was presented below to demonstrate that the bowflex mark enjoys a high level of brand recognition.
we next address icon challenge to the district court finding of similarity between the marks.acknowledging that the meaning,appearance,and sound of the marks differed,the district court found that bowflex and crossbow were only somewhat similar marks.preliminary injunction order,slip op.at.because nautilus and icon products were identical,however,this lesser showing was considered nonetheless sufficient for a finding of likelihood of confusion.
on appeal,icon first argument goes to the analysis required under sleekcraft and its progeny for similarity of the marks at issue.relying on ocean garden,marktrade,icon asserts that in addition to considering the sleekcraft factors,a court must ascertain whether any resulting likelihood of confusion was directly caused by the similarity of the marks.to fulfill this requirement,icon would have a court make an explicit determination finding a causal link between the similarity of two marks and any ensuing confusion.the failure of the district court in this case to make such a specific finding amounts to reversible error,icon asserts.
second,icon argues that,setting aside the marks shared component,bow,the remainder of the marks,flex and cross,are entirely dissimilar.this distinction,along with other differences in appearance,sound,and meaning,should,in icon view,operate to prevent a finding of similarity.without similarity,argues icon,nautilus claim of trademark infringement must fail.
finally,icon argues that if any likelihood of confusion does exist,it stems from i the similarity of the machines ii nautilus longstanding dominance in this particular from any closeness of the crossbow and bowflex marks.in icon view,confusion based predominantly on similar functionality can not be protected through trademark law.
to the extent that icon contends that the district court erred because it failed to perform a separate causation analysis,its position does not find support in the law.the ninth circuit has never held that,in addition to considering the sleekcraft factors,a court must satisfy itself that a separate causal relationship exists between the similarity of the marks and consumer confusion.the statement made by the ocean garden court,upon which icon heavily relies,does not indicate otherwise.in ocean garden,the court required the plaintiff to prove probable success on the claim that there is a likelihood of confusion as to the source or origin of the goods caused by the similarity of the marks.at emphasis added.although this does imply that similarity of the marks is critical to an infringement inquiry,it does not suggest that a separate finding of causation,tied solely to the similarity of the marks,is required.instead,the matter of similarity of the marks is already taken into account as one of the sleekcraft factors,and the ocean garden court cited with approval the use of the sleekcraft factors.see id.at.at no point did the ocean garden court indicate that a causal link between mark similarity and consumer confusion must be established in the manner icon now suggests.icon is attempting to inject into the court mere choice of language unintended and unprecedented substance.it was not error for the court in this case to decline
