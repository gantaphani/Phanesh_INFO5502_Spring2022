approximately six months after gallo brought this lawsuit,spider webs published a website at that discussed the lawsuit,the risks associated with alcohol use,and alleged misrepresentations by corporations.it contained a picture of the upper half of a wine bottle with the words whiney winery the whiney winery website.it had links to a number of other pages on the site,including an alcohol awareness page that discussed the dangers of alcohol an our mission page that was critical of corporate america a press release about the lawsuit and a letter from a gallo lawyer.although the first page contained a disclaimer that stated this site is not affiliated with ernest julio gallo r wineries,none of the other linked pages did.as of the date of the trial court opinion,typing in as the address on a web browser led a user to a website entitled spintopic.spider webs states that the spintopic website is owned by it and is a noncommercial,nonprofit,consumer information site.

spider webs does not appeal the holdings that gallo had a valid registration in its mark,that the mark is famous and distinctive,and that the domain name registered by spider webs is identical or confusingly similar to gallo mark.however,spider webs argues that they did not act with a bad faith intent to profit,as required by the acpa.the acpa prohibits cybersquatting by providing that 
a person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of a mark,including a personal name which is protected as a mark under this section,if,without regard to the goods or services of the parties,that person i has a bad faith intent to profit from that mark,including a personal name which is protected as a mark under this section and ii registers,traffics in,or uses a domain name that i in the case of a mark that is distinctive at the time of registration of the domain name,is identical or confusingly similar to that mark ii in the case of a famous mark that is famous at the time of registration of the domain name,is identical or confusingly similar to or dilutive of that mark or iii is a trademark,word,or name protected by reason of section of title or section of title.
d a.in order to determine whether someone has acted in bad faith under the acpa,
a court may consider factors such as,but not limited to i the trademark or other intellectual property rights of the person,if any,in the domain name ii the extent to which the domain name consists of the legal name of the person or a name that is otherwise commonly used to identify that person iii the person prior use,if any,of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering of any goods or services iv the person bona fide noncommercial or fair use of the mark in a site accessible under the domain name v the person intent to divert consumers from the mark owner online location to a site accessible under the domain name that could harm the goodwill represented by the mark,either for commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or disparage the mark,by creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source,sponsorship,affiliation,or endorsement of the site vi the person offer to transfer,sell,or otherwise assign the domain name to the mark owner or any third party for financial gain without having used,or having an intent to use,the domain name in the bona fide offering of any goods or services,or the person prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct vii the person provision of material and misleading false contact information when applying for the registration of the domain name,the person intentional failure to maintain accurate contact information,or the person prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct viii the person registration or acquisition of multiple domain names which the person knows are identical or confusingly similar to marks of others that are distinctive at the time of registration of such domain names,or dilutive of famous marks of others that are famous at the time of registration of such domain names,without regard to the goods or services of the parties and ix the extent to which the mark incorporated in the person domain name registration is or is not distinctive and famous within the meaning of subsection c of this section.
d b i.the acpa also provides a fair use defense bad faith intent described under subparagraph a shall not be found in any case in which the court determines that the person believed and had reasonable grounds to believe that the use of the domain name was a fair use or otherwise lawful.d b ii if a court finds a violation of the acpa,it may order the transfer of the domain name to the owner of the mark and may award statutory damages.see d c,d.
we turn now to consider the listed factors as they apply to this case.spider webs has no intellectual property rights or trademark in the name ernestandjuliogallo,aside from its registered domain name.the domain name does not contain the name of spider webs or any of the other defendants.spider webs had no prior use or any current use of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering of goods or services.under the fourth factor,spider webs use is commercial,and there is no indication that it is a fair use.steve thumann admitted that the domain name was valuable and that they hoped gallo would contact them so that they could assist gallo in some way.further,at least two other courts have found that when a defendant registers a domain name that is identical to someone else trademarked name and thereby impacts the trademark owner business by preventing internet users from reaching the trademark owner own web site,this is impacts the trademark owner business and is a use in connection with goods and services.people for the ethical treatment of animals doughney,d,peta citing planned parenthood federation of america,bucci,i t is likely to prevent internet users from reaching peta own internet web site.the prospective users of peta services who mistakenly access defendant web site may fail to continue to search for peta own home page,due to anger,frustration,or the belief that the plaintiff home page does not exist.
additionally,there is uncontradicted evidence that spider webs was engaged in commerce in the selling of domain names and that they hoped to sell this domain name some day.although spider webs did not offer for sale,it has offered for sale other domain names that it has registered.steve thumann stated that spider webs intended to wait until the acpa is declared unconstitutional before selling the domain name here.gallo,d at.spider webs admitted that gallo had a valuable trademark,and that when they registered the domain name they hoped gallo would contact them so they could assist gallo.indeed,the ninth circuit had found that one can be in the business of register ing trademarks as domain names and then sell ing them to the rightful trademark owners.panavision,toeppen,cir.the acpa was passed to address situations just like this one for example,many cybersquatters are now careful to no longer offer the domain name for sale in any manner that could implicate liability under existing trademark dilution law.and,in cases of warehousing and trafficking in domain names,courts have sometimes declined to provide assistance to trademark holders,leaving them without adequate and effective judicial remedies.sporty farm sportsman market,cir quoting,at,on the acpa 
additionally,there is no evidence that spider webs actually used the domain name until after the lawsuit began.the second and third circuits have indicated that when a registrant first uses a web site after litigation begins,this undermines any claim that the use was in good faith or was a fair use under the acpa.see sporty farm,at considering bad faith factors and finding bad faith shields zuccarini,cir same.under the fifth bad faith factor,the fact that spider webs hosted a website using gallo trademarked name,at which it disparaged the instant litigation and alcohol,is evidence of intent to harm gallo goodwill and to tarnish its mark.see,peta,d at defendant clearly intended to confuse,mislead and divert internet users into accessing his web site which contained information antithetical and therefore harmful to the goodwill represented by the peta mark.under the sixth and eighth factors,although spider webs has not offered this domain name for sale,it has registered other domain names that are identical or similar to the names of businesses and products,has offered other domain names for sale,and has refused to accept less than per name.these factors all favor a finding of bad faith.under factor seven,there is no evidence that spider webs provided misleading contact information.
finally,as to the last factor,there was evidence presented that gallo mark is distinctive and famous.see c listing factors to consider.further,gallo registered the mark,which is a family name,years ago,and other courts have found that gallo has clearly become associated with wine in the united states such that its evolution to secondary meaning status may not be seriously questioned.gallo winery consorzio del gallo nero.in sum,seven of the nine statutory factors strongly support a finding of bad faith.
additionally,this court is not limited to the consideration of the listed statutory factors,but can consider other factors as well.see d a i court can consider factors such as,but not limited to the listed statutory factors.for example,w hen the senior user trademark is famous in the marketplace and where the junior user was aware of the trademark and of its fame,a presumption of bad faith arises from the choice of the same name because it is inferable that the junior user adopted the mark for the purpose of profiting from the aura of goodwill surrounding the senior user mark.gallo winery gallo cattle,aff,cir.the circumstances of this case all indicate that spider webs knew gallo had a famous mark in which gallo had built up goodwill,and that they hoped to profit from this by registering and waiting for gallo to contact them so they could assist gallo.
considering the statutory factors and all the circumstances of this case,the trial court conclusion that spider webs acted with a bad faith intent to profit and its grant of summary judgment to gallo on this issue were appropriate 
spider webs also argues that the trial court should not have awarded gallo in statutory damages under the acpa because gallo did not suffer any actual injury.we review a trial court award of damages for clear error.martin mobil exploration producing,cir.

in a case involving a violation of section d of this title the acpa,the plaintiff may elect,at any time before final judgment is rendered by the trial court,to recover,instead of actual damages and profits,an award of statutory damages in the amount of not less than and not more than per domain name,as the court considers just.
