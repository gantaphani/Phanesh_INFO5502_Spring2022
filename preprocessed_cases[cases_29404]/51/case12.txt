plaintiff appellant peoples federal savings bank peoples federal challenges an interlocutory order denying its motion to preliminarily enjoin people united bank people united from using the mark peoples in the rebranding of several recently acquired banks in eastern massachusetts.after careful consideration,we conclude that peoples federal motion for a preliminary injunction was properly denied.peoples fed.sav.bank people united bank,d.we therefore affirm the decision of the district court.
facts and procedural history 
factual background 
peoples federal is a community bank that operates exclusively in eastern massachusetts it was chartered in and became a federally insured savings and loan institution in.while its headquarters are in brighton,it has grown over the years and now operates branches in allston,brookline,jamaica plain,norwood,and west roxbury.
peoples federal has been using the term peoples in its name and service marks since and claims to be the only continuous user of the peoples mark for banking services in eastern massachusetts since that time it owns six massachusetts registrations for its marks,including peoples,peoples federal,and peoples federal savings bank,which were granted on june,the same day peoples federal filed suit in this case.it promotes its marks through advertising and marketing efforts,involvement in community activities,and charitable giving.the bank has attracted media attention and been portrayed favorably in the press.
defendant appellee people united was founded in in bridgeport,connecticut,and has used the word people in its name for at least eighty years.the bank was called people bank until,when it changed its name to people united bank in consideration of its plans to expand beyond connecticut and distinguish itself from other banks that also use the word people in their titles.people united is a,regional bank with over billion in assets.
on april,as the result of a competitive bidding process,people united acquired from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic the deposits and banking operations of the failed butler bank,which had branches in north central massachusetts,and butler bank subsidiary,marlborough cooperative,which had branches in marlborough collectively,butler.on the following day april,people united began rebranding all former butler branches and them under its own name.specifically,it covered or otherwise replaced exterior signs at the former butler branches with signs bearing the name and logo of people united bank.people united also used its name and logo to replace the failed bank interior posters and brochures,and to publish new marketing materials and newspaper advertisements for these branches.butler troubles were covered extensively in the press as the first massachusetts bank to fail in sixteen years.the press also covered the related purchase and rebranding of all butler branches by people united.
procedural history 
on june,peoples federal filed suit against people united alleging trademark infringement,trademark dilution,and unfair competition in violation of section a of the lanham act,a,as well as massachusetts statutory and common law.one month later,on july,after unsuccessful negotiations with people united,peoples federal presented its motion for preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order.peoples federal avered that people united proposed to launch the rebranding of its former butler branches on july,and that this would cause confusion among peoples federal current and potential customers,damaging its goodwill and threatening irreparable harm to its name recognition in eastern massachusetts.it therefore sought to enjoin people united from rebranding its newly acquired butler branches and any other branches that it might procure in eastern massachusetts with the people united name,logo or other marks,pending adjudication of the parties rights in the instant suit.
at an emergency hearing convened on july,people united informed the district court that the rebranding of the former butler branches had already occurred and had been in place for the past three months.regardless,it agreed to refrain from taking further action,make any additional changes to branch facades or marketing or advertising materials,in the immediate future.people united explained that the july date must have been based on a misunderstanding because people united had no plans to execute any further rebranding on that date once satisfied that the status quo would be maintained,the district court scheduled a status conference and motion hearing for july.at the motion hearing,the court announced its preliminary findings and invited argument from the parties.on august,after considering the parties written submissions and oral arguments,the district court issued a memorandum and order denying peoples federal motion.
denial of preliminary injunctive relief 
in assessing peoples federal motion,the district court weighed the four preliminary injunction factors the plaintiff likelihood of success on the merits,the likelihood of irreparable harm,the balance of relevant equities,and the effect of the court action on the public interest.see voice of the arab world,mdtv med.news now,cir.ultimately,it found against peoples federal on each of these factors.
as to likelihood of success on the merits,the district court first rejected peoples federal argument that its peoples mark was entitled to a presumption of protectability,inherent distinctiveness based on its six massachusetts trademark registrations.peoples fed.sav.bank,d at.it so held in part because peoples federal registration of the mark was filed on the same day that suit was brought in this case,and only after people united had begun its rebranding process in massachusetts.the court also considered as relevant the fact that another massachusetts bank by the name of peoplesbank had operated as a local bank in massachusetts since,and had registered a mark that included the dominant word peoples prior to peoples federal the district court determined that this registration substantially outdates peoples federal recent,registrations.id.
the court nevertheless considered whether,independent of its massachusetts registrations,the peoples mark was inherently distinctive.it concluded that the peoples mark is properly classified as descriptive rather than suggestive because it did not require a stretch of the imagination to associate the term people with banking services id.at.in reaching this conclusion,which the district court characterized as a close call,it distinguished another district court opinion,commerce bank trust td banknorth,d,in which the word commerce was found to be suggestive in the banking context.the commerce bank trust court had found that,unlike commerce,words such as community,national,and mutual are descriptive of a specific characteristic of a banking institution.id.at.similarly,the district court in this case concluded that the term peoples is a straightforward way to describe a bank as.peoples fed.sav.bank,d at.the district court also concluded that the frequent use of the term people in connection with banking services cuts in favor of defining the mark as descriptive.see id.noting that people ranks as the twelfth most commonly used word in bank names on the fdic website,appearing in the names of banks in the united states.
having found the mark to be descriptive,the district court then determined whether the same had acquired secondary meaning sufficient to entitle it to protection.the court looked at the bank advertising budget,the nature and extent of its promotion efforts,and evidence of the bank growth,per this court guidance in boston beer company limited partnership slesar brothers brewing company,cir,in which we listed factors to be taken into account when assessing a showing of secondary meaning.see peoples fed.sav.bank,d at citing boston beer,at.the district court found that,although peoples federal had demonstrated that its mark had acquired secondary meaning within the neighborhoods where it has branches,it had not done so beyond those areas.specifically,although it had developed plans to open branches in suffolk,middlesex,and norfolk counties,peoples federal had not shown that a substantial portion of the consuming public in those areas recognized the peoples mark.its advertising efforts and community involvement,though significant,were found to be highly localized within the boston city limits and nearby urban areas.therefore,the district court concluded that peoples federal mark was enforceable,but only within,brookline,jamaica plain,norwood and west roxbury and not throughout all of eastern massachusetts,or even the rest of middlesex,suffolk and norfolk counties.id.at.
the district court then evaluated whether people united alleged infringing use was likely to result in consumer confusion.in finding against peoples federal on this point,the court carefully weighed the eight factors established in pignons de mecanique de precision polaroid pignons,cir the pignons factors or pignons analysis the court determined that,although the banks marks contain the same dominant word,important differences between the marks,including additional essential words such as federal and united and visual differences in their logos undoubtedly help customers distinguish between the two banks,thus decreasing the chance of confusion.peoples fed.sav.bank,d at.
although the district court considered the similarity of the services and found that this factor weighed in favor of peoples federal,it also weighed the parties differing views on whether the two banks market to the same kinds of retail and commercial consumers.it noted that while peoples federal emphasizes its identity as a small neighborhood bank,people united is a large,regional bank with numerous branches throughout new england.as to the similarity of their advertising,channels of trade and prospective customers,the court also determined that because banking customers ordinarily gather information before choosing a bank and make their decision based on substantive factors other than a bank name,the likelihood of confusion on those grounds was minimal,particularly because the banks in this case do not operate branches in the same neighborhoods.id.at.therefore,the balance of these three factors tipped slightly in favor of people united.
the district court then considered two instances of alleged confusion cited by peoples federal in support of its motion,both of which stemmed from a boston globe article that discussed a merger between people united and river bank,an entity that operates branches in essex county.evidence was presented that thomas leecht leecht,president and ceo of peoples federal,was asked on two separate occasions whether peoples federal as opposed to people united was acquiring river bank the district court stated that neither of the reported incidents involved confusion among current or prospective customers,which indicated a paucity of evidence of actual consumer confusion.id nonetheless,it found that because people united entered eastern massachusetts only a few months prior,the lack of proof of actual confusion was less salient,and concluded that the scarcity of such evidence was not in itself dispositive of peoples federal claim.
it next determined that peoples federal presented no compelling evidence that people united acted in bad faith by adopting the mark people united bank,and that to the contrary it had used the word people in its name for decades,asserting that its decision to change its name from peoples bank sic to peoples united bank sic aimed to avoid,rather than create,confusion in the market place.id.it further found credible people united contention that the rebranding of the acquired butler branches was consistent with standard practice in acquisitions.the court perceived no intent by peoples sic united to get a free ride off the good will of plaintiff mark or to confuse prospective customers,thus the intent factor weighed in people united favor.id.at.
finally,the district court considered the strength of the marks.per its discussion regarding the lack of inherent distinctiveness of peoples federal mark,the court noted that the conceptual strength of the peoples mark is belied by the fact that banks elsewhere around the country use that mark and many coexist in the same market areas.id.although the peoples mark had developed secondary meaning in the specific neighborhoods in which peoples federal operates,the court found the term to be a common one in the banking industry as a whole.thus,the mark lack of inherent conceptual strength tilted this factor in favor of people united.the district court concluded that the balance of the pignons factors particularly the dissimilarity between the parties logos,consumers tendency to perform research before selecting a bank,the absence of bad faith,and the scarcity of evidence of actual confusion weighed against a finding of likelihood of consumer confusion.the court additionally noted that 
at least at this stage of the proceedings,peoples federal has not adequately demonstrated that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its trademark claim.if,however,evidence is elicited that people united is deliberately encroaching into the specific neighborhoods in which peoples federal operates promotes itself as peoples rather than people united in an effort to divert peoples federal customer base and people united actions have caused actual confusion among peoples federal clientele,the c ourt would entertain a renewed motion for injunctive relief.
the district court concluded its analysis by considering the other three preliminary injunction factors.it found that,because peoples federal had failed to make a showing of likelihood of consumer confusion,it was not at risk of continuing irreparable harm.its finding that whatever harm incurred thus far was neither imminent nor irreparable was buttressed by the fact that people united had been using its name to operate former butler branches for more than three months with scant evidence of consumer confusion or peoples federal awareness until june of.the court concluded that,because peoples federal had failed to show both likelihood of confusion and irreparable harm,the balance of the equities and the analysis of the public interest weighed against providing injunctive relief.
this interlocutory appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
peoples federal challenges the district court denial of a preliminary injunction on multiple grounds.the main thrust of its appeal is that the court imposed an impermissibly high standard for establishing a likelihood of success on the merits by improperly weighing the eight pignons factors for likelihood of consumer confusion.as will be discussed below,we hold that the district court acted within its discretion when it denied injunctive relief based on its appraisal of the evidence and an accurate application of our case law.
preliminary injunction standard 
a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy that is never awarded as of right.voice of the arab world,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.in order for a court to grant this type of relief,a plaintiff must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that the injunction is in the public interest.id.quoting winter natural res.def.council,d.generally,w hile all these factors must be weighed,the cynosure of this test is the movant likelihood of success on the merits.borinquen biscuit,at.in a trademark case,t he importance of that inquiry is magnified because the resolution of the other three factors will depend in large part on whether the movant is likely to succeed in establishing infringement.id.this emphasis on likelihood of success is fully consistent with the tenet that,as a matter of public policy,trademarks should be protected against infringing uses.
the district court conclusions regarding these factors and its determinations as to their relative weight deserve considerable deference on appeal.id.at.accordingly,the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states weikert,cir.within that framework,findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and issues of law are reviewed de novo.boston duck tours,lp,at.in other words,the court will set aside a district court ruling on a preliminary injunction motion only if the district court clearly erred in assessing the facts,misapprehended the applicable legal principles,or otherwise is shown to have abused its discretion.id.quoting wine spirits retailers,rhode island,cir.
we turn now to peoples federal challenges on appeal,all of which center on the first factor in the preliminary injunction analysis likelihood of success on the merits.
likelihood of success on the merits 
in order for a party to succeed on a claim of trademark infringement,it must demonstrate that its mark merits protection and the allegedly infringing use is likely to result in consumer confusion.borinquen biscuit,at.we have interpreted likely confusion to mean more than the theoretical possibility of confusion.boston duck tours,lp,at quoting int l ass of machinists aerospace workers,afl cio winship green nursing,cir.this means the allegedly infringing conduct must create a likelihood of confounding an appreciable number of reasonably prudent purchasers exercising ordinary care.id.quoting int l ass of machinists,at.
as conveyed by the district court,we have enumerated eight factors to guide the inquiry into likelihood of confusion 
the similarity of the marks the similarity of the goods the relationship between the parties channels of trade the relationship between the parties advertising the classes of prospective purchasers evidence of actual confusion the defendant intent in adopting its mark and the strength of the plaintiff mark.
pignons,at accord astra pharm,beckman instruments,cir.a proper analysis takes cognizance of all eight factors but assigns no single factor dispositive weight.borinquen biscuit,at.see also beacon mut.ins.onebeacon ins,cir courts may consider other factors and may accord little weight to factors that are not helpful on the particular facts of a case.further,b ecause likelihood of confusion is a factbound inquiry,appellate review of a finding on that issue is for clear error.borinquen biscuit,at.
the court below applied this test and concluded that,on the whole,the evidence weighed against a finding that people united use of the peoples mark was likely to cause consumer confusion.peoples federal attacks the district court determination on various grounds,all of which we find unpersuasive.we consider each in the order presented to us on appeal.
actual confusion and the defendant intent 
we first evaluate peoples federal related arguments as to the sixth and seventh factors in the pignons analysis evidence of actual confusion and the defendant intent in adopting the peoples mark.
actual confusion 
peoples federal argues that the district court erred by requiring proof of actual confusion.it posits that,w hile evidence of actual confusion is often deemed the best evidence of possible future confusion,proof of actual confusion is not essential to finding likelihood of confusion.id.quoting attrezzi,llc maytag,cir.it also emphasizes that because people united and peoples federal had only in eastern massachusetts for a short period of time,evidence of actual confusion could not be expected.see id.at historically,we have attached substantial weight to a trademark holder failure to prove actual confusion only in instances in which the relevant products have coexisted on the market for a long period of time.peoples federal notes that the relevant injury in the likelihood of confusion analysis includes loss of goodwill and control of the mark,and is not limited to whether confusion caused an actual diversion of customers or lost sales.see beacon mut.ins,at,the relevant commercial injury for purposes of a of the lanham act includes not only loss of sales to actual and prospective buyers,but also harm to the trademark owner goodwill and reputation.
peoples federal argument is a red herring.it is patently clear from a balanced reading of the district court opinion that it only considered confusion regarding current or prospective buyers as one in a series of factors.indeed,after noting that evidence of actual confusion was limited in this case,the court went on to state that the scarcity of such evidence was not in itself dispositive of plaintiff claim,peoples fed.sav.bank,d at citing to relevant case law,and acknowledged that people united had entered eastern massachusetts only a few months prior.the district court then continued to weigh the remaining pignons factors before reaching its determination.
while it is true that evidence of actual confusion is not a prerequisite for a finding of likelihood of confusion,courts may still weigh evidence presented on this factor as part of their balanced analysis.see,beacon mut.ins,at noting that,although other persons might be relevant if their confusion threatens the commercial interests of the mark owner,a ctual and potential customers are the most obvious relevant persons in a likelihood of confusion analysis citation and quotation marks omitted.there is no error of law here,and the court assessment of the evidence was not clearly erroneous 
people united intent in adopting the mark 
peoples federal argues that the district court erred by requiring evidence of deliberate encroachment or bad intent to divert peoples federal customers.it points out that e vidence of bad intent,while potentially probative of likelihood of confusion,is simply not required in a trademark infringement case moreover,a finding of good faith is no answer if likelihood of confusion is otherwise established.star fin,aastar mortg,cir quoting president trs.of colby coll.colby,cir.however,in this case as noted throughout this opinion likelihood of confusion was not otherwise established.in addition,although bad intent is not required for a finding of trademark infringement,the defendant intent in adopting the mark is an appropriate consideration in the court assessment of whether the public is likely to be confused about the actual source of the goods or services at issue.see,boston duck tours,lp,at absence of bad faith weighed against a finding of infringement volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft wheeler,cir noting as relevant to infringement analysis that,while evidence did not indicate an intent to deceive customers,it did indicate that defendant chose beetle mark not independently,but with an intent to benefit from the plaintiff reputation.here,the defendant created its mark and logo years before it entered the eastern massachusetts market.
application of a heightened standard for likelihood of confusion 
peoples federal contends that the district court erred by requiring proof of actual confusion,actual loss of business,and bad intent,thereby applying an improperly high standard for likelihood of success on the merits.peoples federal points to the district court statement at the end of its likelihood of success analysis to support its position.the district court indicated that at least at this stage of the proceedings,the plaintiff ha d not adequately demonstrated it would be likely to succeed on the merits of its trademark claim.peoples fed.sav.bank,d at.in particular,the district court stated it would entertain a renewed motion for injunctive relief if evidence was elicited of deliberate encroachment into specific neighborhoods where peoples federal operates and of people united actions having caused actual confusion among peoples federal clientele.id.peoples federal argues this language confirms that the district court required more than a mere likelihood of confusion,and that it found against the grant of a preliminary injunction because peoples federal failed to present proof of these two factors.we are not persuaded.
peoples federal reads more into the district court words than is warranted.the district court findings as to likelihood of confusion were supported by the record before it,which included scant evidence of actual confusion,a proper consideration of people united intent in adopting the mark,and a thorough analysis of six other factors.these additional expressions were only an attempt to clarify to the parties the court willingness to consider future motions for injunctive relief if it were given a more developed record.
we also reject peoples federal related contention that the district court applied an improperly high standard as to likelihood of confusion because it indicated that in a trademark infringement case the plaintiff carries a considerable burden to show not just a possibility of confusion but rather a substantial likelihood of confusion.id.at emphasis added quoting bear republic brewing cent.city brewing,d.the district court consideration of the actual confusion factor did not amount to a requirement to prove an,likelihood of confusion,as characterized by peoples federal.the district court accurately framed the plaintiff burden,see,star fin,at we require evidence of a substantial likelihood of confusion not a mere possibility internal quotation marks omitted,and after an appraisal of peoples federal slim proffer of evidence determined,in its discretion,that the proffered evidence was insufficient to support a finding of likelihood of confusion.
similarity of the marks 
peoples federal argues that the district court erred by engaging in a comparison of the banks respective logos,and that it gave too little weight to the use by both banks of the same dominant word in its analysis.however,as peoples federal recognizes,s imilarity is determined on the basis of the total effect of the designation,rather than a comparison of the individual features.volkswagenwerk,at quoting pignons,at.accordingly,the district court took a holistic approach in assessing the parties marks,considering their sight,sound and meaning,and finding important differences.peoples fed.sav.bank,d at quoting boustany boston dental,d.specifically,the district court noted that people united mark contains the equally prominent word united and that its logo uses a red and blue color scheme,as well as a red orbit icon that encircles both the words people and united.id.meanwhile,peoples federal uses a green color scheme,with a yellow horizontal line separating the word peoples from federal savings bank.id.the district court concluded that a lthough the banks marks contain the same dominant word,the visual differences in their logos neutralize d this factor.id.
contrary to peoples federal contentions,the court conclusion is supported by our case law.see int l ass of machinists,at otherwise similar marks are not likely to be confused if they are used in conjunction with clearly displayed names,logos or other designations pignons,at same beacon mut.ins,at,factfinder could reasonably find total effect of marks to be similar where,in addition to sharing the ir most salient word,marks also shared the ir only pictorial element,an image of a lighthouse in addition,as will be discussed in our assessment of the appellant arguments infra,the district court did not commit error in determining that the word peoples was descriptive,rather than suggestive,and that determination cuts in favor of its finding against peoples federal on the similarity factor.see,boston duck tours,lp,at finding boston duck tours and super duck tours dissimilar despite both parties use of same dominant word emphasizing that e ven if elements of each party mark overlap,or are visually similar,the marks as a whole may still create a distinct commercial impression,especially if the similarities are limited to generic or descriptive elements see also first sav.bank,first bank,cir when the primary term is weakly protected to begin with,minor alterations may effectively negate any confusing similarity between the two marks.
similarity of the services 
peoples federal contends that because the district court found that t he parties offer essentially identical retail and commercial banking services,and this factor weighed in favor of people united,peoples fed.sav.bank,d at,the court overall conclusion should have also cut in its favor.once again,peoples federal misconstrues the applicable legal standard.a proper analysis of the eight elements that guide the likelihood of confusion inquiry assigns no single factor dispositive weight.borinquen biscuit,at.the court committed no abuse of discretion by considering the evidence on each of the remaining factors as part of its overall determination.
relationship between the parties advertising and channels of trade,and the classes of prospective customers 
after considering these three interrelated factors together,see beacon mut.ins,at,the district court noted differences between the scope of the parties businesses and found that customers were unlikely to be confused because of the level of care they ordinarily would employ before choosing a bank.it ultimately decided that even if the two banks attract the same clientele,the likelihood of confusion is minimal,particularly because the banks do not operate branches in the same neighborhoods.peoples fed.sav.bank,d at.
peoples federal attacks this finding on the ground that the difference between the banks in this case,the fact that peoples federal is a small,neighborhood bank,whereas people united is a large,regional bank augments the likelihood of reverse confusion.see,visible.unisys,cir explaining that under a reverse confusion theory,customers purchase the senior user goods under the misimpression that the junior user is the source of the senior user goods and that harm may occur if the junior user saturates the market and overwhelms the senior user,affecting the value of the trademark and the senior user business see also attrezzi,llc,at t he relatively greater strength of a junior user may hurt,rather than help,its defense.internal quotation marks omitted.notwithstanding,we have held that t here is no actionable reverse confusion in the absence of a showing of likely confusion as to source or sponsorship,visible,at,and all of the other factors considered by the district court in this case weighed against such a finding.
in addition,contrary to the appellant contention,the district court conclusion that customers would not likely be confused between the banks because banking customers ordinarily gather information before choosing a bank and make their decision based on substantive factors other than a bank name,peoples fed.sav.bank,d at,is supported by expert testimony on the record,and peoples federal fails to articulate how this conclusion constitutes either a legal or a factual error.our circuit precedent indicates that any meaningful inquiry into the likelihood of confusion necessarily must replicate the circumstances in which the ordinary consumer actually confronts or probably will confront the conflicting mark.int l ass of machinists,at.the parties have not pointed to,nor have we found,case law in our circuit interpreting the level of care to which we may hold an ordinary consumer in the banking sector.however,other circuits examining the subject have reached conclusions similar to that reached by the district court in this case.see,first nat.bank in sioux falls first nat.bank,cir validating lower court holding that consumers tend to exercise a relatively high degree of care in selecting banking services and recognizing that other courts have determined there to be minimal or no likelihood of confusion even where the names of financial institutions share the same dominant terms first sav.bank,at no likelihood of confusion between firstbank and first bank system service marks where bank logos were visually distinct sun banks of,sun fed.sav.loan,cir no likelihood of confusion between sun federal savings and sunbanks service marks first bank first bank,confusion between names first bank and first bank iowa is reasonably manageable such that equities weigh against permanent injunction,aff,cir.we do not in this case adopt a categorical rule for banking cases,but merely hold that the record supports the district court conclusion as to the level of care that could be presumed,and this was not in itself an abuse of discretion.see boston athletic ass n,at noting that d istinctions based on expertise can be useful in analyzing likelihood of confusion astra pharm,at t here is
