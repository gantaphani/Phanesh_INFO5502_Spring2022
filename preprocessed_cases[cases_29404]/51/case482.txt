background 
triumph use of the coach mark 
triumph publishes books and software used to assist teachers and students in preparing for standardized tests.triumph claims that it has used the coach mark in connection with its products since at least.according to triumph the market for test preparation materials for standardized tests is highly specific and targeted and much of the marketing takes place through face to face contact with sales representatives or in the form of direct mailings to previously identified educational department heads.appellee br.
triumph explains that,when congress passed the no child left behind act in,which mandated that all states administer standardized tests to monitor academic advancement,triumph made additional investments in its marketing.it began focusing on the style of its brand and developed a mascot a cartoon coach and a slogan america best for student success.triumph invested significantly in its marketing efforts,and,according to triumph,it has had substantial commercial success selling products under its coach mark.
in december,triumph filed applications for three marks the coach word mark serial a stylized coach mark serial and a coach mark and design serial referred to collectively as triumph coach marks.the coach mark with a design appears as follows 
each of the applications is for the following goods in international classes and 
computer software for use in child and adult education,namely,software to assist teachers and students at all levels in mastering curricula and in preparing for standardized exams prerecorded audio and video tapes in the field of child and adult education,featuring materials to assist teachers and students at all levels in mastering curricula and in preparing for standardized exams,in class and 
printed materials in the field of child and adult education,namely,textbooks,workbooks,teacher guides and manuals,posters and flashcards,all featuring materials to assist teachers and students at all levels in mastering curricula and in preparing for standardized exams,in class.
triumph coach marks were published for opposition on september.
csi coach marks 
csi advertises and sells a wide variety of accessible luxury products,including handbags,luggage,clothing,watches,eye glasses,and wallets.it has been using the coach mark in connection with its products since at least december,csi owns sixteen incontestable trademark registrations for the coach mark,all but one of which issued before triumph applications were filed in december.
csi sells its coach products in its own retail stores,in department stores,and over the internet through its website.it also promotes its goods by catalogs.csi advertises and markets its coach line of products throughout the united states using magazine and newspaper ads,billboards and bus and phone kiosks.appellant br.for example,csi coach brand products have been advertised in national fashion publications,including elle,vogue,mademoiselle,and vanity fair.
although csi briefing to this court includes advertising and sales figures from,including a representation that its sales exceeded billion over that time frame,as discussed below,this evidence was not properly submitted to the board and thus was not considered.in fact,the board found that csi introduced evidence of its advertising and sales only for.specifically,csi introduced the testimony deposition of carole sadler,the former vice president,general counsel,and secretary of csi,who testified that,in csi annual sales were roughly billion and csi spent about million a year on advertising.joint appendix.
to further support the popularity and commercial success of its coach mark,csi points to its joint marketing efforts with other popular brands,including lexus and canon unsolicited media attention from the fashion press an internal market study conducted in june and july of persons between the ages of,which showed that the coach brand had aided awareness and the fact that csi has taken steps to enforce its trademark rights against past infringers.
it is undisputed that csi is not in the education or industry,does not consider triumph a competitor,and did not present any evidence of any actual confusion stemming from triumph use of the coach mark in conjunction with its educational materials.
ttab opposition proceedings 
on march,csi filed a notice of opposition opposing registration of all three of triumph coach marks on grounds of likelihood of confusion under d and dilution under c.on october,csi amended its notice to add a claim that coach is merely descriptive when used on goods in the educational and test preparation industries,such that the mark is not registrable to triumph pursuant to e.
on september,the board issued a judgment dismissing csi opposition.specifically,the board found that there was no likelihood of confusion between the parties marks and no likelihood of dilution of csi coach mark for lifestyle goods by triumph coach marks for educational materials.while the board found that csi coach mark was famous for likelihood of confusion purposes,it concluded that csi failed to provide sufficient evidence of fame to support its dilution claim under the trademark dilution revision act of tdra,c.finally,the board held that,although triumph coach marks were merely descriptive,they had acquired secondary meaning and thus were entitled to registration.
csi timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a b.
standard of review 
we review the board legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for substantial evidence.in re pacer.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla and such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.quoting consol.edison labor relations.
discussion 
csi primary arguments on appeal fall into three categories.it argues that the board erred when it improperly balanced the factors set forth in in re dupont de nemours,to find no likelihood of confusion ignored substantial evidence showing that csi coach mark was famous for dilution purposes,including corporate annual reports that csi had attempted to introduce via a notice of reliance and found that triumph descriptive coach marks have acquired distinctiveness.
in response,triumph argues that the board correctly found no likelihood of confusion in light of the vast differences in the parties respective goods,the channels of trade through which those goods are sold,and the vastly different commercial impressions made by the marks on consumers no likelihood of dilution because csi did not meet the stringent standards for fame under the tdra and because its mark has not become the principal meaning of the word coach and that triumph marks have attained secondary meaning.appellee br.
for the reasons set forth below,we find triumph arguments regarding likelihood of confusion and likelihood of dilution.because we find that the board made evidentiary errors with respect to its acquired distinctiveness analysis,we vacate that portion of the board decision and remand for further proceedings on that issue alone.
evidentiary ruling regarding csi notice of reliance 
on appeal,csi takes issue with the board decision to exclude the corporate annual reports it attempted to admit through a notice of reliance.according to csi,the board should have considered its annual reports as evidence of csi annual sales figures and the amount it expended in advertising,design,and promotion of its coach products.in response,triumph argues that the board properly struck the documents from the record because they were not submitted in accordance with the board rules and were not otherwise authenticated.we agree with triumph.
this court reviews evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.crash dummy movie,llc mattel,citing chen bouchard.we will reverse only if the board evidentiary ruling was clearly unreasonable,arbitrary,or fanciful based on an erroneous conclusion of law premised on clearly erroneous findings of fact or the record contains no evidence on which the board could rationally base its decision.id.at.
the trademark rules of practice,which govern inter partes trademark proceedings before the board,provide,in part,that printed publications which are available to the general public in libraries or of general circulation among members of the public or that segment of the public which is relevant under an issue in a proceeding may be introduced in evidence by filing a notice of reliance on the material being offered.e.historically,corporate annual reports were not considered printed publications available to the general public and thus were not admissible via a notice of reliance without any authentication.see jeanne marc,cluett,peabody,it is well settled that annual reports do not fall within the category of printed publications as contemplated under the trademark rules.see also midwest plastic fabricators underwriters labs,p rinted material in the nature of annual reports is not considered printed publications available to the general public such that it may be relied on pursuant to rule e.rather,such material must be introduced in connection with the deposition testimony of a competent witness.vtech holdings varian semiconductor equip,opp,ttab lexis,at,opposer corporate annual reports,newsletters and other house publications are not printed publications or official records and may not be made of record by notice of reliance.we sustain applicant objection to all such documents and shall give them no consideration.internal citations omitted.
in a decision,however,the board expanded the types of documents that can be introduced by way of a notice of reliance.safer oms investments,t.in safer,the board held that 
if a document obtained from the internet identifies its date of publication or date that it was accessed and printed,and its source,the url,it may be admitted into evidence pursuant to a notice of reliance in the same manner as a printed publication in general circulation in accordance with trademark rule e the board will henceforth deem a document obtained from the internet displaying a date and its source as presumptively true and genuine.of course,the document must be publicly available.the date and source information on the face of internet documents allow the nonoffering party the opportunity to verify the documents.
id.emphasis in original.in a footnote,the board recognized that documents could be treated differently depending on their format.for example,a corporate annual report available only in paper form may not be admissible through a notice of reliance because it is not a document in general circulation,while a report in digital form publically available over the internet would be admissible through a notice of reliance because its publication on the internet places it in general circulation.id.at.
here,csi first notice of reliance,which was dated october,listed its annual reports from to triumph objected on grounds that annual reports may not be introduced through a notice of reliance,but must be introduced and authenticated by competent testimony.board decision.at.the board,relying on trademark rule e and the related cases cited above,indicated that corporate annual reports are not considered to be printed publications available to the general public.id.in a footnote,the board acknowledged the recent safer decision and found that,b ecause the annual reports were not printed from the internet,they may not be admitted into evidence pursuant to a notice of reliance.id.at citing safer,at.the board further noted that csi did not have any witness testify to the authenticity of the reports.accordingly,the board sustained triumph objection and gave csi annual reports no consideration.
on appeal,csi argues that the board should have considered the annual reports in light of the safer decision.according to csi,because its annual reports from to were available online,the board should have accepted the printed versions of the reports.in the alternative,csi argues that,if the court agrees with the board that the paper versions of the annual reports are not admissible via a notice of reliance,but that identical copies printed off the internet are admissible,coach submitted the testimony of its vice president and general counsel that coach sales and advertising information is reported publicly because it is a public company.appellant br.
the record reveals that csi former vice president and general counsel carole sadler testified as follows 
q.about how much does coach spend on advertising every year 
currently we spend about to million a year.if you include design and promotional expenditures with advertising,it is closer to million.
annually,yes.
and is that information available publicly 
yes,it is in our annual report.
q.what are coach sales approximately today 
a.about billion dollars.
is that information available publicly 
is coach a public company 
q.so it reports that information publicly 
according to csi,this testimony corroborates that the advertising spending and sales figures from to are publicly available through the annual reports csi proffered.it is undisputed,however,that sadler was not shown the annual reports during her deposition and did not authenticate the documents at issue.
despite csi contentions to the contrary,we find that the board decision to exclude the annual reports is consistent with both the trademark rules and the board related case law.it is significant,moreover,that csi submitted its notice of reliance in october,and the board did not decide safer until.at the time the notice of reliance was submitted,therefore,the board rules and existing case law were clear that corporate annual reports were not admissible via a notice of reliance.even under the board safer decision,moreover,csi printed versions of its annual reports could not be admitted into evidence pursuant to a notice of reliance because they lacked identifying information such as the online source and date accessed.indeed,safer specifically contemplated this situation where a corporate annual report is inadmissible in paper form by way of a notice of reliance because it is not a document in general circulation whereas the same annual report in digital form,publicly available over the internet,would be admissible through a notice of reliance because its publication on the internet places it in general circulation.gary krugman,trademark trial app.board prac.proc.
with respect to sadler testimony,the board found that her statements were limited to because she specified that her sales and advertising estimates were current estimates,and her deposition was taken in.and,as triumph notes and csi concedes,the sales figure sadler quoted during her testimony was for worldwide sales,not sales within the united states,and there was no indication as to whether the advertising figures quoted were limited to the united states.simply put,there was no testimony authenticating the annual reports or independently establishing the information contained therein.
although the board requirements for admission of evidence via a notice of reliance are specific,and do not mirror the federal rules of evidence,they can be readily learned and easily satisfied.because csi offered only paper versions of its annual reports,which are not selfauthenticating,we find that the board did not abuse its discretion when it excluded those reports.accordingly,we affirm the board evidentiary ruling.
likelihood of confusion 
next,csi argues that the board erred in finding no likelihood of confusion under the factors articulated in dupont.likelihood of confusion is a legal determination based on underlying facts.cunningham laser golf,see also software,commc ns,likelihood of confusion is a question of law,based on findings of relevant underlying facts,namely findings under the dupont factors.although we review the board findings as to the dupont factors for substantial evidence,we review its overall determination of likelihood of confusion without deference.in re chatam int l inc,
under section d of the lanham act,the patent and trademark office pto may refuse to register a trademark if it is so similar to a registered mark as to be likely,when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant,to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.d.whether a likelihood of confusion exists between an mark and a prior mark is determined on a basis applying the thirteen factors set forth in dupont citigroup capital city bank group,citation omitted.not all of the dupont factors are relevant to every case,and only factors of significance to the particular mark need be considered.in re mighty leaf tea.for example,the board can focus on dispositive factors,such as similarity of the marks and relatedness of the goods.herbko int l,kappa books,citation omitted.
here,the board focused on the following dupont factors the strength or fame of csi coach marks the similarity of the goods the channels of trade the classes of consumers and the similarity of the marks in their entireties.the board weighed each of these factors and found that there was no likelihood of confusion because the parties marks have different meanings and engender different commercial impressions,and the goods involved are not similar or related in any way.board decision,at.
csi argues that the board failed to give proper weight to the fame of its coach mark the identical nature of the parties marks and the overlap between the parties goods and the overlap and lack of sophistication of the parties customers.appellant br.we address each of the challenged determinations in turn and find that they are supported by substantial evidence.after careful review and balancing of the dupont factors,we conclude that the board correctly found no likelihood of confusion.
strength or fame of csi coach mark 
the fame of the registered mark plays a dominant role in the dupont analysis,as famous marks enjoy a wide latitude of legal protection.recot,becton,see also palm bay imports veuve clicquot ponsardin maison fondee en,fed.cir a strong mark casts a long shadow which competitors must avoid citation omitted.a famous mark is one that has extensive public recognition and renown.bose qsc audio prods,citation omitted.
fame for purposes of likelihood of confusion is a matter of degree that varies along a spectrum from very strong to very weak.palm bay,at quoting in re coors brewing.relevant factors include sales,advertising,length of use of the mark,market share,brand awareness,licensing activities,and variety of goods bearing the mark.recot,at see also bose,at o ur cases teach that the fame of a mark may be measured indirectly,among other things,by the volume of sales and advertising expenditures of the goods traveling under the mark,and by the length of time those indicia of commercial awareness have been evident.the party asserting that its mark is famous has the burden to prove it.leading jewelers guild,ljow holdings,llc,it is the duty of a party asserting that its mark is famous to clearly prove it.
it is that fame is insufficient,standing alone,to establish likelihood of confusion.of notre dame du lac.gourmet food imports,likely to cause confusion means more than the likelihood that the public will recall a famous mark on seeing the same mark used by another.internal quotations omitted.although fame can not overwhelm the other dupont factors,we are mindful that it deserves its full measure of weight in assessing likelihood of confusion.recot,at noting that fame alone can not overwhelm the other dupont factors as a matter of law.
to show the strength and fame of its mark,csi introduced the following evidence before the board 
csi began using the coach mark at least as early as december.
there are approximately coach retail stores throughout all states.
csi coach products are sold by approximately retailers throughout the us.
in,csi annual sales were roughly billion.
in,csi spent about million a year on advertising.
csi has advertised in magazines such as elle,vogue,vanity fair,and the new yorker.
csi has advertised in newspapers in major metropolitan areas.
csi coach products have received unsolicited publicity from newspapers and magazines discussing fashion trends.
csi has been the subject of articles that refer to the renown of its products.
csi internal brand awareness study,which issued in march,showed a high level of awareness of the coach brand for women between the ages of.
csi coach products are the subject of counterfeiting.
based on this evidence,the board found that csi coach mark is famous for purposes of likelihood of confusion.substantial evidence supports this finding.as discussed below,however,the board found that the other factors,on balance,dispel any likelihood of confusion between the parties marks.
similarity of the marks 
under the next dupont factor,the board must consider the similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance,sound,connotation and commercial impression.at.csi argues that the substantial similarity of the marks should have weighed heavily in favor of likelihood of confusion.triumph responds that,although the marks for both companies contain the word coach,when viewed in their commercial contexts,together with the relevant designs and in connection with their respective goods,they convey entirely different commercial impressions.appellee br.
it is that it is improper to dissect a mark,and that marks must be viewed in their entireties.in re shell oil co,the marks are considered in their entireties,words and design.see also sports auth,pc,same.in some circumstances,however,one feature of a mark may be more significant than another,and it is not improper to give more weight to this dominant feature in determining the commercial impression created by the mark.leading jewelers guild,at see also in re data,t here is nothing improper in stating that,for rational reasons,more or less weight has been given to a particular feature of a mark,provided the ultimate conclusion rests on consideration of the marks in their entireties.
the proper test is not a comparison of the marks,but instead whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their commercial impression such that persons who encounter the marks would be likely to assume a connection between the parties.leading jewelers guild,at.in this inquiry,if the parties goods are closely related,a lesser degree of similarity between the marks may be sufficient to give rise to a likelihood of confusion.in re inca textiles,llc,fed.appx,citing century real estate century life of.even where the marks at issue are identical,or nearly identical,the board has found that differences in connotation can outweigh visual and phonetic similarity.see blue man prods.tarmann,finding that blue man group has the connotation of the appearance of the performers and that applicant blueman mark has no such connotation for cigarettes or tobacco.thus,the marks differ in their connotations and commercial impressions see also in re sears,roebuck,considering crossover for brassieres and crossover for ladies sportswear and finding that,a s a result of their different meanings when applied to the goods of applicant and registrant,the two marks create different commercial impressions,notwithstanding the fact that they are legally identical in sound and appearance.
here,the board found that,although the marks are identical in terms of sight and sound,they differ as to connotation and commercial impression.the board stated that,in assessing connotation and commercial impression,we are compelled to consider the nature of the respective goods and services.board decision,at citing tbc holsa.applying this analysis,the board found that 
opposer coach mark,when applied to fashion accessories is clearly either arbitrary or suggestive of carriage or travel accommodations,stagecoach,train,motor coach,thereby engendering the commercial impression of a traveling bag,a coach or carriage bag.on the other hand,applicant coach marks call to mind a tutor who prepares a student for an examination.
id.given the completely different meanings and commercial impressions engendered by the marks,the board concluded that triumph coach marks are not similar to csi coach mark.id.
as noted,triumph applications seek to register coach in standard character form,coach in a stylized font,and coach with a mascot and the tagline america best for student success.it is undisputed that the word marks for both parties are identical in sound and appearance they both use the word coach.this fact is significant to the similarity inquiry.we,nevertheless,agree with the board that,despite their undisputed similarity,the marks have different meanings and create distinct commercial impressions.this is particularly true given that the word coach is a common english word that has many different definitions in different contexts.
specifically,we find that substantial evidence supports the board determination that triumph coach mark,when applied to educational materials,brings to mind someone who instructs students,while csi coach mark,when used in connection with luxury leather goods,including handbags,suitcases,and other travel items,brings to mind traveling by carriage.we agree with the board that these distinct commercial impressions outweigh the similarities in sound and appearance,particularly since,as discussed below,the parties goods are unrelated.see blue man,at we consider these differences in the connotations and the commercial impressions of the marks to outweigh the visual and phonetic similarity.accordingly,this factor favors triumph.
similarity of the goods 
with respect to the dupont factor assessing the similarity of the goods,the board found,and we agree,that the parties goods are unrelated.this factor requires a comparison between the goods or services described in the application and those described in the registration.see software,at noting that,when reviewing the relatedness of the goods,this court considers the applicant goods as set forth in its application,and the opposer goods as set forth in its registration.
when analyzing the similarity of the goods,it is not necessary that the products of the parties be similar or even competitive to support a finding of likelihood of confusion.eleven wechsler.instead,likelihood of confusion can be found if the respective products are related in some manner if the circumstances surrounding their marketing are such that they could give rise to the mistaken belief that they emanate from the same source.id.when trademarks would appear on substantially identical goods,the degree of similarity necessary to support a conclusion of likely confusion declines.citigroup capital city bank group,citing century real estate,at.
the board found clear and significant differences between the parties goods.board decision,at.while triumph applications identify computer software and printed materials for use in preparing students for standardized exams,the various products identified in csi registrations include handbags,fashion accessories,luggage,and clothing.the board further noted that,although csi uses its mark on many different types of goods,it does not use coach on educational products.
on appeal,csi concedes that the parties products are not the same,but contends that there is some overlap between their goods because it has used the mark in connection with books and audio and videotapes and in connection with tote bags,caps and shirts.appellant br.this alleged overlap does not help csi position,however,particularly since there is no evidence in the record regarding the sales or marketing of these items 
finally,although csi argues that the parties products are related because triumph uses its marks on shirts,caps,and tote bags,the board correctly noted that triumph applications do not seek to register its coach marks for those items,and likelihood of confusion must be based on the goods identified in the application.board decision,at.and,there is no evidence that triumph sells these products,which,according to triumph,are worn by its sales agents to market triumph test preparation materials.
based on the foregoing,substantial evidence supports the board conclusion that the parties goods are not related.
channels of trade and classes of customers 
next,we consider the similarity or dissimilarity of the trade channels in which the parties goods are sold and the purchasers to whom the parties goods are marketed.the board correctly recognized that,because triumph description of goods is not limited to sales to educational professionals,the goods are presumed to travel in all normal channels and to all prospective purchasers for the relevant goods.see packard press,hewlettpackard,when the registration does not contain limitations describing a particular channel of trade or class of customer,the goods or services are assumed to travel in all normal channels of trade.
with respect to the trade channels,the board noted that csi sells its products through its retail stores and through retailers.it also advertises in newspapers,fashion magazines,and catalogs that target female consumers between the ages of in all income brackets.for its part,triumph markets its products through catalogs,direct mail,and personal sales representatives.
with respect to the classes of customers,csi argues that customers of both products are ordinary consumers,including teachers,who may buy the products at issue without a great deal of thought.appellant br.the board found,however,that triumph targets educational professionals with responsibility for purchasing educational materials.the board further found that,although educational professionals may include females between the ages of,the products are not sold under circumstances likely to give rise to the mistaken belief that the products emanate from the same source.board decision,at.in fact,the board found that educational professionals are likely to exercise a high level of care in making purchasing decisions,which would minimize likelihood of confusion.
under these circumstances,the board did not err in concluding that the goods are not related and the channels of trade are distinct.although there could be some overlap in the classes of purchasers for the parties products,we agree it is unlikely that,in the circumstances in which the products are sold,customers would associate csi coach brand products with educational materials used to prepare students for standardized tests.and,there is nothing in the record to suggest that a purchaser of test preparation materials who also purchases a luxury handbag would consider the goods to emanate from the same source.see sports auth,at there is nothing in the record,however,to suggest that merely because the same consumer may purchase these items,such consumer would consider the goods as likely to emanate from the same source or have the same sponsorship.accordingly,substantial evidence supports the board decision that this factor favors triumph.
balancing the dupont factors 
the board found that two of the dupont factors weighed in favor of csi,in whole or in part csi coach mark is famous for likelihood of confusion and the classes of consumers may overlap.in contrast,the board found that the following factors weighed in favor of triumph the goods of the parties are not similar or related the goods move in different trade channels the marks used by the parties have different meanings and engender different commercial impressions and triumph markets to sophisticated purchasers after balancing these factors,the board determined that no likelihood of confusion would arise between the parties marks.
on appeal,csi argues that the board should have given more weight to its determination that its coach mark was famous.as the board correctly found,however,fame,while important,is insufficient standing alone to establish likelihood of confusion.on the record before us,and after weighing the relevant dupont factors de novo,we agree with the board that customer confusion is not likely between the parties respective coach marks.although csi coach mark is famous for likelihood of confusion purposes,the unrelated nature of the parties goods and their different channels of trade weigh heavily against csi.absent overlap as to either factor,it is difficult to establish likelihood of confusion.because the dupont factors favoring triumph outweigh the factors favoring csi,the board was correct in finding no likelihood of confusion.
the tdra,which was signed into law on october,amended section c of the lanham act,c.it provides that 
the owner of a famous mark that is distinctive,inherently or through acquired distinctiveness,shall be entitled to an injunction against another person who,at any time after the owner mark has become famous,commences use of a mark or trade name in commerce that is likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment of the famous mark,regardless of the presence or absence of actual or likely confusion,of competition,or of actual economic injury.
c.therefore,to prevail on a dilution claim under the tdra,a plaintiff must show that it owns a famous mark that is distinctive the defendant is using a mark in commerce that allegedly dilutes the plaintiff famous mark the defendant use of its mark began after the plaintiff mark became famous and the defendant use of its mark is likely to cause dilution by blurring or by tarnishment.
the tdra defines dilution by blurring as an association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark.c b.dilution by tarnishment is defined as an association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that harms the reputation of the famous mark.c c.
in its opposition,csi argued that triumph marks would blur the distinctiveness of its coach mark and tarnish its reputation.on appeal,however,csi abandons its dilution by tarnishment claim and focuses its arguments solely on blurring the board found that csi could not succeed on its dilution claims because it failed to show that its coach mark was famous for dilution purposes.for the reasons explained below,we agree.because we find that csi failed to prove fame for dilution,we need not address the other statutory factors courts can consider to determine whether a mark is likely to cause dilution by blurring.
fame for dilution 
a threshold question in a federal dilution claim is whether the mark at issue is famous.under the tdra,a mark is famous if it is widely recognized by the general consuming public of the united states as a designation of source of the goods or services of the mark owner.c a.by using the general consuming public as the benchmark,the tdra eliminated the possibility of niche fame,which some courts had recognized under the previous version of the statute see top tobacco,lp atl.operating,cir noting that the reference to the general public eliminated any possibility of niche fame,which some courts had recognized before the amendment.the tdra lists four factors for courts to consider when determining whether a mark is famous 
i the duration,extent,and geographic reach of advertising and publicity of the mark,whether advertised or publicized by the owner or third parties.
ii the amount,volume,and geographic extent of sales of goods or services offered under the mark.
iii the extent of actual recognition of the mark.
iv whether the mark was registered under the act of march,or the act of february,or on the principal register.
c a.whether a mark is famous under the tdra is a factual question reviewed for substantial evidence.
fame for likelihood of confusion and fame for dilution are distinct concepts,and dilution fame requires a more stringent showing.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademark and unfair competition at ed.the standard for the kind of fame needed to trigger protection is more rigorous and demanding than the fame which is sufficient for the classic likelihood of confusion test.while fame for dilution is an proposition it either exists or does not fame for likelihood of confusion is a matter of degree along a continuum.palm bay,at.accordingly,a mark can acquire sufficient public recognition and renown to be famous for purposes of likelihood of confusion without meeting the more stringent requirement for dilution fame.eleven,d at.
it is that dilution fame is difficult to prove.see toro torohead,fame for dilution purposes is difficult to prove.everest capital,everest funds mgmt.llc,cir the judicial consensus is that famous is a rigorous standard.see also mccarthy,at,noting that fame for dilution is a difficult and demanding requirement and that,although all trademarks are distinctive very few are famous.this is particularly true where,as here,the mark is a common english word that has different meanings in different contexts.importantly,the owner of the allegedly famous mark must show that its mark became famous prior to the filing date of the trademark application or registration against which it intends to file an opposition or cancellation proceeding.toro,at.
as noted,fame for dilution requires widespread recognition by the general public.c a.to establish the requisite level of fame,the mark owner must demonstrate that the common or proper noun uses of the term and uses of the mark are now eclipsed by the owner use of the mark.toro,at an opposer must show that,when the general public encounters the mark in almost any context,it associates the term,at least initially,with the mark owner.id.at.in other words,a famous mark is one that has become a household name.nissan motor nissan computer,cir quoting thane int l,trek bicycle,cir.with this framework in mind,we turn to csi evidence of fame.
csi failed to introduce sufficient evidence of fame for dilution 
the board found that csi evidence of fame was insufficient to support a dilution claim.on appeal,csi argues that the same evidence establishing fame for likelihood of confusion also establishes fame for dilution purposes.specifically,csi argues that the board disregarded sales and advertising figures for years its sixteen federal trademark registrations unsolicited media attention joint marketing efforts two second circuit decisions finding the coach hangtag,which features the coach mark,to be famous and csi internal brand awareness survey showing awareness among year old consumers.we address each category of evidence in turn.for the reasons set forth below,we find substantial evidence supporting the board decision that csi failed to show the requisite level of fame for dilution.
turning first to csi evidence of sales and advertising expenditures,csi argues that the board erred when it ignored the annual reports that were attached to a notice of reliance.as previously discussed,however,the board correctly held that these reports were unauthenticated and thus inadmissible.the only sales and advertising figures in the record via sadler testimony were for one year which,notably,is after triumph filed its applications in december.we agree with the board that this limited evidence of sales and advertising is insufficient to show fame.even if the board had considered the annual reports,moreover,such evidence,standing alone,would be insufficient.see toro,at merely providing evidence that a mark is a brand is insufficient to show this general fame without evidence of how many persons are purchasers.
with respect to csi registrations,the board found that the mere existence of federally registered trademarks is insufficient to show that the mark is famous for purposes of dilution because ownership of a registration is not proof of fame.on appeal,csi argues that the board erred in this determination because one of the statutory factors a court can consider in the fame analysis is whether the mark is registered on the principal register.see c a iv.as triumph points out,however,o ne can not logically infer fame from the fact that a mark is one of the millions on the federal register.mccarthy,at.while ownership of a trademark registration is relevant to the fame inquiry,and to the extent the board decision implies otherwise the board erred on this point,proof of registration is not conclusive evidence of fame.
with respect to media attention,the board found that csi evidence fell short of showing widespread recognition of opposer mark by the general population.board decision,at.specifically,the board found that 
the vast majority of unsolicited media recognition for opposer coach mark comprises a reference to one of opposer products as one of many different fashion buys or trends,and the news articles noting opposer renown are too few to support a finding that opposer mark has been transformed into a household name.
id.on appeal,csi argues that the board ignored hundreds of unsolicited articles mentioning the coach mark over the years.csi points to several examples,including the following 
in fact,coach growth has been phenomenal.when sara lee acquired the firm in,its volume was about million.in sara lee latest fiscal year,which ended last june,coach sales exceeded million.the name also resonates with consumers.the brand ranked eighth among the top in accessories firms in the latest fairchild consumer survey of fashion labels,in.women wear daily,may.

will coach become too popular coach,the maker and retailer of stylish handbags,just had a blowout season clearly coach has recorded some of the best growth numbers of any retailer or accessories maker in recent years.business week.
looking at the media attention in the record,there is certainly evidence that csi coach mark has achieved a substantial degree of recognition.that said,many of the articles submitted are dated after triumph filed its registration applications and thus do not show that csi mark was famous prior to the filing date.see toro,at an owner of an allegedly famous mark must establish that its mark had become famous prior to the filing date of the trademark application which it opposes.and,there is substantial evidence supporting the board determination that many of the references are limited to mentioning one of csi coach products among other brands.accordingly,even though there is some evidence of media attention,substantial evidence supports the board conclusion that the media evidence submitted fails to show widespread recognition.
with respect to joint marketing efforts,csi argued that other popular brands,including lexus and canon,have used the coach mark in connection with their products.the board found that csi failed to provide any testimony regarding the success of the joint marketing efforts and the effect of those efforts in promoting opposer mark.board decision,at.we agree.without evidence as to the success of these efforts or the terms of any contracts involved,they have little value here.
next,the board found that csi brand awareness study was of dubious probative value because it did not offer a witness with knowledge of the study to explain how it was conducted.id.at.the board further noted that,although the study showed a high level of brand awareness among women ages,it provided no evidence of brand awareness among women generally,or among men.see top tobacco,at noting that the tdra eliminated the possibility of niche fame as a basis for finding a mark famous.and,the survey was conducted in,several years after triumph filed its applications.given these circumstances,we find no error in the board decision to give this survey limited weight.
csi also argues that the board failed to adequately consider two second circuit decisions finding that the hangtag attached to its various handbags,which features the coach mark,is distinctive.see coach leatherware,anntaylor,cir finding that coach leather tags embossed with the name coach leatherware,which are attached to coach handbags by beaded brass chains,have become distinctive and valuable through coach promotional efforts and by virtue of its upscale reputation see also coach,v.we care trading,fed.appx,cir affirming the jury dilution verdict on grounds that the jury determination that the hang tag was famous and distinctive was not unreasonable and the substantial similarity of the two marks here coupled with the use of coach very distinctive hang tag shape amply justified the jury verdict.although the board did not specifically address these cases,we agree with triumph that they are unrelated and irrelevant,particularly because the case did not involve a dilution claim and both cases focus on the hangtag feature on csi handbags,not on the alleged fame of the coach mark generally.
based on the foregoing,we agree with the board that csi failed to provide sufficient evidence of fame for dilution purposes.absent a showing of fame,csi dilution claim fails,and we need not address the remaining statutory factors for dilution by blurring.
before moving on,we pause to emphasize the nature of our holding today.while the burden to show fame in the dilution context is high and higher than that for likelihood of confusion purposes it is not insurmountable.we do not hold that csi could never establish the requisite level of fame for dilution purposes.we hold only that,on the record presented to it,the board had substantial support for its conclusion that csi evidentiary showing was just too weak to do so here.
whether triumph marks were registrable 
as an alternative ground for opposition,csi argued that triumph coach mark is merely descriptive and thus not registrable under e.the board found that,although csi had standing to oppose triumph applications on descriptiveness grounds,triumph demonstrated that its coach marks had acquired distinctiveness.
both parties take issue with portions of the board decision on descriptiveness.for its part,triumph argues that the board incorrectly found that csi had standing to oppose registration on descriptiveness grounds.in contrast,csi argues that it had standing and that there was no evidence in the record to support a finding that triumph descriptive coach marks have acquired distinctiveness.appellant br.we address the parties arguments in turn.
standing is a question of law that this court reviews de novo.under article iii of the united states constitution,a plaintiff must show a case or controversy between the parties to establish standing.ritchie simpson,fed.cir.the case and controversy restrictions do not,however,apply to matters before administrative agencies.id.instead,for an agency such as the pto,standing is conferred by statute.here,standing is conferred by section of the lanham act,which provides,in pertinent part,that a ny person who believes that he would be damaged by the registration of a mark may,upon payment of the prescribed fee,file an opposition in the patent and trademark office,stating the grounds therefor.a.the purpose of the standing requirement is to prevent litigation where there is no real controversy between the parties,where a plaintiff,petitioner or opposer,is no more than an intermeddler.lipton,ralston purina.
in addition to meeting the broad requirements of section,an opposer must satisfy two standing requirements.ritchie,at.specifically,an opposer must show a real interest in the proceeding and a reasonable basis for believing that it would suffer damage if the mark is registered.id.under the real interest requirement,an opposer must have a legitimate personal interest in the opposition.id.with respect to the second inquiry,the opposer belief of damage must have a reasonable basis in fact.id.at citation and quotation omitted.
