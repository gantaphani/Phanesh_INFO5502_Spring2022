de quinta real,appeals from the district court judgment and order concluding that expansion of quinta real mexican hotel business into the united states would result in a likelihood of consumer confusion with la quinta worldwide,llc la quinta.the district court issued a permanent injunction against the use of quinta real in association with hotels and lodging in the united states.we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to.we conclude that there is federal jurisdiction over the trademark claims,and that the district court correctly found a likelihood of confusion,but that the district court did not provide a sufficient analysis balancing the equities in its decision to grant a permanent injunction.we affirm in part as to trademark violations,but vacate the permanent injunction and remand in part requesting further assessment of the equities.
since,la quinta has operated hotels and motels in the united states on its own and through franchise agreements,and it has long held trademarks for la quinta in connection with motel services.today there are more than la quinta hotels across the united states,including more than in major cities,renting million rooms to hotel guests each year.about half of la quinta hotels are operated by franchisees.la quinta franchise agreements require it to provide operational support,marketing,and training to its franchisees.la quinta also offers franchisees a geographic zone in which no other la quinta hotel will be opened,and la quinta agrees to ensure that there is no misuse or infringement that could harm franchisees investment in the brand,and to maintain and enforce quality control standards.la quinta spends millions of dollars each year advertising on national television,radio,in print advertising,through direct mail and multiple formats of internet advertising.la quinta is often featured in magazines,travel guidebooks,and on internet travel sites.
quinta real opened its first hotel in in guadalajara,mexico,and today operates eight luxury hotels throughout mexico.quinta real hotels are considered to be some of the most luxurious in mexico,and the average daily room rate is per night.quinta real hotels offer a wide range of amenities,and about of quinta real hotel guests are from the united states.like la quinta,quinta real has authorized websites such as and to promote and book reservations at its hotels.quinta real is also often featured in travel guidebooks.
quinta real plans to develop a luxury hotel in a major city.in,quinta real entered into a letter of intent to build a hotel in san antonio,texas,and this letter was publicized,although there was no indication of what the hotel would be called.la quinta has said that it was unaware of quinta real exploration of the san antonio hotel market.this letter of intent came to nothing,and quinta real next entered into a letter of intent in to build a hotel in tucson,arizona.although that letter also came to nothing,quinta real still intends to enter the united states market.while quinta real efforts to open a hotel in the united states have not yet reached fruition,la quinta,by contrast,has already opened several hotels in mexico.
la quinta filed the complaint giving rise to this action in march,two years after the date of quinta real last letter of intent.after a bench trial,the district court granted la quinta a permanent injunction,concluding that a likelihood of confusion exists and that the permanent injunction factors listed in ebay mercexchange,favored la quinta.this appeal followed.in substance quinta real raises four arguments that there is no federal jurisdiction over this case that la quinta suit is barred by laches that no likelihood of confusion exists and lastly,that the district court erred in granting la quinta a permanent injunction.we address each argument in turn.
quinta real argues that we lack jurisdiction because its expressions of intent to open a hotel are not sufficient to show a use in commerce under the lanham act.the use in commerce requirement that quinta real relies on is found in sections and a of the lanham act,which both lay out claims for infringement.we hold that the use in commerce element of lanham act sections and a claims is not a jurisdictional requirement,and we have jurisdiction under a.
federal jurisdiction over trademark claims is granted by the lanham act,a,which confers broad jurisdictional powers upon the courts of the united states in conjunction with.steele bulova watch,see reebok int l,marnatech,cir.the lanham act grants federal jurisdiction over all actions arising under this chapter,without regard to the amount in controversy or to diversity or lack of diversity of the citizenship of the parties.a.
to understand whether this broad grant is narrowed by other language in the lanham act,we turn to united states supreme court precedent.the supreme court has distinguished jurisdictional requirements from those required to establish a cause of action.see bell hood.under bell,
whether the complaint states a cause of action on which relief could be granted is a question of law and it must be decided after and not before the court has assumed jurisdiction over the controversy.if the court does later exercise its jurisdiction to determine that the allegations in the complaint do not state a ground for relief,then dismissal of the case would be on the merits,not for want of jurisdiction.

the supreme court has recently addressed in more detail the difference between elements of a claim and jurisdictional requirements.in arbaugh y h,the supreme court confronted a suit that the district court had dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.the district court reasoned that because the plaintiff could not show that the defendant met the employee threshold required in title vii to bring a cause of action,the court lacked jurisdiction over the claims.id.at.the supreme court concluded that because congress included no requirement in the title vii jurisdictional grant the employeenumerosity requirement was only included in a separate provision that does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts and no other factor suggested that the requirement was intended to be jurisdictional,such a requirement was not a condition for jurisdiction.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also reed elsevier,muchnik,leeson transamerica dis.income plan,cir.rather,federal courts have jurisdiction over all suits pleading a colorable claim arising under the constitution or laws of the united states,so long as congress does not clearly indicate otherwise.arbaugh,at.
here,the use in commerce element of lanham act claims under sections and a is not connected to the lanham act jurisdictional grant in a,which grants federal jurisdiction without any reference to a use in commerce requirement.nothing suggests that congress intended that use in commerce be interpreted as a jurisdictional requirement,and we conclude that we have jurisdiction over la quinta claims under the lanham act.see arbaugh,at if the legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute scope shall count as jurisdictional,then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.
to show trademark infringement,a plaintiff must establish ownership of a trademark and a likelihood of consumer confusion amf,sleekcraft boats,cir,abrogated on other grounds by mattel,walking mountain,cir.when determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists we weigh eight factors 
the strength of the mark 
the proximity of the goods 
the similarity of the marks 
evidence of actual confusion 
marketing channels used 
the type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser 
defendant intent in selecting the mark and 
likelihood of expansion of the product lines.
id.the factors are intended to act as guideposts for determining whether a likelihood of consumer confusion exists,and are adaptable to specific cases.fortune dynamic,victoria secret stores brand,cir see also network automation,advanced.concepts,cir.quinta real argues that the district court misapplied all of the above factors.but,for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the clear weight of the factors supports the district court conclusion that a likelihood of confusion exists.
strength of the mark 
the strength of a mark determines the level of trademark protection it is given.brookfield commc ns,coast entm t,cir.the stronger a mark meaning the more likely it is to be remembered and associated in the public mind with the mark owner the greater the protection it is accorded by the trademark laws.see one,llc jim,cir,walt disney,cir.we determine the strength of a mark by examining its conceptual strength that is,where it falls in the spectrum of marks and the strength of the mark within the marketplace.one,at.
quinta real does not challenge the district court conclusion that la quinta mark is strong because it has extensive secondary meaning and a robust commercial presence.instead,quinta real argues that because both parties have strong marks,confusion is not likely to occur,pushing against the district court conclusion that b ecause both marks are strong,this factor weighs in favor of la quinta.
both the district court and quinta real mistake this factor,and quinta real argument is without merit.the strength of the junior mark,here quinta real,is important to weighing this factor in cases of reverse infringement.in those cases,the issue is whether the strength of the junior user mark is so significant that it may overpower the senior user mark.see surfvivor media,survivor,cir cohn petsmart,cir walter mattel,cir.this is not a reverse infringement case,and the district court should not have considered the strength of quinta real mark in determining what level of trademark protection to extend to la quinta mark.as such,the district court erred in its analysis,but it correctly concluded that the factor weighs in favor of la quinta because its mark is descriptive with significant secondary meaning and a large presence in the hotel marketplace.
proximity of the services offered 
goods or services that are closely related are generally more likely than unrelated goods or services to confuse the public as to their sources.brookfield,at.the proximity of goods is measured by whether the products are complementary sold to the same class of purchasers and similar in use and function.network automation,at.
the district court found that both la quinta and quinta real offer hotel services,and while they operate hotels in different tiers of the market,a reasonable customer could conclude that the two hotel chains are from the same source because some american hotels operate several different levels of hotels under one umbrella brand.it also noted that the rates of the two hotel chains overlap significantly,and for these reasons it concluded that the factor favors la quinta.id.quinta real points to no evidence showing that the district court conclusion regarding umbrella brands is clearly erroneous.even if la quinta has no plans to expand into the luxury hotel market,the district court reasonably concluded that the varying tiers of hotel service do not render the services less related because hotel consumers frequently encounter hotel umbrella brands,including marriott and hilton we agree that this factor favors la quinta.
similarity of the marks 
the similarity of the marks is a critical question in the analysis,at.to assess similarity,we compare the two marks in terms of sight,sound,and meaning,considering the marks as a whole,as they appear in the marketplace.software,madacy entm t,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.generally,similarities between the marks weigh more heavily than differences.sleekcraft,at.and the amount of similarity required to support a likelihood of confusion declines as the services themselves become increasingly similar.century real estate century life of,mobil oil pegasus petroleum,cir remy martin co,shaw ross int l imports,cir exxon texas motor exch.of houston,cir.here,the district court correctly concluded that the marks are similar and that this factor favors la quinta.
quinta real argues that the district court erroneously considered quinta in isolation from other differentiating elements and by opening hotels in mexico and coexisting with the la quinta resort and club in california,la quinta can not argue that the marks are overly similar.we reject these arguments.
the district court conclusion that the marks are similar is not clearly erroneous.it examined the sight,sound,and meaning of la quinta and quinta real,and reasonably determined that the words shared a similar meaning when translated country home and royal villa and an identical dominant word quinta.see gallo winery gallo cattle,cir holding that although the mark logos were dissimilar,it does not appear that the district court committed clear error in relying on the dominant element gallo for its finding of similarity in sight,sound and meaning.this conclusion is supported by the fact that the dominant words frequently appear without anything more in the marketplace.where both marks are attached to such closely related services and the senior user has a strong mark,the similarity of the words is sufficient for this factor to weigh in favor of la quinta.
quinta real second argument regarding la quinta expansion into mexico does not succeed because it seeks to equate two separate trademark protection systems operating in different markets.while we are troubled by the inequitable circumstances,la quinta use of its mark in mexico does not determine whether the marks are similar or whether la quinta will suffer injury in the united states by quinta real expansion into this market.as such,the district court did not clearly err in finding the marks to be similar.
evidence of actual confusion 
evidence that use of the two marks has already led to confusion is persuasive proof that future confusion is likely.sleekcraft,at.however,due to the difficulty of garnering such evidence,the failure to prove instances of actual confusion is not dispositive t his factor is weighed heavily only when the particular circumstances indicate such evidence should have been available.see brookfield,at d ifficulties in gathering evidence of actual confusion make its absence generally unnoteworthy.despite quinta real contention that the two marks have coexisted for years and,therefore,evidence of actual confusion should be available,quinta real and la quinta have never both operated in the market.quinta real has american customers,but it has only offered services within mexico.the district court correctly concluded that a lack of actual confusion in the united states does not weigh against la quinta.
marketing channels used 
when examining the marketing channels used by the competing companies,we consider where the goods or services are sold,the sales and marketing methods employed,and the class of purchasers exposed to the marketing efforts.sleekcraft,at.the district court concluded that this factor weighed in favor of la quinta because the marketing efforts of la quinta and quinta real converge with internet travel sites and guidebooks.this conclusion is supported by evidence in the record showing that both la quinta and quinta real use internet travel sites such as and to reach consumers,as well as placements in travel guidebooks.the use of identical travel sites is particularly likely to cause confusion because it allows for the competing marks to be encountered at the same time,on the same screen.ebay,cir,at see network automation,at.the district court correctly concluded that this factor favors la quinta.
type of services and degree of care 
under this factor we look at the type of good or service offered and the degree of care one would expect from the average buyer exercising ordinary caution.sleekcraft,at.the district court found that of quinta real guests are business travelers who rely on others to make their rese
