this is an interlocutory appeal of an injunction granted in a trademark case.the parties agree that the mark purports to include at least the guitar shape set out in the papers.however,they disagree as to whether the mark extends to cover objects where two dimensions of those objects have the same general shape but not the same exact proportions as the drawing in the registration papers,and as to whether the mark includes additional product features shown in a photograph accompanying the registration papers whatever the scope of the mark,the parties also dispute whether the mark is valid and whether it has been infringed.
gibson guitar gibson is the owner of the mark in question,trademark registration the lp trademark.paul reed smith guitars,lp prs manufactures the singlecut line of guitars which gibson alleges infringes on the lp trademark.concluding that there was no issue of fact for trial,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of gibson on the claim,denied all of prs counterclaims,and issued a permanent injunction preventing prs from manufacturing,selling,or distributing its singlecut line guitars.
with respect to gibson claim,we reverse the district court decision granting summary judgment in favor of gibson,reverse the district court decision denying summary judgment in favor of prs,and vacate the permanent injunction issued by the district court.we remand the case to the district court with instructions that summary judgment be entered in favor of prs on gibson claim 
background 
certain basic facts are not in dispute.gibson and prs both manufacture guitars.gibson has been in the business of manufacturing musical instruments for over years.prs founder paul reed smith smith began manufacturing custom guitars in the and opened a guitar factory in.
gibson introduced at least one guitar model under the les paul name in.since that time,gibson has offered a number of guitar models under the les paul name.at least some of these models were,electric guitars of the type at issue in this litigation for a number of years during the,gibson did not manufacture guitars in the les paul series.at some time thereafter,gibson resumed manufacturing,electric guitars under the les paul name.gibson first applied for registration of what became the lp mark under which gibson asserts trademark protection for its les paul line of,electric july,but the patent and trademark office did not issue the registration until july.on september,the lp trademark became incontestable within the meaning of and b.
prs is a relatively recent entrant to the,market.although prs had previously manufactured a number of other guitars,it did not offer a guitar in its normal line until january at the earliest.in february,prs displayed models of the prs singlecut,a,electric guitar,at a music industry trade show on march,gibson sent a letter demanding that prs cease and desist from producing and selling the singlecut.
procedural history 
the procedural posture of this case is somewhat unusual.we briefly summarize those aspects relevant to this interlocutory appeal.on november,gibson sued prs in federal district court in nashville,tennessee.the complaint sought injunctive relief,costs,attorney fees,and treble damages for trademark infringement,counterfeiting,false designation of origin,and dilution under the lanham act,a,c,and for unfair competition,fraud,and deceptive business practices under state law.prs counterclaimed,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and asserting that the lp trademark is invalid and unenforceable the lp trademark is not infringed by the prs singlecut any trade dress associated with the gibson les paul series of guitars can not be protected under the lanham act or is otherwise unenforceable and the prs singlecut guitar does not infringe any such trade dress.
prs moved for summary judgment on all claims and counterclaims,and gibson moved for partial summary judgment on the claim.on january,the district court granted gibson motion for partial summary judgment on its claim and denied prs motion for summary judgment in its entirety.gibson guitar paul reed smith guitars,lp,d,gibson i.after the district court summary judgment decision,the parties jointly requested that the district court allow them to amend gibson complaint to state only the claim amend prs answer to state only counterclaims and dismiss all other claims and counterclaims with prejudice.the district court approved this request,and shortly thereafter gibson filed an amended complaint and prs filed an amended answer.as amended,gibson complaint seeks injunctive relief,attorney fees,and treble damages for infringement of the lp trademark.prs amended counterclaim seeks declaratory and injunctive relief,costs,and attorney fees,on the basis that the lp trademark is invalid and unenforceable and that the lp trademark is not infringed by the prs singlecut.
on july,the district court issued an order addressing a motion in limine filed by gibson and several matters raised in prs pretrial brief,including a demand by prs for a jury trial on the amount of profits to be disgorged.in the course of ruling on gibson motion in limine and denying prs jury trial demand,the district court entered a permanent injunction against prs 
this is hereby ordered that the defendant paul reed smith,its partners,employees,agents and all persons in active consent with them are enjoined from manufacturing,selling,or distributing,or in any manner enabling or aiding others to manufacture,or to sell,or to distribute the prs singlecut guitar and all versions thereof,including but not limited to their exterior shapes and features,the designs of which have been determined to violate plaintiff rights to protection under the lanham act for its incontestable trademark registration,for les paul guitar.

ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction over the underlying action pursuant to the lanham act.as the district court entered a permanent injunction against prs,we have jurisdiction to hear this interlocutory appeal pursuant to a.although our jurisdiction arises from prs interlocutory appeal of the permanent injunction entered below,we may also review the district court summary judgment rulings because those rulings form the basis for the district court decision to order injunctive relief 
propriety of granting injunctive relief 
in determining whether a district court has properly granted a permanent injunction,we review factual findings for clear error,legal conclusions de novo,and the scope of injunctive relief for abuse of discretion.worldwide basketball and sport tours,collegiate athletic ass n,cir.a district court normally must hold an evidentiary hearing prior to issuing a permanent injunction.moltan,cir.in this case,it is unclear from the parties submissions whether the district court held an evidentiary hearing prior to issuing the permanent injunction.however,because an evidentiary hearing is not required when no factual issues remain for trial,the district court decision to grant a permanent injunction without such a hearing could still be upheld if the entry of summary judgment in favor of gibson and against prs was proper.accordingly,resolution of prs interlocutory appeal from the permanent injunction requires us to determine whether summary judgment was properly granted to gibson.we conclude that it was not,and the district court accordingly erred in granting a permanent injunction.

c.the scope of the lp trademark 
prior to conducting our substantive inquiry,we take this opportunity to clarify a fundamental issue.the district court appears to have confused trademark law and law when it concluded that the lp trademark covered the entire guitar,rather than the silhouette included in the registration papers,gibson i,d at see also gibson ii,d at.this affected the remainder of the district court reasoning and prevented proper analysis of the parties claims.specifically,we do not believe that the drawing included in the lp trademark should be construed to create a trademark on the entire guitar as depicted in photographs accompanying the trademark application including the location and style of knobs,switches,and other hardware 
the district court error rests on an overly broad reading of in re eccs,as prs correctly argues,the district court relies on eccs to justify its decision to expand gibson trademark on the guitar body shape to cover other aspects or design features of the guitar such as the placement and style of knobs and switches,and the color of the guitar which would normally qualify as trade dress.however,trademark and trade dress are two distinct concepts under the lanham act.see stores,samara,d.the lanham act defines a trademark as any word,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof which is used or intended to be used by a person in commerce to identify and distinguish his or her goods,including a unique product,from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods,even if that source is unknown.by contrast,trade dress is not explicitly defined in the lanham act,but has been described by the supreme court as the design or packaging of a product which has acquired a secondary meaning sufficient to identify the product with its manufacturer or source.traffix devices,mktg.displays,d 
trademark infringement under the lanham act 
to establish trademark infringement within the meaning of the lanham act,gibson must demonstrate that the prs singlecut is likely to cause confusion among consumers regarding the origin of the singlecut.daddy junky music stores,big daddy family music,cir citing.we determine whether such confusion is likely by examining the eight frisch factors strength of the plaintiff mark,relatedness of the goods or services,similarity of the marks,evidence of actual confusion,marketing channels used,likely degree of purchaser care,the defendant intent in selecting its mark,and likelihood of expansion of the product lines.jet,at citing frisch,elby big boy of steubenville,cir,cert.denied,d in conducting the frisch balancing test,we must remember that t hese factors imply no mathematical precision,but are simply a guide to help determine whether confusion is likely.homeowners group,home mktg.specialists,cir.
the district court concluded that,with the exception of actual confusion factor four,all factors on which it made a finding favored gibson for summary judgment purposes because there was no evidence of confusion,factor four would have favored prs.gibson i,d at.however,the district court nonetheless concluded that g iven the striking similarity of the prs singlecut to gibson les paul and the instant market recognition of gibson les paul initial confusion would occur in the marketplace between parties products as to the singlecut guitar source.this factor favors gibson.gibson i,d at.having made this substitution of initial confusion for actual confusion at the point of sale,the district court went on to determine that summary judgment in favor of gibson was appropriate on gibson claim that the prs singlecut infringed the lp trademark.we disagree with the district court conclusion that initial confusion or,as discussed below,any of its variants can apply in this case.moreover,as gibson has conceded that no purchaser would be confused at the point of sale we conclude that there is no theory of confusion upon which gibson can prevail.in other words,gibson concession that there is no confusion which goes to the fourth frish factor,actual confusion is dispositive of gibson claim accordingly,it is not necessary for us to discuss the remaining seven frisch factors.
gibson theories of purchaser confusion 
gibson argues that despite the lack of actual confusion at the point of sale,the district court decision can be affirmed under a theory of either confusion the theory relied on by the district court,confusion,or some combination of the two.confusion takes place when a manufacturer improperly uses a trademark to create initial customer interest in a product,even if the customer realizes,prior to purchase,that the product was not actually manufactured by the.see paccar telescan,cir see also thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.supp mccarthy on trademarks collecting cases.confusion occurs when use of a trademark leads individuals other than the purchaser mistakenly to believe that a product was manufactured by the.see esercizio roberts,cir,cert.denied,d see also mccarthy on trademarks collecting cases.we conclude that neither confusion,nor confusion,nor any combination of two,is applicable in this case.
the one case where we arguably have applied confusion involved facts strikingly different than those involved in the present dispute.in paccar,we were faced with a dispute between telescan,a company operating web sites,and paccar,a truck manufacturer which also operated its own website.in paccar,telescan was using trademarks owned by paccar as part of the domain name of some of its web sites.noting that a n infringing domain name has the potential to misdirect consumers as they search for web sites associated with the owner of a trademark,we suggested that confusion analysis might appropriately be applied.paccar,at.however,our decision that paccar had established a likelihood of success on the merits on the issue did not rest on confusion instead,we focused primarily on three other frisch factors that we judged to be particularly important in an case.see id.at.as always,our concern was with whether the defendant use of the disputed mark is likely to cause confusion among consumers regarding the origin of the goods offered by the parties.id.at quotations omitted.other circuits applying the confusion doctrine have generally focused on that same issue whether the consumer might be misled about the source of the relevant product or service 
gibson essentially argues that the shape of the prs guitar leads consumers standing on the far side of the room in a guitar store to believe they see gibson guitars and walk over to examine what they soon realize are prs guitars.see,at carter dep.just looking at the guitars on the wall,i initially thought i was looking at les pauls,and on a closer look,i saw i was.we decline to adopt such a broad reading of the doctrine.many,if not most,consumer products will tend to appear like their competitors at a sufficient distance.where product shapes themselves are trademarked such a theory would prevent competitors from producing even dissimilar products which might appear,from the far end of an aisle in a warehouse store,somewhat similar to a trademarked shape.accordingly,we hold that confusion can not substitute for confusion on the facts of this case.
the one published case where we have applied confusion is also clearly distinguishable from the present case.esercizio,a case,involved ferrari sports cars which were manufactured in deliberately limited quantities in order to create an image of exclusivity.esercizio,at.the alleged infringer built fiberglass kits intended to be bolted onto the undercarriage of another automobile such as a chevrolet corvette or a pontiac fiero in order to make the donor car look like a ferrari.id.at.our concern in esercizio was that ferrari reputation in the field could be damaged by the marketing of roberts clearly inferior replicas.id.at.such a concern is not present here,where gibson concedes that prs guitars are not clearly inferior to gibson guitars.see,gibson br.at.accordingly,confusion can not serve as a substitute for confusion in this case.
gibson theory of confusion 
finally,gibson argues that,taken together,the and doctrines should be extended to include something that we can only describe as a theory of confusion.doctrine,which we have already rejected on the facts of this case,applies when allegedly improper use of a trademark attracts potential purchasers to consider products or services provided by the infringer.doctrine,which we have also rejected on the facts of this case,applies when allegedly improper use of protected trade dress on a product diminishes the reputation of the holder of the rights to that trade dress in the context,however,gibson does not suggest that consumer confusion as to the manufacturer of a prs guitar would lead a potential purchaser to consider purchasing a prs,rather than a gibson,or that gibson reputation is harmed by prs guitars.rather,gibson argues that this confusion occurs when potential purchasers see a musician playing a prs guitar and believe it to be a gibson guitar 
in the context of guitar sales,initial interest confusion is of real consequence.guitar manufacturers know that they can make sales by placing their guitars in the hands of famous musicians.on a distant stage,a smoky bar,wannabe musicians see their heroes playing a guitar they then want.
gibson br.at.as gibson concedes that prs produces guitars,we do not believe such an occurrence could result in confusion harmful to gibson.if a budding musician sees an individual he or she admires playing a prs guitar,but believes it to be a gibson guitar,the logical result would be that the budding musician would go out and purchase a gibson guitar.gibson is helped,rather than harmed,by any such confusion.
the summary judgment motions 
we have determined as a matter of law that confusion,confusion,and gibson theory of confusion can not be used to demonstrate infringement of the trademark at issue in this case.gibson has conceded that confusion does not occur between these guitars,and our review of the record does not suggest otherwise.accordingly,there is simply no basis on which gibson can show confusion that would demonstrate trademark infringement in violation of the lanham act.see kp permanent,lasting impression i,d noting that a claim of trademark infringement under the lanham act requires a showing that the defendant actual practice is likely to produce confusion in the minds of consumers about the origin of the goods or services in question.accordingly,prs,rather than gibson,must be granted summary judgment on gibson claim.
iii.conclusion 
with respect to gibson claim,we reverse the district court decision granting summary judgment in favor of gibson,reverse the district court decision denying summary judgment in favor of prs,and vacate the permanent injunction issued by the district court.we deny all other claims and motions as moot,and remand the case to the district court with instructions that summary judgment be entered in favor of prs on gibson claim.
i agree that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of gibson and i also agree that gibson can not maintain its trademark infringement claim either on a theory of likelihood of confusion at the for it has disclaimed that a consumer could be confused at the or on a theory of confusion however,because i believe that a product shape trademark holder should be able to present evidence to maintain a trademark infringement claim on the theory of confusion,i dissent with respect to this issue.
first,this court has recognized confusion as an infringement under the lanham act.see paccar,telescan technologies,cir citing eli lilly natural answers,cir such confusion,which is actionable as an infringement under the lanham act,occurs when a consumer is lured to a product by its similarity to a known mark,even though the consumer realizes the true identity and origin of the product before consummating a purchase.second,a product shape can serve as a trademark,it can identify the source of the product.see qualitex jacobson products,d recognizing that the senate report accompanying the lanham act revision of stated that the revised definition intentionally retains the words symbol or device so as not to preclude the registration of colors,shapes,sounds or configurations where they function as trademarks.citation omitted and ellipsis in original see also kohler,moen,cir concluding,in a case involving faucet manufacturer,which received a trademark after demonstrating that purchasers of its products recognized the source of its faucets by their distinctive shapes,that product configurations were entitled to trademark protection.since a product shape can serve as a trademark,and since initial interest confusion is a recognized theory of relief generally for trademark infringements,i believe that a product shape trademark holder whose product shape does in fact identify the product source should not be precluded from presenting evidence that a competitor product shape causes consumers to be attracted to it because of its similarity to a trademark holder mark.
the majority reason for rejecting the application of initial interest confusion to product shapes is based upon the concern that since many product shapes within the same category will appear similar when viewed from a sufficient distance,if the confusion doctrine were applied to product shapes,a product shape trademark holder could prevent competitors from producing even dissimilar products that appeared from a sufficient distance to be somewhat similar to a trademarked shape.this concern,however,is misplaced.evidence that a competitor product shape is similar to a trademark holder product shape when viewed from afar is irrelevant unless the product shape trademark holder maintains that its product shape identifies its source when viewed from afar.for if a product shape trademark holder does not assert that its product shape identifies its source when viewed from a certain distance,then any alleged confusion between the trademark holder product shape and a competitor product shape would not support the trademark holder claim for infringement.if a product shape trademark holder does assert that its product shape serves to identify the product source when viewed from a distance where many competitor products appear substantially the same,then this will be evidence that the trademark holder product shape does not identify its source.if most product shapes in the same product category have similar shapes,a product shape trademark holder will have a difficult time establishing that its trademark identifies the source of its product when viewed from afar,for the further one is away from a product,the more similar products in the same category will look to each other and,thus,the less likely a product shape will identify the source of the product serve as a trademark from that vantage point in other words,a product shape trademark holder will not be able to present probative evidence of initial interest confusion unless it first shows that its product shape identifies its source when viewed from the vantage point where the confusion is alleged to have occurred.
thus,this preliminary question whether a product shape identifies its source when viewed from the point where the confusion is alleged to have occurred,when in dispute,as it is here,must be addressed before determining if there is an issue of fact as to whether a competitor product shape causes initial interest confusion due to its similarity to a trademark holder product shape for if the product shape does not identify its source,then,logically,there can be no confusion as to the source of the product due to the product shape,since,in such a case,a consumer would not associate the product shape with its source.
here,prs argues that,as there are only a few general shapes in which guitars are made,and since there are numerous style guitars in the market,a consumer would not,and,indeed,could not,identify the source of a guitar on the basis of its shape.although prs would likely prevail on this issue,i can not say,in light of the record as developed,that it has met its burden establishing that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the shape of gibson guitar identifies its source.
since the district court incorrectly analyzed the issue of whether gibson trademark served to identify its source from the distance where the confusion was alleged to have occurred,i would remand for consideration of this issue if it were found that the shape of gibson guitar does serve to identify its source from the distance where the confusion is alleged to have occurred,then i believe that gibson should be entitled,just as any other trademark holder would be,to present evidence that a competitor use of a similar mark causes confusion as to the source of the competitor product thus,i respectfully dissent.
we emphasize that this dispute is only over whether the product shape and features are covered by trademark law.all claims have been voluntarily dismissed by the parties.
on appeal,paul reed smith guitars,lp prs also maintains that the district court erred in failing to declare trademark registration the lp trademark invalid under the doctrines prohibiting protection of functional or generic marks.as we have determined that the lp trademark,even if valid,is not infringed by the prs singlecut,we deny prs counterclaims against the validity of the trademark as moot.we also note that following oral argument and prior to our decision in this case,prs filed a motion to stay proceedings in the district court pending the resolution of this appeal.we now deny this motion as moot.
on appeal,neither party challenges the district court description of the les paul guitar produced by gibson guitar gibson gibson les paul single cutaway guitar is a traditionally shaped guitar with a portion removed from the body of the guitar where the lower section of the fingerboard meets the body of the guitar.the term cutaway guitar denotes that portion of the guitar between the neck and its lower part,that appears to be missing from the natural,rounded body contour.the removal of this portion forms what is often referred to as the horn.one aspect of this horn design is that the musician can access higher strings and position s.as to other parts of a guitar,a pickup selector switch allows the player to change quickly the electromagnetic inputs to any one of three options the pickup closest to the neck the neck pickup,the one furthest from the neck the bridge pickup,or a combination of both.the combination of volume and tone knobs for each pickup allow s the player to set the tone and volume of each pickup and switching among these pickups can achieve different guitar paul reed smith guitars,lp,d,gibson i quotation marks,citations,and footnote omitted.

explaining its decision to issue an injunction prior to the trial on appropriate relief,the district court noted here,the court did not initially award injunctive relief in contemplation of a motion to alter or amend its earlier findings and conclusions of law for potential error.the court was of the view that the declaration of rights was sufficient in the interim.prs did not file a rule motion or a motion to reconsider.the court is now firmly convinced that injunctive relief to bar the production and sale of prs singlecut is appropriate and to any stay pending an appeal,the standards to consider are those on awarding injunctive relief.for the reasons set forth in the court memorandum,the court does not believe that prs will prevail on appeal.gibson will suffer irreparable injury to its goodwill in its les paul if prs is not enjoined.gibson dealers would be injured by prs unlawful sales of its singlecut.the court deems it in the interest of justice to enforce registered trademarks.given these findings,prs request for a stay of injunctive relief will be guitar paul reed smith guitars,lp,d,gibson ii.
a bench trial was held from july,to july.perhaps awaiting the result of this interlocutory appeal,the district court does not appear to have issued any order following this bench trial.

the district court analysis of this issue reads in full the court follows in re eccs,to conclude that any variations between gibson drawings and the les paul guitar are not controlling.the core consideration is whether the les paul guitar is covered by gibson trademark.here,the undisputed facts are that the gibson les paul guitar is the same shape of the guitar shown in gibson trademark and application papers.pictures of the les paul guitar,as well as pictures from market publications and business records about the les paul guitar were part of gibson application papers upon which the ustpo issued gibson trademark registrations.the court concludes prs contention about gibson drawing lacks merit.gibson i,d at see also gibson ii,d at elements of the les paul are so intermingled with prs singlecut that the entire singlecut guitar is the offending product.id.at finally,gibson trade mark is not,as prs argues,the two dimensional guitar,but rather is the entire les paul guitar and its appearance.
the issue presented in eccs was entirely different from the one presented by the lp trademark.in eccs,the federal circuit was called to determine whether to permit a trademark applicant to amend an admittedly erroneous drawing to conform to its intended trademark,rather than require the trademark be changed to conform to the erroneous drawing.the eccs trademark applicant had submitted accurate specimens of its trademark,as actually used the word exa appearing above the word module,but had included an inaccurate drawing of the trademark listing examodule as a single word,on a single line.eccs,at.the applicant attempted to submit a corrected drawing,but the trademark examining attorney,in a decision upheld by the trademark trial and appeals board,required that the applicant instead submit substitute specimens reflecting use of the mark in the drawing examodule.the federal circuit reversed the board decision,holding that in such a case it is appropriate to look to the specimens to determine what the applicant wished to register,rather than a clearly inconsistent and erroneous drawing made by its attorney.id.
see generally a stores,samara,d describing trade dress protection abercrombie fitch stores,am.eagle outfitters,cir same.as we have explained,t rade dress refers to the image and overall appearance of a product.it embodies that arrangement of identifying characteristics or decorations connected with a product,whether by packaging or otherwise,that make s the source of the product distinguishable from another and promote s its sale.trade dress involves the total image of a product and may include features such as size,shape,color or color combinations,texture,graphics,or even particular sales,at internal quotations omitted brackets and ellipses in abercrombie.the distinction between trademark and trade dress is particularly important,given the posture of this case.as we noted above,after the district court granted gibson partial summary judgment motion,the district court approved the parties agreement to dismiss with prejudice all of gibson remaining claims,including its claim for infringement.accordingly,the only remaining gibson claim is the a claim.
many precedents applying this test arise out of bench trials,where the district court has the authority to make findings of fact,see,wynn oil thomas,cir.however,we have previously explained the somewhat awkward manner in which this test should be applied in the context of a sum
