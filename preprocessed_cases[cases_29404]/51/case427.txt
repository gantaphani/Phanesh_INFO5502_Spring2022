are a consumer electronics company,its owners,and its trade names collectively,midwest.beltronics is a provider of aftermarket vehicle electronics,including radar detectors.midwest appeals the district court order preliminarily enjoining it from selling beltronics equipment not bearing an original beltronics serial number label.see lanham act,a,a.we have jurisdiction under a and affirm.
background 
as early as,beltronics began selling electronics equipment under its beltronics trademark.at all times relevant to this case,beltronics sold its equipment to at least two authorized distributors who agreed to sell the products for a specified minimum price.apparently in violation of their distribution agreements,those distributors sold beltronics radar detectors to midwest,which in turn resold them as new on the internet auction site ebay.to prevent beltronics from discovering that midwest inventory had been supplied by the two distributors,the distributors either replaced each radar detector original serial number label with a phony label or removed the original label altogether before shipping equipment to midwest.on rare occasions,when the distributors supplied midwest with a radar detector bearing an original serial number label,midwest removed the label prior to resale.
it is beltronics policy that only those who purchase beltronics radar detectors bearing an original serial number label are eligible to receive certain products and services,including software upgrades,rebates,product use information,service assistance,warranties,and recalls.beltronics learned that its radar detectors were being sold without original serial labels when midwest purchasers contacted beltronics with warranty requests for detectors that had phony serial numbers.a beltronics customer service manager submitted an affidavit stating that those purchasers were confused,thinking that they were entitled to a warranty from beltronics.the customer service manager further stated that the customers expressed their belief that they did not receive what they thought they had purchased and that beltronics had deceived them.he explained that they became irate when they learned their radar detector was not covered by beltronics warranty and did not come with other services such as recalls and product upgrades,and that this is extremely harmful to beltronics reputation and goodwill.
in september,beltronics filed this action against midwest.the complaint asserted counterfeiting and federal trademark infringement under false designation or origin under and trademark infringement,unfair competition,and passing off in violation of state law.beltronics also sought a preliminary injunction following an evidentiary hearing on october,the district court determined that beltronics had satisfied all of the necessary requirements for a preliminary injunction and enjoined midwest from selling or offering for sale any beltronics products that do not bear an original serial number label.midwest filed a timely notice of interlocutory appeal see a fed.a a.
ii.discussion 
preliminary injunction standard of review 
to prevail on a motion for a preliminary injunction,the movant must establish that four equitable factors weigh in its favor it is substantially likely to succeed on the merits it will suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is denied its threatened injury outweighs the injury the opposing party will suffer under the injunction and the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.see westar energy,lake,cir.on appeal,midwest challenges only the district court determination that beltronics has a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits of its claim for trademark infringement.see lanham act.
we review the grant of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.see pac.frontier pleasant grove city,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it commits an error of law or makes clearly erroneous factual findings.wyandotte nation sebelius,cir.moreover,because a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy,the right to relief must be clear and unequivocal.greater yellowstone coal.flowers,cir see also united states ex rel.citizen band potawatomi indian tribe of enter.mgmt.consultants,cir stating that a preliminary injunction constitutes drastic relief to be provided with caution and should be granted only in cases where the necessity for it is clearly established.motors urban gorilla,llc,cir in general,a preliminary injunction is the exception rather than the rule.quotations omitted.
we have also explained that injunctions that disrupt the status quo are disfavored and must be more closely scrutinized to assure that the exigencies of the case support the granting of a remedy that is extraordinary even in the normal course.schrier of,cir quotations omitted.an injunction disrupts the status quo when it changes the last peaceable uncontested status existing between the parties before the dispute developed.id.at.in such instances,the district court may not grant a preliminary injunction unless the plaintiff make s a strong showing both with regard to the likelihood of success on the merits and with regard to the balance of harms.o centro espirita beneficiente uniao do vegetal ashcroft,cir en banc.this heightened standard accords with the historic purpose of the preliminary injunction,which is to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.of camenisch,d.see also o centro,at stating that the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to assure that the does not take unilateral action which would prevent the court from providing effective relief to the movant should the movant prevail on the merits.
midwest argues that the district court injunction disrupted the status quo between the parties because it compelled midwest to cease selling beltronics products on ebay.it thus contends that the district court was required to examine with extra scrutiny whether beltronics is substantially likely to prevail on the merits of its trademark infringement claim.we need not decide this question,however,because even assuming the heightened standard applies in this case,beltronics has met its burden.
trademark infringement claim 
under of the lanham act,t he unauthorized use of any reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of a registered mark in a way that is likely to cause confusion in the marketplace concerning the source of the different products constitutes trademark infringement.first sav.bank,first bank system,cir citing a.thus,the central inquiry in a trademark infringement case is the likelihood of consumer confusion.see team tires plus,tires plus,cir see also australian gold,hatfield,at the party alleging infringement has the burden of proving likelihood of confusion.midwest argues that the district court erred both legally and factually in determining that midwest sale of beltronics radar detectors is likely to cause confusion in the marketplace.first,midwest claims that its sale of radar detectors under the beltronics trademark is protected by the first sale doctrine and the district court committed an error of law in concluding otherwise.alternatively,midwest argues that even if the first sale doctrine does not apply,the district court determination that its disclosure to consumers was insufficient to alleviate confusion involved errors of both law and fact.we evaluate each of these claims in turn.
first sale doctrine 
those who resell genuine trademarked products are generally not liable for trademark infringement.see davidoff cie,pld int l,cir nec elecs.cal circuit abco,cir.the reason is that trademark law is designed to prevent sellers from confusing or deceiving consumers about the origin or make of a product,which confusion ordinarily does not exist when a genuine article bearing a true mark is sold.nec,at citing prestonettes,coty.see also united states giles,cir t he purpose of trademark law is to guarantee that every item sold under a trademark is the genuine trademarked product,and not a substitute.quoting speicher,cir.accordingly,under the first sale doctrine,the right of a producer to control distribution of its trademarked product does not extend beyond the first sale of the product.australian gold,at cir quotations omitted.in our circuit only case evaluating this doctrine in connection with a lanham act claim,we observed that the essence of the first sale doctrine is that a purchaser who does no more than stock,display,and resell a producer product under the producer trademark violates no right conferred upon the producer by the lanham act.id.at quotations omitted.
it logically follows that the first sale doctrine is not applicable when an alleged infringer sells trademarked goods that are materially different than those sold by the trademark owner.davidoff,at.a materially different product is not genuine and may generate consumer confusion about the source and the quality of the trademarked product.see gamut trading int l trade comm n,iberia foods romeo,cir we hold,as other federal circuit courts have held,that the unauthorized resale of a materially different trademarked product can constitute trademark infringement.see brilliance audio,haights cross commc ns,cir davidoff,at iberia foods,at martin herend imports,diamond gem trading usa,cir societe des produits nestle,casa helvetia,cir original appalachian artworks,granada,cir 
we emphasize that not all differences are material.see davidoff,at.some differences between products prove so minimal that consumers who purchase the alleged infringer goods get precisely what they believed they were purchasing and consumers perceptions of the trademarked goods are not likely to be affected by the alleged infringer sales.iberia foods,at quotations and citations omitted.a guiding principle in evaluating whether a difference between two products bearing the same trademark is material is whether the difference confuses consumers and impinges on the trademark holder goodwill.nestle,at.for this reason,the materiality analysis must be undertaken on a basis,see id.at,and must include an examination of the products and markets at issue.brilliance audio,at.although no mechanical process exists for determining the threshold for materiality,see nestle,at,a difference is material if consumers would consider it relevant to a decision about whether to purchase a product.davidoff,at.because many factors influence such considerations,the threshold must be kept low to include even subtle differences between products.id.we review de novo the question of whether differences between trademarked goods and goods sold by an alleged infringer are material.iberia foods,at.
in support of its argument that the first sale doctrine applies in this case,midwest contends that material differences are limited to differences in physical quality or in control procedures designed to ensure a trademarked product physical quality at the time of resale.it asserts that the absence of beltronics warranties and other services are collateral to the radar detectors physical quality,and therefore no material differences distinguish beltronics radar detectors from those sold by midwest.accordingly,midwest claims the first sale doctrine shields it from liability under the lanham act.
in evaluating this line of reasoning,we turn again to what we have called the essence of the first sale doctrine,which is that a purchaser who does no more than stock,display,and resell a producer product under the producer trademark violates no right conferred upon the producer by the lanham act.australian gold,at quotations omitted.in this case,it is undisputed that something more than stocking,displaying,and reselling radar detectors is at issue.additionally,although we have never had occasion to review whether differences in warranties or service commitments may constitute material differences,at least two federal circuit courts have held or observed that they may.see skf usa int l trade comm n,nestle,at.the federal circuit has held that physical material differences are not required to establish trademark infringement because trademarked goods originating from the trademark owner may have nonphysical characteristics associated with them,including services,such that the sale of similar goods lacking those associated characteristics may mislead the consumer and damage the owner goodwill.skf,at.similarly,the first circuit has observed that the appropriate test for materiality should not be strictly limited to physical differences,but should include other differences such as warranty protection or service commitments that may well render products in the relevant lanham act sense.nestle,at.we are aware of no federal circuit court that has held or observed otherwise when considering the specific question of whether material differences may include warranties and service commitments.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not commit an error of law in concluding that material differences may include the warranties and services associated with beltronics radar detectors.
midwest expresses concern about the policy implications for such a decision.it claims that this interpretation of the material difference exception to the first sale doctrine would permit any trademark owner to eliminate the resale of its goods,shut down its competitors,and ultimately fix the price of its product simply by limiting its warranty coverage and service commitments to those who buy from it directly.because under this scenario those who purchase a trademarked product from a reseller would not receive the same warranty and services as those who purchase from the trademark owner,midwest asserts the product would be materially different and all resellers would be unavoidably and invariably liable under the lanham act.
were the first sale doctrine the only legal principle shielding resellers from liability in this scenario,midwest argument might avail.see davidoff,at observing that the first sale doctrine does not hold true when an alleged infringer sells trademarked goods that are materially different than those sold by the trademark owner.however,the fact that the resale of a trademarked product that is materially different can constitute a trademark infringement,see id.at emphasis added,does not mean that it always does.the lanham act does not proscribe material differences per se it proscribes sales and offers for sale that are likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.a b.the purpose of the material difference test is to assist courts in determining whether allegedly infringing products are likely to cause confusion in the marketplace and undermine the goodwill the trademark owner has developed in its trademarked goods.see iberia foods,at nestle,at noting that the sale of materially different merchandise violates the lanham act because a difference in products bearing the same name confuses consumers and impinges on the trademark holder goodwill.so long as resellers of materially different products take the necessary steps to adequately alleviate this confusion and prevent injury to the trademark,for example,sufficiently disclosing that the product differs from the originally sold differences will be unlikely to trigger the liability midwest envisions.see king of the mountain sports,chrysler,cir likelihood of confusion forms the gravamen for a trademark infringement action.matrix essentials,emporium drug mart,cir explaining that in several cases where trademark infringement was associated with the resale of materially different goods,an essential element was that a consumer would not necessarily be aware of the differences and would thereby be confused or deceived.we therefore conclude that midwest policy argument is unavailing.
sufficiency of disclosure 
midwest argues that even if the beltronics radar detectors its sells are materially different than those sold by beltronics,midwest included a disclosure in its advertisements sufficient to shield it from liability.specifically,midwest offered into evidence a printout from an auction on ebay that contained the following statement
