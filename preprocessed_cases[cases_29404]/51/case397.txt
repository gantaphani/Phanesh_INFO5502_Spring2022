this appeal raises a number of trademark issues arising out of the use by uzi nissan of his last name for several business enterprises since,his use beginning in of nissan as part of the name of a north carolina computer store he computer his registration in of as a domain name and website for advertising various products including for a period in,products and services.nissan motor,a japanese automobile manufacturer that registered the mark nissan in,and its subsidiary,nissan north america,began using that name,rather than datsun,to identify and market their vehicles in the united states in.they filed this action in complaining that diluted the nissan mark under the federal trademark dilution act ftda,c,as well as the california analogue,cal.bus,and infringed it under the lanham act.
in a series of summary judgment rulings,the district court held that nissan computer advertising constituted trademark infringement on the basis of initial interest confusion,but that advertising did not.the court determined that nissan motor dilution suit was not barred by laches,that nissan computer first commercial use of nissan was in when it registered the website because that was the only use identical to the nissan mark,that by then nissan motor nissan mark had become famous,and that nissan computer use of dilutes the quality of nissan motor mark.accordingly,the court enjoined nissan computer and its alter ego,the internet center from posting any commercial content at and from placing links to other websites that contain disparaging remarks or negative commentary about nissan motor.
neither side is entirely happy and both appeal.on the main issues,we hold 
initial interest confusion exists as a matter of law as to nissan computer use of because use of the mark for automobiles captures the attention of consumers interested in nissan vehicles.to this extent trades on nissan motor goodwill in the nissan mark and infringes it,but other uses do not because there is no possibility of confusion as to them.
even though the nissan mark was distinctive and incontestable within five years of registration,it must also have become famous before nissan computer first commercial use in order to be entitled to protection against dilution.the first use for purposes of the ftda is that use which is arguably offending,here,nissan computer,because any commercial use of a famous mark is diluting regardless of whether it is confusing or combined with other identifiers.as such a use occurred in,and because the district court believed that triable issues of fact exist about fame of the nissan mark before,summary judgment on the dilution claim can not be sustained.
finally,to enjoin nissan computer from providing visitors to a link to sites with disparaging or negative commentary about nissan motor is a restriction on speech that is inconsistent with the first amendment.
as a result of our conclusion on these and other issues,we affirm in part on the infringement claim,reverse in part on the dilution claim,and remand.
it is uncontroverted that nissan motor and its subsidiary nissan north america,collectively,nissan motor have marketed and distributed automobiles in the united states since.nissan motor registered the nissan mark for ships and vehicles on the principal register in.vehicles were sold in the united states under the name datsun until,when nissan motor began marketing its vehicles under the name nissan.for a while the two names were used together,but since only the nissan name has been used.
uzi nissan used his last name for various businesses,including nissan foreign car mobile repair service,an business nissan international,and nissan computer established in to engage in the business of computer sales and services.on june,nissan computer registered the domain name and established a website at that address to advertise its goods and services.in july nissan motor sent nissan computer a letter expressing great concern about use of the word nissan in nissan computer domain name nissan computer made no response and nothing further happened until nissan motor contacted uzi nissan in october.
meanwhile,nissan computer registered to offer services as an internet service provider in.in august,it altered the website by adding a new logo with the name,sold space for advertising,and registered with a website for banner advertising.nissan computer received a payment for each time a user clicked through to an advertiser website.the first links in august and september were for,barnes noble,and.ads appeared in late september.within several weeks nissan computer signed up,and by december.com,and had been added.
in october,nissan motor told uzi nissan that it wished to purchase,but negotiations came to naught.this action was filed against nissan computer on december.the complaint asserts claims for trademark dilution in violation of federal and state law trademark infringement domain name piracy false designation of origin and unfair competition.nissan motor moved for a preliminary injunction,which the district court granted in a published opinion,nissan motor,nissan computer,d,and which we affirmed.the injunction ordered nissan computer to post prominent captions on the first web page of the and websites identifying them as affiliated with nissan computer corporation and disclaiming affiliation with nissan motor,and to refrain from displaying information,advertisements,and links.
in march,nissan computer posted a link on and that stated nissan motor lawsuit against nissan computer.clicking this link transferred the user to.a banner at stated we are being sued and included links entitled story,which contained uzi nissan description of this litigation,faq,news,which contained links to media reports,people opinions,which contained emails received by uzi nissan,and how you can help,which contained links via banner advertising,including a link to a site operated by the internet center tic,which had advertising.tic was owned and operated by uzi nissan,and was added as a defendant in nissan motor first amended complaint.
the district court resolved the action on for summary judgment.in summary,the court held that tic was an alter ego of nissan computer and that both tic and nissan computer are liable for trademark infringement on account of their use of the nissan mark for links and for dilution.the court inferred from nissan computer altering the website in august to display advertising that it intended to confuse consumers.the court granted nissan computer motion for summary judgment on use of the website.
on the dilution claim,the court declined to bar nissan motor suit on account of laches because the internet was an emerging technology and nissan computer was not prejudiced by delay.the court initially found that the fame of the nissan mark was to be measured as of,when nissan computer was incorporated,and that there was a question of material fact whether the nissan mark was famous as of that date.however,in a later ruling that granted judgment to nissan motor,the court determined fame as of when nissan computer first used the nissan mark alone because that is the use that nissan motor disputes,and as of when tic did.applying the fame factors set out in the ftda,c,the court concluded that the nissan mark was famous at the time that nissan computer registered the domain name in.it held that nissan computer use of the nissan mark diluted the quality of that mark by blurring its ability to distinguish nissan motor goods from other companies products and by tarnishing it because the look and design of the website falls short of the high standards that nissan motor sets for itself,and because the site posts disparaging remarks about nissan motor and this lawsuit.accordingly,the court concluded that nissan motor is entitled to an injunction that prohibits commercial content at the and sites.although it declined to preclude uzi nissan from using the site for personal purposes,the court decided that disparaging remarks and negative commentary posted on the sites or through links are sufficiently commercial to bring use of the domain names within the scope of the ftda because critical commentary at those sites,where the domain name is the mark,exploits the goodwill of nissan motor in the nissan mark.therefore,the court permanently enjoined nissan computer and tic from posting commercial content,advertising,and disparaging remarks or negative commentary regarding nissan motor on or and placing links to other websites containing commercial content or disparaging remarks and negative commentary about nissan motor.d.the district court subsequently denied nissan computer request for a stay,explaining that it is the coupling of disparaging remarks with visitors expectations of finding nissan motor that makes the enjoined conduct commercial and that the first amendment is not implicated because the domain names are source identifiers and not part of the communicative message.we denied a request for a stay as well.
these followed.nissan computer and tic appeal the judgment in nissan motor favor on laches,dilution,retroactivity of the ftda,alter ego,and infringement as to use of.nissan computer appeals the permanent injunction nissan motor,asking that the injunction be broadened to include transfer of the domain names and to itself in exchange for the fair value of nissan computer investment 
we start with the dilution claim because this is where the parties focus most of their attention.
four preliminary issues can be summarily resolved.first,the parties disagree about the relevant statute of limitations and whether nissan motor delay in bringing this action presumptively constituted laches.we need not address their arguments,however,because regardless,the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that nissan computer was not prejudiced.see jarrow formulas,nutrition now,cir stating that laches will not apply unless the defendant will suffer prejudice from delay if the suit were to proceed.
second,nissan computer argues that the ftda should not be applied retroactively because by the time it was passed in,uzi nissan had been using nissan for years,nissan computer had been using it for nearly five years,and had been up and running for months.however,application of the ftda is not retroactive because it only authorizes prospective relief.landgraf usi film products,d.three circuits have so held,and we join them.see westchester media prl usa holdings,cir sporty farm sportsman market,cir viacom ingram,cir.
third,nissan computer argues that the district court violated due process by changing the date for determining fame of the nissan mark from it had used in denying partial summary judgment in,which it used in its final order granting summary judgment.however,the issue had been fully briefed and final judgment had not been entered.the court had discretion to see things differently without affronting due process.
finally,tic contends that it is not an alter ego of nissan computer just because they are related companies,share resources,and exchange loans.the district court considered the appropriate factors,see ua local norcal plumbing,cir,and correctly concluded that the separate identity of each was not respected,and that sufficient injustice could occur to nissan motor from tic misuse of the corporate form to permit nissan computer to capitalize on the nissan mark while rendering itself judgment proof.
i njunctive relief is available under the federal trademark dilution act if a plaintiff can establish that its mark is famous the defendant is making commercial use of the mark in commerce the defendant use began after the plaintiff mark became famous avery dennison sumpton,cir,and there is actual harm to the trademark holder,moseley secret catalogue,d.noncommercial use of a mark is excepted.see c b.
the ftda grandfathering clause lies at the heart of this dispute.it provides 
the owner of a famous mark shall be entitled,subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court deems reasonable,to an injunction against another person commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name,if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark,and to obtain such other relief as is provided in this subsection.
in nissan computer view,the first use principle requires that fame be measured as of the defendant actual first use of the mark,not the use that the plaintiff finds objectionable.this would be no later than,when nissan computer was incorporated and used the name to sell computers not surprisingly,nissan motor has a different view,that the date to determine famousness of its nissan mark is the first time that nissan computer used nissan by itself as a trade or company name instead of as a composite trade or company name.this would be,when nissan computer registered as a domain name and opened a website for advertising.nissan motor points out that the text of the statute refers to such use,which nissan motor interprets to mean not just any the commercial use in commerce of a mark.drawing on the rule from trademark infringement law,nissan motor also posits that use of nissan by itself is a different commercial use in commerce of the nissan mark than is nissan computer.
we believe such use for purposes of c is a use that,assuming it occurs after another mark has become famous,would arguably dilute the mark.this follows from the text of the statute as well as its purpose.the ftda protects the holder of a trademark from dilution,which is different from,and broader than,infringement in that neither confusion nor competition is required and the protection is nationwide in scope.see avery,at.dilution is the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services,regardless of the presence or absence of competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties,or likelihood of confusion,mistake,or deception.as the supreme court explained,the purpose of the ftda is to protect famous trademarks from subsequent uses that blur the distinctiveness of the mark or tarnish or disparage it,even in the absence of a likelihood of confusion.moseley,at.quoting,cong,pp.dilution refers to the whittling away of the value of a trademark when it used to identify different products.mattel,mca records,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.because protection from dilution comes close to being a right in gross,it is a cause of action reserved for a select class of marks with such powerful consumer associations that even uses can impinge on their value.avery dennison,at.for this reason,the ftda extends dilution protection only to those whose mark is a household name.thane int,trek bicycle,cir.
t he mark used by the alleged diluter must be identical,or nearly identical,to the protected mark for a dilution claim to succeed.id.at.this means that the mark itself must be identical,or nearly identical,not that it can not be used in combination with some other identifier.for example,as the report of the subcommittee on courts and intellectual property of the house judiciary committee observes of the ftda,the use of dupont shoes,buick aspirin,and kodak pianos would be actionable under this legislation.see moseley,at.citing.no,cong.admin.news,pp,thane,at,citing the same examples in the senate report,at,reprinted in.we conjured others in mattel,f or example,tylenol snowboards,netscape sex shops and harry potter dry cleaners would all weaken the commercial magnetism of these marks and diminish their ability to evoke their original associations.these uses dilute the selling power of these trademarks by blurring their uniqueness and singularity,by tarnishing them with negative associations.at internal quotations and citations omitted.
the point of dilution law is to protect the owner investment in his mark.see,thane,at.this is why it is actionable for a store to call itself kodak pianos,as well as kodak.as the use of kodak pianos would dilute kodak,then nissan pianos would dilute nissan if the nissan mark were as famous as kodak.it follows that nissan computers is a use that arguably dilutes the nissan mark.whether it does in fact,of course,depends upon whether the capacity of the nissan mark to identify and distinguish goods or services sold by nissan motor has been lessened however,for purposes of settling the date by which fame must be measured,nissan computer use of the nissan mark is arguably diluting even though the word nissan is used in combination with another identifier.see mattel,at holding that barbie girl diluted mattel barbie mark see also moseley,at.suggesting that the evidence required to prove dilution may differ depending upon whether the junior and senior marks are identical.in sum,just as the tylenol mark,the barbie mark,and the kodak mark are used in commerce when snowboards,girl,and pianos are added,the nissan mark is used in commerce when other words are added to it such that if nissan were a famous mark,then nissan computer could be a dilutive commercial use.
the federal circuit recently considered,and rejected,a statutory argument similar to nissan motor,and to the view taken by the district court,that the use that matters for purposes of c is the first use that the trademark holder finds objectionable.in enterprise advantage,enterprise challenged advantage use of the phrase we even pick you up in television commercials broadcast in san antonio,texas between and as diluting its own phrases pick the company that picks you up and pick enterprise,we pick you up,which enterprise began using in.enterprise contended that prior use by advantage in a limited geographic area did not bar its claim of dilution.the court recognized that the term such use in c could refer to any use by the defendant in commerce,or could refer to the particular use being challenged in the litigation.id.at.it held that the latter was not a tenable reading of the statute,and that the statute reference to such use must refer to any use in commerce.id.at.we agree that this is a more sensible construction.as the federal circuit explained,it is significant that there is no qualification in the statute requiring that the defendant prior use be substantial or cover a wide geographic area to defeat an injunction under the statute.id.at.if it were otherwise,and first use for purposes of c turned on whatever use the mark owner finds particularly objectionable,o wners of famous marks would have the authority to decide when an allegedly diluting use was objectionable,regardless of when the party accused of diluting first began to use the mark.the network network cbs.
nissan motor reliance on the rule is also unhelpful.that doctrine prescribes that a composite mark is tested for its validity and distinctiveness by looking at it as a whole,rather than dissecting it into its component parts.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed,walt disney,cir i t is the mark in its entirety that must be simply individual elements of that mark.citation omitted.however,our task here is not to test distinctiveness but to determine famousness.
accordingly,we hold that any commercial use of a famous mark in commerce is arguably a diluting use that fixes the time by which famousness is to be measured.in this respect as in others,a dilution claim differs from a claim for infringement,because not all uses of a mark are actionable.see interstellar starship,epix,cir explaining why companies using the same mark for different products with different consumer expectations may not cause initial interest confusion.for purposes of the ftda,however,the commercial use of nissan for computers in nissan computer was a use of the nissan mark in commerce that was arguably diluting.such use occurred in.therefore,fame of the nissan mark must be measured as of.
nissan motor argues that even if the fame of its mark must be measured as of rather than,reversal is not required because the nissan mark was also famous as of.however,the district court found that there were triable issues of fact when it was of the view that fame should be determined as of.the record is not so clear that we can affirm notwithstanding the district court conclusion.
the ftda lists eight factors for a court to consider in determining whether a mark is distinctive and famous.they are 
a the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark 
b the duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the goods or services with which the mark is used 
c the duration and extent of advertising and publicity of the mark 
d the geographical extent of the trading area in which the mark is used 
e the channels of trade for the goods or services with which the mark is used 
f the degree of recognition of the mark in the trading areas and channels of trade used by the mark owner and the person against whom the injunction is sought 
g the nature and extent of use of the same or similar marks by third parties and 
h whether the mark was registered or on the principal register.
without going into detail because we must remand in any event,there is no question that the nissan mark is distinctive because it became incontestable five years after being registered,yet to be capable of being diluted,a mark must have a degree of distinctiveness and strength beyond that needed to serve as a trademark.avery dennison,at citations and quotations omitted emphasis added.f amousness requires more than mere distinctiveness.id.at.
nissan motor introduced evidence through surveys,studies,and expert opinion that the nissan mark had considerable public recognition,however nissan computer questioned their methodology and import,and we have no ruling on these issues from the district court.for example,an survey found that nissan enjoyed awareness among consumers in,in,and in,but nissan computer experts counter that the survey measured only the attitude of people who intended to buy a new car,thereby skewing the results in favor of nissan motor,and claim that there are methodological errors in the survey analysis.the same applies to the landor research survey,which concluded that nissan motor was one of the most powerful brands in america in nissan computer experts point out that the survey was a newspaper account without a description of methodology,universe of respondents,or statistical reliability of results.another public opinion survey that reported consumer familiarity with nissan was conducted between and january and spoke as of that time frame,which sheds no light on public perception in.although nissan motor promotional expenditures for vehicles bearing the nissan than million during the period in its favor,we can not say as a matter of law,on this record,that the survey,expert,and advertising evidence permit only the conclusion that the nissan mark was famous as of.
the record is further clouded by what it shows about the word nissan and its use.nissan is a common last name,a biblical term originally identifying the first month in the calendar,the contemporary name of the seventh month in the jewish calendar,the arabic word for april,and is part of the trademark or trade name of more than unaffiliated businesses in the united states including nissan thermos,nissan chemical,and nissan fire and marine insurance company.the word nissan is an acronym in japanese for japanese industries kk.nissan motor itself is a party to a trademark basic agreement with nissan chemical,nissan agriculture and forestry,nippon oxygen,nippon fisheries,and nippon oil and fat,in which each agrees to cooperate to ensure the proper use and protection of the nissan related trademark.and there are thousands of domain names that use the word nissan.all of this is relevant,because when a mark is in widespread use,it may not be famous for the goods or services of one business.avery dennison,at quoting trademark review commission,report recommendation,trademark.that other unaffiliated companies use nissan in their names at a minimum raises a question whether the mark can be considered a famous mark eligible for dilution protection.see id.stating that widespread use of the mark in the name of other companies makes fame unlikely.
in sum,we can not say on this record that genuine issues of material fact do not exist as to the degree of distinctiveness of the nissan mark,the weight to be given and the conclusions to be drawn from the experts reports and surveys,the impact of third party uses of nissan,and the overall fame of the nissan mark in.
after the district court final decision in this case,the supreme court held in moseley v secret catalogue,d,that actual dilution must be shown for a dilution claim to succeed.based on moseley,nissan computer and tic argue that summary judgment on the ftda claim must be reversed because nissan motor presented no evidence of actual harm to the nissan mark.nissan motor argues otherwise,relying on moseley statement that direct evidence of dilution such as consumer surveys will not be necessary if actual dilution can reliably be proved through circumstantial obvious case is one where the junior and senior marks are identical.id.at.however,it is not entirely clear what the court meant by this,see ty softbelly,cir,and appellate review would be aided by a record developed in light of moseley and the district court analysis of it.therefore,we follow the lead of horphag research pellegrini,cir,and remand to give the district court an opportunity to consider in the first instance whether there has been actual dilution within the meaning of moseley.
nissan motor also urges that remand is not necessary because the california analogue of the ftda,cal.bus.affords another basis upon which to affirm.however,the district court granted injunctive relief entirely under the ftda.we prefer to hear from the district court in the first instance on this as well.the california analogue has generally been construed consistently with federal law,and no argument has been made to us about whether,or how,moseley might affect what the california supreme court would do.in addition,nissan computer has claimed on appeal that a nationwide injunction for violation of state law is inappropriate and unconstitutional.see,enterprise,at a federal dilution statute is necessary because famous marks ordinarily are used on a nationwide basis and dilution protection is currently only available on a system of protection further,court decisions have been inconsistent and some courts are reluctant to grant nationwide injunctions for violation of state law this simply encourages and increases the amount of litigation.quoting,at.while california courts have repeatedly held that they have authority to issue injunctions which have effect beyond the borders of california,duncan stuetzle,cir,this remains an open question in this circuit.id.at.as we have no ruling before us,we leave the constitutionality of a nationwide injunction based on state law for another day and remand to the district court to consider,if necessary,whether it would grant injunctive relief,or alter its scope,if the dilution liability were based solely on california law.
nissan computer seeks relief from the provision of the permanent injunction that restrains it from placing links on and to other websites containing disparaging remarks or negative commentary about nissan motor.it contends that such speech is,thus not diluting under the ftda.nissan computer also maintains that the disclaimer ordered in the preliminary injunction is sufficient to assure there is no dilution.finally,it submits that the injunction does not control the uses of the domain names but instead,prohibits a particular type of content posted at the website.
nissan motor argues that we need not revisit nissan computer first amendment challenge to the permanent injunction because we already considered and rejected it by denying nissan computer motion to stay.we disagree,as the standards for a stay differ from the review on the merits that is now before us beyond this,nissan motor defends the injunction as narrowly tailored,arguing that it restricts use of just two websites identical to the nissan mark.these restrictions,in its view,constitute regulation of nothing more than domain names that do not express or communicate any views at all.for this reason,nissan motor asks us to hold that the first amendment is not implicated because it is only when a trademark is used as part of a communicative message and not as a source identifier which is what a domain name functions as in cyberspace that the first amendment is implicated.we disagree with this as well.
prohibiting nissan computer from placing links to other sites with disparaging commentary goes beyond control of the nissan name as a source identifier.the injunction does not enjoin use of,but enjoins certain content on the website.thus,it is not the source identifier that is controlled,but the communicative message that is constrained.consequently,the first amendment is implicated.
the prohibited use of the mark is a restriction because the purpose behind it is to control the message and it is not justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.see,ward rock against racism,d citation and quotation omitted.regulations pass constitutional muster only if they are the least restrictive means to further a compelling interest,county of clark,cir citing sable communications of cal,d.as a restriction,the injunction is presumptively invalid,see city of paul,d,and not subject to a time,place,and manner analysis,see reno aclu,d.thus,it is immaterial whether there are alternative places on the web that negative commentary about nissan motor can be posted.the injunction is also viewpoint based because it only prohibits disparaging remarks and negative commentary.see,at.
the ftda anticipates the constitutional problem where the speech is not commercial but is potentially dilutive by including an exception for noncommercial use of a mark.see c b mattel,at recognizing that the noncommercial use exemption in the ftda was designed to prevent courts from issuing injunctions that collide with the first amendment.so,the relevant question is whether linking to sites that contain disparaging comments about nissan motor on the website is commercial.
although the boundary between commercial and speech has yet to be clearly delineated,the core notion of commercial speech is that it does no more than propose a commercial transaction.mattel,at quoting hoffman capital,cir quotation marks omitted.if speech is not purely commercial that is,if it does more than propose a commercial it is entitled to full first amendment protection.id.negative commentary about nissan motor does more than propose a commercial transaction and is,therefore.
nissan motor argues that disparaging remarks or links to websites with disparaging remarks at is commercial because the comments have an effect on its own commerce.see jews for jesus brodsky,the conduct of the defendant also constitutes a commercial use of the mark and the name of the plaintiff organization because it is designed to harm the plaintiff organization commercially by disparaging it and preventing the plaintiff organization from exploiting the mark and the name of the plaintiff organization.however,we have never adopted an effect on commerce test to determine whether speech is commercial and decline to do so here.
we are persuaded by the fourth circuit reasoning in a similar case involving negative material about skippy peanut butter posted on,a website hosted by the owner of the trademark skippy for a cartoon comic strip.cpc,which makes skippy peanut butter,successfully sought an injunction that ordered removal of the material.the court of appeals reversed.cpc int l,skippy,cir.recognizing that criticism was vexing to cpc,the court emphasized how important it is that trademarks not be transformed from rights against unfair competition to rights to control language.id.at quoting mark lemley,the modern lanham act and the death of common sense,yale.it held that speech critical of cpc was informational,not commercial speech.likewise here,links to negative commentary about nissan motor,and about this litigation,reflect a point of view that we believe is protected.
nissan motor relies on san francisco arts athletics,usoc,d,to argue that it has obtained a limited property right in the nissan mark which nissan computer does not have a first amendment right to appropriate to itself.in that case,the court held that the amateur sports act of did not unconstitutionally prohibit certain commercial and promotional uses of the word olympic
