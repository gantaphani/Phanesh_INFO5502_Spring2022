in this trademark case,we must decide whether jobdiva,used its marks in connection with personnel placement and recruitment services,or whether the trademark trial and appeal board correctly held that jobdiva failed to do so because it used its marks on software offerings,without more.the board required jobdiva to prove that it used its marks on more than just software because its software sales alone could not,in the board view,constitute personnel and recruitment services.we disagree with the board approach.the proper question is whether jobdiva,through its software,performed personnel placement and recruitment services and whether consumers would associate jobdiva registered marks with personnel placement and recruitment services,regardless of whether the steps of the service were performed by software.because the board must visit that question in the first instance,we vacate its decision and remand for further consideration.

jobdiva software generally provides a database of employment applications that a hiring manager or recruiter might use to fill a job opening.the software performs multiple functions to facilitate this process.it employs automated harvesters to find potential job candidates by automatically scraping job boards and aggregating relevant resumes.and it reviews and analyzes job candidates resumes to determine if any candidate qualifications match the job requirements.it thus replaces a tedious manual search previously performed by hiring managers or recruiters.jobdiva also helps hiring managers directly communicate with job candidates.for instance,it permits hiring managers to post job openings in a job candidate portal.this candidate portal may also be embedded into a company website.the software further assists job candidates by recommending potential openings to the candidates based on skillsets and provides them automated resume feedback.
in many circumstances,jobdiva renders these offerings on a,or saas,basis to its customers.as the board explained,software as a service saas leverages software by delivering it over the internet.jobdiva,jobvite,cancellation,wl,at may,jobdiva rehearing.the board noted that saas is also known as cloud computing.id.at.cloud computing,according to the board,is defined as computing operations carried out on servers that are accessed through the internet,rather than on one own personal computers.id.at quoting dictionary of computer and internet terms ed.by hosting its software remotely,jobdiva provides its clients a product without the need to download cumbersome software onto office desktops or laptops.
as the board explained,jobdiva saas model of software delivery also changes the way that users interact with jobdiva the users pay for the computing as a service rather than owning the machines and software to do it.jobdiva rehearing,wl,at quoting dictionary of computer and internet terms,supra,at.unlike a locally installed software program,which might be downloaded from the internet or a disk,jobdiva software resides on remote servers and customers access it via the internet.
the board cancelled jobdiva marks in a proceeding that jobdiva originally requested.jobdiva initially petitioned the board to cancel a registration owned by jobvite,which is no longer a party to this case.jobdiva asserted,inter alia,a likelihood of confusion between jobvite and jobdiva service marks.to establish its claim,jobdiva asserted ownership of its two marks introduced above.
jobvite counterclaimed,petitioning the board to cancel jobdiva trademark registrations by alleging that jobdiva failed to perform personnel placement and recruitment services.jobvite requested that the board cancel the registration in whole and its registration in part.notably,jobvite did not submit affirmative evidence of abandonment or challenge that jobdiva used the registration to identify the other services specified in its registration.
the board granted jobvite counterclaim,cancelling the registration in whole and the registration in part.jobdiva,jobvite,cancellation,wl.the board explained that under section of the trademark act,a mark shall be deemed to be abandoned w hen its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use.id.at quoting.
the board started its analysis of jobdiva use of its marks by defining the scope of jobdiva registrations for personnel placement and recruitment services and consulting dictionary definitions for each word.id.at.combining these definitions,the board found that personnel placement and recruitment meant that jobdiva is finding and placing people in jobs at other companies or providing personnel staffing services for others.id.
to prove its use of the marks in connection with personnel placement and recruitment,jobdiva had submitted screenshots from its website and a declaration of its ceo,diya obeid.but the board found jobdiva evidence insufficient,explaining that t here was no reference to petitioner performance of personnel placement and recruitment services other than supplying petitioner software.id.the board concluded that,s ince there is no evidence of use of petitioner marks in connection with personnel placement and recruitment services,there has been nonuse for three consecutive years.id.the board therefore cancelled the registration in whole and amended the registration to delete personnel placement and recruitment.id.
jobdiva petitioned the board to reconsider its judgment,arguing that the board made erroneous findings of fact because there is abundant evidence of record that shows petitioner providing the service of finding and placing people in jobs at other companies or providing personnel staffing services for others.jobdiva rehearing,wl,at.the board again disagreed,finding that jobdiva had failed to prove use of its marks for personnel placement and recruitment services.
the board explained that a term that only identifies a computer program does not become a service mark merely because the program is sold or licensed in commerce.id.at.such a mark does not serve to identify a service unless it is also used to identify and distinguish the service itself,as opposed to the program.id.the board counseled,however,that it is important to review the record carefully to determine the manner of use of the mark and the impression it is likely to make on purchasers.id.
the board found jobdiva evidence of use insufficient because jobdiva only provided software,but not additional personnel placement and recruitment services.the board explained that it looked for evidence that petitioner was rendering personnel placement and recruitment services for others rather than merely providing a software solution for clients to use in performing their personnel placement and recruitment activities.id.the board criticized jobdiva for confus ing the service of providing a software solution for personnel placement and recruitment with actually rendering personnel placement and recruitment services.id.at.the board repeatedly faulted jobdiva evidence as provi
