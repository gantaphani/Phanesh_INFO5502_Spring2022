these three consolidated appeals arise out of the improper use of a model image to package and promote a home entertainment system.the model,plaintiff ting ji ji,although successful at trial as to liability,insists that a new trial as to damages is necessary to cure the district court purported errors in refusing to compel discovery and instructing the jury.the maker of the entertainment system,defendant bose corporation bose,and ji photographer,defendant,white,contest other rulings of the district court in their respective.
after careful review,we affirm in all respects.
background 
in,ji participated in a photo shoot for which she was paid.on the same day,she signed two documents in connection with the shoot.the first was her modeling agency voucher voucher that confirmed her attendance at the shoot and entitled her to payment.the voucher included a release assigning limited use of ji photos among other things,the release prohibited the use of images for packages,point of purchase,and displays.the second instrument that ji signed was white adult release release,which included a broad release that assigned the absolute right and permission to use ji images for any purpose whatsoever.
thinking that it had secured a total of ji images based on the release,white conveyed the images to bose.bose selected one of those images for the packaging of its series ii dvd home entertainment system the system and related promotional media.the image bose selected featured the system with ji partially embracing a male model as they watched television from a couch.the photo was taken from behind the couch,exposing the back of ji head and little of her face as a result,ji is barely recognizable.bose placed the image on the upper corner of each side of the system packaging.
after ji discovered her image while perusing a best buy store,she sued bose in federal district court in florida.she asserted a false endorsement claim under a of the lanham act,a,a claim under florida statutes,and a claim for invasion of privacy.bose successfully moved to transfer the case to federal district court in massachusetts,where it is based.ji amended her complaint to assert an additional claim for unfair trade practices under.laws ch.she also added white as a defendant.bose then filed against white for breach of contract,misrepresentation,indemnification,and contribution.
during discovery,ji sought financial information from bose,including sales data concerning its system,on the ground that she needed that information to prove damages under the lanham act.bose objected because,as a private company,its financial information,and particularly information concerning its sales,was sensitive and closely guarded.bose also argued that discovery concerning such information should await the district court ruling on bose pending and potentially dispositive motion for partial summary judgment on ji lanham act claim.the district court agreed and postponed discovery.
the court eventually granted bose partial summary judgment motion and dismissed ji lanham act claim.of the factors that courts have found necessary to prove false endorsement under the lanham act,the district court concluded that ji could at best prove two and that six leaned decidedly in bose favor.see downing abercrombie fitch,cir listing factors in false endorsement case.of critical importance to the district court,ji did not show,nor could the court credibly infer,that her identity or mark,in trademark parlance was familiar to bose target audience.
despite this setback,and the specter that her extant discovery requests would be fruitless,ji again moved to compel production of bose financial information.this time ji argued that she still needed that information in order to prove damages on her claim because florida law entitled her,if successful,to a reasonable royalty.stat.the district court initially denied the motion.on further reflection,however,the court granted it in part and ordered bose to produce information sufficient for ji to inform the jury of the extent of bose use of her image 
this court has previously ruled that the reasonable royalty language in.stat.provides for recovery of compensatory damages which does not implicate the net worth of the defendant.nevertheless,the plaintiff may reasonably argue that her fair compensation,should she prove a violation of the statute,ought to depend,to some degree,upon bose usage of her image.
bose will,therefore,produce to ji information sufficient for her to inform the jury of the extent of its use of the subject photographs.such information includes,to the extent that it is available,the number of unit boxes on which her image appeared,the number of displays that were produced in the years in which her image was in use and the number of promotional that were distributed in the advertisement of the system.bose will not be required to produce sales figures with respect to its system unless no other metric,such as those indicated in the preceding sentence,is ascertainable.
after the close of discovery,bose and white moved for summary judgment on ji florida claims.they asserted,and ji agreed,that her florida claims hinged on a question of contract interpretation whether the voucher or the release controlled bose rights with respect to the images of ji taken by white.bose and white argued that the release controlled because the voucher left essential terms blank and was therefore unenforceable.ji countered that the absence of some terms in the voucher did not invalidate it.according to ji,the voucher controlled because it was executed earlier in time.at the very least,ji argued,the question was more appropriate for the jury because it involved competing accounts of the parties intentions.viewing both contracts together,the district court concluded that it was unclear from the plain language which controlled the dispute.because the parties submitted conflicting extrinsic evidence,and had retained expert witnesses in part to opine on this precise question,the district court denied summary judgment.
the case proceeded to trial.after four days of argument and testimony,the jury found that bose violated ji publicity and privacy rights under florida law but awarded her only a fraction of her million demand the jury also found that white was liable to bose for the award.
after judgment entered,bose moved for attorneys fees on ji unsuccessful false endorsement claim under an express provision in the lanham act,a t he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorneys fees to the prevailing party,and as a sanction for vexatious litigation under providing for attorneys fees in cases where an attorney unreasonably and vexatiously multiples the proceedings in any case.the district court denied the motion on the ground that ji false endorsement claim,while meritless,failed to satisfy the high standards under either statute for the imposition of attorneys fees.
all parties appealed.
ii.discussion 
these appeals raise three main issues.
measure of damages under florida statutes 
ji principal grievance is that the district court fundamentally misunderstood the measure of damages under as compensatory rather than royalty based.had the court correctly understood the law,ji argues,it should have compelled bose to produce sales data number of units sold,revenues,profits,rather than mere usage data number of units on which ji image appeared.ji contends that without sales data the jury could not calculate a percentage of sales,and therefore could not determine a reasonable royalty.ji also argues that the court omission of her proposed damages instruction was erroneous.even if the jury had the benefit of sales data,ji postulates,it still could not have determined a reasonable royalty because the court charge restricted any award to compensatory damages.according to ji,these errors require a new trial on damages 
we disagree.in doing so,we need not prophesy whether the florida supreme court would characterize damages under as compensatory or something else.instead,we take each of ji two arguments on their own terms and reject them.
motion to compel 
discovery orders ordinarily are reviewed for abuse of discretion.cusumano microsoft,cir.this standard is not,and we will not intervene without a clear showing of manifest injustice,that is,where the lower court discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.dennis osram sylvania,cir quoting modern cont occupational safety health review comm n,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a decision may be plainly wrong if it is based on an incorrect legal standard or a misapplication of the law.in re subpoena to witzel,cir.
section of the florida statutes provides 
the person whose likeness is used may bring an action to enjoin such unauthorized publication,printing,display or other public use,and to recover damages for any loss of injury sustained by reason thereof,including an amount which would have been a reasonable royalty,and punitive or exemplary damages.
stat.the statute does not define a reasonable royalty,or suggest what data is necessary to calculate what one might be in any particular set of facts.no opinion of the florida supreme court,or of florida lower appellate courts,does either.
ji argument that sales data are necessary to determine damages under is based on an unpublished decision of a florida federal district court,jackson grupo indus.hotelero,sa,dist.lexis,and an analogy to patent law.neither shows that the district court abused its discretion when it ordered bose to produce usage data in lieu of sales data.
in jackson,following a bench trial,the district court found that the coco bongo nightclub violated by misappropriating the likeness of entertainer curtis jackson cent and his mark short for guerilla unit,the nom de guerre of jackson group.id.at.as for damages under the statute,the district court observed that the reasonable royalty measure of damages is taken to mean more than simply a percentage of actual profits.the measure now,very simply,means the actual value of what has been appropriated.id.at emphasis supplied quoting university computing,cir.to ascertain what that value was,the district court turned to basic principles of florida law of damages the fundamental principle of the law of damages is that the person injured shall have fair and just compensation commensurate with the loss sustained in consequence of the defendant act which gives rise to the action.id.at quoting mci worldcom network servs.mastec,so d.framework in place,the district court determined that a payment of was a reasonable royalty for coco bongo misappropriation.id.at.
ji argues that the district court award in jackson was based on in royalty rate.not true.nowhere in its analysis of damages under did the district court mention,let alone consider,coco bongo sales.see id.at.it only did so in calculating damages on jackson successful lanham act claim.id.at jackson is entitled to an award of profits for the infringing use of his trademark only.compare,with section.stat.first emphasis supplied.here,unlike in jackson,ji lanham act claim was dismissed on summary judgment.
for similar reasons,ji reliance on the court statement in jackson,quoted above,that a reasonable royalty means more than simply a percentage of actual profits,is mistaken.id.at quoting university computing,at.judges expect their pronunciamentos to be read in context.in re olympic mills,cir quoting wisehart davis,cir internal quotation marks and alternation omitted.the fallacy in ji argument is readily apparent.if the court in jackson meant that profits were a component of a reasonable royalty,then why did it disregard coco bongo profits which were in the record when it determined damages under ji offers no reasonable explanation for this discrepancy.
ji analogy to patent law measures of damages suffers a similar,but much quicker,fate.whatever the variety of approaches under patent law,see,university computing,at,the language of the federal statute is different and there is no basis to assume that was meant to have the same meaning.
all in all,it is enough that ji has failed to submit reliable indicia that the florida supreme court would consider sales data as necessary components of a reasonable royalty under.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in compelling bose to produce usage data instead.
if we had any doubts about this conclusion we do not,ji failure to show prejudice resulting from the district court order would remove them.as discussed,the district court ordered bose to tell ji the number of unit boxes on which her image appeared.bose thereafter told ji,via a supplemental interrogatory response,that ji image appeared on approximately units of the system.based on that data point,and record evidence that the system sold for per unit,ji expert witness,richard wolfe,an attorney specializing in entertainment law,was able to extrapolate that bose gross revenues from the system were as high as about million.applying a rate of between a half percent and one percent of that figure,wolfe testified at trial that in his opinion a reasonable usage fee which he equated with a royalty would be between million and million at closing,ji counsel,specifically referencing wolfe testimony,argued that the jury should award ji a million fee based on a rate 
ji argues that although wolfe was able to extrapolate maximum potential revenues based on the number of units bose packaged,he could not determine actual revenues without knowing how many of those units bose sold.this is,of course,true.but this could not have prejudiced ji.the number of units bose sold would have to be equal to or,more likely,less than the number of units bose packaged.therefore,the usage fee ji expert recommended was the upper end of a range based on what actual revenues could have been.actual revenues were probably less,but bose perhaps against its interest did not object and the jury was free to agree with wolfe.
jury instructions 
ji proposed the following two instructions,and others,to the district court 
proposed jury instruction if you find for the plaintiff on her claims for violation of right to publicity,you should award plaintiff an amount of money that the preponderance of the evidence shows will fairly and adequately compensate plaintiff for the damages she has sustained by virtue of bose appropriation and exploitation of plaintiff image without her express consent.if you find that the plaintiff has been injured by bose in violation of her rights under florida statute,she is entitled to receive damages from bose which may include a reasonable royalty.
proposed jury instruction a royalty can be established several different ways.one method of establishing a royalty is by the total amount of the sic bose profits resulting from its exploitation of plaintiff image.
at the charge conference,the district court stated that it would deliver the substance of proposed instruction but not 
i will give the substance of.however,bose objections have been noted,and the instructions will certainly be consistent with this court prior rulings.on,i am not going to give that.we tell the jury about what compensatory damages are but not how to calculate them.
ji counsel did not object.
the next day,the district court instructed the jury on damages as follows 
if you find that ji has proved her claim of a violation of her right to publicity,you may award her damages for any injury suffered as a result of that violation.that means that you must determine how much the plaintiff would have been paid for the uses to which bose eventually put her image,which is referred to in the law as compensatory damages.
the object of compensatory damages is to award the plaintiff the equivalent in money to any losses that she suffered.that requires you to consider all of the evidence and determine what would have been a fair value for the way that bose eventually used the plaintiff photographs.
at sidebar,before the case was sent to the jury,ji counsel objected to neither the district court instruction as delivered nor its omission of proposed instruction.
bose argues that ji failures to object result in waiver,or,alternatively,forfeiture of her instructional challenge.
the failure to object promptly and properly to an instruction generally forfeits an appellant right to object on appeal.see,nihon kohden,cir defendants did not object to the instruction and they therefore forfeited their right to object on appeal.see also.c a party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so on the record,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection.c b a party must object promptly after learning that the instruction or request will be,or has been,given or refused.our interpretation of rule is quite strict,at quoting connelly hyundai motor,cir internal quotation marks omitted.there is good reason for this strictness.we enforce our rules to compel litigants to afford the trial court an opportunity to cure a defective instruction and to prevent the litigants from ensuring a new trial in the event of an adverse verdict or diminutive damages award by covertly relying on the error.id.second alteration supplied quoting flynn ak peters,cir internal quotation marks omitted.forfeited objections may be reviewed for plain error only.id.
ji counters with a single argument.she urges us to recognize,as some circuits have done,a exception to rule that a party need not object when doing so would have been futile and unavailing.see,gulliford pierce county,cir where the district court is aware of the party concerns with an instruction,and further objection would be unavailing,we will not require a futile formal objection.according to ji,an objection would have been pointless because the district court was well aware of her position on damages in light of earlier motion practice.
we have in the past rejected similar attempts to excuse a party failure to object.see,elliott warren,f d,cir w e have held that strict compliance with rule is mandatory and that a failure of compliance will not be excused merely because the defaulting party brought the same matter to the trial judge attention more specifically at some other time.monomoy fisheries,bruno stillman yacht,cir rejecting party request to overlook its failure to object on the ground that an objection following the charge was unnecessary because its position on the issue of mitigation had previously been clearly made known to the court and it was evident that a further objection would have been unavailing.we did so,most recently,in gray genlyte group,cir,reh g denied,f d cir denying rehearing en banc despite urging to recognize a futility exception to rule.
in light of our precedent,our review of this claim is for plain error,cir.to obtain relief under this standard,the party claiming error must show an error,that is plain,obvious and clear under current law that is likely to alter the outcome,and that is sufficiently fundamental to threaten the fairness or integrity or public reputation of the judicial process.id.quoting connelly,at internal quotation marks omitted.the requirement that the error is likely to alter the outcome is particularly important in this context because a n erroneous jury instruction necessitates a new trial only if the error could have affected the result of the jury deliberations,at quoting allen chance,cir.
we need not linger on ji failure to satisfy these elements.the district court decision to omit ji proposed instruction a royalty can constitute a percentage of not plain error for the same reasons that its decision to order bose to produce usage data in lieu of sales data was not an abuse of discretion.see supra part.even if the omission were plain error it was not,ji has not shown that it likely altered the jury damages award.as discussed,ji testifying expert,wolfe,extrapolated bose revenues and opined that a reasonable usage fee in this case could be as high as million based on a rate.see supra part.the damages instruction that the district court the jury to consider all of the evidence and determine what would have been a fair value for the way that bose eventually used the plaintiff photographs compelled the jury to consider,rather than disregard,wolfe testimony.in this light,we struggle to see the probability that an additional instruction that royalties are sometimes calculated on the basis of sales would have resulted in a higher damages award 
we also think ji proposed instruction,supra,undermines her general critique that the district court misunderstood damages under as compensatory in nature.proposed instruction specifically requested an instruction on compensatory damages you should award plaintiff an amount of money that will fairly and adequately compensate plaintiff for the damages she has sustained and was substantially similar to the instruction that the district court delivered.
in sum,ji has not shown that the district court order partially granting her motion to compel constituted an abuse of discretion.nor has she shown that the district court omission of her proposed instruction constituted plain error or that it likely altered the damages award.a new trial on damages is therefore unwarranted.
challenge to summary judgment denial 
in their,bose and white argue that trial on ji and privacy claims should never have taken place in the first instance.they argue that the district court should have granted their motions for summary judgment on what they contend was a pure legal issue whether the voucher or the release controlled.if the voucher was unenforceable,as they claim,then the release controlled and through it ji relinquished all rights to her images.
we do not reach the merits of their argument because neither bose nor white properly preserved it in a motion for judgment as a matter of law 
generally,the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not reviewable after a full trial and final judgment on the merits.see,eastern platform tennis,cir lama borras,cir declining to address the defendants challenge because their attack on the denial of summary judgment has been overtaken by subsequent events,namely,a trial and an adverse jury verdict.the rationale for this rule has been based on the procedural fact that a denial of a motion for summary judgment is merely a judge determination that genuine issues of material fact exist.it is not a judgment,and does not foreclose trial on issues on which summary judgment was sought,at quoting glaros robertson.thus,in order to preserve its challenge for appeal,a disappointed party must restate its objection in a motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol.see id.at see also.if that too is unsuccessful,then the propriety of the district court denial of jmol is reviewable on appeal from final judgment,at.
we have not recognized an exception to this rule,as some circuits have done,when a party challenge is based on a circumscribed legal error,as opposed to an error concerning the existence of fact issues instead,our rule is that even legal errors can not be reviewed unless the challenging party restates its objection in a motion for jmol.see,ortiz velez,cir declining to review a party challenge to the district court denial of its motion for summary judgment based on a purported legal error concerning qualified immunity when that party failed to move for jmol mauser raytheon.pension plan for salaried employees,cir declining to review a party challenge to the district court denial of its motion for summary judgment based on a purported legal error concerning erisa liability when that party failed to move for jmol.
here,at the close of ji case,bose moved for jmol on the grounds that ji failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a violation of chapter,and that she did not consent to bose use of her image an element of both her and privacy claims.white moved on the former ground only.following the verdict,bose orally renewed its motion for jmol with regard to liability.white did the same.but at no point did either bose or white restate their challenge that the voucher was unenforceable as a matter of law.accordingly,we deem that challenge waived 
attorneys fees 
bose argues that the district court should have granted its motion for attorneys fees.according to bose,ji lanham act claim was fabricated,entirely groundless,and nothing more than a ruse to gain access to bose sensitive financial
