the radiance foundation published an article online entitled naacp national association for the abortion of colored people that criticized the naacp stance on abortion.in response to a letter from the naacp,radiance sought a declaratory judgment that it had not infringed any naacp trademarks.the naacp then filed counterclaims alleging trademark infringement and dilution.
the lanham act protects against consumer confusion about the source or sponsorship of goods or services.persons may not misappropriate trademarks to the detriment of consumers or of the marks themselves.however,the act reach is not unlimited.to find lanham act violations under these facts risks a different form of infringement that of radiance expressive right to comment on social issues under the first amendment.courts have taken care to avoid lanham act interpretations that gratuitously court grave constitutional concerns,and we shall do so here.we hold that radiance is not liable for trademark infringement or dilution of defendant marks by tarnishment.we vacate the injunction against radiance entered by the district court and remand with instructions that defendant counterclaims likewise be dismissed.
the national association for the advancement of colored people,better known by its acronym naacp,is this country oldest and largest civil rights organization,radiance,naacp,d,and one that holds a place of honor in our history.it champions political,educational,social,and economic equality of all citizens while working to eliminate racial and other forms of prejudice within the united states.id.since its formation,it has pursued these objectives not only through litigation but also through community outreach,informational services,and educational activities on issues of significance to the african american community.see id.the naacp owns several trademarks,among them naacp federally registered and national association for the advancement of colored people.
the radiance foundation,established by ryan bomberger,is also a organization focused on educating and influencing the public about issues impacting the african american community.radiance addresses social issues from a christian perspective.it uses as its platform two websites,and,where it posts articles on topics such as race relations,diversity,fatherlessness,and the impact of abortion on the black community.id.at.radiance also runs a billboard campaign for individuals may sponsor these billboards,licensing the artwork from radiance.in addition to its billboard campaign,radiance funds its endeavors through donations from visitors to its websites,which are facilitated by donate buttons on the webpages that link to a paypal site.
in january,bomberger authored an article criticizing the naacp annual image awards,entitled naacp national association for the abortion of colored people.see.the piece lambasted the naacp for sponsoring an awards event to recognize hollywood figures and products that radiance alleged defied christian values and perpetuated racist stereotypes.the article then criticized other of the naacp public stances and actions.it particularly targeted the naacp ties to planned parenthood and its position on abortion.though the naacp has often claimed to be neutral on abortion,radiance maintains that the naacp actions actually demonstrate support for the practice.
the article appeared on three websites the two owned by radiance and and a site called.though the text of the article was identical across the sites,the headlines and presentation varied slightly.on,directly below the headline was an image of a toomanyaborted billboard with the headline naacp national association for the abortion of colored people repeated next to it.id.the site posted the headline the national association for the abortion of colored people with a graphic below of a red box with the words civil wrong followed by the modified naacp name.id.at.adjacent to the article on both pages was an orange button with click here to give one time gift to the radiance foundation printed around the word donate.id.at.finally on,the site,the naacp scales of justice appeared as a graphic underneath the headline.id.at.
the naacp sent radiance a letter on january,after a google alert for the naacp mark unearthed the article.radiance thereupon brought a declaratory action seeking a ruling that it had not infringed or diluted any of the naacp marks and that its use of the marks,or similar ones,was protected under the first amendment.the naacp counterclaimed for trademark infringement under and a and virginia state law,and trademark dilution under c.
after a bench trial,the district court found for the naacp on all counterclaims and denied declaratory relief to radiance.it held that radiance had used the marks in connection with goods and services and that its use of the naacp and national association for the advancement of colored people marks,or a colorable imitation,created a likelihood of confusion among consumers.radiance,d at.
the district court also found that the use of the mark created a likelihood of dilution by tarnishment by associating the naacp and its marks with a position.id.at.the court found that radiance actions failed to qualify as fair use,news reporting,news commentary,or noncommercial use.radiance was accordingly deemed ineligible for those usages protected under the lanham act itself.id.at.
the district court issued a permanent injunction against any use by radiance of national association for the abortion of colored people that creates a likelihood of confusion or dilution.id.at.however,it declined to award any damages or attorney fees,as it found the naacp had failed to make the case that they were warranted.id.at.
radiance now appeals.we review a judgment following a bench trial under a mixed standard of findings may be reversed only if clearly erroneous,while conclusions of law,are examined de novo.roanoke cement falk,cir.for the reasons given below,we must reverse.the naacp does not have actionable claims for trademark infringement here,and radiance use of the naacp marks or colorable imitations falls squarely within the exceptions to trademark dilution specifically included in the lanham act to avoid encroaching on free speech rights.
we must first review briefly the lanham act principles relevant to this action.the lanham act provisions prohibiting trademark infringement,and a,exist to protect consumers from confusion in the marketplace.see qualitex jacobson prods,d.trademarks designate the source or affiliation of goods and services in order to provide consumers with information about those goods and services,allowing mark holders to build and benefit from the reputation of their brands.trademark infringement laws limit the ability of others to use trademarks or their colorable imitations in commerce,so that consumers may rely on the marks to make purchasing decisions.see cpc int l,skippy,cir the basic objectives of trademark law are to encourage product differentiation,promote the production of quality goods,and provide consumers with information about the quality of goods.
trademark protection,however,comes at a potential cost to free expression.much like advertising regulations that prohibit using false or misleading information,trademark infringement laws restrict speech in order to promote the government interest in protecting consumers from confusing misappropriations of product identifications.however,congress did not intend for trademark laws to impinge the first amendment rights of critics and commentators.lamparello falwell,cir.the lanham act and first amendment may be in tension at times,but they are not in conflict so long as the act hews faithfully to the purposes for which it was enacted.mattel,mca records,cir.the risk of impinging on protected speech is much greater when trademarks serve not to identify goods but rather to obstruct the conveyance of ideas,criticism,comparison,and social commentary.the canon of constitutional avoidance in this area is thus not a device of judicial evasion but an effort to reconcile the commercial values protected by the lanham act and the democratic value of expressive freedom.see rogers grimaldi,cir edward debartolo.gulf coast constr.trades council,d.
it is for this reason that an actionable trademark claim does not simply require that the alleged infringer used in commerce the mark that the trademark holder possesses.it also requires that the infringer use be in connection with goods or services in a manner that is likely to cause confusion among consumers as to the goods or services source or sponsorship.a a see people for the ethical treatment of animals doughney,cir peta united we stand,united we stand,am.new york,cir it poked fun at the plaintiff,but did not cause consumer confusion as to source or origin.emphasis added.use of a mark that does not satisfy these two criteria is not trademark infringement.lamparello,at.
the first element of trademark infringement at issue is thus whether radiance use of the naacp marks was in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services.a see also id.a requiring mark be used in connection with any goods or services.the naacp urges us to give this requirement a broad construction,appellee br.at,but that construction would expose to liability a wide array of noncommercial expressive and charitable activities.such an interpretation would push the lanham act close against a first amendment wall,which is incompatible with the statute purpose and stretches the text beyond its breaking point.we decline to reach so far.
at least five of our sister circuits have interpreted this element as protecting from liability all noncommercial uses of marks.farah esquire magazine,utah lighthouse ministry found.for apologetic info.research,cir bosley med,kremer,cir taubman webfeats,cir porous media pall,cir.but see united we stand,at.we have not taken a position on whether in connection with goods or services indicates a commercial use.lamparello,at.
at the very least,reading the in connection with element to take in broad swaths of noncommercial speech would be an overextension of the lanham act reach that would intrude on first amendment values.rogers,at see also taubman,at stating that the lanham act is constitutional because it only regulates commercial speech.it is true that neither of the lanham act infringement provisions explicitly mentions commerciality.lamparello,at.still,this provision must mean something more than that the mark is being used in commerce in the constitutional sense,because the infringement provisions in a and a include a separate commerce clause hook.bosley,at int l bancorp,llc societe des bains de mer et du cercle des estrangers a monaco,cir united we stand,at.
although this case does not require us to hold that the commercial speech doctrine is in all respects synonymous with the in connection with element,we think that doctrine provides much the best guidance in applying the act.the in connection with element in fact reads very much like a description of different types of commercial actions in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services.a emphasis added.
use of a protected mark as part of speech that does no more than propose a commercial transaction thus plainly falls within the lanham act reach.united states united foods,d.courts also look to the factors outlined in bolger youngs drug products,d whether the speech is an advertisement whether the speech references a particular good or service and whether the speaker the alleged infringer has a demonstrated economic motivation for his speech.greater balt.ctr.for pregnancy concerns,mayor of,cir en banc.these are not exclusive factors,and the presence or absence of any of them does not necessitate a particular result.
in the context of trademark infringement,the act purpose,as noted,is to protect consumers from misleading uses of marks by competitors.thus if in the context of a sale,distribution,or advertisement,a mark is used as a source identifier,we can confidently state that the use is in connection with the activity.even the second circuit,which rejected noncommerciality as an invariable defense to lanham act liability,conceded that a crucial factor is that the infringer us ed the mark not as a commentary on its owner,but instead as a source identifier.united we stand,at.the danger of allowing the in connection with element to suck in speech on political and social issues through some strained or tangential association with a commercial or transactional activity should thus be evident.courts have uniformly understood that imposing liability under the lanham act for such speech is rife with the first amendment problems.
finally,in order to determine whether the use is in connection with goods or services,we must consider what qualifies as a good or service.the lanham act does not directly define either term,but we can deduce their meaning from other defined terms and common usage.a good is best understood as a valuable product,physical or otherwise,that the consumer may herself employ.see noting that a mark may be used in commerce in relation to a good when placed on a good,its container,its tag,or its associated documents black law dictionary ed defining goods as t hings that have value,whether tangible or not.a service is a more amorphous concept,denot ing an intangible commodity in the form of human effort,such as labor,skill,or advice.black law dictionary.because congress intended the lanham act to protect consumers from confusion in the marketplace,it is probable that the act is meant to cover a wide range of products,whether goods or services.see yates united states,d ordinarily,a word usage accords with its dictionary definition.in law as in life,however,the same words,placed in different contexts,sometimes mean different things.
it is clear,therefore,that despite the need to reconcile the reach of the lanham act with first amendment values,goods or services remains a broad and potentially fuzzy concept.that is yet another reason why the in connection with language must denote a real nexus with goods or services if the act is not to fatally collide with first amendment principles.
the second element in establishing lanham act liability is whether the use of the trademark is likely to cause confusion among consumers regarding the source or sponsorship of the goods or services.a a a.here it is important to remember that trademark infringement protects only against mistaken purchasing decisions and not against confusion generally.lang ret.living publ g,cir quotation marks omitted see also bosley,at.that is because a trademark only gives the right to prohibit the use of it so far as to protect the owner good will against the sale of another product as his.prestonettes,coty.emphasis added.
this court and others have employed any number of frameworks to assess the likelihood of confusion,generally balancing a slew of relevant factors.see,pizzeria uno temple,cir.this court considers the strength of the trademark holder mark,the degree of similarity between the two marks,the similarity of the goods they identify,the similarity of the facilities used in the businesses,the similarity of the advertising,the infringer intent,and the presence of actual confusion,anheuser busch,wings,cir,as well as the quality of the infringer product,and the sophistication of the consuming public,george,llc imagination entm t,cir.these factors are not a rigid formula but rather only a guide,anheuser busch,at,and each factor may be more or less relevant or important for any given case,lamparello,at.
in conducting such an inquiry,which is inherently and context dependent,we must bear in mind the purpose behind it preventing consumer confusion of the infringer goods or services with those of the trademark holder.when the infringer intent is something other than piggybacking off a mark holder success by tricking consumers into purchasing his goods instead,the other factors must be evaluated in light of that intent and purpose.see louis vuitton malletier haute diggity dog,llc,cir an intent to parody is not an intent to confuse the public.quotations marks omitted.although finding an alternative intent does not prevent us from applying the factors,it does influence the way in which they are applied.id.
marks used to parody,satirize,criticize,comment,or compare make the inquiry under pizzeria uno at best awkward and require that the use be assessed in that context.anheuser busch,at quotation marks omitted.for example,the strength of the mark and the similarity between the marks often work in reverse for cases of parody and satire as compared to a standard infringement case.louis vuitton,at.the keystone of parody is imitation,anheuser busch,at,and the similarity with key differences between the original mark and the parody may only enhance the effect of the latter and the strong mark fame and popularity are precisely the mechanism s by which likelihood of confusion is avoided,louis vuitton,at.
as with the in connection with element,the likelihood of confusion test,if misapplied,can implicate free speech concerns.when the use of the trademark does not imply sponsorship or endorsement of the product because the mark is used only to describe the thing,rather than to identify its source,restricting speech does not serve the purpose of the lanham act.new kids on the block news am.publ g,cir.indeed,criticism or parody of a mark holder would be difficult indeed without using the mark.id.trademark protections exist neither to allow companies to protect themselves from criticism nor to permit them to control language.skippy,at quoting mark lemley,the modern lanham act and the death of common sense,yale.even some amount of actual confusion must still be weighed against the interest in a less fettered marketplace of social issues speech.see rogers,at.
in applying the above principles,we think the district court made several errors.those mistakes extended the lanham act beyond the purposes it was intended to serve.
in finding that radiance use of the naacp marks was in connection with goods or services,the district court erred in several respects.to begin,the court held that because the radiance article appeared in a google search for the term naacp,it diverted internet users to radiance article as opposed to the naacp websites,which thereby created a connection to the naacp goods and services.radiance,naacp,d.but typically the use of the mark has to be in connection with the infringer goods or services,not the trademark holder.see utah lighthouse ministry found.for apologetic info.research,cir stating that the defendant in a trademark infringement case must use the mark in connection with the goods or services of a competing producer,not merely to make a comment on the trademark owner goods or services.
if the general rule was that the use of the mark merely had to be in connection with the trademark holder goods or services,then even the most offhand mention of a trademark holder mark could potentially satisfy the in connection with requirement.that interpretation would expand the requirement to the point that it would equal or surpass the scope of the lanham act in commerce jurisdictional element.this would not only make the jurisdictional element superfluous,but would hamper the ability of the in connection with requirement to hold lanham act infractions within first amendment limits.
in people for the ethical treatment of animals doughney,we stated that an infringer need only have prevented users from obtaining or using the trademark holder goods or services,or need only have connected the infringing website to other goods or services in order to satisfy the in connection with requirement,cir.but that rule applies specifically where the infringer has used the trademark holder mark in a domain name.id.at.neither of radiance websites used an naacp mark in its domain name.rather,radiance used the naacp marks only in the title and body of an article criticizing the naacp.nothing in peta indicates that the use of a mark in the course of disseminating such an idea is on that account sufficient to establish the requisite relationship to goods or services.peta simply does not govern the application of the in connection with element in this case.
the district court proceeded to find that radiance use of the naacp marks was also in connection with radiance goods or services.radiance,d at.but the court analysis failed to demonstrate a sufficient nexus between the specific use of the marks and the sale,offer for sale,distribution,or advertisement of any of the goods or services that the court invoked.the court first found that there was a sufficient nexus with radiance own information services because radiance provided information on its website.id.at.that ruling,however,neuters the first amendment.the provision of mere information services without any commercial or transactional component is speech nothing more.
in the alternative,the court held that radiance use of the naacp marks was in connection with goods or services,because the use was part of social commentary or criticism for which they solicit donations and sponsorship.id.the naacp echoes the district court,arguing that the transactional nature of the billboard campaign and radiance fundraising efforts place radiance use of the marks comfortably within the reach of the in connection with element.appellee br.at.
we need not address this point with absolute pronouncements.suffice it to say that the specific use of the marks at issue here was too attenuated from the donation solicitation and the billboard campaign to support lanham act liability.although present on the article page,the donate button was off to the side and did not itself use the naacp marks in any way.the billboard campaign was displayed on a different page altogether.a visitor likely would not perceive the use of the naacp marks in the article as being in connection with those transactional components of the website.it is important not to lose perspective.the article was just one piece of each radiance website content,which was comprised of articles,videos,and multimedia advocacy materials.that the protected marks appear somewhere in the content of a website that includes transactional components is not alone enough to satisfy the in connection with element.to say it was would come too close to an absolute rule that any social issues commentary with any transactional component in the neighborhood enhanced the commentator risk of lanham act liability.
the supreme court has warned that charitable appeals for funds involve a variety of speech interests that are within the protection of the first amendment.vill.of schaumburg citizens for a better env t,d.such solicitation,the court stated,is not a variety of purely commercial speech.id.courts are thus to tread cautiously when a trademark holder invokes the lanham act against an alleged infringer whose use of the trademark holder marks may be only tenuously related to requests for money.again,this is not to say that in all instances a solicitation by a is immune from lanham act liability.a solicitation may satisfy the in connection with element if the trademark holder demonstrates a sufficient nexus between the unauthorized use of the protected mark and clear transactional activity.such a nexus may be present,for example,where the protected mark seems to denote the recipient of the donation.however,where,as here,the solicitations are not closely related to the specific uses of the protected marks,we are compelled to conclude that the district court erred in ruling that the in connection element was met.
the district court likewise considered the likelihood of confusion from radiance use of the marks.first and foremost,it based its finding in great part on whether consumers thought naacp in fact stood for national association for the abortion of colored people.radiance,d at relying on survey evidence.trademark infringement provisions do not protect against confusion about the marks themselves because marks are not goods or services but instruments to identify goods and services.louis vuitton malletier haute diggity dog,llc,cir the misspellings pointed out by lvm in the vuitton name are far more likely in this context to indicate confusion over how to spell the product name than any confusion over the source or sponsorship of the chewy vuiton dog toys.thus confusion about what a particular trademark says or looks like is not relevant for infringement claims.we may certainly account for similarities between the trademark holder and infringer marks in the likelihood of confusion analysis,but only in the context of how those similarities create confusion about the source of any products the marks identify.
likewise,trademark infringement is not designed to protect mark holders from consumer confusion about their positions on political or social issues.the evidence of actual confusion relied on by the district court consisted of phone calls to the naacp by people who took issue with the naacp supporting abortion.radiance found,d at.i ndignation is not confusion,girl scouts of personality posters,at least not as pertains to trademark infringement,and at best the calls demonstrated confusion as to the naacp policy positions rather than any good or service.policy stances are neither goods nor services,though the means of conveying them may be.
political discourse is the grist of the mill in the marketplace of ideas.it may be that the only but also the best remedy available to a trademark holder is to engage in responsive speech.for even where a speaker lies,more accurate information will normally counteract the lie.united states alvarez,d breyer,concurring in the judgment.the naacp is a renowned civil rights organization with numerous mechanisms for connecting with its membership and the public.organizations of its size and stature possess megaphones all their own.actual confusion as to a mission,tenets,and beliefs is commonplace,but that does not transform the lanham act into an instrument for chilling or silencing the speech of those who disagree with or misunderstand a mark holder positions or views.see rogers grimaldi,cir.
the district court also concluded that some consumers might be confused about an affiliation between the authors of the article and the naacp.radiance,d at.but it is not immediately apparent how someone would confuse an article which is strongly critical of an organization with the organization itself.the mark in this case was used primarily to identify the naacp as the object of radiance criticism,resembling a descriptive or nominative fair use albeit by employing a modified version of the name.admittedly,the attention span on the internet may not be long,but the briefest familiarity with the article would quickly create the impression the author was no friend of the naacp.indeed,in just the first two lines,the piece refers to the naacp as an liberal organization and accuses its image awards of honoring black imagery churned out by often racist,perpetually sexist,violent and pornographic hollywood.intemperate and worse as the commentary is,holding it actionable risks creating the paradox that criticism equals confusion,thereby permitting companies to shield themselves from adverse assessments.indeed,m uch useful social and commercial discourse would be all but impossible if speakers were under threat of an infringement lawsuit every time they made reference to a person,company or product by using its trademark.cpc int l,skippy,cir quoting new kids on the block news am.publ g,inc,cir.
it remains essential in any analysis of confusion to consider fully the purpose with which the mark was being used.the trial court did entertain the possibility of parody,but once it found that radiance had not engaged in a successful parody,it ended its inquiry there.radiance,d at.if not quite parody,the use of national association for the abortion of colored people in this context may be more akin to satire,which works by distort ing the familiar with the pretense of reality in order to convey an underlying critical message.farah esquire magazine,quotation marks omitted.whatever the label affixed to the article,radiance twist on the famous moniker follows in the same vein as articles that refer to the nra as the national republican association or the aclu as the anti christian lawyers union.amicus br.of frontier found.aclu of at.biting,surely distortive,certainly radiance ploy was nonetheless effective at conveying sharply what it was that radiance wished to say.the implications for the likelihood of confusion factors are thus obvious parody or satire or critical opinion generally may be more effective if the mark is strong and the satirical or critical version is similar to the original.the critical message conveyed by the satirical mark itself and in the commentary that follows ensures that no confusion about the source of the commentary will last,if in fact it is generated at all.
it is important moreover to pay sufficient attention to the full context in which the mark was used,which diminishes the likelihood of confusion about source even further.the domain names and webpage headings clearly denote other organizations the radiance foundation or toomanyaborted.for each site,this post was one of dozens of articles on social and political issues.
suppose,however,a viewer caught no more than the title of the article naacp national association for the abortion of colored people.the claim against radiance would still not lie.titles,as part of expressive works,require more protection than the labeling of ordinary goods.rogers,at.for consumers understand and expect titles to pertain to the contents of the underlying work rather than authorship or the publisher.see mattel,mca records,cir rogers,at.provided the title is connected to and not misleading about the contents and does not use the mark in a way that clearly suggests authorship,see rogers,at,use of a mark in a title will generally not result in the type of consumer confusion necessary to support infringement claims.in this case,the title related to and conveyed the subject of the article the naacp and radiance views of its alleged stance on abortion.the use of the satirical modification of the true naacp name was designed,as many titles are,to be and provocative in a manner that induces the reader to continue on.we can not find that use of the naacp marks in the title of the radiance article created a likelihood of confusion as to the piece authorship or affiliation.
we have identified individual difficulties with appellee position,but it is well to understand the matter in its totality.the trial court found that using marks in a highly critical article that lambasts the naacp for its views and actions constituted trademark infringement because the site solicits financial support for its activities,albeit attenuated from the use of the mark,and some consumers may be confused about the naacp true name and political positions.we need not go so far as to say that social commentary solicitations can never be the subject of a valid infringement claim in order to conclude that it will not be infringing so long as the use of the mark does not create confusion as to source,sponsorship,or affiliation.any other holding would severely restrict all kinds of speakers from criticizing all manner of corporate positions and activities and propel the lanham act into treacherous constitutional terrain.
the district court further held that radiance diluted the naacp and national association for the advancement of colored people trademarks by tarnishing them in violation of c.radiance,naacp,d.we respectfully disagree.radiance use of the marks was undeniably to criticize the naacp perceived position on abortion,thus falling squarely within the statute explicit exclusions.see c.
whereas the law of trademark infringement is motivated by an interest in protecting consumers from confusion as to a product source,the law of dilution defends the trademark itself.moseley secret catalogue,d see also nissan motor nissan computer,cir the point of dilution law is to protect the owner investment in his mark.specifically,the law allows the owner of a famous mark that is distinctive to seek an injunction where another person use of a mark is likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment of the famous mark,regardless of the presence or absence of actual or likely confusion,of competition,or of actual economic injury.c.
