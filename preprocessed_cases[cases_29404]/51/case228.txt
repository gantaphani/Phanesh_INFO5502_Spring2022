this appeal involves a dispute between gaming companies.it began when wms gaming,wms,sued wpc productions and its parent corporation,partygaming plc collectively,partygaming or the defendants,for partygaming unapologetic infringement of wms registered trademarks jackpot party and super jackpot party.partygaming is based in gibraltar,but the electronic gaming services that it provides span the globe.after several failed attempts to persuade partygaming voluntarily to cease its infringing uses of wms marks,wms filed this suit in federal district court seeking injunctive relief,damages,and an equitable accounting of the profits partygaming reaped from its use of wms marks in the united states.
despite receiving proper notice,the defendants have opted to ignore wms lawsuit entirely.the result was a default judgment for both monetary and injunctive relief entered in wms favor.believing that it was entitled to additional relief,however,wms appealed,arguing that the district court applied the wrong standard to its claim for an accounting of profits.we reverse.
wms has manufactured,sold,and leased gaming devices,including slot machines,for many years.since as early as,wms has used the jackpot party trademark.in interstate commerce in connection with its goods,and since as early as october,it has used the super jackpot party trademark.in the same way.under law,these registrations constitute conclusive evidence of wms exclusive rights to the underlying marks for the uses specified in the registrations,see b,and they also provide nationwide constructive notice of wms rights to the underlying marks,dating back to the filing dates of the applications from which the registrations matured december,for jackpot party,and february,for super jackpot party,id.c.
partygaming business is online gaming,including slot machines,poker,bingo,sports betting,and other casino games.during the years,and,partygaming used approximate and even exact reproductions of wms marks for that business,throughout the world and in the united states.its use of wms marks is and has occurred frequently and persistently throughout the years in question.
in addition to having constructive notice of wms ownership of the trademarks by virtue of their registration with the patent and trademark office pto,partygaming also had actual notice that wms owned the jackpot party mark by the beginning of.at that time,it attempted to register the mark partyjackpot with the pto,but the pto promptly rejected the request because it found that the mark was confusingly similar to wms prior registered mark jackpot party.this was not enough to prompt partygaming to abandon its use of the mark.to the contrary,the record shows that it instead expanded its use after the pto action,and with its use,the profits it derived from the mark.according to partygaming annual report,available from its website,the company earned million in total revenue that year,of which,or million,came from customers.see,annual report at,follow investors hyperlink to financial performance and then financial reports hyperlinks,report reproduced in app.vol,at ff.partygaming also continued for several months to pursue its application in the united states to register partyjackpot,ultimately forcing wms to oppose that application in litigation before the trademark trial and appeal board.
while that litigation was pending,the congress passed the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act,stat uigea,which effectively prohibited gambling businesses from receiving proceeds or monies in connection with online gambling.up until that point late,the largest source of partygaming revenues,by far,was the united states.in the wake of the uigea enactment,however,partygaming decided to cease its operations in the market.it also abandoned its application and litigation in this country regarding the partyjackpot mark.
once again,however,partygaming did not abandon its use of wms trademarks.it continued,for a time,to rake in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues from customers.when amicable efforts to resolve the dispute failed,wms filed this suit,which,as we noted,partygaming chose to boycott despite proper service of process.eventually,the district court,having found that it had jurisdiction under and and,we might add,apparently a,and that the requirements of illinois statute,ilcs were satisfied,granted wms motion for entry of default judgment.its order,entered july,awarded damages to wms in the amount of.it also granted injunctive relief,the terms of which it provided in an order entered on september.
though the district court granted relief to wms,the monetary award that wms had sought was exponentially larger than the one it got wms had requested.it arrived at this figure by determining the total amount of revenue that partygaming had earned as a result of its business in the united states in,and.wms obtained that data from partygaming website,which featured links to its public financial statements and annual revenue reports.the reports which we have in the substantial appendices that wms has filed reveal,in partygaming own words and colorful charts,the hundreds of millions of dollars that it earned during the years in question.the reports even separate the revenues into and revenues.when it became clear that partygaming would not respond to wms lawsuit,wms turned its focus to the remedy it wanted,and it used the defendants annual reports to estimate how much money the defendants had earned in the united states while infringing wms trademark rights.
the district court concluded that wms estimate of its damages was reasonable.that amount was,and it was significantly lower than the estimates for and,because the revenues for the later years reflected partygaming expanded use of the marks.in the district court view,however,wms estimates for and could not be ascertained with reasonable certainty and were clearly excessive.it therefore based its awards for those years not in the amounts that wms had requested,but instead on the same amount that it had deemed reasonable for.the result was the total award reflected in the court order.
wms responded with a motion under.e to alter or amend the judgment.in its motion,it tried to persuade the district court that it had committed legal error by applying the standard for actual damages in its order for default judgment,rather than the proper and more flexible standard for an equitable accounting of profits.both types of relief are available under the lanham act to redress trademark infringement,see a,and they are distinct remedies with different legal standards and burdens of proof.the district court denied the rule e motion it remained committed to its prior interpretation of wms request as one for damages and concluded again that wms was asking for damages that are clearly excessive and can not be ascertained with reasonable certainty.
before proceeding to the substance of wms claims,we believe that it is prudent to assure ourselves that the federal courts have jurisdiction over this lawsuit.the statutes on which the district court based its conclusion that jurisdiction exists were and.see a granting original jurisdiction to the district courts,and appellate jurisdiction to the circuit courts of appeals,of all actions arising under this chapter chapter trademarks,without regard to the amount in controversy or to diversity or lack of diversity of the citizenship of the parties a granting exclusive jurisdiction to the district courts of any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents,copyrights and trademarks and b granting the district courts original jurisdiction of any civil action asserting a claim of unfair competition when joined with a substantial and related claim under the copyright,patent,plant variety protection or trademark laws.wms claims fall squarely within the scope of these statutes.
our appellate jurisdiction is secure because the defendants were properly served but failed to appear or answer wms complaint.they therefore were found to be in default,and the district court entry of default judgment and later denial of wms rule e motion constitutes an appealable judgmen
