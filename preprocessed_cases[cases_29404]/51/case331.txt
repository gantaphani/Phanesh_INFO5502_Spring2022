we address the scope of the anticybersquatting consumer protection act.
this case was tried to a jury,and the appellant challenges the jury verdict,so we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party favor.
dspt,founded and owned by paolo dorigo,designs,manufactures,and imports men clothing.the company sells clothes to between and retailers.it sells mostly shirts,but also some knitwear,trousers,and.its brand name since had been equilibrio.to serve a younger market with somewhat trendier,tighter fitting fashion,the company created the eq brand name in.
at about that time,dorigo brought his friend lucky nahum into the business.dorigo lived in los angeles,nahum in rochester,new york.they decided to set up a site on what was then the fledgling internet,and nahum brother,a hairdresser,was doing website design,so dspt had nahum arrange to have his brother prepare the site.the website,eq for the brand,italy for dorigo and the style origin,was created solely for dspt for the purpose of showing dspt clothes.nahum brother designed the website in consultation with dorigo,though nahum registered the site to himself.this seemed trivial at the time,since nahum was working exclusively for dspt and registration cost only.dorigo,who was not knowledgeable or interested in computer matters,was unaware that the registration was in nahum name.
the importance of the website grew with the importance of the internet.by,the website served as dspt catalog.customers accessed it hours a day,chose designs from it,and sent in orders through it.dspt them about new items on the site.salesmen sold dspt clothes to retailers by referring them to pictures on the website and soliciting their orders based on the pictures.
unfortunately,during the same period,the friendship between dorigo and nahum soured.nahum dspt contract was up for renewal august,so dorigo sent him a proposal in.at the same time,dspt paid nahum airfare,hotel,and meals for a trip to las vegas for the west coast exclusive wear show,an offshoot of the largest menswear show in the world magic,men apparel guild in california which was taking place in las vegas.but while there,nahum spent time in a competitor booth,and arranged employment with that dspt competitor.though dorigo was also at the show and asked nahum whether he would be renewing his contract,nahum only informed dorigo by after the show that he was not renewing his contract.
at the beginning of october,dspt website mysteriously disappeared.if a customer typed.com into his web browser,instead of seeing dspt clothing line,all he saw was a screen saying all fashion related questions to be referred to lucky nahum at nahum had no use for the website,but he told his new boss at dspt competitor that he had inserted that sentence in order to get equilibrio dspt older brand to pay him funds that were due to him.dspt repeatedly but unsuccessfully asked nahum to give back the website.
this created a crisis for dspt.retailers do around three fourths of their business during the last quarter of the year,so wholesalers and manufacturers,like dspt,do a large percentage of their business supplying retailers during october,november,and the first part of december.dspt website in the fall also generated the orders for the upcoming spring.without its website,dspt could not sell anything in a manner approaching its previous efficiency.it was forced to go back to the old way of sending out samples,but retailers did not want to deal with dspt using the old method.sales plummeted and inventory was left over in the spring from the very bad fall had been good,and the first quarter of was the best ever,but the last quarter of,and all of,were disastrous.a lot of inventory had to be sold below cost.dspt spent,plus a great deal of time,writing to customers to explain the situation and replacing its website and the stationery that referred customers to.com.
dspt sued nahum for cybersquatting and trademark infringement in violation of the lanham act nahum counterclaimed for in additional commissions he claimed he was owed.
the case was tried to a jury.the jury returned a special verdict,finding,among other things,that eq and equilibrio were valid trademarks owned by dspt that lucky nahum registered,trafficked in,or used the domain name that the name was identical or confusingly similar to dspt distinctive trademark and that lucky nahum commit ed the acts with a bad faith intent to profit from dspt mark.the jury found that dspt damages were.as for nahum for commissions,the jury found that dspt did not breach its contract with him and owed him nothing.
the district court denied nahum renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law,remittitur,and new trial.nahum appeals,and we affirm.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo and denial of a motion for new trial and remittitur for abuse of discretion a district court may grant a new trial only if the jury verdict is contrary to the clear weight of the evidence the district court denial of a motion for a new trial is reversible only if the record contains no evidence in support of the verdict or if the district court made a mistake of law.a jury verdict must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence,which is evidence adequate to support the jury conclusion,even if it is also possible to draw a contrary conclusion.we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party favor.a jury verdict should be set aside only when the evidence permits only one reasonable conclusion,and that conclusion is contrary to the jury verdict.
on appeal,nahum argues that the statute has no application to the conduct in this case,that dspt did not own the trademarks and that was not identical or confusingly similar to dspt marks,that there was no evidence of intent to profit,and that there was insufficient evidence to support the damages award.
b.the anticybersquatting consumer protection act.
the consumer protection act establishes civil liability for cyberpiracy where a plaintiff proves that the defendant registered,trafficked in,or used a domain name the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a protected mark owned by the plaintiff and the defendant acted with bad faith intent to profit from that mark.
nahum first argues that as a matter of law,this statute does not apply to what he did.he argues that the statute applies only to one who registers a trademark as a domain name,and then attempts to profit in bad faith by either selling the domain name back to the trademark holder,or using the domain name to divert business from the trademark holder.he argues that he can not owe damages under the statute because the evidence shows only that he used dspt mark to gain leverage over dspt in bargaining for money he claimed he was owed,not to sell under dspt mark or sell the mark to dspt.he argues that even if in some sense he had a intent to profit,any intent to profit under the act must be an intent to profit from the goodwill associated with the mark rather than to gain some other benefit.the core of his argument is that he did not register the domain name in bad faith,and used it only to get what he was entitled to.
his arguments are not implausible,but we conclude that they are mistaken.true,the statute was intended to prevent cybersquatters from registering brand names as internet domain names in order to make the trademark owners buy the ability to do business under their own names nahum cites a remark in a senate committee report mentioning the intent to profit from the goodwill associated with someone else trademark and the sixth circuit noted that t he paradigmatic harm that the anticybersquatting consumer protection act was enacted to eradicate was the practice of cybersquatters registering several hundred domain names in an effort to sell them to the legitimate owners of the mark.
but the statute,like so many,is written more broadly than what may have been the political catalyst that got it passed.as in bosley medical institute kremer,we conclude that the words of the statute are broader than this political stimulus that led to its enactment though there was no evidence of anything wrong with nahum registration of the domain name to himself,the evidence supported a verdict that nahum subsequently,years later,used the domain name to get leverage for his claim for commissions.the statute says registers,traffics in,or uses,with or between the terms,so use alone is enough to support a verdict,even in the absence of violative registration or trafficking.
as for whether use to get leverage in a business dispute can establish a violation,the statutory factors for bad faith intent establish that it can evidence of bad faith may arise well after registration of the domain name.the statute contains a safe harbor provision,excluding a finding of bad faith intent for persons who reasonably believed that use of the domain name was fair use or otherwise lawful but that safe harbor has no application here.nahum could not have reasonably believed that he could lawfully use when he no longer worked for dspt.the safe harbor protects uses such as parody and comment and use by persons ignorant of another superior right to the mark 
the statute provides that a court may consider factors such as,but not limited to the previously enumerated list of nine nahum does not challenge the jury instruction,which listed all of the factors,even though some have no bearing on this case,and some do not offer either side much support.one of the factors,number vi in the statute,strongly supports dspt claim.that factor notes that it is indicative of a bad faith intent to profit from the mark if the person offering to transfer the domain name to the owner of the mark has never actually used or intended to use the domain name for bona fide sales of goods 
factor vi may fairly be read to mean that it is bad faith to hold a domain name for ransom where the holder uses it to get money from the owner of the trademark rather than to sell goods.the jury had evidence that nahum was using the.com domain name as leverage to get dspt to pay him the disputed commissions,not for the bona fide sale of clothes.though there was no direct evidence of an explicit offer to sell the domain to dspt for a specified amount,the jury could infer the intent to give back the site to dspt only if dspt paid nahum the disputed commissions.
the intent to profit,as factor vi shows,means simply the intent to get money or other valuable consideration.profit does not require that nahum receive more than he is owed on his disputed claim.rather,p rofit includes an attempt to procure an advantageous gain or return.thus,it does not matter that,as the jury concluded,nahum claim for unpaid commissions was meritless,because he could not hold the domain name for ransom even if he had been owed commissions.
in this case,shortly after dspt content disappeared from.com,nahum dorigo stating that the.com website would be back up under a new format.nahum testified that he would transfer the domain to dspt after nahum and dspt were able to resolve the monetary issues regarding nahum commissions.nahum subsequent employer testified that nahum told him that dspt wanted the website returned to them,but nahum was keeping it to use it as leverage in order to get the money he said dspt owed him.this is evidence of an intent to profit under the act.
distinctive and confusingly similar 
nahum second argument is that there was no evidence from which a jury could conclude that was a distinctive mark,or that it was confusingly similar to dspt eq mark.the latter point is meritless,since the evidence showed that only dspt used the mark eq for a men shirts line,and used the italian fashion connection as a selling point.even though dspt had not registered the eq mark,ownership of common law trademark is obtained by actual use of a symbol to identify the goods or services of one seller and distinguish them from those offered by others.the evidence shows that dspt used the mark in commerce in fall,when it exhibited eq at the new york fashion and thereafter used the eq symbol.although nahum showed that others used an eq mark in subsequent years for other sorts of goods,such as online publications,engine cylinder heads,and bicycles,no one would likely confuse these goods with dspt the only other use that was even arguably confusingly similar was eq equestrian clothing,but the jury could conclude that retailers shopping for men shirts are unlikely to be confused by a mark also used for equestrian clothing,and that the style in which the marks were displayed was too different to foster confusion.the shirts were marked by the letters eq,whereas the equestrian apparel was marked by a rectangle inside another rectangle.
as for whether.com is confusingly similar to eq,a jury could reasonably conclude that in the context of men shirts,it was.the jury could have concluded that,at the time nahum used it,the mark was distinctive and his use of the site after leaving dspt would confuse retailers trying to shop dspt catalog at the website where they had done so before in fact,as dorigo testified,several customers were actually confused by the alteration of the website.now,people would still call and say,what happened where is it you know,they wanted to know what this screen by.com was identified with eq and equilibrio.the similarity of eq and is considerably greater than and,which we held were similar,and thus the jury finding should be upheld 
nahum argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the damages award of.under the cybersquatting statute,dspt was entitled to any damages it sustained which,like tort damages,are the reasonably foreseeable harms caused by the wrong the district court barred the testimony of dspt expert witness a ruling not on appeal,so there was no testimony supporting a precise number.but the jury did have as admitted exhibits dspt financial statements providing detailed information on sales,expenses,and profits for all those years,as well as dspt president testimony about the financial impact of nahum cyberpiracy.
the wronged party has the burden of proof as to damages but the nature of the proof required depends on the circumstances of the case the calculation is subject to the principles of equity.because nahum did not,so far as the record indicates,divert trade from dspt to himself or his new employer,defendant profits were not sought and are not at issue,only consequential damages to dspt.
nahum conduct was not an unintentional infringement where the defendant failed to provide financial information it should have been able to provide,as in lindy pen,bic pen it was an intentional infringement,so our language in intel corporation terabyte international,applies.in intel,we affirmed a crude measure of damages that depended on an inference that was not inexorable,neither was it fanciful.
in the circumstances of this case,precision in the calculation of damages is neither necessary nor possible.nahum wrong made it impossible to know with any precision what dspt sales would have been had he not committed his wrong.requiring more precision than can be attained,especially where the impossibility of more precise ascertainment was the fault of the wrongdoer,would be inequitable and is not required.a defendant whose wrongful conduct has rendered difficult the ascertainment of the precise damages suffered by the plaintiff,is not entitled to complain that they can not be measured with the same exactness and precision as would otherwise be possible.just as a business could not know how many phone calls it did not get because its phone number was wrong in the yellow pages,dspt could not know how many shirts it did not sell because retailers could not find its website.
given the impossibility of precise measurements,the jury had sufficient tools for estimating dspt actual damages,including financial statements bracketing the period of the loss and testimony that dspt spent recreating its website.the law does not require expert testimony to establish damages though that would have made the jury task easier.it is hard to see what additional data,as opposed t
