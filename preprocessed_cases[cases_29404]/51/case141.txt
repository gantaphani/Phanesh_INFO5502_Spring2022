carefirst,a maryland corporation with its principal place of business in maryland,is one of the nation largest healthcare insurance companies.it is a bluecross blueshield licensee,primarily in the business of selling prepaid healthcare plans.bluecross is an association of independent health plans,which,since the,have been chartered to operate in geographically distinct territories.carefirst operates exclusively within the region of the united states the majority of its million members resides in maryland and in the nearby states of pennsylvania and west virginia.

cpc,an illinois corporation with its principal place of business in illinois,is a,evangelical,advocacy organization.cpc professed mission is to care for women in crisis by meeting their emotional,physical and spiritual needs,enabling them to choose life.the organization originally incorporated in under the name loop crisis pregnancy center,but it changed its name in to chicagocare pregnancy centers,and then in to carefirst pregnancy centers,carefirst.
cpc is headquartered in chicago,illinois,and it has no physical presence in maryland it has no offices,no telephone listing,no employees,and no agents there.nor does cpc directly solicit funds from individuals in maryland.and,according to the declaration of cpc president,nancy good,cpc has never even provided counseling services to anyone in maryland.cpc sole contact with maryland springs from its operation of an internet website,accessible from anywhere in the world through any one of several web addresses.
in,cpc entered into a contract with netimpact,a web and web company incorporated in delaware and headquartered in ocean pines,maryland.on cpc behalf,netimpact purchased several domain names including,and.between november,and november,netimpact submitted invoices to cpc illinois address for the web hosting services that netimpact provided during the period 
cpc uses its various domain names to direct internet traffic to cpc website,throughout which the carefirst name appears.on that website,cpc solicits donations educates pregnant women about nutrition,infant care,and prenatal care provides references to medical doctors and hospitals promotes its counseling services and parenting classes and advertises the pregnancy tests and ultrasound services that it offers free of charge.the website asserts at several points that the geographic focus of cpc activities is the chicago metropolitan area.
in soliciting donations,cpc website offers prospective donors two methods of contribution they can call an advertised number and make a credit card transaction over the phone or they can make a credit card donation directly through the website.in either case,the donor name and address are recorded in cpc database,and the donor thereafter receives advertising materials through the mails.if the donation is made online,the donor also receives a.
cpc has acknowledged that it received in donations about of its total donation receipts from maryland residents between and september of.of this amount,only was donated by nine different marylanders after cpc adopted the name carefirst pregnancy centers,in.apart from a single online donation made by the lawyer for carefirst in this proceeding,there is no evidence that the maryland donations were made through the website.
on october,shortly after learning of cpc use of the carefirst name and mark,carefirst transmitted a letter to cpc.after attempting to resolve the dispute,carefirst,on may,filed suit against cpc and netimpact in the district of maryland.
cpc responded by filing a rule b motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,supported by the declaration of its president,nancy good.after obtaining several extensions of time,carefirst filed a motion requesting both limited jurisdictional discovery and another extension of time in which to respond to the motion to dismiss.cpc opposed carefirst motion,maintaining that discovery was unwarranted since carefirst had failed to make a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction.
on january,the court dismissed the action,without prejudice,for lack of personal jurisdiction,and it denied carefirst discovery request carefirst of,carefirst pregnancy,mem,civ.no,the opinion.in granting cpc motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,the court found that cpc operated primarily in chicago had no office,telephone listing,employees,agents,or sales representatives in maryland had never directly solicited funds from maryland residents or otherwise targeted the forum had received a de minimus portion of its charitable contributions from maryland residents and had recived nearly all of those contributions by mail,rather than online.opinion at.the court went on to find that cpc only connections to maryland arose from the facts that its website could be accessed from anywhere in the world,including maryland and the website host was a maryland corporation.id.on this basis,the court concluded that cpc did not have sufficient contacts with maryland to support personal jurisdiction in the maryland courts.id 
on january,carefirst sought reconsideration of the dismissal.then,on march,it filed a motion to vacate the dismissal on the basis of newly discovered evidence of cpc contacts with maryland,which carefirst had obtained from netimpact president.the court denied the motion for reconsideration on march,carefirst of,carefirst pregnancy,order,civ.no,and it denied the motion to vacate on july,carefirst of,carefirst pregnancy,order,civ.no.july,the july order.carefirst timely appealed the dismissal of its complaint,the denial of its motion for reconsideration,and the denial of its motion to vacate.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo a dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction,koehler dodwell,cir,though we review any underlying factual findings for clear error,see in re celotex,cir.when personal jurisdiction is properly challenged under rule b,the jurisdictional question is to be resolved by the judge,with the burden on the plaintiff ultimately to prove grounds for jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.mylan,akzo,cir.when,however,as here,a district court decides a pretrial personal jurisdiction motion without conducting an evidentiary hearing,the plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction.combs bakker,cir.in deciding whether the plaintiff has made the requisite showing,the court must take all disputed facts and reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.see mylan,at.
we review a district court discovery orders for abuse of discretion.see id.at.we also review for abuse of discretion the denial of a rule b motion for extension of time.see lujan wildlife fed n,d.
under federal rule of civil procedure k a,a federal court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant in the manner provided by state law.see esab group,centricut,cir.thus,for a district court to assert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant,two conditions must be satisfied the exercise of jurisdiction must be authorized under the state statute and the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with the due process requirements of the fourteenth amendment.christian sci.bd.of dirs.of the first church of christ nolan,cir.with regard to the first requirement,we must accept as binding the interpretation of maryland statute rendered by the maryland court of appeals.see mylan,at.the maryland courts have consistently held that the state statute is coextensive with the limits of personal jurisdiction set by the due process clause of the constitution.see mohamed michael.thus,our statutory inquiry merges with our constitutional inquiry.see stover,cir.
a court exercise of jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant comports with due process if the defendant has minimum contacts with the forum,such that to require the defendant to defend its interests in that state does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.internal quotation marks omitted.
the standard for determining the existence of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant varies,depending on whether the defendant contacts with the forum state also provide the basis for the suit.if those contacts form the basis for the suit,they may establish specific jurisdiction.in determining whether specific jurisdiction exists,we consider the extent to which the defendant has purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the state whether the plaintiffs claims arise out of those activities directed at the state and whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be constitutionally reasonable.als scan,digital serv.consultants,cir,cert.denied,d see helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d.if,however,the defendant contacts with the state are not also the basis for the suit,then jurisdiction over the defendant must arise from the defendant general,more persistent,but unrelated contacts with the state.to establish general jurisdiction,the defendant activities in the state must have been continuous and systematic.als scan,at see,at.
because there is,in this case,no suggestion that cpc engaged in continuous and systematic activities within maryland,our inquiry must focus on the conduct giving rise to the suit,cpc alleged infringement of carefirst trademark.and accordingly,it is only if cpc purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in maryland,carefirst claims arise out of those activities,and the exercise of personal jurisdiction would be constitutionally reasonable,that cpc can be held subject to specific jurisdiction in maryland.in conducting this inquiry,we direct our focus to the quality and nature of cpc maryland contacts.nichols searle,aff,cir.we should not merely count the contacts and quantitatively compare this case to other preceding cases.id.even a single contact may be sufficient to create jurisdiction when the cause of action arises out of that single contact,provided that the principle of fair play and substantial justice is not thereby offended.id.citing burger king rudzewicz,d see mcgee int l life ins,d.
to decide whether the requisites of specific jurisdiction are satisfied in this case,it is necessary to consider how they apply to the particular circumstance in which,as here,an defendant has acted outside of the forum in a manner that injures someone residing in the forum.in calder jones,d,the supreme court held that a court may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant acting outside of the forum when the defendant has intentionally directed his tortious conduct toward the forum state,knowing that that conduct would cause harm to a forum resident id.at.applying that test to the libel suit before it,the calder court held that california possessed jurisdiction over florida reporters who had written an allegedly libelous article for the national enquirer about a california actress,because california was the focal point both of the story and of the harm suffered.id.at.the writers actions were expressly aimed at california,the court said,a nd they knew that the brunt of the potentially devastating injury would be felt by the actress in the state in which she lives and works and in which the national enquirer has its largest circulation.id.at.see also esab group,at emphasizing importance,in light of calder,of evidence that defendant expressly aimed or directed its conduct toward forum state and noting that business activities focusing generally on customers located throughout the united states and canada without focusing on and targeting forum state can not yield personal jurisdiction.
carefirst contends that,in two distinct ways,cpc expressly aimed its conduct at the forum state of maryland first,cpc set up a website that was accessible from maryland and second,cpc maintained a relationship with the maryland web hosting company,netimpact.we address in turn each of these two potential sources of specific jurisdiction.
carefirst first contends that it made a prima facie showing of specific personal jurisdiction when it alleged that cpc used an interactive website to direct electronic activity into the state with the manifest intent of conducting commercial activities with maryland residents.that cpc possessed the requisite intent is,according to carefirst,demonstrated by cpc acceptance of donations from maryland residents its submission of to maryland residents who make contributions its mailing of promotional materials to maryland residents who make contributions and its establishment of a telephone number and hotline over which maryland residents could make donations,obtain counseling,or receive pregnancy test kits.
the issue before us is whether the evidence that carefirst has proffered is sufficient to make out a prima facie case that cpc expressly aimed its allegedly unlawful online conduct at maryland,so as to confer personal jurisdiction over cpc in the maryland courts.to resolve this question,we begin with our recent decision in als scan,digital service consultants,cir,in which we addressed whether a person electronically transmitting or enabling the transmission of information via the internet to maryland,causing injury there,subjects the person to the jurisdiction of a court in maryland.id.at.or,to put the als scan issue more broadly,when has an citizen,through electronic contacts,entered the state via the internet for jurisdictional purposes id.at.
in tackling these questions,our als scan decision expressly a dopt ed and adapt ed the model for specific jurisdiction developed in zippo manufacturing zippo dot com.id.at.in its zippo decision,judge mclaughlin of the western district of pennsylvania first enunciated that court influential sliding scale model for applying calder principles to cases arising from electronic commerce.in zippo,the defendant operated an online news service,which collected information and payments from,and contracted with,subscribers in the plaintiff jurisdiction,all via the internet.in holding that personal jurisdiction over the defendant was proper in the plaintiff home state,the zippo court distinguished among interactive,and passive websites.when a defendant runs an interactive site,through which he enters into contracts with residents of a foreign jurisdiction that involve the knowing and repeated transmission of computer files over the internet,he can properly be haled into the courts of that foreign jurisdiction.zippo.at.if,by contrast,the defendant site is passive,in that it merely makes information available,the site can not render him subject to specific personal jurisdiction in a foreign court.see mink aaaa dev.llc,cir see also esab group,centricut,llc,d.occupying a middle ground are websites,through which there have no
