few subjects have generated more ink and consternation in the trademark arena in recent years than the topic of parallel market goods.in general terms,a gray market good,often referred to as a parallel import,is a good,bearing a valid united states trademark,that is imported without the consent of the united states trademark holder.k mart cartier,d.indeed,the debate is not a new one,as congress jumped on the bandwagon in the early to provide united states trademark holders a remedy under the tariff act against importation of genuine goods bearing a united states trademark.tariff act of,stat.later reenacted in identical form as tariff act of.that legislation,amended over the years,did not quell the confusion and uncertainty,especially regarding the relationship between infringement claims under the lanham act and claims under the tariff act.
it is no surprise then that the parties to this dispute have diametrically opposed views as to how the case should be analyzed.at issue is the sale in the united states of circuit breakers imported from canada under the trademark.in an ironic twist,the circuit breakers are gray.whether viewed as a gray market case or not,american circuit breaker corporation acbc must establish a likelihood of confusion to prevail.
the essential facts are undisputed.acbc holds the trademark in the united states.schneider canada holds the trademark in canada.federal pioneer limited pioneer,a subsidiary of schneider canada,manufactures circuit breakers for itself and acbc.the circuit breakers sold by the companies are identical except for the casing color.pioneer manufactures black circuit breakers for acbc and gray ones for itself.the parties have stipulated that,except for the casing color,there are no material differences between the products,and that the gray circuit breakers are genuine versions of the black ones.this dispute arose because oregon breakers bought gray circuit breakers from a canadian supplier and,without permission from acbc,sold them in the united states.
the question we address is whether the district court erred in dismissing acbc claims against oregon breakers for trademark infringement and unfair competition.we affirm the court dismissal of the claims.
factual background 
although the current relationships among the various companies are fairly straightforward,we briefly discuss the history of the trademark because an understanding of where and when the parties derived their trademark rights provides useful background to our analysis.
in,federal pacific electric company fpe adopted the trademark for circuit breakers.fpe eventually sold its circuit breaker business,including the trademark,to challenger electric.in,challenger electric sold the circuit breaker portion of its business to acbc predecessor,which in turn assigned all of its rights in the business and trademark to provident industries.provident industries,changed its corporate name to american circuit breaker corporation in late.
since,acbc and its predecessors have continuously used the trademark on advertising,marketing,and sales of circuit breakers in the united states.acbc is the record owner of the mark,which was issued in.under the lanham act,the mark is incontestable and acbc has the exclusive right to use the mark.see entrepreneur media,smith,cir citing,b.
in,federal electric products company,a company that was later merged into fpe,registered the trademark in canada.until,pioneer,the manufacturer of the gray circuit breakers,was a canadian subsidiary of fpe.the canadian registration of was assigned to pioneer in.
in,fpe sold pioneer to a canadian company that had no relationship to challenger electric or any other predecessor of acbc.in,pioneer assigned the canadian trademark to its parent company,schneider canada.
prior to,acbc manufactured black circuit breakers for the market at its plant in albemarle,north carolina,and pioneer manufactured in canada gray circuit breakers for the canadian market.following an intellectual property dispute in the early,acbc entered into an agreement with pioneer and schneider canada.
part of the dispute centered around pioneer claim that it had acquired rights to market under the mark in the united states,as well as canada.although the details of the settlement agreement are confidential,the parties reveal the key elements in their briefs.under the agreement,pioneer manufactures black circuit breakers for acbc for sale in the united states and acbc has agreed to purchase guaranteed minimums from pioneer.pioneer continues to manufacture gray circuit breakers for sale in canada by pioneer.the agreement forbids pioneer from selling its circuit breakers in the united states for the term of the agreement.the effect of the agreement is that,although acbc originally acquired its rights in the mark from challenger electric,a company,acbc exclusivity of those trademark rights came about through the deal it struck with pioneer,a canadian company.
accordingly,since,both black and gray circuit breakers have been manufactured by pioneer in canada and both bear the trademark,as well as an indication that federal pioneer limited is the manufacturer and that the breakers are manufactured in canada.the parties agree that there are no material differences between acbc black circuit breakers and the gray circuit breakers.finally,the agreement provides that acbc will assign its rights in the trademark to pioneer at the conclusion of the agreement.
from to,oregon breakers sold gray circuit breakers in the united states.oregon breakers purchased the circuit breakers from merchant pier,a canadian distributor of circuit breakers and imported them into the united states for resale.
in sum,this case involves a trademark owner which contracts with a foreign,but historically affiliated manufacturer that owns the identical trademark in the foreign jurisdiction.the foreign trademark owner legitimately manufactures goods for both markets,which goods are identical except for color.a third party then imports identical goods manufactured under the foreign trademark into the united states,in competition with the trademark owner products.
ii.procedural history 
acbc filed suit in the district of oregon asserting claims for trademark infringement,unfair competition,and trademark dilution against oregon breakers.acbc initially sought partial summary judgment on its claim for trademark infringement under of the lanham act,and the related claim of unfair competition under a of the lanham act.
in ruling on the summary judgment motion,the district court pointed out that the gray circuit breakers are manufactured in canada by the same manufacture r from which acbc imports genuine breakers and that pioneer and acbc are not completely at arm length.the court also noted that acbc concedes that there is no material difference between the gray and black breakers.in an opinion and order,the district court denied the motion,however,because there were material questions of fact as to whether the gray circuit breakers were genuine and whether the quality control procedures resulted in differences between the breakers.
after denial of acbc motion,the parties stipulated to entry of final judgment,with acbc reserving its right to appeal the dismissal of the trademark and unfair competition claims.in the stipulation,the parties agreed that 
there are no material differences between acbc black circuit breakers and the gray circuit breakers offered for sale and sold by oregon breakers.the gray circuit breakers accordingly are genuine products as that term is defined by the court at of the opinion and order 
although the stipulation effected a complete dismissal with prejudice of all claims,the parties stipulated that in the event of reversal and an eventual trial,the issues of the strength and meaning of the trademark,and whether acbc has exercised control over the quality of the black circuit breakers manufactured by pioneer for acbc for resale in the united states would be resolved at trial 
the district court accepted the stipulation,entered a final judgment that incorporated the stipulation and various modifications of its earlier opinion and order,and dismissed all of acbc claims.acbc appeals only the dismissal of its claims for trademark infringement and unfair competition.
iii.discussion 
katzel and the emergence of territoriality 
it is now generally agreed and understood that trademark protection encompasses the notion of territoriality.the supreme court ushered in this concept more than eighty years ago in bourjois katzel.understanding katzel in the context of the transition from the notion of universality of trademarks to the emergence of territoriality sheds light on the dispute here.
as mccarthy,one of the leading commentators in the trademark arena notes early cases refused to protect trademark owners from parallel imports of genuine goods obtained from the foreign manufacturer.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,ed.west citing apollinaris scherer,fred gretsch schoening,cir.these early cases were decided under the principle of universality of trademarks.the universality principle 
stands for the proposition that a trademark serves the sole purpose of identifying the source of a product.under this principle,a trademark is valid if it correctly identifies the origin or source of the product,regardless of where the consumer purchases the product.a gray market product does not violate trademark rights under the universality principle as long as it bears a genuine trademark that identifies the source of the product.
jerome gilson,trademark protection and practice.katzel came to the supreme court on a writ of certiorari from the second circuit.the plaintiff in katzel purchased a french cosmetic firm business,along with its goodwill and trademark java,which was used on face powder.katzel,at.the plaintiff continued to purchase the face powder from the french firm and used substantially the same form of box and label as its predecessors but uses care in selecting colors suitable for the american market id.at.the court pointed out that the labels have come to be understood by the public here as meaning goods coming from the plaintiff.id.the defendant was a third party who purchased the same face powder in france and resold it in the united states in the french boxes which closely resemble those used by the plaintiff id.
following precedent based on the principle of universality,the second circuit concluded that there was no trademark infringement.bourjois katzel,cir the question is whether the defendant has not the right to sell this article under the which truly indicate its origin.we think she has.in quick response to the ruling and with the intent of overruling the decision,congress enacted of the tariff act of,while katzel was on appeal.see k mart,at.see also mccarthy,supra.section,which has since been reenacted as of the tariff act,prohibits importation of goods bearing a registered trademark owned by a citizen or corporation.unlike a trademark infringement action under of the lanham act,the remedy under is prohibition of importation of the goods.
the supreme court subsequently reversed the second circuit and held that the plaintiff trademark rights were infringed,though the court did not reference the new legislation.katzel,at.the court reasoned that the monopoly of a deals with a delicate matter that may be of great value but that easily is destroyed,and therefore should be protected with corresponding care.id.at.the court then explained 
it is said that the here is that of the french house and truly indicates the origin of the goods.but that is not accurate.it is the of the plaintiff only in the united states and indicates in law,and,it is found,by public understanding,that the goods come from the plaintiff although not made by it.it was sold and could only be sold with the good will of the business that the plaintiff bought.it stakes the reputation of the plaintiff upon the character of the goods.
id.at.internal citation omitted.
the katzel decision marked a dramatic change in trademark law by adopting the principle of territoriality of trademarks and moving away from the rule of universality.see mccarthy,supra,gilson,supra.under the territoriality principle,a trademark has a separate legal existence in each country and receives the protection afforded by the laws of that country.gilson,supra.
between the supreme court decision in katzel and the early the legal journals were the main battleground over the issue of whether a trademark holder could prevent the importation of genuine gray market goods.bell howell mamiya masel supply.changing world economic conditions during the ushered in a dramatic increase in the number of cases dealing with the issue.see mccarthy,supra.
some courts limited katzel to its particular facts.see,weil ceramics and glass,jalyn,cir we do not read katzel to extend beyond its circumstance.olympus united states,cir holding that of the lanham act did not apply to genuine goods in cases that did not present the same equities as katzel.in contrast,in osawa b h photo,the court thoroughly embraced the shift from universality to territoriality ushered in by katzel,explaining that,under the territoriality principle 
a trademark proper lawful function is not necessarily to specify the origin or manufacture of a good although it may incidentally do that,but rather to symbolize the domestic goodwill of the domestic markholder so that the consuming public may rely with an expectation of consistency on the domestic reputation earned for the mark by its owner,and the owner of the mark may be confident that his goodwill and reputation the value of the mark will not be injured through use of the mark by others in domestic commerce.
more recently,the principle of territoriality has been criticized as obsolete in a world market where information products like computer programs can not be located at a particular spot on the globe.mccarthy,supra.nevertheless,katzel remains good law and found expression in the more recent k mart case.
k mart and gray market goods 
in,the supreme court in k mart provided a useful tutorial on gray market goods.k mart involved a challenge to customs service regulations implementing of the tariff act the court began its opinion by explaining that a good is a good,bearing a valid united states trademark,that is imported without the consent of the united states trademark holder.k mart,at.emphasis added.the court then went on to describe the three general gray market scenarios.
the prototypical context,based on katzel,see id.at,arises where a domestic firm purchases from an independent foreign firm the rights to register and use the latter trademark as a united states trademark and to sell its products here.id.at.if the foreign manufacturer or a third party imports the products into the united states,they would be gray market goods competing with the trademark holder goods.id.
the second gray market scenario is where a domestic firm registers the trademark for goods that are manufactured abroad by an affiliated manufacturer.id.the court detailed three variations that fit under this example a a foreign firm incorporates a subsidiary in the united states which then registers the trademark which is identical to the foreign parent firm trademark in its own name b an firm establishes abroad a manufacturing subsidiary corporation or c an firm establishes abroad its own unincorporated manufacturing division to produce its united states trademarked goods,and then imports them for domestic distribution.id.at.all of these variations involve common control of the united states and foreign trademark holders.see gilson,supra.
the third gray market scenario is where the domestic holder of a united states trademark authorizes an independent foreign manufacturer to use it.k mart,at.emphasis in original.usually the holder sells to the foreign manufacturer an exclusive right to use the trademark in a particular foreign location,but conditions the right on the foreign manufacturer promise not to import its trademarked goods into the united states.id.this situation usually arises when the firm owns both the domestic and foreign trademarks and licenses its use to a foreign manufacturer in a foreign country.see gilson,supra.
