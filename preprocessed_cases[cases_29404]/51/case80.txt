background 
i.the internet and windows 
by way of introduction to this case we incorporate the district court helpful tutorial on the internet and the microsoft windows operating environment as it pertains to this litigation 
the internet is a global network of millions of interconnected computers a can access information that is stored on the internet in repositories called servers.much of the information stored in servers on the internet can be viewed in the form of webpages,which are collections of pictures and information,retrieved from the internet and assembled on the computer screen.websites are collection s of related webpages that are organized and linked together to allow a to move from webpage to webpage easily 
a generally connects to the internet using an internet service provider isp,which allows the computer to communicate with the internet.once a connection to the internet has been established,a may browse or surf the internet by using a software program called an internet browser browser.microsoft internet explorer is one example of a browser program 
to retrieve information from the internet,a may type a specific address,called a domain name,of a website into the address line of a web browser 
alternatively,a can use a search engine to find information by typ ing in a word or words describing what is sought,and the search engine will identify websites and webpages that contain those words.

the district court further explained that 
m any access the internet with computers that use the microsoft windows operating system windows.windows allows a to work in numerous software applications simultaneously.in windows,the background screen is called the desktop.when a software program is launched,a window appears on the desktop,within which the functions of that program are displayed and operate.a may open multiple windows simultaneously,allowing the to launch and use more than one software application at the same time.individual windows may be moved around the desktop,and because the computer screen is,one window may obscure another window,thus appearing to be in front of another window.
id.at internal citations omitted.some programs on a computer,such as a calendar or application,may cause windows to open on the desktop independently of any contemporaneous action by the.see wells fargo,d,see generally id.at providing description of how software applications and web browsers operate in the windows environment,and noting that windows is currently used on approximately of personal computers.
ii.the challenged conduct 
the specific conduct at issue in this case has been described in detail by the district court,see contacts,d at,as well as other courts that have addressed similar claims against whenu,see wells fargo,d at,int l,d.accordingly,we recite only those facts relevant to this appeal.
whenu provides a proprietary software called savenow without charge to individual,usually as part of a bundle of software that the voluntarily downloads from the internet.once installed,the savenow software requires no action by the to activate its operations instead,the savenow software responds to a activities by generating advertisement windows that are relevant to those specific activities.contacts,d at.to deliver contextually relevant advertising to,the savenow software employs an internal directory comprising approximately website addresses and address fragments,search terms and keyword algorithms,wells fargo,d at,that correlate with particular consumer interests to screen the words a types into a web browser or search engine or that appear within the internet sites a visits.
when the savenow software recognizes a term,it randomly selects an advertisement from the corresponding product or service category to deliver to the computer screen at roughly the same time the website or search result sought by the appears.as the district court explained,
the savenow software generates at least three kinds of ad may be a small that appears in the bottom corner of a screen it may be a advertisement that appears behind the webpage the initially visited or it may be a panoramic ad that stretches across the bottom of the computer screen.
contacts,d at.each type of ad appears in a window that is separate from the particular website or page the has accessed.id.in addition,a label stating a whenu for info.appears in the window frame surrounding the ad,together with a button on the top right of the window frame marked that,when clicked by the,displays a new window containing information about whenu and its ads as well as instructions for uninstalling the resident savenow software.id.at nn.
usually there is a delay between the moment a user accesses a website,and the point at which a savenow advertisement appears on the screen.
if a savenow user who has accessed the contacts website and has received a advertisement does not want to view the advertisement or the advertiser website,the user can click on the visible portion of the window,which will move the contacts website to the front of the screen display,with the ad moving behind the website window.or,the can close the website by clicking on its x,or close,button.if the user clicks on the ad,the main browser window containing the contacts website will be navigated to the website of the advertiser that was featured inside the advertisement.
id.at internal citations omitted.
in its complaint,alleges that whenu conduct infringes trademarks,in violation of sections and a of the lanham act,a,by delivering advertisements of competitors,vision direct,to who have intentionally accessed website.although somewhat difficult to discern from the complaint,the allegations that pertain specifically to trademark claims appear to be as follows whenu ads appear on,over,or on top of the website without authorization,and change its appearance as a result,the ads impermissibly appear to be an integral and fully authorized part of website in addition,whenu unauthorized ads interfere with and disrupt the carefully designed display of content on the website,thereby altering and hindering a access to website whenu is thereby and trad ing upon the goodwill and substantial customer recognition associated with the contacts marks and whenu is using trademarks in a manner that creates a likelihood of confusion.
following an evidentiary hearing on motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court held that had demonstrated a likelihood of success on its trademark infringement claims and issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting whenu from utilizing trademarks contacts,d at.whenu appeals the district court decision.
discussion 
whenu challenges the district court finding that whenu uses trademarks within the meaning of the lanham act.see contacts,d at.in the alternative,whenu argues that the district court erred in finding that whenu ads create a likelihood of both source confusion and initial interest confusion,as to whether whenu is somehow associated with or that has consented to whenu use of the ad s.id.at see id.at.because we agree with whenu that it does not use trademarks,we need not and do not address the issue of likelihood of confusion.
legal standards 
preliminary injunction 
to obtain a preliminary injunction,
a party must demonstrate the likelihood of irreparable injury in the absence of such an injunction,and either a likelihood of success on the merits or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation plus a balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting the preliminary relief.
fed.express fed.espresso,cir.we review a district court grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.johnson son,clorox,cir.such abuse will be found if a district court rests its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of fact or makes an error of law.id.
lanham act 
in order to prevail on a trademark infringement claim for registered trademarks,pursuant to or unregistered trademarks,pursuant to a a plaintiff must establish that it has a valid mark that is entitled to protection under the lanham act and that the defendant used the mark,in commerce,in connection with the sale or advertising of goods or services,a,without the plaintiff consent.see time,petersen publ g,cir genesee brewing,stroh brewing,cir.in addition,the plaintiff must show that defendant use of that mark is likely to cause confusion as to the affiliation,connection,or association of defendant with plaintiff,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of the defendant goods,services,or commercial activities by plaintiff.a a see also estee lauder v.the gap,cir gruner jahr usa publ g meredith,cir.
the only issue before us on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion when it entered the preliminary injunction against whenu specifically,whether the district court erred in finding that had demonstrated a likelihood of success on its trademark claims.as a result,the threshold of error required to reverse the district court decision is higher than it would be were we reviewing a decision on trademark claims themselves.that higher threshold is met in this case,however,because the district court erred as a matter of law in finding that whenu uses trademark.because can not establish an essential element of its trademark claims,not only must the preliminary injunction be vacated,but trademark infringement claims must be dismissed as well.
ii.use under the lanham act 
the lanham act defines use in commerce,in relevant part,as follows 
for purposes of this chapter,a mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce 
on goods when 
a it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto,or if the nature of the goods makes such placement impracticable,then on documents associated with the goods or their sale,and 
b the goods are sold or transported in commerce,and 
on services when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services are rendered in commerce 
in issuing the preliminary injunction,the district court held that whenu 
use s mark in two ways.first,in causing advertisements for defendant vision direct to appear when savenow users have specifically attempted to access which plaintiff trademark appears whenu is displaying plaintiff mark in the advertising of defendant vision direct services and,t hus,is using plaintiff marks that appear on plaintiff website.
second,defendant includes plaintiff website address,www contacts.com,which incorporates trademark,in the proprietary directory of terms that triggers advertisements on savenow users computers.in so doing,defendant uses plaintiff mark to advertise and publicize companies that are in direct competition with plaintiff.
contacts,d at.
prior to the district court decision,two other courts had addressed the issue of use as it applies to whenu specific activities and reached the opposite conclusion.in wells fargo,d,the district court denied wells fargo motion for a preliminary injunction after finding that whenu inclusion of plaintiff wells fargo trademarked website address in whenu proprietary directory of keywords was not use for purposes of the lanham act,and that whenu did not alter or interfere with wells fargo website in any manner.id.at.the district court in international,d,employing a very similar analysis,granted summary judgment in favor of whenu after concluding that whenu inclusion of trademarked website address in the savenow directory was not actionable because it was for a pure function that was not use under the lanham act.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in the case before us,the district court consideration of these two comprehensive decisions on the precise issue at hand was confined to a footnote in which it cited the cases,summarized their holdings in parentheticals,and concluded,without discussion,that it disagree d with,and was not bound by these findings.contacts,d at.unlike the district court,we find the thorough analyses set forth in both and wells fargo to be persuasive and compelling.
a.the savenow directory 
the district court held that whenu inclusion of website address in the savenow directory constitutes a prohibited use of trademark.id.at.we disagree.
at the outset,we note that whenu does not use trademark in the manner ordinarily at issue in an infringement claim it does not place trademarks on any goods or services in order to pass them off as emanating from or authorized by.see,d at bean,drake publishers,cir societe comptoir de cotonniere etablissements boussac alexander dep t stores,cir.the fact is that whenu does not reproduce or display trademarks at all,nor does it cause the trademarks to be displayed to a.rather,whenu reproduces website address,www contacts.com,which is similar,but not identical,to trademark.see contacts,d at.
the district court found that the differences between trademarks and the website address utilized by whenu were insignificant because they were limited to the addition of the www.and and the omission of the hyphen and a space.see id.we conclude that,to the contrary,the differences between the marks are quite significant because they transform is entitled to protection under the lanham a word combination that functions more or less like a public key to website.
moreover,it is plain that whenu is using website address precisely because it is a website address,rather than because it bears any resemblance to trademark,because the only place whenu reproduces the address is in the savenow directory.although the directory resides in the computer,it is inaccessible to both the and the general public.see id.at noting that directory is scrambled to preclude access.thus,the appearance of website address in the directory does not create a possibility of visual confusion with mark.more important,a whenu ad can not be triggered by a input of the trademark or the appearance of that trademark on a webpage accessed by the.rather,in order for whenu to capitalize on the fame and recognition of improper motivation both and the district court ascribe to would have needed to put the actual trademark on the list 
in contrast to some of its competitors,moreover,whenu does not disclose the proprietary contents of the savenow directory to its advertising clients nor does it permit
