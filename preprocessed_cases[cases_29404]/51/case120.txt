donald cone and chun yu zhao were convicted of various charges under an indictment arising out of a scheme to import and resell counterfeit pieces of computer networking equipment,some of which bore the trademark of cisco systems,cisco.on appeal,they challenge certain evidentiary rulings made at their joint trial and whether some of the criminal acts alleged can support a conviction for criminal counterfeiting under.additionally,cone challenges whether sufficient evidence supports his conviction for conspiracy and zhao challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on certain substantive counts upon which she was convicted.for the reasons set forth below,we reject zhao and cone attack on the district court evidentiary rulings and cone argument that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence.however,the government theory of prosecution based on a material alteration theory of counterfeiting trademarks is not cognizable under the criminal counterfeiting statute based on the facts of this case.further,the government evidence on count was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain zhao conviction.we therefore vacate the judgment of the district court on certain counts of conviction,affirm the judgment of the district court in all other respects,and remand for resentencing.
background and material proceedings belowa.the factual background 
zhao,then a recent immigrant from the people republic of china china,was recently divorced from junling yang,an indicted in this case who remains at large,when she married cone while living and working in the united states,zhao and cone formed jdc networking,jdc,a licensed distributor of products made by and for cisco.jdc conducted frequent business with a company known as han tong technology han tong,a hong business alleged to be operated by members of zhao family.as a cisco registered partner,jdc was contractually prohibited from purchasing cisco products for resale from outside of the united states,yet records introduced at trial reflect that,from through,jdc imported over shipments from han tong and companies associated with han tong in china containing both genuine cisco products and fake imitations.
in and,while zhao and cone were living together in rockville,maryland,customs and border patrol cbp agents began intercepting and seizing shipments of highly sophisticated counterfeit computer networking products sent from han tong to lucy and donald,at addresses in rockville,maryland.the investigation went cold,however,when the shipper of the counterfeit goods began declaring a very low value for the goods shipped and using variant spellings of the destination address,thus foiling cbp tracking techniques.
from to,jdc marketed computer equipment bearing a cisco mark to consumers and resale outlets.several of jdc customers,however,were dissatisfied with some of the products they purchased from jdc.introduced at trial from jdc customers revealed that some clients believed they had been sold counterfeit or fake products.
zhao filed income tax returns indicating that jdc was struggling and that she was only earning a small salary.in fact,jdc was thriving and producing significant income for her.jdc records reflect that it was purchasing cisco products or purported cisco products in china for resale at considerably below the expected market price for such products and then reselling the products with a high markup.
as jdc thrived,however,zhao marriage to cone deteriorated.in late,cone moved out of the couple home,and zhao moved into a condominium with her yang.upset with zhao over their faltering marriage,cone sent zhao a series of demanding his share of jdc proceeds.in one,he stated i wo let my life get ruined.i will make sure everyone knows the truth about everything.irs,doj,customs,immigration,et cetera i have proof of everything.in another,cone indicated that other companies were returning products to us because they were counterfeit.zhao and cone later divorced.
in,cbp was notified that four pieces of highly sophisticated,very expensive counterfeit networking technology routers bearing cisco marks were seized upon entry from china into the united states,bound for a parcel plus retail storefront in northern virginia and with an estimated value of thousands of dollars per piece of equipment.cbp agents compared the attributes of this shipment with those in the investigation and concluded that the shipments were similar and likely related to the same counterfeiting scheme.
coordinating its efforts with dhl a shipping company and immigration and customs enforcement ice,cbp intercepted the next package sent from china to the address in virginia.when cbp and ice agents opened the package,they discovered over labels bearing a cisco mark that agents suspected to be counterfeit.cbp and ice forwarded the package to an ice facility in washington,where agents coordinated a controlled delivery of the package to the parcel plus retail storefront.agents observed zhao retrieving the package and followed her to her home.cbp and ice agents then executed an anticipatory search warrant at the residence.
in the course of searching zhao home,federal agents discovered,in addition to the shipment of suspected counterfeit cisco labels that led them to zhao,unlabeled transceivers that matched the labels found in the shipment,labeled transceivers,business and financial records,torn labels and label backing,and instructions on how to convert cisco equipment into different models.
as investigators were executing the search warrant at zhao home,a fedex delivery driver attempted to deliver two packages to her.the delivery driver revealed to the agents executing the warrant that zhao maintained a storage unit across the street.although zhao initially denied the existence of the storage unit and later provided law enforcement agents with a false unit number and a false entry code to the storage facility,agents were eventually able to gain access.agents found quantities of boxes filled with equipment bearing a cisco mark filling at least half the storage unit.
after being arrested,zhao was interviewed by ice agent julie hilario for approximately minutes.although zhao initially denied any involvement with counterfeiting and even denied receiving the package that was the subject of the controlled delivery,she eventually admitted that she sold fake cisco products to make a greater profit than with a legitimate product.
as ice and cbp pursued the investigation,agents interviewed cone by telephone he had fled the united states and was living in china.cone admitted that jdc received and resold both real and counterfeit cisco products from han tong which he described as a fake company.vol.v.with respect to authentic cisco products,cone informed agents that he and zhao altered authentic cisco products obtained from china and sold them to clients,representing that they were higher end products than they actually were.cone was later arrested when he returned from china in december.
district court proceedings 
cone and zhao were both indicted by a grand jury along with yang and chun yan zhao,defendant zhao sister in in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia on one count of conspiracy in violation of,with three objects trafficking in counterfeit goods and labels importation and sale of improperly declared goods and wire fraud count and three counts of wire fraud in violation of u.counts,
as relevant to that part of the count conspiracy charge alleging trafficking in counterfeit goods and labels,the government presented at trial three theories underlying the alleged objects of that conspiracy.first,that some of the products seized from zhao residence or sold to were represented to be cisco products but in fact were pure counterfeits,the products were never made by or for cisco.second,other products acquired from legitimate cisco resellers in the united states and abroad were indeed made by or for cisco,but were converted by zhao and cone into a different type of cisco product and represented to buyers as the original of that item the material alteration theory.third,other products acquired from china that were originally made by or for cisco but were relabeled and mislabeled by zhao and cone with new serial numbers to deceive customers into believing that the products were eligible for cisco warranty and services in the united states,when,in fact,such products were not so eligible 
in support of count counterfeiting the government introduced testimony from its expert,cisco engineer michael heidecker,who testified that the four routers seized by cbp in each contained a unique cisco mac address,but that the mac addresses found on the routers were actually assigned to other cisco products.thus,heidecker was able to establish that the four routers were not actually manufactured by cisco.furthermore,they were shipped in packaging that,although displaying a cisco mark,was,according to heidecker,counterfeit.defense expert richard krebs,however,opined that the routers were manufactured by or for cisco,because the mac addresses for each were actually consistent with the mac addresses assigned to cisco and because counterfeiters could not have created the switches due to the prohibitive cost.
craig grant,a manager at vology,a cisco equipment reseller,testified regarding transceivers that are the subject of count counterfeiting.grant testified that vology purchased ten cisco transceivers from jdc,but returned them to jdc because vology was unable to verify the transceivers authenticity.specifically,grant stated that the vology inventory team noted that the transceivers were not packaged in standard cisco packaging.the exact items jdc sold to vology were not available at trial having been returned to jdc and resold.heidecker told the jury that cisco does not sell unlabeled transceivers and packages them in a certain specific manner not followed in the case of vology.
during the government case in chief,zhao lodged timely objections to several items of evidence.first,zhao moved to exclude statements made by cone which she argued incriminated her and therefore required exclusion under bruton united states,d holding that admission of a statement inculpating a in a joint trial violates the rights under the confrontation clause.the district court denied the motion,although it did require the government to excise any mention of zhao name when cone statements were presented to the jury and replace her name with a noun.the court reasoned that there are multiple individuals involved in the conspiracy and therefore,zhao rights under the confrontation clause would not be prejudiced by use of a substitute.accordingly,when cone statements were read into evidence,another individual was substituted for zhao name.
zhao also filed a motion in limine to exclude from jdc customers characterizing certain cisco products purchased from jdc as fake or counterfeit.she argued that the constituted inadmissible hearsay.the district court denied the motion on the grounds that the were to be admitted not for their truth,but rather,as evidence that zhao and cone were on notice that the products jdc sold were not authentic.after the were introduced at trial,zhao requested a limiting instruction from the court that the statements were not to be considered by the jury for their truth.the court replied as follows but did not give the requested limiting instruction.
i believe i said that multiple times to the jury.i say it again.the jury is going to decide what is counterfeit or not.they make up the definition.the say what they say,and the jury will have to decide if they believable or not.that their job.
at the close of the evidence,cone moved pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure for judgment of acquittal on the charges against him.the district court granted the motion with respect to the wire fraud counts,granted it in part to the extent that count conspiracy related to wire fraud,but denied the motion for the remainder of count charging a counterfeiting and importation of misdeclared goods conspiracy.
zhao similarly filed a rule motion as to all of the wire fraud counts,as well as a motion to dismiss counts through the conspiracy charge and the improperly declared goods charges.the district court granted the motion with respect to the wire fraud charges and denied it in all other respects 
in denying the rule motions on the remaining counts,the district court briefly discussed cone and zhao argument that the government material alteration theory exceeded the scope of the federal criminal counterfeiting statute.the court reasoned 
the issue of whether the marks appear on the serial numbers and the various labels including barcodes are encompassed in the definition of spurious mark because labels are being applied to cisco products to give the end user an impression that the goods that were of a higher grade than when they originated from the factory 
the statute has to be interpreted in the light of the meaning,and the presentation of an item as new when it has been altered under a mark is likely to cause confusion and lead the consumer to believe the product was made by the genuine owner of the trademark in the fashion in which it left the factory even though it was not.
the jury returned a mixed verdict,convicting cone of conspiracy the only remaining charge against him,convicting zhao of conspiracy,all four improperly declared goods charges,all four trafficking in counterfeit goods and labels charges,two counts of money laundering,one count of making a monetary transaction with criminally derived proceeds,and three charges not relevant to this appeal.zhao was acquitted on one false statement to law enforcement charge and one money laundering charge.
the district court imposed a sentence upon cone and a sentence upon zhao.both noted timely appeals and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
counterfeiting.material alteration as counterfeiting a mark under 
zhao and cone raise a pointed challenge on appeal to their convictions under count conspiracy to counterfeit and by zhao on the underlying substantive counterfeit charge in count.their argument is that material alteration,one of the government theories of criminal liability under the federal criminal counterfeiting statute,west is not a crime as defined by that statute.
we emphasize at the outset of our analysis,as we noted earlier,that the government alleged several distinct activities as separate acts of counterfeiting and similarly types of conspiracies to counterfeit.in count,for example,the government alleged that the cisco labels found in zhao home and storage locker were completely fake,that is,never manufactured by or for cisco resulting in pure counterfeit labels.as we explain below,that act of counterfeiting is plainly cognizable as violating.what zhao and cone challenge is the government theory of prosecution for material alteration counterfeiting.that is,the government contends counterfeiting of marks includes transactions in which a good bears a genuine and authentic mark,but is altered to be a different product than the one to which the mark was originally fixed.cone and zhao not surprisingly disagree with the government and argue that the criminal counterfeiting statute eliminates from the universe of counterfeit marks any mark that was placed on a good by its authorized manufacturer and confirms that goods that have been marked in that fashion are not counterfeit.opening br.of appellants at as the statute is written,we conclude that cone and zhao have the better argument.
where,as here,we are asked to interpret the language of a criminal statute,we are guided by the relevant canons of construction.
the starting point for any issue of statutory interpretation is the language of the statute itself.in that regard,we must first determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute and our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.we determine the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.
ignacio united states,cir citations omitted.in interpreting a criminal statute,we must be certain that its language clearly identifies the act which is rendered a trespass of the law.i n the interest of providing fair warning of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed,we will construe criminal statute s strictly and avoid interpretations not clearly warranted by the text.wec carolina energy solutions llc miller,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
we look first,therefore,to the plain language of the statute.under a the act made a crime is defined,in relevant part,as intentionally traffic king or attempt ing to traffic in goods or services and knowingly us ing a counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods or services and intentionally traffic king or attempt ing to traffic in labels,boxes,containers,or packaging of any type or nature,knowing that a counterfeit mark has been applied thereto,the use of which is likely to cause confusion,to cause mistake,or to deceive.put succinctly,to obtain a conviction under a,the government was required to prove that cone and zhao trafficked or attempted to traffic in goods or services did so intentionally used a counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods and services and knew the mark was counterfeit.united states lam,cir quoting united states habegger,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the key issue regarding the material alteration theory is what constitutes a counterfeit mark under the statute.a counterfeit mark is defined in e as a spurious mark.that is,a trademark used in connection with goods or labels,that is identical with,or substantially indistinguishable from,a registered mark the use of which is likely to cause confusion,to cause mistake,or to deceive.id.e a i.the statute provides no further definition of what constitutes a spurious mark however,we recently relied on the definition provided by black law dictionary to define the term as deceptively suggesting an erroneous origin fake.lam,at quoting black law dictionary,ed brackets omitted.
in order to subject a defendant to criminal liability under,the government must therefore show that the defendant knowingly trafficked in goods or labels bearing a spurious mark.the requirement of a spurious mark is problematic for the government material alteration theory that cone and zhao obtained a genuine cisco product bearing a genuine mark modified the product,but not the mark then sold the modified product bearing the genuine mark.the government contention is that the modification the material alteration of the cisco product to something other than the exact device cisco originally manufactured transforms not only the genuine product into a counterfeit product but also the genuine mark into a spurious mark.we do not find that can be properly read as the government contends without rewriting the statute an act the congress,but not this court,can undertake.
the concept put forth by the government,that product modification can transform an unaltered genuine mark into a spurious one,does not appear in the plain language of,and is not clearly warranted by the text of that statute.see crandon united states,d.indeed,congress could have explicitly criminalized in the practice of modifying genuine goods that bear a genuine,unaltered mark,but it did not do so.rather,congress made criminal the practice of using a counterfeit mark in connection with traffic king of goods or services,and trafficking in containers and labels with knowledge that a counterfeit,fake mark has been applied thereto.see a.congress has simply not criminalized in the acts that the defendants are accused of committing under the material alteration theory in this case altering a product with a genuine mark but not altering the mark.
while we are confident that the text of a,standing on its own,does not support the government material alteration counterfeit theory,our conclusion is significantly bolstered by the existence of the authorized use exception found at e b.that subsection provides that 
such term counterfeit mark does not include any mark or designation used in connection with goods or services of which the manufacturer or producer was,at the time of the manufacture or production in question,authorized to use the mark or designation for the type of goods or services so manufactured or produced,by the holder of the right to use such mark or designation.
this subsection makes clear that congress did not intend to criminalize,in the statute it adopted,the use of genuine and unaltered marks on goods that were manufactured by or for the mark holder.as one commentator has explained,a plain reading and literal interpretation of the authorized use exclusion excludes from the statute definition of counterfeit goods those products which have their genesis in authorized production.brian kearney,note,the trademark counterfeiting act of a sensible legislative response to the ills of commercial counterfeiting,fordham urb.
our conclusion rejecting the government material alteration theory is further underscored by the novelty of the material alteration approach as posited by the government.indeed,the government cites no case,and we can identify none,where a criminal conviction under the counterfeiting statute has been sustained for the type of material alteration conduct alleged here.the cases the government does cite are significantly distinguishable.
the government asks us to follow united states milstein,cir,a case in which the second circuit affirmed the counterfeiting conviction of a defendant accused of purchasing drugs manufactured for foreign markets,repackaging them for sale in the united states without the consent of the manufacturers,and representing to the public that the drugs were fda approved when they were not.id.at.milstein,however,is inapposite because the defendant obscured the fact that the drugs had been repackaged,and,with his package design,fraudulently conveyed that the foreign drugs had been manufactured as products.id.at.the milstein defendant manufactured counterfeit packaging designed to resemble authentic packaging.id.in this case,by contrast,the cisco mark was and remained a genuine mark.milstein,which involved an actual spurious,fake mark,provides no support for the proposition that genuine marks can lose their genuine character by virtue of alteration only of the good to which the mark was correctly attached when that good was produced.
the government also relies on united states farmer,cir,for the proposition that because alteration removes a measure of quality assurance from the original manufacturer,marketing the altered products as genuine is prohibited under a.in farmer,this court upheld the counterfeiting conviction of a defendant accused of purchasing blank and sweatshirts manufactured for companies like nike and hilfiger,placing those companies logos on the shirts without authorization,and then passing along the shirts to the public as goods.id.at.the defendant in that case purchased authentic shirts from authorized manufacturers,and then affixed the unauthorized mark to represent the good as being marked.
farmer,however,is materially different from the case at bar.critically,the mark that was affixed to the goods at issue was not genuine,being fraudulently affixed by the defendant himself,thereby rendering the mark a spurious mark.in contrast to the marks genuinely affixed by cisco to the goods before being acquired by jdc,the placement of the marks in farmer was never authorized by the manufacturer at any time during the manufacture of the goods in question.see id.at i t was farmer rather than the trademark holder who oversaw the construction of the shirts.farmer therefore does not support the government material alteration theory of counterfeiting that genuine marks lose their genuine character solely from product alteration.
additionally,the government argues that we should adopt,for purposes of the criminal counterfeiting statute,certain trademark applications under the lanham act,et,the statute governing civil trademark disputes the government argues that cases under the lanham act support the proposition that a genuine mark becomes counterfeit when the product is altered in a way not approved by the original manufacturer.see intel terabyte int l,cir by the time the intel markings had been scraped off or printed over,intel did make the chip but it was no longer the source of the product which was being sold.
as the government correctly notes,we recently stated that,b ecause of the similarity between the lanham act definition of counterfeit and the definition of counterfeit mark,we find lanham act civil counterfeiting cases helpful to our analysis of criminal counterfeiting cases brought under a.lam,at helpful though these cases may be,it does not necessarily follow that we import every aspect of civil counterfeiting jurisprudence into the criminal counterfeiting context.indeed,as we recognized in lam,the standard may be construed more narrowly in a criminal context than in a civil context.id.quoting united states guerra,cir.
as a number of courts have recognized,must be construed more narrowly than the civil law definition of counterfeit acts contained in the lanham act.see united states giles,cir w e must construe the criminal counterfeiting statute more narrowly than the lanham act.united states hanafy,cir lanham act precedent is of little value in a case because the lanham act deals with civil liability.citing giles,at guerra,at the identical or substantially indistinguishable standard in the counterfeit context is to be construed more narrowly in a criminal context than in a civil context.
indeed,even the civil cases to have found lanham act liability based on material alteration have acknowledged that such a theory of liability strays from a strict statutory definition of counterfeit.see rolex watch usa,at the original labels are not themselves counterfeits in the literal sense.quoting westinghouse circuit breaker supply,cir.in doing so,those courts relied upon a rationale critical in the civil trademark infringement context the important test is whether the practice of the defendant is likely to cause confusion,not whether the defendant duplicated the plaintiff mark.westinghouse,at citing continental motors continental aviation,cir confusion,or the likelihood of confusion is the real test of trademark infringement.in applying a criminal statute,however,we do not have the freedom to disregard an element of the crime that the defendant did,in fact,employ a counterfeit mark.see a.
moreover,zhao and cone have correctly identified a second material difference between the lanham act and the lanham act lacks an authorized use exception.thus,our conclusion that under the e b authorized use exception congress did not intend to criminalize the use of genuine marks used on goods that were manufactured by or for the mark holder distinguishes this case from those civil cases cited by the government.no court,in interpreting the lanham act to allow material alteration liability,has even had the opportunity to opine on whether an authorized use exception such as that codified at e b,would preclude such liability in the civil context of trademark infringement.
for all the reasons just discussed,we find that criminal liability under can not be based on the alteration of a product to which a genuine mark was affixed and the mark itself has not been altered.the congress can certainly rewrite that statute to cover a material alteration theory,but the statute as now written does not do so.
we must now apply our holding on the scope of to the facts of this case and determine what,if any relief is available to cone and zhao.based on our review of the indictment,and the evidence adduced at trial,we first conclude that zhao conviction under count,a substantive counterfeiting charge against her,must be vacated.
count charged zhao with,on june,intentionally traffic king in a counterfeit cisco unit.the evidence adduced at trial showed that in the u.fish and wildlife service fws purchased an enhanced cisco switch from,which in turn had purchased the switch from jdc.when the switch arrived,officials at fws became aware that they had received a standard model,rather than the enhanced version they had purchased.the mac of the switch was assigned to a standard model,while the serial number on the chassis was assigned to an enhanced switch.thus,the government adduced evidence that a standard model switch was purchased from cisco,which had a proper and genuine cisco mark affixed to it.zhao,through jdc,later upgraded the product to resemble an enhanced model switch,and sold it to as an enhanced switch.the mark,however,was genuinely affixed to the good when manufactured by or for cisco and the mark itself was never altered.that conduct is not,we conclude,criminal counterfeiting because the unaltered genuine mark is not a spurious mark,a required element of the crime under.thus,zhao conviction for count can not stand and must be vacated.
cone and zhao argue that their convictions for conspiracy under count must also be vacated.this is so,they contend,because the jury verdict was a general one and it is impossible to determine whether the conspiracy convictions rested upon the invalid material alteration theory as opposed to the valid theory of improperly declared goods also charged under count.
zhao and cone are correct to state that reversal is required when a case is submitted to a jury on two or more alternate theories,one of which is legally as opposed to factually inadequate,the jury returns a general verdict,and it is impossible to discern the basis on which the jury actually rested its verdict.united states moye,cir en banc citing yates united states.
in this case,however,the jury returned a special,not a general verdict as to count.indeed,the jury was given and utilized,without objection,a special verdict form.on that verdict form the jury found cone and zhao guilty of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods and labels,and separately found them guilty of conspiracy to import and sell improperly declared goods.we recently addressed a similar situation in united states lawson,cir.in that case,after determining that certain juror misconduct rendered a conviction for conspiracy to violate the animal welfare act invalid,we determined whether the defendants convictions for a single count of conspiracy could nevertheless be affirmed where the indictment alleged a conspiracy in the conjunctive.we reasoned that 
in contrast to the general verdict rendered in yates,the verdict in the present case reveals that the jury had two separate bases for convicting the defendants of the conspiracy charges.although the indictment alleged both objects in a single count,the jury verdict forms with respect to each of the defendants listed separate guilty verdicts for count conspiracy animal welfare act june,through april,and count conspiracy illegal gambling business may through april.thus,we are not confronted with a situation in which we are uncertain whether a jury verdict was solely attributable to an underlying conviction which we have set aside on legal grounds.yates,at.accordingly,the conspiracy convictions for the defendants are supported by a valid and independent legal basis that is apparent from the record,and we therefore affirm those convictions.
id.at.likewise,the conspiracy convictions in this case are supported by a valid and independent legal basis,because of the separate verdict form,and we accordingly affirm the conspiracy convictions of both cone and zhao 
our review of the presentence investigation report psr and the record of the sentencing hearing,however,plainly demonstrates that the district court relied on the counterfeiting object of the conspiracy convictions in fashioning the sentences for cone and zhao.because the district court may have utilized what we have now determined would be noncriminal acts under the material alteration theory of counterfeiting conspiracy in arriving at the sentences,we must also vacate the sentences of both cone and zhao and remand for resentencing.
sufficiency of the evidence 
counts and against zhao 
in addition to her challenges to count and count,zhao also argues that counts and should be vacated because the evidence was insufficient,as a matter of law,to prove that she engaged in criminal counterfeiting.we agree with zhao as to count,but not count.
a defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden.united states foster,cir.in a sufficiency of the evidence challenge,we view the evidence on appeal in the light most favorable to the government in determining whether any rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states collins,cir.we review both direct and circumstantial evidence,and accord the government all reasonable inferences from the facts shown to those sought to be established.united states harvey,cir.we do not review the credibility of the witnesses and assume that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government.united states kelly,cir.we will uphold the jury verdict if substantial evidence supports it and will reverse only in those rare cases of clear failure by the prosecution.foster,at.
with respect to the products at issue in count,four routers seized by cbp in,prosecution expert and cisco engineer michael heidecker opined that the mac addresses found on the routers matched physically different products manufactured by cisco.see.furthermore,heidecker opined that the labels applied to the routers were nongenuine.thus,heidecker was able to conclude that the routers at issue were not manufactured by or for cisco and could not be genuinely marked.while zhao expert reached a different conclusion,this conflicting evidence was for a jury to weigh.the jury had ample evidence on which to conclude that zhao was guilty as charged in count.
on count,however,the government did not carry its burden to show that zhao engaged in the criminal counterfeiting of marks.count charges that jdc sold counterfeit cisco transceivers to vology,a reseller of network equipment.the government alleges that these transceivers were not made by or for cisco,but identifies only two pieces of evidence in support of this claim.
first,the government points to testimony from craig grant,a vology manager,who testified that,upon receipt of the transceivers,he was able to tell from his experience that the packaging was not genuine.congress,however,has chosen to bar the government from bringing a criminal cause of action for the repackaging of genuine goods or services not intended to deceive or confuse.g.evidence of repackaging,therefore,is not enough standing alone to prove the goods within that packaging bear a counterfeit mark.the government must come forth with some other evidence that the mark on the actual good is spurious.
to that end,the government second piece of evidence for count is that law enforcement seized additional versions of the transceivers at issue in count from zhao residence,which heidecker opined were not made by or for cisco.however,the vology transceivers were not introduced at trial,having been returned to jdc and resold.whatever marks the additional versions of the transceivers may or may not have borne does not prove the status of the marks on the long gone vology transceivers.no evidence at trial established what marks were on the vology transceivers a burden which fell to the government to bear.
heidecker opined only that the packaging of the transceivers found at zhao home was inauthentic.he gave no testimony about the marks on the vology transceivers.
since the repackaging evidence can not,under the plain terms of g,sustain a conviction under the statute for a counterfeit mark on the goods in the package,and as the government adduced no evidence on the marks on the vology transceivers,the government failed to prove a violation of for the acts charged in count.the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain zhao conviction.
accordingly,while we find that the government adduced sufficient competent evidence to sustain zhao conviction under count,we find that the government did not do so with respect to count,and vacate that count of conviction.
ii.sufficiency of the evidence against cone 
cone individually challenges his conviction for conspiracy to import misdeclared goods count by arguing that the evidence was insufficient and the district court accordingly erred in denying his rule motion for judgment of acquittal.we review the district court denial of a rule motion de novo.lam,at.the legal standard for a sufficiency of the evidence claim is set forth above at.
in count,the government alleged cone participated in a conspiracy to violate,which criminalizes fraudulently or knowingly import ing or bring ing into the united states,any merchandise contrary to law.id.cone was alleged to have conspired to import goods without taking reasonable care to ensure that the goods were properly declared,in violation of a.
to establish a conspiracy under,the government must prove an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime,and an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states ellis,cir.the existence of a tacit or mutual understanding between conspirators is sufficient evidence of a conspiratorial agreement.id.internal quotation marks omitted.proof of the agreement may be established by circumstantial evidence.burgos,at.it is no defense to a conspiracy charge that one role in the conspiracy is minor.see united states laughman,cir once the existence of a conspiracy is established,evidence establishing beyond a reasonable doubt a connection of a defendant with the conspiracy,even though the connection is slight,is sufficient to convict him with knowing participation in the conspiracy.internal quotation marks omitted.
united states kingrea,cir.
with the standards of review in mind,we have little difficulty concluding that the government adduced sufficient evidence from which the jury could properly convict cone under count.cone was unquestionably an active participant in the scheme to sell counterfeit,mislabeled,or undeclared cisco products.the evidence adduced at trial showed that cone confessed to law enforcement that he was a member of that conspiracy.he acknowledged in his confession that he was aware that han tong employees were misdeclaring goods to avoid detection by cbp.furthermore,when he became estranged from zhao,he sent to her demanding his share of proceeds from the conspiracy.
this is not a case,as cone suggests,where an innocent spouse is implicated solely by his marriage to a conspirator.see united states dozie,cir vacating conspiracy conviction against spouse who was never tied to the conspiracy by any of the other persons involved.rather,the record contains ample evidence from which the jury could have properly concluded that cone was an active participant in the conspiracy.we accordingly see no merit to cone contention that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction on count.
iii.money laundering 
zhao further contends her convictions for money laundering must be vacated on the basis that the government incorrect material alteration theory may have formed the basis for her money laundering convictions we agree.
zhao was convicted of two counts count and of concealment money laundering.see a b i a b i.she was also convicted of count,engaging in a monetary transaction with criminally derived proceeds in violation of a collectively the money laundering convictions.
to obtain a conviction under a b i count,the government had the burden to prove four elements 
an actual or attempted financial transaction involving the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity knowledge that the transaction involves the proceeds of some unlawful activity and knowledge that the transaction was designed in whole or in part to conceal the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity.
united states richardson,cir internal quotation marks,brackets,and ellipsis omitted emphasis added.the elements of a violation of a b i,as charged in count,are similar,with the additional requirement that the government prove an international transaction involving the proceeds of unlawful activity.see cuellar united states,d.finally,as to count,a similarly requires the government to allege and prove a transaction involving funds derived from a specified unlawful activity.see united states cherry,cir.
in this case,the district court instructed the jury properly as to each offense,observing that,to sustain a conviction under counts,and,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that zhao engaged in monetary transactions that,inter alia,involved funds derived from the offense of trafficking in counterfeit goods or labels.see.
as the supreme court has explained,
jurors are not generally equipped to determine whether a particular theory of conviction submitted to them is contrary to,for example,the action in question fails to come within the statutory definition of the crime.when,therefore,jurors have been left the option of relying upon a legally inadequate theory,there is no reason to think that their own intelligence and expertise will save them from that error.
griffin united states,d.accordingly,a verdict is required to be set aside in cases where the verdict is supportable on one ground,but not another,and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected.yates united states,d.but see united states hastings,cir if the evidence is such that the jury must have convicted the defendant on the legally adequate ground in addition to or instead of the legally inadequate ground,the conviction may be affirmed.
while it is no doubt correct that the government adduced ample evidence tending to show that zhao committed pure counterfeiting,neither the indictment,nor the evidence adduced at trial allow us to conclude that the jury necessarily convicted zhao of money laundering based on the government pure counterfeiting theory.
agent hilario testified,in support of count,that jdc and han tong engaged in a series of wire transfers in june,designed to conceal the funds source.the source of these funds was derived largely,if not entirely,from sales,by jdc,of goods purchased from han tong.the evidence of these sales,introduced in the form of zhao ledgers,simply does not allow us to determine whether the sales were of pure counterfeits,or of materially altered goods,which,as discussed supra,do not constitute counterfeit marks for the purposes of.
the government evidence in support of count consisted solely of testimony from ice agent raymond orzel,a certified fraud examiner.orzel testified that zhao purchased a home in with funds derived from jdc,han tong,and related entities.in,zhao sold the home to an individual named dan lou,an indicted who rented the home out.however,the government also put forth evidence that the funds lou used to purchase the home were drawn from zhao accounts,and that rent checks made out to lou were deposited in accounts controlled by zhao.once again,the funds at issue were derived from jdc sales of han tong goods.we can not say with any certainty that the jury only considered sales of pure counterfeits when convicting zhao of count.
in support of count,the government adduced evidence that zhao directed that two checks be drawn from jdc accounts to marcie wu,an affiliate of han tong.the checks represented,in large part,the proceeds of the sales of certain cisco switches from jdc to network hardware resale nhr.see.these switches were obtained from han tong,and the evidence adduced at trial demonstrated that the switches were manufactured by or for cisco,and then later altered by zhao.because this conduct is not criminal counterfeiting,the jury verdict of conviction on count rests on an unsound legal basis.
thus,the money laundering convictions must be vacated.count appears to clearly rest on an improper legal basis,and because we can not say with certainty whether zhao convictions on counts and are based on pure counterfeiting,those convictions must be vacated as well.
our distinguished colleague in dissent concurs in the foregoing analysis concerning the material alteration theory,but suggests that zhao conviction on count,a substantive counterfeit charge,should also be vacated.we respect the views of the dissent but do not agree.
the general thesis of the dissent is that,having held that the government material alteration theory of counterfeiting is without legal basis,we should have vacated count owing to improper closing argument by the government.however,at oral argument,when asked by the panel what specific counts of the indictment would be affected by our rejection of the material alteration theory,counsel for zhao responded that such a holding would most clearly affect substantive count and count conspiracy.audio recording of oral argument at.counsel,of course,could have argued that vacatur of count was appropriate as well,but chose to focus entirely on counts and.this is not surprising,as the record is conclusively clear that at no point in the district court or this court,did zhao raise a claim of error under the material alteration theory as to count.this concept arises sua sponte for the first time in the dissent.
the representations of zhao counsel to the panel at oral argument were entirely consistent with the arguments set forth in her briefs before this court and the district court.indeed,although zhao contends that count should be vacated,her argument rests entirely on a sufficiency of the evidence basis,which we rejected in section ii a ii,above.see opening br.of appellant at.
the dissent acknowledges as much,but argues that because the government argued a legally incorrect theory to the jury in closing argument,deference to the jury verdict is not warranted.to reach this result,the dissent analyzes the government remarks under united states lighty,cir.again,a construct appearing for the first time now,sua sponte,and which,under our precedent,has long since been waived by zhao.
zhao never made the argument that is the lynchpin of the dissenting opinion that the prosecutor closing comments,in and of themselves,constitute reversible error.see post at a prosecutor comments constitute reversible error if.zhao briefs on appeal are utterly devoid of any reference to the lighty factors because zhao does not make a standalone challenge to the government statements in closing argument.rather,to the extent that zhao discusses the prosecutor closing arguments at all,it is for purposes of the harmless error analysis under count only.
zhao failure to raise this independent assignment of error,either in brief or at oral argument,regarding the government comments to the jury is fatal to the position advocated by the dissent.see united states strieper,floyd,citing edwards city of goldsboro,cir this argument does not appear in appellant brief,and as such,it is waived.granting relief on a basis not advanced by zhao and arguably disclaimed at oral argument is plainly improper for all the reasons the rule of waiver is in force.the government has not had any opportunity to respond to the claim of error advanced by the dissent,nor was it ever placed before the district court for consideration see cavallo star enterprise,cir the appellants omission of the issue from their initial brief denied appellee an opportunity to respond,so considering it now would be unfair to the appellee and would risk an improvident or opinion on the legal issues raised.quoting hunt nuth,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
additionally,we do not consider the issue of the prosecutor comments on appeal as they were not preserved by zhao in the district court.we have long held that the failure to object to a prosecutor statements made during closing arguments constitutes a waiver of that claim of error.see united states sawyer,cir i f defense counsel does not object during the course of the government closing argument he may be said to have waived the point.
the mere fact that zhao challenged,as a general matter,the material alteration theory presented by the government is insufficient to preserve the claim of error formulated by the dissent.this is so because,as explained above,the dissent theory is based on a stand alone prosecutorial misstatement claim.indeed,the dissent acknowledges that the theory presented by the prosecution during closing statements was even broader than the material alteration theory advanced in the government proposed jury instruction.post,at.accordingly,zhao challenge to the government proposed jury instructions would not preserve a claim of error as to the prosecutor unchallenged remarks in closing.
it is for that reason that the dissent reliance on lacy csx transportation,is unavailing.in that case,as the dissent observes,the court found that an unsuccessful motion in limine was sufficient to preserve a challenge to later closing remarks by the opposing party so long as the argument fell within the scope of the court earlier ruling on the motion.id.at.in this case,though,as the dissent acknowledges,zhao succeeded in her motion in limine.it makes sense,therefore,that if the prosecutor closing remarks ran afoul of the district court prior ruling,zhao should have timely objected to alert and afford the court an opportunity to correct any error 
the dissent does correctly observe that zhao brief on appeal mentions the government closing arguments.but even a superficial reading of the briefs demonstrates that,far from raising an independent challenge to the prosecutorial statements,zhao was merely describing what the prosecutor said,or,in one case,noting that any error in the government theory of prosecution was.see appellants br.at.the dissenting opinion goes several steps farther,raising,for the first time,a stand alone challenge to the prosecutorial remarks.
for those reasons,the cases cited by the dissent in favor of its position are,in our view,inapposite.judge floyd dissent in lam,for example,cited twice in the dissenting opinion,observed that the district court has sustained repeated objections to the prosecutorial statement.lam,at.here,the district court did not sustain any objection because none was made.thus the government was deprived of the opportunity to make the case that its argument was proper,and the district court was deprived of the opportunity to correct any purported error.see united states hargrove,cir hargrove failed to object at the time,thus denying the district court the opportunity to consider hargrove argument and correct the purported error.
accordingly,while we respect the views of the dissent,we do not agree that the claim of error on which the dissent would vacate count was properly preserved by the zhao or raised in this court or the district court.
confrontation clause 
zhao argues that the district court committed reversible error by admitting cone statements to agent hilario into evidence against her.the core of zhao claim is that substituting another individual for her name made it obvious to the jury that she was the person referenced and thereby violated her sixth amendment confrontation clause rights.
in bruton,the supreme court held a defendant is deprived of his rights under the confrontation clause when his nontestifying codefendant confession naming him as a participant in the crime is introduced at their joint trial,even if the jury is instructed to consider that confession only against the codefendant.richardson marsh,d citing bruton united states,d.this court reviews de novo an evidentiary ruling implicating the confrontation clause.united states palacios,cir.
in united states akinkoye,cir,we summarized supreme court precedent as holding that if a redacted confession of a codefendant given to the jury by testimony or in writing shows signs of alteration such that it is clear that a particular defendant is implicated,the sixth amendment has been violated.id.at.we further noted that the supreme court precedent did not directly address the situation in that case namely,whether redacted statements that refer to the existence of another party who may be the defendant through symbols or neutral pronouns are admissible,and observed that t he supreme court has strongly implied that such statements do not offend the sixth amendment.id.at.
in akinkoye,the confessions were retyped so as to replace the defendants respective names with the phrase another person or another individual.id.the retyped versions were read to the jury,and the jury neither saw nor heard anything in the confessions that directly pointed to the other defendant.id.accordingly,we held that the defendants confrontation clause rights were not violated by the redacted statements because use of the neutral phrase another person did not facially implicate the defendant.id.
applying the holding of akinkoye to the case at bar,we readily conclude that substitution of zhao name with another individual was sufficient to protect zhao rights under the confrontation clause.the phrase another individual does not facially implicate zhao.only by reference to other evidence could the jury have arrived at the conclusion that zhao was the actual subject of cone out of court statement.in such circumstances,we have concluded that the confrontation clause is not offended,and thus zhao claim lacks merit.
introduction of customer e mails 
cone and zhao last argue that the district court erred in admitting certain from jdc customers complaining that jdc products were counterfeit and fake.although the district court determined that the were introduced for a purpose,to show that zhao and cone were on notice that they were selling counterfeit goods,the court declined to give a limiting jury instruction to that effect and instead stated that the say what they say and the jury will have to decide if they believable or not.that their job.cone and zhao contend that the court actions constitute reversible error.
this court reviews evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion and will only overturn an evidentiary ruling that is arbitrary and irrational.united states cloud,cir quoting united states cole,cir.evidentiary rulings are subject to harmless error review,such that any error is harmless where we may say with fair assurance,after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.united states johnson,cir.
at the outset,we believe that the district court properly admitted the for the purpose of showing that cone and zhao were on notice as to the counterfeit nature of the goods they sold.see weinstein federal evidence a out of court statement not hearsay when offered not for its truth but to prove the extent of a recipient notice of certain conditions.
we are troubled,however,by the court response to counsel request for a limiting instruction.indeed,while the may have been properly admitted for a reason other than their truth,the district court stated just the opposite that the jury will have to decide if they believable or not.in other words,the court erroneously instructed the jury to consider statements contained in the for the truth of the matter asserted.
the government contends,nonetheless,that the court statement was not error because the statements in the could have been admitted under a hearsay exception,namely the business records exception to the hearsay rule,found at federal rule of evidence.we are not persuaded.
rule b allows for the introduction of records that are kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business.for a record to be admitted as a business record,it must be made by a regularly conducted business activity,kept in the regular course of that business,the regular practice of that business to make the memorandum,and made by a person with knowledge or from information transmitted by a person with knowledge.clark city of,cir quoting.
however,present unique problems of recent vintage in the context of the business records exception.as one district court recently explained 
courts are in disagreement on whether emails can and should fall under the business records hearsay exception.the business records exception assumes that records containing information necessary in the regular running of a business will be accurate and reliable.see certain underwriters at lloyd london sinkovich,cir.email,however,is typically a more casual form of communication than other records usually kept in the course of business,such that it may not be appropriate to assume the same degree of accuracy and reliability.as email is more commonly used to communicate business matters both internally and externally,however,more formal paper records are becoming more unusual.
its my party,live nation,no.jfm,wl at,unpublished.the district court in that case excluded the on the basis that the more specificity is required regarding the party recordkeeping practices to show a particular email in fact constitutes a reliable business record.id.
while properly authenticated may be admitted into evidence under the business records exception,it would be insufficient to survive a hearsay challenge simply to say that since a business keeps and receives,then ergo all those are business records falling within the ambit of rule b.an created within a business entity does not,for that reason alone,satisfy the business records exception of the hearsay rule.morisseau dla piper,d.the district court observation that the were kept as a regular operation of the business is simply insufficient on that basis alone to establish a foundation for admission under rule b.accordingly,because the could not,on this record,be admitted under an exception to the hearsay rule,the district court failure to give the limiting jury instruction was error.
we conclude,however,that the any error in the court jury instructions or failure to give an limiting instruction was harmless.in the context of a jury trial in which the government adduced overwhelming evidence of cone and zhao guilt,we can not conclude that cone or zhao were prejudiced by this single error concerning a minute portion of the total evidence against them.as discussed above,the government further introduced physical evidence in the form of counterfeit labels seized from zhao home and storage unit.the government also introduced routers seized by cbp,that heidecker a cisco engineer identified as counterfeit goods.
the government also introduced evidence from cone and zhao themselves.in addition to zhao confession at the time of her arrest that she sold fake goods in order to make more money,the government introduced incriminating from cone to zhao wherein cone threatened to reveal the counterfeiting scheme to law enforcement if he did not receive his share of proceeds from the criminal venture.in sum,the government evidence against cone and zhao was more than ample,and we conclude that the district court jury instruction with respect to certain from jdc customers was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
because we conclude that the government material alteration theory of counterfeiting is not encompassed within the statutory crime of counterfeiting marks,we vacate zhao conviction on count.in light of this holding,we must vacate zhao convictions for counts,and.we further hold that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain zhao conviction on count and also vacate that conviction.we also vacate the sentences of both cone and zhao and remand for resentencing in light of our holding today.we affirm the judgment of the district court in all other respects.
affirmed in part,vacated in part,and remanded 
i concur with the majority conclusion that the government material alteration theory is not supported by the plain language of the criminal trademark counterfeiting statute.as a result,i also agree that this court must reverse defendant zhao conviction on count,which involved a networking switch that the government concedes was manufactured by or for cisco,and her three money laundering convictions,which were tainted by the material alteration theory.i further concur that the government adduced insufficient evidence to convict defendant on count because the government evidence at most showed that defendant zhao repackaged a genuine cisco product.
however,i can not join the majority in affirming defendant zhao conviction on count,the remaining trademark counterfeiting conviction potentially tainted by the errant material alteration theory.the government and defendant zhao presented conflicting evidence regarding whether the products at issue in count were manufactured by or for cisco.in affirming that conviction,the majority considered the evidence adduced at trial in the light most favorable to the government.but such deference is unwarranted because the government argued its legally incorrect alteration theory to the jury and the district court did not provide an adequate instruction to the jury regarding when a product that has its genesis in authorized production can serve as the basis for a trademark counterfeiting conviction.because we do not know whether the jury properly credited the government evidence or improperly credited the government errant legal theory,this conviction also should be reversed.
in addition,i write separately to clarify that in resentencing defendants zhao and cone on their conspiracy convictions the district court should not take into account evidence that defendants altered one other type of cisco product,which,like the switch at issue in count,the government concedes was not manufactured by or for cisco.i further emphasize that this panel was not tasked with answering,and thus did not decide,whether the repackaging of an altered,but genuine product in a manner violates section as a matter of law.
before explaining why defendant zhao conviction on count should be reversed,it is first useful to provide some additional background on section,the government material alteration theory,and the district court instruction on the definition of counterfeit under section.
section a makes it unlawful for anyone to intentionally traffic or attempt to traffic in goods or services and knowingly use a counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods or services the statute defines a counterfeit mark as a spurious mark that is used in connection with trafficking in any goods or services that is identical with,or substantially indistinguishable from,a registered mark the use of which is likely to cause confusion,to cause mistake,or to deceive e a.
section includes two provisions that deal with when the resale of an authentic or genuine good can serve as the basis for a trademark counterfeiting conviction an authorized use exception and a repackaging,or gray goods,exception.as the majority correctly notes,the authorized use exception excludes from the definition of counterfeit mark any mark used in connection with goods or services of which the manufacturer or producer was,at the time of the manufacture or production in question,authorized to use the mark by the trademark holder.f.the second exception bars the government from bringing a criminal cause of action for the repackaging of genuine goods or services not intended to deceive or confuse.g.this applies to gray goods,which are goods that are authentic and that have been obtained from overseas and imported into the united states.united states hanafy,cir.
in hanafy,the fifth circuit approvingly quoted its district court regarding the relationship between the two exceptions 
a common denominator of these two exceptions is that the goods to which the mark is attached were manufactured by,or with the permission of,the owner of the mark that is,the goods themselves are genuine.that congress saw fit to exempt gray market goods and authorized users from criminal liability lends support to an interpretation that was intended to prevent trafficking in goods that were similar to but different than the goods normally associated with the mark.
id.quoting united states hanafy,d.thus,the two exceptions jointly indicate that congress intended generally to exclude from liability under section sellers of goods that have their genesis in authorized production.such an exclusion makes sense one of the primary rationales for protecting trademarks is that they assist consumers in identifying the source of goods.obx stock,bicast,trademark law,at a general level enabl es consumers readily to recognize products and their source and to prevent consumer confusion between products and between sources of products.therefore,it would make little sense for congress to hold a reseller criminally liable for attaching a mark to a product if the mark correctly identifies the source of the product,and does so in a nondeceptive manner.
prior to trial,the government submitted a lengthy proposed instruction regarding the definition of counterfeit,which provided,in pertinent part 
a defendant can not purchase genuine products manufactured by or for the registered owner,materially alter those products,and then offer the products for resale as genuine or unaltered products such modifications convert a genuine product into a counterfeit product.
this language was drawn almost entirely from federal district and appellate court decisions in civil actions brought under the trademark counterfeiting provisions in the lanham act.
defendants zhao and cone filed a motion in limine seeking an advance ruling on the government proposed instruction,arguing that the material alteration theory was not supported by the plain language of section and had never been applied in criminal cases brought under the statute.defendants requested that the material alteration language not be used,and instead proposed that the instruction state,in pertinent part 
a mark is counterfeit if,and only if the challenged mark is spurious,which means false or inauthentic 
because a counterfeit mark must be false or inauthentic,the definition of counterfeit mark does not include any mark used in connection with goods or applied to labels or packaging if,at the time of manufacture of the goods or production of the labels or packaging,the manufacturer or producer was authorized to use the mark for the type of goods or packaging being made 
the use of an inauthentic mark in the repackaging of genuine goods does not constitute use of a counterfeit mark if it is done without any intent to deceive or confuse as to the authenticity of the goods.
thus,defendants proposed instruction on the definition of counterfeit included both the authorized use and repackaging exceptions.
noting that a material alteration instruction had not previously been given in a criminal trademark counterfeiting case,the district court expressly rejected the government proposed instruction.instead,the court elected to use the model instruction set out in leonard sand et,modern federal jury instructions,instruction.in comments on the model instruction,sand states that f urther instruction may be required when the prosecution involves goods other than the typical containing a false label.sand,supra.
emphasizing that the parties agreed that this was not the typical case,at the conclusion of evidence,the government renewed its request that the court instruct the jury on the material alteration theory.although the government and defendants agreed that the sand instruction was inadequate,they could not agree on how it should be modified.rather than choosing between the government and defendants proposed instructions,the district court modified the sand instruction by quoting section authorized use exception,instructing the jury,in pertinent part 
a counterfeit mark is one that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from a registered trademark,the use of which is likely to confuse,cause mistake or deceive the public in general 
i instruct you that as a matter of law,the counterfeiting statute in this case does not criminalize any mark or designation used in connection with goods or services if the manufacturer or producer was at the time of the manufacture or production in question authorized to use the mark or designation for the type of goods or services so manufactured or produced.
although it quoted the authorized use exception,the district court did not quote or paraphrase the repackaging exception.
with this background in mind,turn with me to defendant zhao conviction on count,which covered four network routers bearing cisco trademarks sold by jdc.
defendant zhao contends her conviction must be reversed because the evidence adduced by the government would only be sufficient to support a trademark counterfeiting conviction under the government errant material alteration theory,which she contends that the government impermissibly argued to the jury.in particular,defendants note that after the district court had instructed the jury and despite the fact that the court had rejected the government proposed material alteration instruction,the government still argued in its closing that altering and then reselling a genuine good constitutes illegal trademark counterfeiting for purposes of section.
for example,during its initial closing argument,the government argued that defendants engaged in 
illegal upgrading if they were just buying things in china and selling in the,they could have done that.but they were upgrading them.they were changing them.they were making them new products.
similarly,during its rebuttal argument,the government defined counterfeit as follows 
defendants were taking one product and converting it to another.they were making a product in chantilly,virginia.that not a cisco product any more.cisco has standards for its products,quality control.what they did is they took software to change what those products did.they do know what they actually could do with that software.maybe it turned it into something unusable.they took that risk and then they packaged it up with a cisco logo on it and sold it.that counterfeit.those are not cisco products.once you make that alteration,it something different.
this argument,referred to hereafter as the alteration theory,was even broader than the material alteration theory advanced in the government proposed jury instruction because it suggested that any alteration,no matter how minor,to a product manufactured by or for a mark holder and sold under the original mark violates section.
before reaching defendant zhao argument that these remarks constitute reversible error,it is first necessary to address whether this issue is properly before us on appeal.although not disputing the merits of this argument,the majority maintains that defendant zhao waived any argument regarding the government remarks because she did not timely object below and failed to adequately raise the issue on appeal.i disagree.
at the outset,it is worth noting that the general rule is that the government waives waiver by failing to argue on appeal that the defendant did not preserve a given argument.see,united states quiroz,cir united states beckham.here,the government did not argue in its briefs or at oral argument that defendants waived any challenge to the government closing remarks by failing to contemporaneously object.appropriately,the same degree of scrutiny for preserving issues on appeal should be applied to the government as the majority seeks to apply to defendants.if done so here,then we must conclude that the government waived the waiver argument advanced by the majority.
nonetheless,regarding whether defendant zhao preserved this issue below,the majority correctly notes that the general rule is that counsel for the defense can not remain silent,interpose no objections,and after a verdict has been returned seize for the first time on the point that the comments to the jury were improper and prejudicial.united states socony vacuum oil.an appellate court,however,may consider improper remarks by counsel in exceptional circumstances such as if the remarks were obvious,or if they otherwise seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.id.at quotation omitted.this court has indicated that exceptional circumstances exist when comments by the prosecution cause actual prejudice to a defendant.united states elmore,cir.
additionally,this court has held that motions in limine preserve issues that they raise without any need for renewed objections at trial,just so long as the movant has clearly identified the ruling sought and the court has ruled upon it.united states williams,cir.for example,we have held that when a party moves in limine to exclude evidence,the party need not renew its objection when evidence within the scope of the motion is introduced at trial.united states ruhe,cir see also.b.although we have not previously had occasion to apply this rule in the context of motions in limine to preclude the jury from considering a particular legal theory,the same logic applies because counsel is restricted to arguing the law in accordance with the principles espoused in the court instructions,united states trujillo,cir,if a party moves in limine to bar the jury from considering a particular legal theory and the court rules on that motion,it need not renew its objection when the opposing party argues the legal theory at trial,see lacy csx transp,t o preserve error with respect to closing arguments by an opponent,a party need not contemporaneously object where the party previously objected to the trial court in limine ruling permitting such argument,and the argument subsequently pursued by the opponent reasonably falls within the scope afforded by the court ruling.
the majority contends that lacy is inapposite because in that case the party motion in limine to preclude the jury from considering a particular legal theory was unsuccessful,whereas here defendant zhao motion in limine seeking to exclude the material alteration theory was successful.but it is paradoxical to argue that a party need not contemporaneously object when an opposing party argues a legal theory that was explicitly accepted by the court but must contemporaneously object at risk of waiver when an opposing party argues a legal theory that was explicitly rejected by the court.such a holding would unfairly reward parties that violate a court in limine rulings and is contrary to the policy underlying motions in limine,which is to allow a party to exclude from consideration of the jury a prejudicial matter without drawing attention to the matter by having to contemporaneously object to it.see jeffrey ghent,annotation,modern status of rules as to use of motion in limine or similar preliminary motion to secure exclusion of prejudicial evidence or reference to prejudicial matters,a.
here,defendants did not contemporaneously object to the government statements during its closing.at the same time,defendants did not remain silent or interpose no objections to the government efforts to get the material alteration theory before the jury.rather,defendants repeatedly sought to bar the jury from considering the theory on two occasions defendants successfully asked the district court to exclude the government proposed material alteration instruction after the government completed its case in chief,defendant cone sought to have the trademarking counterfeiting counts dismissed on grounds that the alteration theory is not supported by the plain language of section during their closing argument,defendants sought to diminish the prejudice from the prosecution statements by arguing that the alteration theory espoused in the government closing was contrary to the court instruction and,after the jury rendered its verdict,defendants sought to have their convictions set aside on grounds that the government impermissibly argued the alteration theory to the jury.because the government alteration theory was within the scope of defendants motion in limine,which the court definitively ruled upon prior to closing arguments,it was unnecessary for defendants to renew their objection to the theory when,contrary to the court ruling,the government argued the errant theory to the jury.
the majority maintains that defendant zhao motion for acquittal does not argue that the government closing remarks regarding the material alteration theory were improper and a basis for acquittal.to the contrary,as her brief notes,appellant br.at,defendant zhao motion explicitly incorporated all arguments made by defendant cone regarding the criminal trademark counterfeiting counts in his motion for acquittal.and defendant cone motion for acquittal states 
the government argued,and the jury considered,the theory that cone agreed to materially alter equipment,and that this activity constitutes a violation of.because the jury considered an impermissible basis for liability under and the court is unable to determine the basis for the jury guilty verdict,cone must be granted a new trial pursuant to rule.
thus,defendant zhao did argue in her motion for relief that the government closing remarks constituted a basis for her acquittal.
but even if defendants repeated efforts to preclude the jury from considering the alteration theory were inadequate to preserve the issue,i believe that this is one of those few cases where exceptional circumstances warrant consideration of the government remarks on appeal.the government remarks caused defendant zhao actual prejudice because they misled the jury into believing that any alteration of a good manufactured by or for a mark holder would be sufficient,by itself,to support a conviction under section.yet the majority correctly holds that modifying a genuine good,without modifying the mark on the good,does not run afoul of section.ante at.thus,at a minimum,defendants were prejudiced by the government comments because they may have led the jury to incorrectly believe that defendants could be convicted for modifying a genuine product even if the jury found that defendants did not alter the mark on the product.see united states mitchell,cir holding that prosecution appeal to improper legal theory during closing argument constitutes prejudicial plain error united states chong lam,cir floyd,dissenting stating that a misstate ment of the relevant legal standard by the prosecution during closing arguments is prejudicial.
the majority also contends that defendant zhao failed to adequately raise this issue on appeal,arguing that zhao has never raise d a claim of error under the material alteration theory as to count and never argued that the government closing remarks constitute reversible error.ante,at.but the majority position is belied by defendant zhao briefs.
first,after arguing at length that this court should reject the government material alteration theory by adopting a narrower interpretation of section,defendant zhao brief states 
if the court adopts the narrower interpretation of section that the plain language and the rule of lenity require,two conclusions follow.first,the government failed to prove that zhao trafficked in counterfeit goods as charged in counts,and.those convictions therefore must be reversed,as must the associated money laundering convictions counts,and.
appellants br.at.moreover,during her discussion of count in particular,defendant zhao asserts that the government evidence showed,at most that a serial number programmed inside a genuine cisco product was altered by someone.appellants br.at emphasis added.thus,defendant zhao repeatedly contended that the government errant alteration theory improperly tainted her conviction on count.
second,defendant zhao opening and reply briefs also repeatedly take issue with the government closing remarks,referencing them on at least five occasions.appellants br.at,appellants br.at.in particular,defendant zhao summarizes her argument as follows 
the district court rejected the government unprecedented material alteration instruction.but the court permitted the government to argue a version of the legal theory to the jury,and it denied appellants motions challenging the theory and the verdicts that resulted.the district court instructional ruling and its acceptance of the jury verdicts can not be reconciled.
appellants br.at.therefore,defendant zhao unambiguously argued in her opening brief that the government closing remarks regarding the alteration theory improperly tainted the jury verdict.
in sum,defendant zhao repeatedly argued below and on appeal that both the material alteration theory and the broader alteration theory tainted her trademark counterfeiting convictions because the government improperly argued the theories to the jury.indeed,defendant zhao challenges to the alteration theory were and are the central issue in this case.the government has repeatedly had the opportunity to respond to defendant zhao objections on the issue,and in each case has argued that the theory is correct and thus her convictions must be affirmed.the majority correctly rejects the government arguments and vacates or modifies all of defendant zhao convictions that were potentially impacted by the government errant alteration theory,except for count.given the centrality
