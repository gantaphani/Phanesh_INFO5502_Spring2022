this is an immense,unwieldy,complex,multiparty commercial case,now in its ninth year and on its second district judge.the case has been protracted unduly and should probably have been resolved on summary judgment years ago.the principal issues concern the interpretation of a trademark licensing agreement and japanese trademark law.in,a major producer of and products its home page,under brands,states that alberto company flagship brand after years remains a favorite of millions of women and men throughout the world,offering solutions from daily hair care to innovative styling products,sold japanese trademark registrations,covering trademarks.the buyer was a japanese manufacturer of such products named sunstar plus an affiliate,kaneda,kosan,kabushiki kaisha,that need not be discussed separately we pass over other immaterial facts as well.most of the trademarks are forms or variants of those that are not have no bearing on the litigation.the forms or variants,as presented in appendices to the license agreement,are as follows 
the agreement of sale provided that upon receiving the trademarks sunstar would transfer them to bank one corporation to hold in trust for years,to license their use during this period to sunstar,and at the end of the period to return them to sunstar.if at any time while the trust was in force the trustee had a reasonable ground for thinking sunstar had committed an act that created a danger to the value or validity of licensor,bank one ownership and title in licensed trademarks,sunstar would have to stop using the endangered trademarks until the trustee reasonably determined that the danger had passed.in the event of an actual breach of the license by sunstar,the trustee was to rescind the license and return the trademarks to.
the license agreement the terms of which were negotiated by sunstar and,bank one duties being limited to enforcement calls the license granted sunstar a senyoshiyoken,which in english means right.the holder of a senyoshiyoken not only has an exclusive right to use the licensed trademarks within the geographical scope of the license see next paragraph but can sue infringers of the trademarks in its own name.the grantor of the this case the use the trademarks while the license is in force.japanese trademark act,iii.
sunstar,for its part,was forbidden by the agreement to export any products bearing the licensed trademarks to countries in which was selling products under any of the trademarks,had granted an exclusive license to a third party to sell such products,or had registered or applied to register any of the trademarks licensed to sunstar.although the agreement forbids sunstar to register except for the purpose of defending the licensed trademarks any new trademarks containing the names alberto,alberto or or any of the names or marks set forth in the appendices to the agreement,sunstar is not forbidden to use new trademarks in japan.
all the products sold under the license are made by sunstar as far as the record reveals sells no no products,japan.the agreement does not require sunstar to pay royalties for using the licensed trademarks the entire compensation to for the license consisted of payments totaling more than million by sunstar made in when the license agreement was made.
the difference between obtaining a exclusive trademark license with no royalty obligation and buying trademarks outright is small.sunstar had wanted to buy the trademarks outright but had balked because it wanted to restrict sunstar ability to use them in countries in which used or might want to use them these restrictions take up more space in the license agreement than any other subject,and doubtless also because it wanted to be able to recapture and then relicense the use of the trademarks in japan should sunstar for some reason stop using them.
in sunstar asked for permission to license this new variant of the trademark 
refused.sunstar used the variant anyway,contending that it did not violate the license.but the trustee said it did.negotiations between and sunstar ensued,and ultimately sunstar agreed to pay million for the right to add the variant to the list of licensed trademarks and register it,and for some trade secrets.
ten years later,sunstar started using a further variant,consisting mainly of a different typeface for,but also adding a black background and a vertical bar rather than a space between the o and the 
sunstar describes this as a modernized version of the licensed trademarks,which we assume means alluring to modern japanese consumers.refused to amend the agreement to permit sunstar to use the modernized version,and,as before,the trustee commanded sunstar to it refused to do,instead filing this suit in against both and bank one.the suit,which invokes federal jurisdiction under a because it is between a foreign citizen sunstar and two citizens and bank one,seeks a declaration that sunstar use of the mark is permitted by the license.sunstar sought other relief as well,including damages from bank one,but has abandoned the additional claims,as a beneficiary of the license agreement,filed a suit against sunstar,seeking damages and injunctive relief,including an order that the license be rescinded and the trademarks returned to.the suits were consolidated,and tried to a jury.
the agreement is in english and states that disputes arising under it are to be resolved in accordance with the law of illinois.but we can not look to illinois law to define senyoshiyoken,a term the meaning of which is given by japanese law.illinois law will not tell us whether the holder of a senyoshiyoken can use variants of its licensed trademarks.has taken the position that the parties used the term merely to indicate that sunstar could register the license with the japanese trademark office,and not to confer on sunstar the rights that a senyoshiyoken confers on the holder under japanese law.the district judge agreed,and refused to instruct the jury on the legal meaning of the japanese term.under rule of the civil rules,the judge decides the meaning of relevant foreign law and instructs the jury on that meaning,just as it would do in the case of issues of domestic law.the parties had submitted affidavits from experts on japanese law concerning that meaning,but the judge,thinking the japanese legal meaning irrelevant,did not try to determine it.argues that sunstar forfeited any challenge to the judge ruling by failing to ask him to instruct the jury on the legal meaning of senyoshiyoken.but he had made his position clear and sunstar lawyers were not required to ask him to reconsider it.
in the course of its deliberations,the jury sent a note to the judge asking what exclusive rights does the senyoshiyoken license give sunstar please be explicit the judge declined to answer,and the jury then returned a verdict for,except that it awarded no the excellent reason that there were none.the judge then enjoined sunstar from using the variant also ordered the license agreement terminated because of sunstar breach and all the licensed trademarks therefore returned to.is from the judge refusal to grant a broader injunction we shall not have to consider the merits of the.
we can not find any basis for the proposition embraced by the district judge that the term senyoshiyoken bears a private meaning in the contract.only if sunstar was the holder of a senyoshiyoken within the meaning that japanese law assigns to that term,rather than in some idiosyncratic sense that the parties assigned to it nor did they say they were doing that,was it authorized to register the license agreement,as concedes sunstar was authorized to do,and to sue in its own name for infringement of the licensed trademarks,as also concedes that sunstar was authorized to do.japanese trademark act,kenneth port,trademark and unfair competition law and policy in japan.does not argue that sunstar license is not a real senyoshiyoken,but only that such a license does authorize sunstar to use variants of the licensed trademarks,and that is a question of japanese law.
when parties to a contract,especially sophisticated parties,use a technical term,there is a presumption that they
