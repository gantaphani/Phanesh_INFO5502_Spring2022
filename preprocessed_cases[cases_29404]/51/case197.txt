bharat patel appellant appeals an order of the district court denying his motion for relief from judgment on the basis that the motion was not filed within a reasonable time as required by fed.civ.b.we affirm and hold that because appellant waited over eleven months after the district court acquired jurisdiction over him to file his motion for relief from judgment,the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the motion was not filed within a reasonable time.
alibaba charcor,alibaba owned and operated a hotel in youngstown,ohio.it entered into a franchise agreement with days inns worldwide,days inns.appellant and his brother mukesh patel each own percent of the stock in alibaba.the other third of the stock is owned by one chafelle patel who is no relation to the two brothers,according to appellant.mukesh patel and appellant guaranteed the licensee alibaba performance of the franchise agreement.
days inns terminated the agreement effective december,but alibaba continued to operate the hotel as a days inn.in april,days inns filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio asserting and lanham act claims against all three defendants days inns sought an accounting,actual damages or liquidated damages under of the agreement,treble damages,interest,and attorney fees and costs.
on may,the district court issued an order scheduling a case management conference cmc for june.days inns filed a report of the parties planning meeting,but neither appellant nor the other defendants did so.the cmc was held as judge waited an extra fifteen minutes before only days inns representative and its counsel were present.
five days after the cmc,on june,days inns moved for default judgment against all three defendants.days inns supported its motion with an affidavit stating that o n april,days inns caused to be served copies of the summons,verified complaint and motion for tro and pi via federal express mail upon defendants the district court scheduled a hearing on days inns motion for july,but none of the defendants appeared or responded to the motion.on july,the district court ordered the entry of judgment holding all three defendants jointly and severally liable for in liquidated damages,plus interest,as well as over in attorney fees and costs 
about three weeks after the order of entry of default judgment,on august,days inns counsel filed a supplemental affidavit acknowledging that it failed to serve appellant with the complaint and summons at his actual home address florida until july,over four months earlier,days inns had mailed the complaint and summons to an address in ohio where appellant had not lived for several years.thus,even by days inns account,appellant was not served until several days after the default hearing,just two days before the district court ordered the entry of default judgment 
the federal rules of civil procedure afford a defendant twenty calendar days from service of process to answer or otherwise respond to a complaint,hornell brewing,cir citing fed.civ.a a.appellant was not properly served with the complaint until july,and the court entered default judgment two days later,so he was denied the twenty days the rules allowed for him to respond to the complaint.
furthermore,under the district court local rules,unless otherwise ordered,appellant had thirty calendar days from the date of service to respond to a potentially dispositive motion.ohio civ.d callier gray,cir a motion for default judgment is a dispositive motion.
the district court did not make any findings as to when appellant was properly served with the complaint or the motion for default judgment filed june.days inns certificate of service for its motion states that it mailed the motion to appellant ohio was presumably not effective,as appellant undisputedly sold the ohio residence and moved to florida well before that date.
at oral argument,days inns stated,and counsel for appellant did not dispute,that its motion was included in the packet received at appellant current florida address on july.thus,like the complaint and summons,it appears that appellant received the motion on that a month after days inns moved for default judgment,and just two days before the entry of judgment.thus,appellant was not afforded the requisite amount of time to respond to either the complaint or the motion.
in july,appellant moved for relief from the default judgment under fed.civ.b.appellant contended that because days inns never effected proper service on him,the judgment was void as to him for lack of personal jurisdiction,and it would violate due process to subject him to the judgment.
nevertheless,appellant did not file his b motion until july,over eleven months after the judgment and,as discussed below,over eleven months after the district court acquired personal jurisdiction over appellant.rule b plainly states that a motion seeking relief from a final judgment must be filed within a reasonable time.fed.civ.b.applying this requirement,the district court ruled that appellant did not move within a reasonable time,and so it denied his motion.
appellant timely appealed.appellant contends that the judgment was void ab initio and therefore can not become valid through the passage of time the district court,he contends,was obligated to vacate its judgment against him whenever it realized that the judgment was void.as such,appellant argues that the requirement violates his due process right to be free of a judgment entered when the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over him,and he had not been afforded the allotted time to respond to the complaint and the motion.
the validity of a court order depends on the court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties.ins.of ireland,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d bauxites.without personal jurisdiction the court is powerless to proceed to an adjudication.ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d.personal jurisdiction must be analyzed and established over each defendant independently.burger king rudzewicz,d.
p ersonal jurisdiction analysis focuses on the fairness of forcing a defendant to defend an action in a given forum,whereas the subject matter jurisdiction inquiry in a diversity case centers on whether a particular court is competent to hear a controversy.schwartz electronic data,cir.this distinction can have important consequences.
for instance,t he existence of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time,by any party,or even sua sponte by the court itself.in re lewis,cir.moreover,the parties can not confer jurisdiction where it does not otherwise exist.sweeton brown,cir citing bauxites,at.
significantly,appellant has never argued,either in his appellate briefs or at oral argument,that he lacked sufficient minimum contacts with ohio when days inns filed the complaint or when the district court ordered the entry of judgment.indeed,appellant could not successfully make that argument.as a nonresident defendant,appellant amenability to the court jurisdiction depends on whether he conducted himself so that he could reasonably anticipate being haled into court in ohio.neal janssen,cir quoting vw woodson,d.this requirement is met if he purposefully directed his activities at residents of the forum and the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise out of or relate to those activities neal,at quoting burger king,at.
rather,appellant,in his brief,challenges the service on the ground that the summons and notice of default where mailed by the attorney rather than by the clerk of the court,a procedural requirement of ohio statute,and although the local rule of the united states district court provides that its clerk will mail summons and complaints within the district,there is no rule that authorizes the district court clerk to mail summons and complaints outside the district.in such cases,where the summons is actually received,as it was here,we believe that there was substantial compliance with the ohio statute.furthermore,at oral argument,appellant conceded that he had received proper service as of july.we rely on that concession as a sufficient indication of appellant accep
