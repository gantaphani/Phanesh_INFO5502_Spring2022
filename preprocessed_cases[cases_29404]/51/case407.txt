factual and procedural background 
since,when princess diana married prince charles,franklin mint has produced,advertised,and sold,plates,and her name and likeness.similar products bearing princess diana name and likeness were sold by other companies.princess diana neither authorized nor objected to any of these products.
the fund was established in after princess diana death to accept donations to be given to various charities with which princess diana was associated during her lifetime.the estate exclusively authorized the fund to use princess diana name and likeness for this purpose.the fund in turn authorized about twenty not franklin use the name and likeness of princess diana in conjunction with products sold in the united states.franklin mint continued to market unauthorized products.
on may,the fund brought suit against franklin mint in the united states district court for the central district of california.the complaint alleged violations of the lanham act for false endorsement and false advertisement under united states code a,and dilution of trademark under united states code c.the complaint also alleged violations of california right of publicity statute,california civil code a now california civil code a the complaint finally alleged unfair competition and false and misleading advertisement under california business and professions code and et.

after the district court dismissed the fund right of publicity claim,the california legislature renumbered the right of publicity statute from to and amended it to apply to the adjudication of liability and the imposition of any damages or other remedies in cases in which the liability,damages,and other remedies arise from acts occurring directly in this state.cal.civ.code n.based on this amendment,the fund filed a motion to reinstate its dismissed right of publicity claim.the fund argued that n is a choice of law provision that requires application of california law,which recognizes a right of publicity.

ii.right of publicity claim 
introduction 
california right of publicity statute,in both its former version,california civil code a west,and its current version,california civil code a west,provides in part that a ny person who uses a deceased personality name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness,in any manner,on or in products,merchandise,or goods,or for purposes of advertising or selling,or soliciting purchases of,products,merchandise,goods,or services,without prior consent from the decedent successor or successors in interest,shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result thereof.it further provides that t he rights recognized under this section are personal property rights.cal.civ.code b west cal.civ.code b west.
as enacted in and amended in,california right of publicity statute did not contain a choice of law provision.see cal.civ.code west.the district court concluded that california default personal property choice of law provision in california civil code applied to the fund right of publicity claim and required application of the law of the decedent domicile the law of great britain,where princess diana was domiciled,does not recognize right of publicity claims.see enters.bruce miner,cir citing tolley fry,thomas mccarthy,rights of publicity privacy.accordingly,the district court dismissed the claim.on interlocutory appeal of this dismissal and the accompanying denial of a preliminary injunction,we affirmed by memorandum disposition.
effective january,the legislature renumbered california right of publicity statute from to and amended it to apply to the adjudication of liability and the imposition of any damages or other remedies in cases in which the liability,damages,and other remedies arise from acts occurring directly in this state.cal.civ.code n west.the former version of the statute contained no comparable provision.see cal.civ.code west.following this amendment,the fund moved to reinstate its right of publicity claim,arguing that n is a choice of law provision that requires application of california law.the district court denied the motion,concluding that n is not a choice of law provision.the district court further concluded that california default personal property choice of law provision in california civil code applies to the current version of the right of publicity in it did to the former version of that right in requires the application of the law of the decedent domicile,great britain,which does not recognize a right of publicity.
the fund argues before it did before the district n is a choice of law provision requiring application of california law to its right of publicity claim.we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.see in re macintyre,cir.we conclude that the plain language of n,as well as its legislative history,supports the district court decision not to reinstate the fund right of publicity claim.
plain language of the statute 
courts must interpret a statute according to its plain meaning,except in the rare cases in which the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.in re arden,cir quoting united states ron pair,d internal quotation marks omitted.section n limits the application of california right of publicity statute to cases in which the liability,damages,and other remedies arise from acts occurring directly in this state.the district court concluded that by the plain meaning of its language,this provision is not a choice of law provision,but simply addresses the reach of the statute coverage.cairns ii,d at.
we agree.section b provides that the right of publicity is a personal property right.section n states that california right of publicity statute shall apply to cases aris ing from acts occurring directly in california.section n does not state that california right of publicity statute applies to such cases regardless of the domicile of the owner of the right.section provides that personal property is governed by the law of the domicile of its owner unless there is law to the contrary in the place where the personal property is situated,california.see supra note.the statement in n that california right of publicity statute shall apply to cases aris ing from acts occurring directly in california is compatible with the right of publicity being governed by the law of the domicile of its owner,because the statute does not state by its plain language that such cases are not governed by the law of the domicile of the owner.thus,there is no law to the contrary to prevent application of the default choice of law provision in to the right of publicity statute in.accordingly,unless the literal application of the statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters,arden,at,applies to,and the fund right of publicity claim is foreclosed.
the fund argues that t here is nothing in to suggest that a court should look to cal.civil code to determine whether the right of publicity applies to a particular plaintiff or her heirs.section,however,is a default choice of law provision that applies i f there is no law to the contrary,and no explicit reference to this default provision should be expected in alone to apply.
legislative history 
the legislative history of further supports our conclusion that n is not a choice of law provision.on january,senator burton introduced senate bill seeking to amend the former version of the right of publicity statute in.the proposed amendment initially contained a subsection o that stated a plaintiff has standing to bring an action pursuant to this section if any of the acts giving rise to the action occurred in this state,whether or not the plaintiff is a domiciliary of this state.cairns ii,d at emphasis added.the domiciliary of this state language was later deleted from the proposed amendment.the amendment was ultimately adopted without this language as n,which reads as follows this section shall apply to the adjudication of liability and the imposition of any damages or other remedies in cases in which the liability,damages,and other remedies arise from acts occurring directly in this state.cal.civ.code n west.
the california assembly judiciary committee hearing of june,provides evidence that the legislature did not intend n,as adopted,to prevent application of to the right of publicity.during that hearing,senator burton attempted to the domiciliary of this state language.assembly member and committee pacheco asked whether such an addition was necessary and whether there was any law that says you have to be domiciled in the state at the time of death.mark lee,counsel for the fund in this case before the district court and present at the hearing on behalf of the fund as a proponent of senate bill,answered that the district court in cairns i had held that domicile was required.after further discussion,senator burton withdrew his proposed amendment to add the domiciliary of the state language to what became n.
we have observed that california courts give substantial weight to the deletion of a provision during the drafting stage.the rejection by the legislature of a specific provision contained in an act as originally introduced is most persuasive to the conclusion that the act should not be construed to include the omitted provision.jimeno mobil oil,cir quoting rich state bd.of optometry,d.here,the committee deleted the domiciliary of this state language and resisted senator burton attempt to reinsert this language.the legislature ultimately passed n without the domiciliary of this state language.under jimeno,this rejection by the legislature of the domiciliary of this state language is most persuasive to the conclusion that n should not be construed to include the omitted domiciliary of this state language.at.the rejection of the domiciliary of this state language is made more persuasive by the california assembly judiciary committee insistence on deleting this language although the committee was made aware that the district court decision in cairns i required domicile in california in the absence of such language.
taken together,the legislative history strongly indicates that the legislature did not intend to statutorily overrule the district court requirement of california domicile in cairns thus,a literal application of n will not produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.arden,at.accordingly,the fund right of publicity claim must fail because the law of princess diana domicile,great britain,governs and that law does not recognize a right of publicity.
iii.false endorsement 
introduction 
the district court granted franklin mint motion for summary judgment on the fund lanham act claim for false endorsement because franklin mint use of princess diana name and likeness did not implicate the purpose of trademark protection,and because there was no likelihood of customer confusion as to the origin of franklin mint products.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.lopez smith,cir en banc.we must determine whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.
under the lanham act false endorsement provision,
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,or any container for goods,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,connection,or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person,shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is likely to be damaged by such act.
under the law of false endorsement,likelihood of customer confusion is the determinative issue.see seuss,penguin books usa,cir likelihood of confusion is the basic test for trademark infringement.between and,many products,including some that were largely indistinguishable from franklin mint products,bore the name and likeness of princess diana,who neither endorsed nor objected to any of these products.consumers,therefore,had no reason to believe franklin mint products were endorsed by the princess.this did not change when,following princess diana death in,the fund endorsed approximately twenty not franklin mint amidst a flood of memorabilia.under these circumstances,there was no likelihood of confusion as to the origin of franklin mint products.in addition,franklin mint is entitled to a fair use defense for its references to princess diana to describe its products.accordingly,the district court did not err when it granted summary judgment in favor of franklin mint on this claim.
b.the distinction between the classic fair use and nominative fair use defenses 
the district court held 
defendants use of the image of princess diana on their products and the words diana,princess of wales,to describe their products does not imply endorsement by plaintiffs.because defendants use does not implicate the purpose of trademark protection,it falls outside the scope of a,and defendants are entitled to summary adjudication of the false endorsement claim as a matter of law.
cairns iii,d at emphasis added.in support of this holding,the district court quoted our conclusion in new kids on the block news am.publ g,cir,that nominative fair use of a mark lies outside the strictures of trademark law b ecause it does not implicate the function that is the purpose of trademark.the district court stated although the new kids court reached the above conclusion in analyzing defendants nominative fair use defense,the same threshold consideration is applicable to this case cairns iii,d at.we agree that new kids threshold consideration applies in the present case and conclude that franklin mint is entitled to a nominative fair use defense for its references to princess diana to describe its products.
we distinguish two types of fair use classic fair use,in which the defendant has used the plaintiff mark to describe the defendant own product,and nominative fair use,in which the defendant has used the plaintiff mark to describe the plaintiff product for the purpose of,for example,comparison to the defendant product.new kids,at second emphasis added.the distinction between classic and nominative fair use is important for two reasons classic and nominative fair use are governed by different analyses and the classic fair use analysis only complements the likelihood of customer confusion analysis set forth in sleekcraft whereas the nominative fair use analysis replaces the sleekcraft analysis.
under the common law classic fair use defense codified in the lanham act at united states code b,a junior user is always entitled to use a descriptive term in good faith in its primary,descriptive sense other than as a trademark.mccarthy on trademark and unfair competition ed.to establish a classic fair use defense,a defendant must prove the following three elements.defendant use of the term is not as a trademark or service mark.defendant uses the term fairly and in good faith and.defendant uses the term o nly to describe its goods or services.id.at quoting b.in our circuit,the classic fair use defense is not available if there is a likelihood of customer confusion as to the origin of the product.see transgo,ajac transmission parts,cir classic fair use defense available only so long as such use does not lead to customer confusion as to the source of the goods or services lindy pen bic pen,cir same.the classic fair use analysis,therefore,only complements the likelihood of customer confusion analysis set forth in sleekcraft.
in new kids,by contrast,we developed a nominative fair use analysis that replaces the likelihood of customer confusion analysis set forth in sleekcraft.see playboy,welles,cir stating that i n cases in which the defendant raises a nominative fair use defense,the new kids test should be applied instead of the test for likelihood of confusion set forth in sleekcraft because it better evaluates the likelihood of confusion in nominative fair use cases.to establish a nominative fair use defense,a defendant must prove the following three elements 
first,the plaintiff product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark second,only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the plaintiff product or service and third,the user must do nothing that would,in conjunction with the mark,suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.
new kids,at footnote omitted.
the nominative fair use analysis is appropriate where a defendant has used the plaintiff mark to describe the plaintiff product,even if the defendant ultimate goal is to describe his own product conversely,the classic fair use analysis is appropriate where a defendant has used the plaintiff mark only to describe his own product,and not at all to describe the plaintiff product we hold that franklin mint use of princess diana name and likeness fits the former definition and that,therefore,the nominative fair use analysis rather than the classic fair use analysis is appropriate in the present case.
new kids involved the use by the the trademarked name of the teen publicize the newspapers telephone polls about the band.see at.the newspapers used the trademark,the new kids,to describe the plaintiff product,the band the new kids on the block.the newspapers ultimate goal,however,was to describe their own products,telephone polls about the band the new kids on the block.application of the nominative fair use analysis was appropriate in new kids because the defendants had used the plaintiff mark to describe the plaintiff product,even though the defendants ultimate goal was to describe their own products.
the same is true of the three cases we cited in new kids as nominative fair use cases.id.at.in volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft church,cir,an automobile repair business specializing in the repair of volkswagen and porsche vehicles placed a large sign on the front of the premises that read modern volkswagen porsche service.id.at.volkswagen was a registered trademark of the plaintiff.id.in boston athletic ass n,cir,a television station made unauthorized broadcasts referred by name boston marathon,an annual sports event organized and trademarked under that name.id.at.and in smith chanel,cir,an imitator of brand perfumes advertised his chance perfume as indistinguishable from the trademarked chanel perfume.id.at.
in each of these three cases,the alleged infringer used the trademark volkswagen,boston marathon,and chanel to describe the alleged infringee automobile,sports event,and perfume designated by that name.in each of these cases,however,the alleged infringer ultimate goal was to describe his own automobile repair business specializing in the repair of volkswagens,a television broadcast of the boston marathon,and a perfume indistinguishable from chanel.as in new kids,application of the nominative fair use analysis was appropriate in each of these cases because the alleged infringer had used the alleged infringee mark to describe the product of the infringee,even though the infringer ultimate goal was to describe his own product 
to summarize,courts should use the new kids nominative fair use analysis in cases where the defendant has used the plaintiff mark to describe the plaintiff product,even if the defendant ultimate goal was to describe his own product.by contrast,courts should use the traditional classic fair use analysis in cases where the defendant has used the plaintiff mark only to describe his own product,and not at all to describe the plaintiff product.
application of the nominative fair use defense 
in the present case,princess diana is the fund product and princess diana name and likeness are the fund marks.franklin mint used princess diana name and likeness to describe princess diana,although franklin mint ultimate goal was to describe its own products because franklin mint used the fund mark to describe the fund product,we apply the new kids nominative fair use analysis,even though franklin mint ultimate goal was to describe its own products.
the first element of the new kids nominative fair use test is that the fund product must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark.at.we explained in new kids that one might refer to the world champions or the professional basketball team from chicago,but it far simpler and more likely to be understood to refer to the chicago bulls.id.at.similarly,one might refer to the english princess who died in a car crash in,but it is far simpler and more likely to be understood to refer to princess diana.we therefore hold that princess diana person is not readily identifiable without use of her name.
there is no substitute for franklin mint use of princess diana likeness on its products.nor is there a substitute for franklin mint use of princess diana likeness in its advertisements for these products.for example,one might franklin mint in fact the diana,the people princess doll is d ressed in the stylish suit princess diana wore when she was presented with her signature flower and c ompletely accessorized with a purse and a tiny bouquet of princess of wales roses that princess diana carried on the same occasion.but it is far simpler and more likely to be understood to franklin mint also picture of the doll and a photograph of princess diana wearing the same suit and carrying the same purse and the same bunch of flowers we therefore hold that princess diana physical appearance is not readily identifiable without the use of her likeness.thus,the first element of the new kids nominative fair use test is met.
the second element of the new kids nominative fair use test is that only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the fund product or service.id.at.we explained in new kids 
thus,a soft drink competitor would be entitled to compare its product to or coke,but would not be entitled to use distinctive lettering.see volkswagenwerk,at church did not use volkswagen distinctive lettering style or color scheme,nor did he display the encircled vw emblem 
in the present case,there is no allegation that franklin mint used any distinctive lettering or any particular image of princess diana intimately associated with the fund.see,toho william morrow,d,holding that a publisher who used the trademark godzilla as the title of a book about the by the same name used more of the mark than was reasonably necessary where the title was written in the distinctive lettering style used by the trademark holder and its licensees in their merchandising activities.
what is reasonably necessary to identify the plaintiff product differs from case to case.compare playboy,at holding that t he repeated depiction of pmoy is not necessary to describe a former playmate of the year on her website,with mattel,mca records,d,holding that the repeated use of the words barbie and ken are reasonably necessary for the purposes of parody in a song lampooning the lifestyle associated with these dolls.
where,as in the present case,the description of the defendant product depends on the description of the plaintiff product,more use of the plaintiff trademark is reasonably necessary to identify the plaintiff product than in cases where the description of the defendant product does not depend on the description of the plaintiff product.for example,general motors would probably be able to sell its oldsmobile without any reference to a basketball star who,like the car,received an award three years in a row.see,at.but it is doubtful whether franklin mint would be able to sell its diana,princess of wales porcelain portrait doll without prominent reference to princess diana.not every franklin mint customer can be expected to recognize princess diana features on the doll.and even fewer franklin mint customers can be expected to recognize princess diana royal tiara and bolero jacket on the doll.accordingly,a caption reading diana is reasonably necessary to identify princess diana.similarly,a photograph showing princess diana wearing her royal tiara and bolero jacket is reasonably necessary to identify these accessories of princess diana.in a nutshell,franklin mint had to ensure that its customers understood the references to princess diana,and it did what was reasonably necessary for this purpose thus,the second element of the new kids nominative fair use test is also met.
the third and final element of the new kids nominative fair use test is that the user must do nothing that would,in conjunction with the mark,suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.at.none of franklin mint advertisements for its products claim that these products are sponsored or endorsed by the fund.nor do any of these advertisements bear a disclaimer that the products are not sponsored or endorsed by the fund.by contrast,franklin mint advertisements for some of its other products in the same catalogue do state that they are authorized by a trademark holder.the absence of similar statements in franklin mint advertisements for its products suggests that they are not sponsored or endorsed by the fund.
in addition to its other use of princess diana name and likeness,franklin mint asked prospective purchasers of the princess diana tribute plate to join with the franklin mint to continue princess diana important work.accompanying this request was a promise that a ll proceeds would be donated to what franklin mint alternatively described as diana,princess of wales charities and diana,princess of wales favorite charities.the district court concluded that a mple evidence before the court demonstrates that the association between the image of princess diana and the fund is negligible.cairns iii,d at.the same is true regarding the association of the name of princess diana and the fund.similarly,there is no evidence that diana,princess of wales favorite charities have become so closely associated with the fund that any reference to them in these terms would suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the fund.
franklin mint advertised its diana,princess of wales porcelain portrait doll as d ressed in the only authentic replica of the stunning designer gown with bolero jacket sold at christie auction emphasis in original.here,the word authentic suggests an authentic portrayal of the past it does not suggest sponsorship or endorsement.similarly,franklin mint promised that its the princess of wales rose collector plate from capodimonte,the european masters of floral portraiture comes with a special certificate of authenticity emphasis added.in this context,authenticity refers to the origin of the plate with franklin mint or capodimonte.it does not suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the fund.
although the issue of suggested sponsorship or endorsement may be a closer call than the first two elements of the new kids nominative fair use test,we conclude that this third and last element of the new kids nominative fair use test is met as well.we therefore hold that franklin mint use of the name and likeness of princess diana was a permissible nominative fair use.because there are no genuine issues of material fact,even when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the fund,the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of franklin mint on the fund false endorsement claim was appropriate 
iv.attorneys fees 
the district court awarded franklin mint in attorneys fees.we review such an award for an abuse of discretion,united states lindberg,cir,and,finding no abuse of discretion,we affirm.
entitlement to attorneys fees 
california right of publicity statute provides that t he prevailing party or parties in any action under this section shall also be entitled to attorneys fees and costs.cal.civ.code a emphasis added.because we affirm the district court denial of the fund motion to reinstate its california right of publicity claim,we also affirm the district court determination that franklin mint,as the prevailing party in this claim,is entitled to recover the attorneys fees and costs associated with this claim.
we further affirm the district court determination that franklin mint is entitled to attorneys fees and costs associated with the fund lanham act claims for false advertisement and dilution of trademark.the lanham act provides that t he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.a emphasis added.we have held that this requirement is met when the case is either groundless,unreasonable,vexatious,or pursued in bad faith.avery dennison sumpton,cir emphasis added quoting stephen boney,boney,cir.
the district court found that the false advertisement claim was groundless and unreasonable because the statements in the advertisements at issue were true and the fund had no reasonable basis to believe they were false.see cairns iv,d at.this finding did not constitute an abuse of discretion and was,under avery,sufficient to justify an award of attorneys fees to franklin mint on this claim.
the district court also found that the dilution of trademark claim was groundless and unreasonable because it had no legal basis,having been based on the absurd and just short of frivolous contention that the mark diana,princess of wales has taken on a secondary meaning in the mind of the public and now primarily identifies charitable and humanitarian services rather than princess diana the individual.cairns iv,d at cairns iii,d at.this finding again did not constitute an abuse of discretion and was,under avery,sufficient to justify an award of attorneys fees to franklin mint on this claim 
in sum,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that franklin mint was entitled to attorneys fees for the fund right of publicity,false advertisement,and dilution of trademark claims.for the reasons discussed below,we hold that the district court also did not abuse its discretion in calculating the amount of the attorneys fees awarded to franklin mint.
amount of attorneys fees 
according to the lodestar method developed by the supreme court,t he most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.hensley eckerhart,d.the fund mainly takes issue with the district court determination of the number of hours reasonably expended by franklin mint on the litigation.
franklin mint requested in attorneys fees for over hours of work by timekeepers.franklin mint allocated some hours exclusively to the right of publicity claim,and other hours exclusively to the trademark claims.still other hours were not exclusively allocated by franklin mint to either type of claim,but were instead allocated half to the right of publicity claim and half to the trademark claims.any hours allocated in whole or in part to the trademark claims were allocated to the false endorsement,dilution of trademark,and false advertisement claims collectively and not to any one trademark claim individually.
the district court found that the unusually large number of hours and timekeepers made application of the traditional lodestar method unworkable.instead,the district court concluded that franklin mint fee request was an appropriate starting point because franklin mint had made a good faith effort to exclude from the fee request hours that were excessive,redundant,or otherwise unnecessary.the district court then reduced the fee request by approximately percent from to based on the following four findings.
first,the district court found that it was inappropriate to allocate half of the hours which were not exclusively allocated to either claim to the right of publicity claim because that claim was on interlocutory appeal while the trademark claims were being litigated.therefore,the district court changed the allocation,allocating only one quarter of the not exclusively allocated hours to the right of publicity claim and allocating the remaining three quarters of that time to the trademark claims.second,because the district court found that franklin mint was not entitled to recover attorneys fees for the false endorsement trademark claim,the district court reduced the fees attributed to the trademark claims by thirty percent.third,the district court reduced the computer research fees by percent because computer research charges are not an exact substitute for an attorney hourly rate,and because a portion of these charges must be considered overhead.fourth,the district court found that franklin mint could not recover any of its fees for lobbying against attempts to change california right of publicity statute.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in making an award that substantially reduced franklin mint attorneys fees request.the supreme court has observed that where,as in this case,the plaintiff claims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories,it is difficult to divide the hours expended on a basis.hensley,at.this circuit has cautioned,however,that the impossibility of making an exact apportionment between recoverable lanham act claims and act claims does not relieve the district court of its duty to make some attempt to adjust the fee award in an effort to reflect an apportionment.gracie gracie,cir.by analogy,the same rule should apply in cases such as this one,which involves lanham act claims,rather gracie act claims.
in the present case,the district court attempted to adjust the fee award in an effort to reflect an apportionment.id.far from uncritically accept ing a party representations as to the time and money reasonably spent on the case,gracie,at,the district court reduced the fees sought by percent or several hundred thousand dollars.a percentage reduction was appropriate in this case.see hensley,at.finding that the district court properly reduced the hours of one attorney by thirty percent to account for,inter alia,his failure to keep contemporaneous time records see also mccarthy,supra,at i t is appropriate for the court to reduce a total attorney fee amount by a percentage which represents work on act claims.during oral argument on franklin mint motion for attorneys fees,the fund itself proposed a percentage reduction,arguing that ten than the not exclusively allocated time was properly allocatable to the right of publicity claim and that the fees attributed to the trademark claims should be reduced by than thirty percent.the district court did not abuse its discretion by adopting a different percentage reduction that is less favorable to the fund.
i n appropriate cases,the district court may adjust the presumptively reasonable lodestar figure based upon the factors listed in kerr screen extras guild,cir intel terabyte int l,cir emphasis added the court need not consider all factors,but only those called into question by the case at hand and necessary to support the reasonableness of the fee award.kessler assocs.fin.servs.of hawaii,cir.
the fund complains that the district court failed to consider the last kerr factor,awards in similar cases.the fund points to the allegedly unprecedented size of the award and claims that the district court award of over million for the lanham act claims may be the first fee award in a lanham act case to exceed million.
the allegedly unprecedented size of the award does not automatically make it unreasonable.see fantasy,fogerty,cir discounting party argument that award of in attorneys fees in copyright litigation was three times larger than any other award it had seen,and commenting that comparisons to fee awards in other cases are largely irrelevant,and certainly not determinative,inasmuch as the reasonableness of a particular fee award depends on a analysis.when considering awards in similar cases,the amount in controversy in those cases can not be ignored.in its lanham act claims,the fund reportedly sought in lost profits plus an unspecified amount for loss of goodwill and lost business opportunities the ratio between the attorneys fees awarded to defendant franklin mint and the damages sought by the fund in this unsuccessful lanham act case is at most one to fourteen.this ratio is not disproportionately higher than the ratios between the attorneys fees and the damages awarded to plaintiffs in successful lanham act cases.in fact,the ratio in this case is considerably lower than the ratios in some of those cases see,taco cabana int l,two pesos,cir affirming an award of in attorneys fees to a party who had been awarded less than twice as much in damages universal city studios,nintendo,cir affirming an attorneys fees award that,at,exceeded the damages by almost.
equally important is the undisputed fact that the fund itself has expended million british pounds approximately million on this c
