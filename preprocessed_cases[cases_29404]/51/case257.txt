plaintiffs am general corporation am general and general motors corporation gm brought a declaratory judgment action in the district court asking the court to find that the grille design of their recently developed sport utility vehicle suv does not dilute or infringe upon a trademark held by the defendant,daimlerchrysler corporation daimlerchrysler,for a similar looking grille on daimlerchrysler line of jeep suvs.daimlerchrysler then filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against gm use of the grille design on the then released 
after an hearing on the matter,the district court denied daimlerchrysler preliminary injunction finding that daimlerchrysler showed virtually no chance of success on the merits of either its federal dilution or infringement claims and that,even if daimlerchrysler did show a better than negligible chance of winning on the merits,the balance of harms weighed heavily against issuing the injunction.
daimlerchrysler timely filed this appeal and raised the following issues whether the district court erred in applying the doctrine of progressive encroachment to its dilution claim by finding that laches barred the claim even though prior sales of vehicles occurred in a different market than the mainstream suv market where the is being sold whether the district court erred in finding that daimlerchrysler must prove that its grille design achieved fame or distinctiveness before am general or gm began using a similar design in a different market and whether the district court improperly balanced the harms of issuing the injunction by finding that the harm to gm,am general,and the public interest outweighed daimlerchrysler presumptive harm from the alleged dilution or infringement.

memorandum and order 
this case is before the court on a motion for preliminary injunctive relief based solely on claims of trademark dilution and infringement arising under the lanham act,et general motors corporation and am general corporation filed this suit,principally as a declaratory judgment action,against daimlerchrysler corporation,but daimlerchrysler seeks the preliminary injunction.daimlerchrysler counterclaims against general motors and am general allege that daimlerchrysler owns protectable trademark rights in a family of designs of the grilles of its jeep vehicles,and general motors and am general intend to use a grille on a forthcoming vehicle that will infringe and dilute daimlerchrysler family of marks.daimlerchrysler does not seek an injunction against am general,but since am general is a party to the suit and would be affected greatly by the requested injunction,the court allowed am general to participate fully in the evidentiary hearing that took place from february.
the case involves two brands of motor vehicles or perhaps more accurately,sport utility vehicles.one brand is jeep.daimlerchrysler owns the jeep brand as the successor corporation to chrysler corporation,american motors corporation,jeep corporation,kaiser jeep corporation,willys motors,and motors.the court will refer to daimlerchrysler corporation and all its predecessors in the jeep brand simply as daimlerchrysler.the history of the jeep brand and the pertinent grille configurations is set forth in part b of this opinion.
the other brand of sport utility vehicle,or suv,is the hummer brand,which has a far shorter biography.part c of this opinion relates that history in some detail.briefly,the hummer was the civilian younger sibling of the military humvee both the hummer and the humvee were owned and produced by am general corporation,which was itself part of other companies including a jeep predecessor to daimlerchrysler throughout the vehicles histories.in,am general sold the hummer brand to general motors corporation.general motors is producing though not yet selling a version of the am general hummer.the companies now refer to the new,general motors hummer as the and to the old am general hummer as the.am general is to assemble the under contract with general motors and continues to produce the and the humvee.
for the reasons that follow,the court denies the motion for preliminary injunction.
parties positions and applicable legal principles 
this case is about jeep grilles and the grille general motors plans to use on the.daimlerchrysler contends that it has a family of marks that have featured consistent and easily recognized common grille characteristics seven to ten vertical slots that appear to be stamped through a planar surface.daimlerchrysler calls this configuration the jeep grille design.
as the party seeking the preliminary injunction,daimlerchrysler has the burden of demonstrating that it has a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of its underlying claim,that it has no adequate remedy at law,and that it will suffer irreparable harm without the preliminary injunction if daimlerchrysler meets those burdens,the court then must consider any irreparable harm the preliminary injunction might impose upon general motors the only party against which the injunction is sought and whether the preliminary injunction would harm or foster the public interest.anderson logistics imc,cir north central,cook,cir.

to prevail at trial on its dilution claim under c and,daimlerchrysler will have to prove that its family of marks was famous before general motors adopted the intended grille,that general motors use of the intended grille is in commerce,and that general motors use of the intended grille is likely to dilute daimlerchrysler family of marks.eli lilly natural answers,at syndicate sales,hampshire paper,cir.unlike a trademark infringement claim,a dilution claim requires no showing of consumer confusion as to source.
in deciding whether daimlerchrysler family of marks is famous within the meaning of the statute,the court is to consider the family inherent distinctiveness or secondary meaning,the time and extent of daimlerchrysler use of the family in connection with motor vehicles,the duration and extent of daimlerchrysler advertising and publicity of the family,the size of the trading area in which daimlerchrysler uses the family of marks,the channels of trade for motor vehicles,the degree of recognition of the family in those trading areas and channels of trade,whether and how others use similar marks,and whether the family is registered.c.

daimlerchrysler contends that its trade dress family is not functional,noting that nearly every other motor vehicle manufacturer has managed to find a way to cool the engine without using vertical slots.general motors contested this point in its briefs,but presented no evidence or argument at the hearing to refute daimlerchrysler contention on nonfunctionality.daimlerchrysler position seems right and is unrebutted,so the court assumes for today ruling that the grille configurations on jeep models are not functional and have not been functional.
general motors contends that daimlerchrysler is judicially estopped from claiming trademark protection for the trade dress family or that the intended grille dilutes and infringes that family because daimlerchrysler did not identify either the grille or earlier jeep grilles as prior art in its application for a design patent on the jeep grand cherokee grille.daimlerchrysler argues that there is no inconsistency between its position then and its position today because different standards govern design patent protection and what constitutes invalidating prior art and trademark protection.
general motors also asserts an affirmative defense of laches,contending that daimlerchrysler unreasonably delayed in objecting to the intended grill,first from to,while am general was selling the humvee,then from to,while am general was selling the,and then from june to december,the time between the announcement of general motors acquisition of the hummer brand and general motors announcement of the.
with respect to,daimlerchrysler contends that it had licensed am general to use the jeep grille design on the humvee,so daimlerchrysler could have taken no reasonable action.with respect to,daimlerchrysler contends that since am general had represented,in the course of registering its trademark,that the did compete with any jeep product,daimlerchrysler failure to object could have led to reasonable reliance on daimlerchrysler silence.the remaining six months in,daimlerchrysler says,simply is too brief a time to support a laches defense.daimlerchrysler also relies on the doctrine of progressive encroachment,which tolerates inaction by the owner of a mark until the threat to the mark grows into substantiality.until the announcement of the,daimlerchrysler argues,the hummer vehicles were not a matter of concern because they constituted a market unto themselves.daimlerchrysler argues that the doctrine of progressive encroachment is available to one claiming dilution as well as to one claiming infringement general motors disagrees.
jeep brand history 
the jeep became as an american military vehicle during world war ii.in,motors,produced a prototype for the nation first military truck,won the production contract through a competitive bidding process,and in,began producing what would become jeeps for the war effort.
as peace followed war in,a commercial version of the jeep appeared for sale to retail consumers.manufactured the first civilian jeep,employing the military jeep grille design of seven perfectly vertical slots that appear to have been stamped through a solid sheet of metal.as discussed in the next section,am general also traces its corporate heritage back to motors.
jeep models for consumers came and went in the ensuing years,with periodic change in the brand ownership.henry kaiser purchased in,and the company became willys motors,which continued to manufacture jeeps and considerable lines of military and postal vehicles until,when the company name was changed to kaiser jeep company.in,in the wake of the demise of the studebaker corporation as a motor vehicle manufacturer,kaiser jeep acquired a studebaker plant in south bend,indiana,and assumed a studebaker contract for the production of military trucks and produced postal trucks of varying sizes.in,kaiser jeep formed a defense and government products division to deal exclusively with government vehicles.
kaiser jeep manufactured the jeep line from until,when american motors corporation purchased kaiser jeep from kaiser industries.in,american motors corporation established two wholly owned subsidiaries jeep corporation,and am general corporation,which previously had been the defense and government products division.
jeep corporation continued to produce a product line of jeep vehicles as an american motors subsidiary until.its sister corporation,am general,continued to develop products for use as military and postal vehicles,and to build them pursuant to contracts awarded by the government.in,am general started preliminary design work on the series high mobility wheeled vehicle the hmmwv,in the inevitable governmental acronym,or humvee,as it came to be named for purposes of verbal communication.after being awarded a prototype contract in,am general was awarded a billion contract to produce humvees over a period eventually increased to billion to produce humvees.
also in,ltv corporation acquired am general from american motors,and established am general as a wholly owned subsidiary of the ltv aerospace and defense company.am general was awarded contracts for the production of more humvees in and.
in,chrysler corporation acquired american motors corporation,and with it,jeep corporation.chrysler continued and from time to time,modified the jeep line.a merger eliminated the chrysler corporation and produced daimlerchrysler corporation,which continues to produce the jeep line of vehicles.except for the period in which am general and jeep corporation were american motors subsidiaries,the precise corporate identity of the producer of civilian jeeps is unimportant to today decision.
jeep,now on the scene in one form or another for sixty years,is widely known.for many years,jeep was the only manufacturer of drive sport utility vehicles that monopoly within what was then a niche market in comparison,there are now models of suvs available in the united states focused the brand prominence.jeeps,and their grilles,have been depicted prominently in military movies,television shows,toys,other licensed products,and in billions of dollars of advertising.daimlerchrysler has obtained three federal trademark registrations that encompass its grille designs all depict what appears to be a variant of the grille used on today jeep wrangler and jeep liberty.the first registration,which reported a first use of,was issued in for land vehicles.the second registration,which reported a first use in commerce of march,was issued in for utility land vehicles.the third registration,which reported a first use in commerce of january,was issued in for sport utility vehicles.the first two registrations no longer are being used in the production of jeep models whether daimlerchrysler still produces either of those grilles for use as replacement parts was unclear from the evidence at the hearing.
since,daimlerchrysler has sold tens of millions of jeep vehicles with what it calls the jeep grille design.daimlerchrysler has advertised its vehicles down through the years,with daimlerchrysler and its dealers and distributors spending billions of dollars on nationwide advertising and promotions that featured the grille.the grille that appears on today wrangler and its headlamp openings appears prominently on many products shown in the jeep provisions catalog,and is the symbol of an annual jeep homecoming event called camp jeep.
today,daimlerchrysler sells three jeep models the wrangler,the grand cherokee,and the liberty.daimlerchrysler discontinued a fourth model,the cherokee,in.
history of the humvee and the hummer 
as already noted,am general won the contract to produce the humvee for the military during the rebuilding of the united states armed forces in the.in february,the government invited proposals for a new high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle,and am general was one of five companies that submitted proposals.am general technical proposal included drawings depicting the design of am general s proposed humvee vehicle,including a grille design with nine vertical slots that were slightly taller than the round headlights that bookended the slots.
am general was among three companies awarded phase i contracts in july those contracts provided funding for production of prototype hmmwv vehicles for the military to test.in july,am general applied to the patent and trademark office the pto,for a design patent on the humvee,including the vertically slotted grille design.that design patent was never issued.in march,the government selected am general to manufacture the hmmwv.
during the government testing of the humvee prototypes,am general engineers made various design modifications based on performance issues raised by the government in one of those changes,the engineers moved the headlamps inboard and eliminated the two outer slots of the grille.the humvee grille first appeared in a blueprint completed in november.since the government acceptance of the final production version of the humvee,every humvee apart from some vehicles has employed the am general engineers front grille design consisting of seven vertical slots.am general sent production versions of the humvee to the military in for more testing but did begin shipping humvees to the military until march.
american motors sold its am general stock and assets to ltv corporation on july.
the humvee was featured quite favorably in news coverage of operation desert shield during the months in which forces gathered in the persian gulf for what became operation desert storm.building on that renown as a desert storm hero,am general launched a commercial vehicle then called the hummer now called the in.the was and continues to be equipped with literally the same hood as the humvee,with the same vertically slotted grille design.
am general adopted its hummer icon a silhouette of an approaching.the logo displays in black the vertical,bisected windshield,the side mirrors,the tires and,while highlighting the headlights,the front grille seven vertical openings,the upper hood grille,and a series of three circles below the bumper that were not identified at the hearing.the icon appeared on promotional items accompanying the national launch of the in,and has appeared since on all subsequent hummer dealer signs,company stationery,and business cards.am general adopted the icon as its official company logo in.since,several items of hummer merchandise included in a catalog hummer stuff features the icon on such items as mugs,golf balls,key chains,posters,caps,toys,patches,and a tie pin that shows only the front end,including the grille.
in,am general applied for a trademark registration for the appearance of the front end of the humvee,which includes the headlight sockets,running light openings,grille,and bumper.the application sought registration for trucks,and not just military trucks or sport utility vehicles.the examiner denied the application on three grounds it was not inherently distinctive was not a source identifier for consumers it was merely ornamental rather than a source identifier and it was likely to be confused with another first of the three registrations for the jeep wrangler configuration.am general twice sought reconsideration,with the second effort producing approval and publication.
daimlerchrysler monitored that application progress am general sent daimlerchrysler a request for a consent am general hoped to file in conjunction with its application.daimlerchrysler twice obtained extensions of time for response,but ultimately filed no response.daimlerchrysler did not tell the pto that the hummer grille was the jeep grille,or that am general was only a licensee of the mark rather than the owner an issue discussed later in this opinion.in march,the government issued am general an unrestricted registration of the design for use on trucks.daimlerchrysler asserted no right to the registered grille until late.every am general sales brochure for the featured the hummer grille some included the language hummer,humvee and the hummer vehicles grille designs are registered trademarks of am general corporation.
since the launch of the,am general hummer brochures and ads have used slogans like meet an american legend and the legend grows.daimlerchrysler contends that the use of legend lines is taken directly from jeep advertising am general says it used legend slogans to evoke the own military heritage.general motors promotional materials and advertisements similarly feature the vehicle front end including the grille and make references to the legend.
many photographs that have appeared in the print media over the last ten years have viewed the humvee or from the front,which draws attention to the grille.am general paid for some of those promotions,but most appeared without expense to am general.some of those photos of approaching humvees are found in ads by other firms,such as panasonic and mastercard that obtained am general permission to use the vehicles in attempts to associate their products and services with the hummer brand.these advertisements and photographs have appeared in national publications such as the wall street journal and usa today.am general also licensed companies to use images of the humvee in which the grille is featured prominently to sell their own merchandise.daimlerchrysler never challenged am general use of the grille design on the humvee,and until this litigation,daimlerchrysler had never objected to or challenged am general grille design on the.
while the was gaining recognizability though not more than,am general never sold more than in a year,general motors was exploring the possibility of developing a very rugged drive the chunk under an existing general motors brand.market research was promising,but faced with the need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to launch such a new vehicle,general motors decided to look into the hummer,which according to general motors research had a highly favorable image and was to the potential purchasers of such an that would be difficult to build from scratch for an entirely new model.negotiations ensued,and in june,am general and general motors announced their intentions to enter into a contract that would transfer the hummer brand to general motors and pursue new product opportunities for the hummer brand.within days after that press release,daimlerchrysler was consulting its lawyers concerning legal issues in hummer dispute and hummer litigation.despite those discussions,daimlerchrysler said nothing to general motors.
on december,general motors and am general entered into a series of agreements to transfer to general motors the hummer brand and all intellectual property rights embodied in the hummer vehicle.general motors granted am general exclusive production rights for the first new model of hummer vehicle am general agreed to construct a brand new facility for that purpose general motors gave am general the continued right to use the hummer grille design on the humvee.
the december general general agreements contemplated a joint effort to manufacture,market,and distribute the hummer and new hummer models,the first of which was the.the was to be about the same size as the very large original a bit taller,a bit narrower,but would include luxury features not available on the.the was to retain the visual brand identity and character,in the hopes of endowing it with the broad recognition and favorable identity general motors consumer research found in the.that research found the front end,including the grille,to be one of several visual cues important to consumers accordingly,the grille general motors intends to use on the is a narrower version of the grille used on the and the humvee before it,with the configuration of vertical slots that appear in the hummer front end registration.
on december,the day after the transaction closed,a daimlerchrysler attorney notified general motors of daimlerchrysler objection to the manufacture and sale of any new vehicle bearing the grille design.
general motors unveiled an concept vehicle at the january detroit auto show and featured that concept vehicle on its hummer web site until replacing it with pictures of the proposed production vehicle,which brought no change in the grille design.since january,general motors has promoted the vehicle extensively.the has appeared in auto shows,the hummer web site,in press coverage on television,in auto enthusiast magazines,and in newspapers.
the is comparable in size to the in all but width and is considerably larger than any jeep vehicle available in the united states.the word appears on the grille the rear bumper,and on each of the four wheels.appears on the left and right front doors.the base price at launch is expected to be at least options,dealer charges,and taxes will take the average consumer transaction over.
vertically slotted grills have appeared occasionally on other suvs down through the years.the current model of the lexus introduced in has ten bars that appear to create ten slots,but the slots do appear to have been stamped through a planar surface.the current model of the kia sportage which was introduced in january has five slots.daimlerchrysler sent letters to both toyota which makes the lexus and kia warning that those grilles appeared to infringe upon the jeep grille design.both of those letters were dated january,five days before this preliminary injunction hearing was scheduled to begin 
third party concerns 
am general already is producing fully assembled pilot for distribution to dealers for sale to consumers am general is scheduled to be in full production by march.am general has committed more than million to hire and train the plant salaried and hourly work force.by the time of the hearing,am general had hired about of the employees for the plant,and was working toward the hiring of the others.many of these people had quit their previous jobs to take employment at the plant,and some have relocated or are in the process of relocating.am general employees will complete a total of training hours preparing for their jobs at the plant.if the plant is closed for any period of time,employees will lose money and suppliers will lose anticipated sales those losses,of course,increase with the length of the shutdown.
in anticipation and aid of new jobs,the state of indiana and joseph county in which the am general plants are located provided millions of dollars to am general in tax abatements,tax credits,training grants,and road construction.joseph county,with contribution from am general,purchased and demolished some forty homes on what is now the plant site and paid to relocate the residents.general motors loaned am general million to design,build,and equip the plant.
likelihood of success generally 
daimlerchrysler brings essentially two claims.first,it contends that general motors use of the planned grille will dilute its mark in the jeep grille design.the federal trademark dilution act,c,amended the lanham act to address the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services,syndicate sales,hampshire paper,at quoting,and to protect the trademark owner from the erosion of the distinctiveness and prestige of a trademark,eli lilly natural answers,at internal quotation marks omitted.
to succeed on the merits of its dilution claim,daimlerchrysler must prove each of the following that the mark is famous that general motors adopted the mark after the mark became famous the infringer diluted the mark and the defendant use is commercial and in commerce.c syndicate sales,at.the act protects product configuration against dilution to the same extent as any other trademark.see,thomas betts panduit,at computer care service,cir.dilution differs from trademark infringement it does not require a showing of consumer confusion as to source.see.

a the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark b the duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the goods and services with which the mark is used c the duration and extent of advertising and publicity of the mark d the geographical extent of the trading area in which the mark is used e the channels of trade for the goods or services with which the mark is used f the degree of recognition of the mark in the trading areas and channels of trade of the mark owner and the person against whom the injunction is sought g the nature and extent of use of the same or similar marks by third parties and h whether the mark is federally registered

daimlerchrysler second claim is that the grille infringes its trademark.to prevail on the merits of this claim,daimlerchrysler will have to prove both that the jeep grille design is distinctive,and that the grille on the is likely to cause consumers to believe mistakenly that the is manufactured,sponsored,or endorsed by,or affiliated or connected with,the jeep brand.johnny blastoff,los angeles rams football,at.

family of marks 
daimlerchrysler relies on what it calls the jeep grille design,which john sgalia daimlerchrysler lead jeep designer defines as seven to ten vertical slots that appear to be stamped through a planar surface.daimlerchrysler has not used the jeep grille design on all its products,and sgalia definition does not appear in daimlerchrysler documents until sgalia formulated the definition the day before his deposition,but the family definition need not be written and need not be used on all products.motorola,griffiths electronics.daimlerchrysler contends that the history of jeep vehicles includes a family of marks that share those elements.
daimlerchrysler brief in support of its preliminary injunction request spoke of a jeep grille design,but its brief refers to a family of marks.daimlerchrysler takes this position because it has used a variety of grilles that fit within its definition of the jeep grille design,and many of those grilles are quite dissimilar in appearance.
daimlerchrysler counterclaim alleges that the intended consists of seven vertical slots that appear to be stamped into a planar dilute its asserted family of marks comprising the jeep grille design,and will infringe that family of marks by confusing consumers into a mistaken belief that jeep manufactures,sponsors,or is associated with the.daimlerchrysler preliminary injunction motion asks the court to enjoin general motors from proceeding with the manufacture,marketing,and sale of the with its intended grille.
while the humvee and the literally use the same grille,the grille will be essentially the same,except that it will be presented in chrome rather than in the plastic comprising the front of the vehicle.accordingly,daimlerchrysler must show that its family of marks existed at the time of the first commercial use of the intended grille.general motors argues that the first such use was in,when am general supplied a prototype humvee to the government,but the prototype had a grill.the first commercial use of the grille used consistently from the humvee through its two commercial successors was,when am general delivered the first humvee to the government under its contract.to succeed on the merits of its dilution claim,then,daimlerchrysler must show the existence of its claimed family of marks by or before,marion laboratories,wl in re,wl,though not all members of the alleged family need have existed at that point.mcdonald mckinley,wl.
daimlerchrysler contends that since,it has sold an unbroken lineage of jeep vehicles that featured a consistent grille design with easily recognizable common characteristics seven to ten and in recent years,exclusively seven vertical slots that appear to be stamped through a planar surface.the appearance produces an image of holes perforated within a surrounding frame.the grille designs used on jeep vehicles have conveyed a consistent overall visual impression to consumers,daimlerchrysler says,and so have come to be recognized as a singular daimlerchrysler calls the jeep grille design.
a point of clarification is needed before proceeding further.professor mccarthy tells us that,while trade dress is most often defined as a totality of elements,there is no reason why the plaintiff can not define a list of elements consisting of less than the totality of features appearing on a package or container.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.stated differently,the plaintiff in a trade dress action under section a of the lanham act is free to seek trade dress protection for whatever products or packaging it sees fit.rose art,swanson,cir.daimlerchrysler excludes the headlamp openings from its definition of the jeep grille design family of marks the definition includes only the number and appearance of slots.few of the exhibits introduced into evidence at the hearing,though,depict jeep grilles or hummer grilles without at least the headlamp openings.daimlerchrysler trademark registrations for wrangler grilles depict the headlamp openings the jeep insignias for camp jeep and the jeep ties include the headlamp openings and the same is true for the am general logo and items in the hummer stuff catalog general motors registered trademark addresses the entire front end.all surveys included headlamp openings.
family of marks the law 
a family of marks is 
a group of marks having a recognizable common characteristic,wherein the marks are composed and used in such a way that the public associates not only the individual marks,but the common characteristic of the family,with the trademark owner.simply using a series of similar marks does not of itself establish the existence of a family.there must be a recognition among the purchasing public that the common characteristic is indicative of a common origin of the goods.
mcdonald druck gerner,quoting j j snack foods mcdonald corporation.
a family of marks exists only if and when the purchasing public recognizes that the common characteristic is indicative of a common origin of the goods.han beauty,accord,cambridge filter servodyne,wl.
daimlerchrysler claims a family comprised of trade dress.trade dress is the total image or overall appearance of a product,including size,shape,color,texture,and graphics.rose art,swanson,cir badger meter,grinnell,cir kohler moen,cir.when considering a claimed family of trade dress,courts apply a consistent overall look standard 
we agree with the district court that if a plaintiff seeking trade dress protection can not show that its packages have a consistent overall look,the trade dress that the defendant is allegedly infringing does not exist,and the defendant must prevail 
in endorsing the consistent overall look standard,however,we do not require that the appearance of the series or line of products or packaging be identical certainly the fact that rose art packages the same product in several different types of packaging does not prevent rose art from seeking trade dress protection for one of these packaging designs 
even if rose art distributed the same products,for example,generic crayons,markers,and colored pencils in fifteen different package designs for each of fifteen different customers,this fact alone would not prevent rose art from obtaining trade dress protection for one of the fifteen different packaging styles.one or more of the package designs could be recognizable trade dress as long as it had a consistent overall look.
we conclude that when applying the consistent overall look standard,that is,when determining whether the trade dress alleged by the plaintiff is recognizable,protectable trade dress,a trial court should consider only the products or packaging for which the plaintiff is seeking trade dress protection.
rose art indus.swanson,at.one claiming family trade dress protection must articulate a specific trade dress and demonstrate that it has consistently used that trade dress,and even then,courts consider these broader product line claims with an acute concern for protecting competition given that any remedy could potentially cover a wide range of products.regal jewelry,kingsbridge int l,citations omitted ultimately,regal lanham act claim fails because it has not consistently defined the elements of,or pursued the use of,a theme trade dress.

family of marks and dilution grilles on jeeps 
when world war ii ended,registered jeep as a trademark,and designer barney roos developed the jeep for the civilian market.the first jeep rolled out in august and sold for.the front of the bore a grille consisting of seven long narrow slots two large,round headlamps were located just outside the top half of the grille,with two signal lights located immediately below the headlamps.the overall shape was akin to a laterally elongated oval atop a rectangle of the same height.the design is set forth in trademark registration,issued to daimlerchrysler in,which reports a first use in.for purposes of these findings,the court refers to the configuration shown in that registration as the grille.
daimlerchrysler produced the jeep until.the was added to the jeep line in,and was produced until.the jeep joined the line in and was produced until.the jeep appeared in and was produced until.the jeep was part of the jeep line from to.the jeep and,according to daimlerchrysler exhibit,the jeep was produced from to.the jeepster commando was produced from to,with the hurst model produced in.a truck in the traditional sense,rather than the suv sense called the jeep and the jeep was produced from to.a panel truck,the jeep fleetvan,was produced from to.the jeep was produced from to,with the jeep a pickup truck produced from to.the jeep wrangler replaced the cj line in and continues to be produced to,with a significant model change having been made in.
each of the jeep models mentioned in the preceding,the,the,the,the,the,the,the,the jeepster commando,the hurst jeepster commando,the,the,and the wrangler the grille or something very close to it.
daimlerchrysler also made jeeps with slotted grilles that differed from the grille.for example 
from to,the jeep cherokee sported a grille with ten slots the ten slots were the same height as the stacked headlamp openings,giving the overall design grille and lights a rectangular appearance.
from to,the cherokee grille had eight slots the overall design still consisted of a rectangular look with wider slots than before.
from to,the jeep comanche a pickup truck bore ten slots in a configuration that appears to have been identical to the cherokee.
from to,the comanche had eight slots in a configuration that appears to have been identical to the cherokee.
daimlerchrysler also was making other jeeps with grilles that do fit within its definition of the family of jeep grille designs.some had no slots 
the jeepster commando grille consisted of vertical and horizontal bars describing a grid 
the wagoneer grille had two dominant horizontal bars and fourteen subordinate vertical bars 
the wagoneer grille had two dominant horizontal bars,one subordinate horizontal bar,twelve vertical bars,and the grille enclosed the headlamp openings 
the cherokee grille appears to have consisted of a single horizontal bar running from one headlamp to the other,and that bar appears to have been removed on the cherokee 
from to,the wagoneer grille consisted of a narrow rectangular shape enclosing a grid pattern of bars and the headlamp openings.
other jeeps had vertical slots in high jeep truck had slots,as did the cherokee and the remodeled jeep truck,while another wagoneer model sported slots.
a jeep advertisement general motors exhibit shows four jeep models.the two in the middle the commando and the wagoneer do not have slotted grilles.the two outside models have vertically slotted jeep that bears the grille,and the jeep truck with slots.
a advertisement for jeep and renault vehicles general motors exhibit carries eight photos of different models,not all of which were identified at trial.four of the eight photos depict grilles three of those are jeep models.one of those photos shows a grille with predominant horizontal bars another of those photos shows a grille with vertical slots the third of the photos shows the grille.
by,when general motors actually sold the first humvees with seven vertical grille slots to the military,daimlerchrysler had no family of grilles with seven to ten slots that appeared to have been stamped through a planar surface.the grille,which had been in use for forty years,was the jeep it was registered as such.by,only two other grilles fitting within the family specifications ever had been employed on jeep models a grille used on both the jeep cherokee and the jeep comanche truck.there is no evidence that the grille with vertical slots producing a very different configuration than the had achieved secondary meaning by,either alone or in conjunction with the grille.the only evidence bearing on the matter of secondary meaning is that daimlerchrysler abandoned the grille by,never to use it again.
as noted earlier,daimlerchrysler dilution claim requires proof that the family of marks was famous before general motors adopted the allegedly diluting mark.such a showing,of course,requires daimlerchrysler to prove that its family of marks existed before general motors adopted the allegedly diluting family can not be famous.daimlerchrysler has not shown that it has a better than negligible likelihood of making such a showing at trial,so it is not entitled to a preliminary injunction on the dilution claim.
family of marks and infringement 
daimlerchrysler infringement claim might require consideration of a different point in time.daimlerchrysler presented evidence concerning the strength of the family of marks that exists in,when all three jeep models bear grilles with seven vertical slots that appear to have been stamped through a planar surface courts are not in full agreement as to whether the strength of the allegedly infringed mark should be examined as of when the allegedly infringing mark entered the marketplace or as of the date the injunction is sought,but the weight of authority sensibly favors the proposition that the proponent of a family of marks must prove that,prior to the junior user entry,all or many of the marks in the alleged family were used and promoted in such a way as to create public perception of the family mark as an indicator of source.simon schuster dove audio,citing marion labs,wl declining simon shuster invitation to look at the strength of its family of marks in the present see also pfizer astra pharm.prods,holding that the existence of the family of marks should be judged at the time that the junior user entered the marketplace see also talk to me,larami,holding that secondary meaning does prohibit a junior use of the mark if the junior use came into the marketplace before the senior mark acquired its secondary meaning but see mcdonald druck and gerner,measuring the strength of the mark from the present standpoint.
the court agrees with the reasoning of the majority general motors ca be said to have infringed a family of marks that did not exist when its grille entered the market,or at least had not acquired secondary meaning when the general motors grille entered the market.if daimlerchrysler marketed only one member of the family when general motors entered the market,there was no family even if daimlerchrysler intended to add other products to the family.pfizer,astra pharm.the court considers the strength of any family of marks from the time the offending grille entered the marketplace.as just set forth,the hummer grille entered the marketplace in,and while the grille had secondary meaning in,no family of marks had been established from which consumers identified source.
the licensing issue 
daimlerchrysler presents a second ground for not looking to.daimlerchrysler contends that am general had no right to convey and so general motors did not obtain any right to use the humvee grille design because in,am general received from jeep a limited license to use the jeep grille design only on its military humvees,and the license,daimlerchrysler contends,precluded the use of the grille design on mainstream suvs that compete directly with the jeep brand.daimlerchrysler maintains that when am general was designing its humvee prototype in the early,jeep designers,at am general specific request,incorporated the jeep grille design into the humvee to reflect a appearance.when am general got the humvee contract,as daimlerchrysler sees it,american motors corporation granted am general a license to use the jeep grille design on the humvee,but for no other purpose.
the license issue relates to the agreements under which american motors sold am general to ltv.section of the stock purchase agreement stated set forth on schedule c is a list of each patent,trademark and patent or trademark application owned by am general.the design patent application for the humvee design was among the itemized rights transferred to ltv.that application never produced a patent,but the application showed a vertically slotted grille.the stock purchase agreement also contained a provision on proprietary rights that said american motors would license unspecified rights specifically excluding the american motors and jeep names and the transferred rights listed in schedule c to ltv before the stock purchase transaction closed in september.american motors and ltv entered into the contemplated license agreement in september.
the stock purchase agreement reserved to american motors the american motors or jeep names and marks or the american motors logo or any derivatives thereof.a side agreement,dated september,excluded specified intellectual property from transfer,including the vehicle design.the side agreement made no reference to the humvee.
from the time of its sale to ltv,am general has produced the humvee with a front grille design that consists of seven vertical slots.am general has used the same grille on the hummer since.in,am general received trademark registration the application had been submitted in for the front end,including the grille,and am general has licensed the grille design to a variety of businesses for their own commercial use.
daimlerchrysler says these agreements licensed am general to use the grille configuration,but to do so only on the humvee,which was only for military use.am general says the agreements reserved to american motors no ownership interest in the humvee grille configuration.new york law controls the agreements pursuant to of the stock purchase agreement.when faced with conflicting interpretations of a clause,new york law directs the court to interpret the clause so as to give reasonable and effective meaning to all terms and produce no meaningless clause.galli metz,cir.the court must consider the entire contract and choose the interpretation which best accords with the sense of the remainder of the contract,quoting rentways milk cream.
section of the stock purchase agreement and the ensuing license agreement addressed,without mention of the humvee,proprietary rights american motors licensed to am general.the humvee was addressed in of the stock purchase agreement,which stated that all intellectual property owned by am general was listed on schedule c.that list included the trademark registration for the humvee name in international class trucks,and the design patent application for the humvee military vehicle.the humvee was not mentioned anywhere else in the agreements.
to agree with daimlerchrysler,the court would have to find that american motors conveyed to am general all rights in the design patent application for the application that disclosed a grille consisting of seven to ten vertical slots that appeared to have been stamped on a planar tacitly and simultaneously retaining and licensing the grille design.no law,including new york law,requires a court to so contort contractual language.the agreements plain and unambiguous language transferred to am general all rights relating to the humvee design.am general could not call the humvee a jeep or equip it with the trademarked grille design as registered,with the headlamps and running lights positioned those rights were reserved to american motors and were not even no other pertinent restrictions were placed on am general entitlement to the humvee and its design.
daimlerchrysler notes that am general never received the design patent that it had applied for,but the application outcome even if properly a matter to consider in the face of unambiguous language tells nothing of the parties intent,and the fact of the application strongly supports general motors.in september,so far as the preliminary injunction record shows,there was no reason to believe that the design patent application would be denied the sophisticated parties to these agreements would not have structured the transaction in such a way that am general might receive patent protection over a design that included american motors intellectual if the design was seen as encompassing the grille design that had adorned jeeps for nearly four decades.
daimlerchrysler presented the testimony of john tierney,who helped negotiate the agreements while employed by american motors.tierney testified to his belief that the humvee had a jeep grille design,and that american motors licensed am general to use the jeep grille design on the humvee.the court is unmoved for two strong reasons.first,since the agreements language is unambiguous,it is improper to resort to parol evidence concerning the parties intent.blue jeans,basciano.second,the court task is to ascertain the parties intent,not the intent of the parties negotiators.whatever tierney may have believed,and whatever the propriety of considering his testimony about his understanding,the agreements plain and unambiguous language makes it clear that am general was to receive all things humvee,at least to the extent shown in the design patent application 
were the court to turn to parol evidence,the most persuasive evidence of american motors intent would not be tierney testimony,but rather the complete inattention that american motors and its successors paid to the purported license.through the,the front end of the humvee gained considerable renown fame in the everyday news reports,entertainment,toys,and advertising.the purported licensors did nothing whatsoever to attend to such uses or collect royalties from am general or its successors,or from those who used the image of the humvee,and as is discussed later did not object when am general sought trademark registration for the front end of the,including the grille.this uninterrupted inattention to the license speaks deafeningly to american motors intent in entering into the agreements with ltv.
am general had no license with respect to the grille on the front end of the humvee.
g.the grille dilution and laches 
that daimlerchrysler had no family of family of jeep grille does not mean that daimlerchrysler had nothing entitled to trademark protection.see champion int l plexowood,wl.daimlerchrysler had the grille design,which can be assumed both to have been famous and to have had secondary meaning in by virtue of its long history of consistent use on jeeps in the marketplace.although daimlerchrysler counterclaims make reference to its registered trademarks for the design and similar designs it has used on the wrangler,daimlerchrysler has expressly excluded the headlamp openings from the mark it seeks to protect through this requested injunction,and each of the registered jeep trademarks include the headlamp openings.
daimlerchrysler has not shown a better than negligible likelihood of success on a claim that the intended grille presents a likelihood of dilution of the mark consisting of the grille design because daimlerchrysler has demonstrated no chance of overcoming general motors affirmative defense of laches.the application of laches in a particular case is dependent upon a showing of an unreasonable lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted and prejudice arising from this lack of diligence.hot wax,turtle wax,cir.general motors points to daimlerchrysler failure to challenge the use of the vertically slotted grille on the humvee in or thereafter,and the failure to challenge the same vertically slotted grille on the in or thereafter.if daimlerchrysler had not remained silent as the grille was used on the humvee and the,general motors says,it would not have invested millions of dollars into the acquisition of the hummer brand and development of the.
daimlerchrysler responds with several arguments.first,daimlerchrysler says that any lack of diligence belongs on general motors doorstep had general motors diligently investigated am general before acquiring the hummer brand and funding a new plant,general motors would have learned that am general owned no rights to the grille design used in humvee and the,but rather was only a licensee entitled to use the design only on military vehicles.that argument requires no further discussion,since the court already has found that am general acquired from american motors full rights to the humvee design,including the vertically slotted grill,and that no license existed.
daimlerchrysler also notes that during the trademark registration process,am general sought daimlerchrysler consent after the pto had noted,as a ground for denial,daimlerchrysler first registration of the grille.am general sent daimlerchrysler a proposed form of consent that included language to the effect that the humvee did not compete in the same market as any jeep product that language,daimlerchrysler says,implicitly disclaimed any intention of future competition with jeep models,and so justifies its failure to object to the hummer commercial use of the grille design.
the court does not agree that a letter to which no reply ever was made can be thought to have such significance as daimlerchrysler attributes to this one.nothing in the classification of vehicles for which the registration was sought would prevent the mark use in the suv market if daimlerchrysler wanted an implicit pledge to be part of the registration,the better course of action would seem to have been to communicate its concern to the pto,perhaps by executing the consent form that contained what daimlerchrysler now claims to have read as a promise in any event,daimlerchrysler argument addresses why it was silent after the november letter,and provides no explanation for the lack of objection from until the years after,when am general was selling the equipped with what daimlerchrysler now contends is the jeep grille.
progressive encroachment and dilution 
daimlerchrysler also points to the doctrine of progressive encroachment,which allows a trademark owner to tolerate de minimis or infringements and still have the right to act promptly when a junior user either gradually edges into causing serious harm or suddenly expands or changes its mark.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed accord independent nail packing stronghold screw,cir.there was no reason to complain of the humvee grill,daimlerchrysler says,because the humvee was a military vehicle,and the never sold more than vehicles per year.this doctrine,daimlerchrysler says,forgives any earlier failure to remonstrate about the threat to its mark did not loom large.sara lee,cir.
the court continues to believe that in light of the infancy of the federal act,it would be far too sweeping to say,as general motors asked the court to hold on summary judgment,that the progressive encroachment doctrine never can apply in a dilution case.nonetheless,having heard the parties arguments and received evidence at the preliminary injunction hearing,the court is persuaded that the doctrine affords daimlerchrysler dilution claim no shelter in this case.
the thrust of daimlerchrysler progressive encroachment argument is that until general motors announced plans to bring the hummer into or at least nearly into the market in which daimlerchrysler sells its jeeps,there was no dilution.before that moment,there was no lessening of the jeep grilles capacity to identify jeeps for consumers.until the federal act was adopted in,state laws addressed dilution by use of marks.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.the legal theory of was not conceived to substitute for the likelihood of confusion rule when the parties are competitors.the federal statute,however,specifically provides that dilution can occur regardless of the presence or absence of competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties.daimlerchrysler argument would require the court to ignore that language and turn the original dilution doctrine on its would not occur until the parties were in competition.
as is consistent with the statutory language,the test for likelihood of dilution ignores competition and looks solely to the marks similarity and to the renown of the senior mark.eli lilly natural answers,at.nothing in this record would allow a finding that the grille is any more similar to famous jeep mark s than were the humvee grille in or the grille in,so the advent of the brings no change in the marks first factor in determining dilution.nothing in this record would allow a finding that any jeep grille design was any more renowned when this suit was filed in than in or,so the impending brings no change to the senior mark other factor in determining dilution.in this case,then,the progressive encroachment doctrine simply does not apply to daimlerchrysler dilution claim.
infringement 
the progressive encroachment doctrine does,however,apply to daimlerchrysler infringement claim there was no risk of confusion between the wrangler and the humvee or the,so the court thinks it most unlikely that general motors laches defense will succeed at trial against the infringement claim.to prevail on its trademark infringement claim,daimlerchrysler will have to prove at trial that its trade acquired secondary meaning,and that the similarity of the intended grille to that of daimlerchrysler causes a likelihood of consumer confusion as to source or affiliation of products,cir.
given the length of its consistent use on jeep vehicles now more than half a century,it is easy to conclude that daimlerchrysler has a very high likelihood of proving that the grille design has acquired secondary meaning daimlerchrysler has not,however,shown a better than negligible likelihood of showing a likelihood of consumer confusion.
daimlerchrysler concedes general motors point that consumers who pay for are unlikely to leave dealerships believing they purchased jeeps.daimlerchrysler contends that two different sorts of confusion are likely initial interest confusion,and source or sponsorship confusion.unlike most commercial products that disappear from the public eye through consumption or private use,motor vehicles populate roads and highways for years after purchase.daimlerchrysler argues that motor vehicles serve as rolling billboards that encourage more consumers to purchase the same model,and that consumers observations influence their short list of vehicles for possible purchase.daimlerchrysler contends that the intended grille likely will lead people who see the on the road or in advertisements to think that the is made or approved by,or somehow associated with,the jeep brand.that belief may continue through the point of sale.
likelihood of confusion is measured by a the similarity of the trade dresses b the area and manner of concurrent use,including the similarity of the products on which the trade dresses are being used c the degree of care likely to be used by consumers d the strength of daimlerchrysler trade dress e evidence,if any,of actual confusion and f any intent of general motors to pass off its product as that of daimlerchrysler.thomas betts panduit,at.
similarity of trade dresses.when the focus is on the grille rather than daimlerchrysler asserted family of marks,similarity with the intended grille appears to be modest.the grille is a series of seven long,narrow,closely bunched slots the intended grille is a series of seven shorter,wider,and more widely spaced slots.in both grilles,the slots appear to be stamped through a planar surface.as indicated above,the court ignores the headlamp openings in making this comparison 
limiting the focus to the grille and ignoring all that surrounds the grille seems to blink the general rule that courts evaluate similarity in light of what happens in the marketplace,rather than just by making a comparison.meridian mut.ins.meridian ins.group,cir,citing james burrough sign of beefeater,cir.consumers in the marketplace do decide to buy an suv solely because of the grille shown on a camp jeep poster or on a jeep tie,or because of the grille shown on a coffee cup found in the hummer stuff catalog.nonetheless,as explained earlier,daimlerchrysler is entitled to define its trade dress,and the wearing of figurative blinders seems to be the only way to compare the similarity of the grilles.
george mantis confusion studies do not suggest confusion between the jeep grille and the intended grille.in his second confusion study,mantis showed respondents photos of an taken from directly in front,directly in back,and off the right front corner.in the set of photos shown to the control group,the grille had been altered to become a single large rectangular slot with silver letters spelling hummer across the slot.the hummer name was prominently displayed in each of the three photos.in the earlier of the two dilution studies,mantis used photographs of an that were placed on the internet before final design changes the earlier study used no control questions and attempted to measure dilution as well as confusion.
neither of mantis confusion studies sheds light on the likelihood of confusion between the intended grille and the jeep grille.mantis reported association with jeep,but at the time of the surveys,the jeep wrangler was and had been for many years the only jeep model to use the grille.the cherokee grille used from to and not used before that time appears to the court to be considerably more similar to the intended grille,but since the court has found virtually no likelihood of daimlerchrysler proving the existence of a family of marks in,and since the cherokee grille was not in use in,association with the cherokee grille proves nothing about the likelihood of confusion between the intended grille and the jeep grille.
for example,mantis reported that in his earlier survey,of the surveyed jeep owners associated a photo of the earlier version of the with jeep.a review of the verbatim responses to the earlier survey daimlerchrysler exhibit,tabs,though,leaves the strong impression that association was made only infrequently to the jeep grille.of the respondents who associated the grille with jeep,only six specifically mentioned an association with the wrangler model,while specifically mentioned an association with the cherokee,the grand cherokee,or the laredo one respondent mentioned both wrangler and cherokee one mentioned tonka.the association with wrangler actually was more frequent among respondents who did mention the grille at those who reported association with jeep for reasons other than the grille,six specifically mentioned the wrangler,while five specifically mentioned a cherokee variant one mentioned studebaker.other respondents in both groups mentioned jeep without mentioning a model.
similarly,in his second confusion survey,mantis reported a net of consumers to have confused the with jeep again,reference to jeep is too broad,since the jeep grille is the only mark that general motors can be accused of infringing.a review of the verbatim responses shows that of the respondents who referred to the jeep appearance when shown an,not one specifically mentioned the wrangler only six mentioned any specific jeep model.
to be sure,these comments do not mean that the mantis surveys disprove any likelihood of confusion.mantis surveys were not designed to measure confusion with the grille then seen only on the jeep wrangler and now on the liberty,too,and the court has too little expertise in statistics to decide whether the figures set forth in the preceding two paragraphs prove anything at all.for purposes of today ruling,though,it is enough to say that neither of these two in which five of respondents associated the front end with the jeep wrangler,and another in which none of respondents did the proposition that the intended grille is sufficiently similar to the jeep grille to make consumer confusion at all likely.
area and manner of concurrent use.besides the wrangler,the new jeep liberty which replaced the cherokee in might be said to use the grille design.the wrangler,liberty,and all are sport utility vehicles that will be sold at car dealerships.beyond that,however,there is little overlap between the daimlerchrysler products and the general motors product.the almost invariably will cost more than,while the wrangler and liberty usually sell for no more than with the wrangler available for as little as,and the liberty selling for around at the low end.as daimlerchrysler measures such things,the wrangler is categorized as a small suv the liberty is in the sized category of suvs the is in the large category.
the wrangler and liberty ordinarily are sold at jeep or daimlerchrysler dealerships,while the and the will be sold at general motors or hummer dealerships.in a few instances,no doubt,the same dealership may handle jeeps and hummers,but there is little likelihood of consumers confusing the products on the showroom floor.the differences in headlamp configuration already have been noted while the front tires and fenders are set outside the headlamps on the wrangler and liberty,the tires on the are directly below the headlamps,and the appears to have no front fenders.
more important,though,are the differences in size the is seven inches taller than the wrangler and the liberty and one to three inches taller than the the track width of the is nine inches wider than the liberty and nearly a foot wider than the wrangler but two inches narrower than the the overall width of the is just under a foot more than the liberty and more than fourteen inches greater than the wrangler though five inches narrower than the while a vehicle length is not apparent from a view,a consumer who walks around the vehicles on the showroom floor will find the to be fifteen inches longer than the liberty,and a whopping three feet longer than the five inches longer than the.in every dimension,the is decidedly larger than any jeep that uses the grille.
as noted earlier,daimlerchrysler does contend that consumers will drive off dealership lots thinking the they just bought for or more is a jeep wrangler.daimlerchrysler concern is what happens before and after the sale.motor vehicles rolling down the highways are free commercials consumers notice cars and suvs,and recall them when considering purchase of a new vehicle.daimlerchrysler believes that a motoring consumer or one looking at true advertisements who sees an will think the is made by,or somehow associated with,jeep.
daimlerchrysler is correct that if general motors sales predictions are correct,the roads soon will be inhabited by,libertys,and wranglers.as already discussed,though,this record contains no persuasive evidence to warrant daimlerchrysler fear that the intended grille will confuse the consumer into association with the grille on the two jeep models.to the extent any such association might arise,it does not amount to the sort of confusion that supports an infringement action.none of the relevant motor vehicles is the sort of item to which a consumer might devote little careful thought,such as a broom,thomas betts panduit,at,or a story book that might be purchased on impulse to distract a fussy child.western publ g publications int l,c,wl,at.may.any similarity in the grilles does not present a risk of a bait and switch effect.see syndicate sales,hampshire paper,at the lanham act forbids a competitor from luring potential customers away from a producer by passing goods off as those of the producer,even when confusion as to the source of the goods is dispelled by the time the sale is consummated.such bait and switch,also known as initial interest confusion,will affect the buying decisions of the consumers when it permits the competitor to get its foot in the door by confusing the consumers.when inspection of the goods is an ineffective remedy,such an approach makes sense,cir rust environment infrastructure,teunissen,cir.
the degree of care likely to be used by consumers.for the reasons just set forth,this factor weighs against a finding of likely confusion.visual similarity may have greater importance when the products are items not likely to receive considerable study from the consumer,roulo russ berrie,cir greeting cards,but the consumer high sophistication does not foreclose confusion.schwinn bicycle ross bicycles,cir.further,that an buyer might understand that the product is a hummer does not eliminate possible confusion as to whether daimlerchrysler is the source of manufacture or affiliated with the manufacturer.motors,v.a a fiberglass.
still,consumers who buy or lease a vehicle that sells for more than,in the case of the,more than likely to use a very high degree of care,especially since they are likely to make their purchases from dealerships.
the strength of daimlerchrysler trade dress.the traditional method of measuring a mark strength with a yardstick that runs from generic at one end to arbitrary and fanciful at the other is a clumsy method when measuring the strength of trade dress or product design.landscape forms,columbia cascade,cir.the issue of strength is not a difficult one here daimlerchrysler has used the grille in commerce continuously for more than half a century,and has promoted it heavily.the grille has considerable secondary meaning,and is a strong mark.
concern with the strength of the mark,though,looks more to the extent of protection to be afforded it than to the likelihood of confusion 
the greater the distinctiveness of the mark,the greater the likelihood that prospective purchasers will associate the same or a similar designation found on other goods with the prior user.strong marks that have a high degree of distinctiveness are thus protected against the use of similar marks on a wide range of goods or services that are weak designations that have less distinctiveness or market recognition.
restatement third of the law of unfair competition,comment i.this factor,then,weighs in favor of injunctive protection of daimlerchrysler strong mark,if there is other evidence of likely confusion.
evidence of actual confusion.the record contains no evidence of actual confusion.that lack of evidence favors neither party since general motors is not yet selling the.no evidence of actual confusion reasonably could be expected.
any intent of general motors to pass off the as that of daimlerchrysler.passing off means fraud it means trying to get sales from a competitor by making consumers think that they are dealing with that competitor,when actually they are buying from the passer off.blau plumbing,cir.the record contains no direct evidence that general motors intends to do anything other than to introduce a new model of large suv,with the possibility of introducing smaller versions in years to come.the intent to compete is not the intent to pass off the product as the competitor.
daimlerchrysler points to general motors advertising as circumstantial evidence of an intent to pass off,or at least to foster confusion among consumers.daimlerchrysler points to general motors use of advertising slogans that make reference to a legend surrounding the predecessors,a legend of which the supposedly is to become a part.daimlerchrysler suspicions on this point are understandable general motors has run advertisements for the that say,the legend continues a slogan that daimlerchrysler used in new jeep product launches in,and.to a lesser extent,jeep and advertising have shared a go anywhere,do anything theme.
daimlerchrysler claims no trademark infringement in general motors use of the the legend continues slogan,but inference of an intent to pass off or to confuse would be nearly irresistible if general motors had initiated the use of a slogan repeatedly used for new jeeps over the past decade.general motors,however,did not initiate the use of the slogan for hummers.am general dubbed its humvee a legend very soon after operation desert shield,and am general early advertising for the spoke of the new american legend and the legend grows.general motors continued the use of the existing legend theme for the hummer line.under these circumstances,no inference can be drawn that general motors chose the legend advertising slogans with any intent to trade on consumers association with the jeep legend,as opposed to the intent to trade on consumers association with the legend.
daimlerchrysler points to another aspect of general motors advertising.in many advertisements,general motors features the front grille,as daimlerchrysler sees a view or,in a recent advertisement,from ground road kill perspective,as daimlerchrysler counsel memorably described it.daimlerchrysler says it has long used such views to advertise jeeps,and that advertising from that perspective is rare in the industry.this,daimlerchrysler says,is indication of general motors intent to confuse consumers as to the source of hummers.
again,the argument would be stronger had this perspective originated with general motors,but it did not.am general used the view in much of its advertising.perhaps more importantly,so did others.in the,firms outside the automotive industry used the humvee with am general permission in their own advertisements that sought to associate attributes of their own products with the humvee.several of those advertisements employed the perspective to which daimlerchrysler now points the court.had those advertisers wished to associate their products with jeeps,they could have used jeeps in their ads and,for all the court knows,they might have done so.those advertisers debunk any inference that general motors uses views of the for the purpose of associating its product with jeep.
nothing in the record indicates any intent on general motors part to palm off the as a jeep,or to exploit consumers associations with jeep.this factor weighs against any likelihood of confusion.
cumulative effect of all factors.in sum,the only factor that might support a finding of likely confusion is the strength of the grille as a source of identification with daimlerchrysler.the facts just addressed with respect to general motors intent,however,sharply pare any weight of that factor in deciding likelihood of confusion.third parties use of the humvee front end indicates that the humvee front end and,inferentially,the front end has developed its own secondary meaning.if so,and recognizing the dissimilarity of the and the wrangler or liberty when viewing anything other than the grille,the grille is much more likely to trigger consumer association with the humvee as it was designed to do than to threaten the strength of the grille configuration as a daimlerchrysler mark.
daimlerchrysler has less than a negligible chance of succeeding on the merits of its trademark infringement claim.because,for the reasons discussed much earlier in this memorandum,daimlerchrysler also has less than a negligible chance of succeeding on the merits of its trademark dilution claim,its motion for preliminary injunction must be denied.see,kiel city of kenosha,cir kiel has so little chance of success on the merits of his case that the granting of a preliminary junction sic in this instance would be inappropriate.teamsters local unions and barry trucking,cir without demonstrating a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of either claim,barry failed to satisfy the all important first element of roland machinery dresser industries,cir,and we therefore need not consider the other four elements.
balance of harms 
that daimlerchrysler has shown no likelihood of success on the merits is reason enough to deny the motion for preliminary injunction without further discussion.platinum home mortgage platinum financial group,cir a district court may decline to address the remaining elements of a preliminary injunction if a plaintiff fails to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the underlying claim,citing ping educ,cir.nonetheless,since the evaluation of a motion for preliminary injunction is intended to reduce the cost of error in determinations made before complete discovery and trial,platinum home mortgage platinum financial group,at,quoting klincar,cir,the court alternatively assumes,solely in consideration of reducing the risk of error,that daimlerchrysler might have a better than negligible chance of success on the merits.for the reasons already discussed,the chance of success would be low,but the court recognizes that bright lines do not always mark the difference between no chance and slight chance.accordingly,while the court holds that daimlerchrysler does not have a better than negligible likelihood of success on the merits,the court addresses the remaining factors in the preliminary injunction analysis.
a better than negligible chance of success is not all that daimlerchrysler must show to reach the balancing phase of the analysis,but for reasons to be discussed in the balancing phase,daimlerchrysler has shown that it has no adequate remedy at other words,that an eventual award of money damages would not satisfy its injury,praefke auto electric battery,tecumseh prods,cir for dilution infringement of its mark which might consist of a family of marks,given the court assumption of its own error,and that if the preliminary injunction is not issued,it will suffer irreparable harm before the lawsuit final resolution.
once daimlerchrysler is assumed to have shown a reasonable probability a better than negligible chance of success on the merits,irreparable harm without the preliminary injunction,and absence of an adequate remedy at law,the court then must consider any irreparable harm the preliminary injunction might impose upon general motors if the preliminary injunction is issued,and whether the preliminary injunction would harm or foster the public interest.anderson logistics imc,cir north central,cook,cir.
the court appraises the risk of irreparable harm to the parties not simply by reference to what they will lose by an unfavorable ruling today,but rather by reference to the harm of error what irreparable harm would denial of a preliminary injunction cause to daimlerchrysler and the public if the trial reveals that daimlerchrysler is entitled to relief and what irreparable harm will the granting of an injunction do to general motors and the public if the trial reveals that daimlerchrysler is not entitled to relief once those evaluations are made,the court balances likelihood of success and the risk of irreparable harm on a sliding scale the better a party chances of winning at trial,the less the balance of harms needs to favor that party.ty,v.the jones group,cir eli lilly natural answers,at.
if,as the court assumes for this portion of the analysis,daimlerchrysler has a better than negligible chance of success on the merits of either or both of its trademark claims,its chance of success is slight.accordingly,the sliding scale requires that the balance of harms weigh heavily in daimlerchrysler favor.it does not do so.
if the court allows general motors to use the intended grille and it later develops that the use of that grille dilutes or infringes on daimlerchrysler mark s,daimlerchrysler will have suffered significant irreparable harm.the jeep grille design no longer will serve as a unique identifier of jeep vehicles to the extent consumers are misled by the grille,the goodwill that the jeep brand has developed in the jeep grille design for the past years will suffer.the loss of so venerable a brand identifier and goodwill would impact daimlerchrysler in the marketplace in ways presently unpredictable,except for the certainty that those effects would be negative.those harms are by their very nature irreparable and not susceptible of adequate measurement for remedy at law,international kennel club,mighty star,cir,and irreparable harm is presumed whenever a trademark is infringed and diluted.eli lilly natural answers,at.
if daimlerchrysler jeep sales are reduced as a result of that harm,its production also will drop,and daimlerchrysler employees some of whom work in indiana,though the court focus is not limited to a single state will lose jobs in an unpredictable number.consumers also would be harmed an injunction against trademark dilution or infringement protects consumers from confusion and also protects a trademark owner right to maintain a mark unique association with its products.international kennel club,mighty star,at nabisco pf brands,cir.
the harm to general motors can be no less than the presumed harm to daimlerchrysler.if daimlerchrysler has only a slight chance of proving at trial that the intended grille dilutes or infringes on daimlerchrysler mark,an injunction against use of the intended grille most likely would deprive general motors of the use of its own intellectual property rights in the registered hummer front end trademark.general motors and the consuming public would suffer the same sort of irreparable harm set forth in the preceding paragraphs if the court deprives general motors of what is very likely to be found to be general motors own mark.
the harm to general motors would be far greater,though the additional harm might not be entirely irreparable.general motors has invested million in the project.general motors has presented models of with its intended grille at auto shows in detroit and los angeles,and york mayor rudy giulani and arnold schwarzenegger participated in the introduction in new york.twenty million people have attended auto shows in which the concept and production vehicles were displayed.the unveiling and launch have been heavily advertised general motors has spent million on advertising,and the advertising materials depict the intended grille.on the weekend during the preliminary injunction hearing,an was auctioned off for arnold schwarzenegger charity,and was sold for.michael digiovanni,general manager of general motors hummer division,estimated at trial that when the cost of a campaign,curative advertising,and damaged goodwill are considered,an injunction against the intended grille would cost general motors million.if amounts are added for losses incurred by dealerships and the expense of recalling licensed die cast toys,digiovanni estimated that the cost to general motors would range from million to billion.
about million of general motors expense in preparing for the went to finance the building of a new am general plant,where the is to be assembled.as much as general motors stands to lose if use of the intended is enjoined,the blow to the much smaller am general and the community around it would be greater.about percent of am general income in the coming years is to be from the project.general motors believes it can sell per year,and the new plant is designed to meet that demand.such a plan requires a large area and a large,stable workforce.
general motors sales estimates led local and state governments to the conclusion that the new plant would bring million in new annual sales to indiana businesses.as a result,the local and state governments made extraordinary arrangements to facilitate the building of the plant,including buying area homes.word of new jobs went forth,and am general received applications for hourly positions,and another for salaried positions.at the time of the hearing,am general employees were assembling at the new plant other am general had given notice to their current employers,and some were in the process of relocating their families to start work at the new plant.by august,if no injunction is issued,people will be working in the new plant.operation of the new plant now costs am general million per month that figure is expected to increase to million per month by late summer.am general has spent more than million in recruiting,screening,testing,hiring,and training the plant workforce.to facilitate the project,the union that represents the hourly workers agreed to a labor agreement.
if general motors is enjoined from selling vehicles with the intended grille and ultimate resolution is delayed until trial which is as yet unscheduled,but which the scheduling order contemplates to take place some time in or around december,am general will have to close its new plant.since am general is paid and repays its loan only for assembled vehicles that it delivers to general motors,it will lose an enormous amount of the income that was expected to constitute more than a third of the company overall income.hundreds of people will lose their jobs,and the overall economic loss to the new plant community will be enormous and unmeasurable.
none of what the court just set forth would be changed if general motors were to choose to use the painted grille that was the subject of much of the information presented at the preliminary injunction hearing.some time after this case began,general motors designers were told to try their hand at designing a grille that could be used on the if the court enjoined use of the intended grille.daimlerchrysler stumbled upon that information late in discovery.the grille is depicted in general motors exhibit.
the alternative grille design would use the same grille that is now being produced for the,but would call for the grille to be painted so as to blacken out the top and sides of the slots,producing an optical illusion in which the eye sees eight floating bars instead of the seven slots daimlerchrysler does not contend that the painted grille would dilute or infringe its mark or family of marks daimlerchrysler argues that if general motors adopted the painted grille as the grille for the,production of the would be delayed for no more than six to eight weeks,and there might be no delay at all if general motors were to forego some testings procedures that daimlerchrysler says general motors has waived in other instances.
general motors disagrees with each aspect of daimlerchrysler argument on the painted grille.the general motors it should be noted that none of those witnesses claimed to be final on any of these that general motors would never waive quality control procedures on a part that is so conspicuous on a vehicle.the week figure,general motors notes,was scenario based on an assumption that the grille supplier would hit a home run in shifting to the painted grill,and actual delay would likely be even much longer.
most fundamentally,says general motors,the painted grille probably would never be accepted as an option.the head of the hummer division and the president of am general both said they would strongly recommend against the painted grille use because it betrays the vehicle humvee heritage.they say they would recommend that general motors put the project on hiatus and close down the plant and try to win at the december trial.daimlerchrysler notes that general motors has not made a final decision,and in light of the strategy that general motors has shown at times in this case,the court can not discount the possibility that general motors is,as daimlerchrysler counsel charged in final argument,holding a gun to its own head and to the head of this community and daring the court to pull the trigger.
nevertheless,the court believes it to be more likely than not that general motors would not use the painted grille were it temporarily enjoined from using its intended grille.general motors has invested hugely in promotion,and has led consumers to expect a vehicle of a appearance.digiovanni testified to his belief that between advertisements and auto shows,general motors has generated million impressions around the which the court understands to mean people thought to have been exposed to a promotion or advertisement that would have to be corrected if a different grille were used.the use of any different grille,even if accompanied by hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising to modify those impressions,digiovanni opined,could cost general motors five to ten percent of its anticipated million over two and a half years.
that estimate assumes that the market for the remaining ninety to percent of sales viewed the painted grille as being sufficiently consistent with the original humvee to remain prospective purchasers.general motors has done no consumer research to test that hypothesis.perhaps,as daimlerchrysler says,general motors should have done such research by was certainly enough time to do so.the question for the court,though,is what is likely to ensue if the preliminary injunction is issued,and the court is persuaded that as long as a delay might solve the problem,general motors would not roll out that risk consumer rejection either because the have a grille that is unattractive to potential purchasers,or because the have a grille that differs from what potential purchasers were led to expect,or because of both reasons.
general motors has made decisions that increased the prospective losses that would flow from an adverse decision on this motion.general motors responds that it should not have been expected to knuckle under to what it viewed as unreasonable demands of daimlerchrysler reasonable minds might agree or disagree with that proposition.nevertheless,those decisions were made by general motors,not by am general or its new the harm that an injunction would wreak on them is not of their own making.further,even setting aside the decisions general motors has made during the pendency of this suit,it remains that a preliminary injunction would be quite likely to harm irreparably general motors intellectual property and consequently to do irreparable harm to the public right to identify products.nabisco pf brands,at international kennel club,mighty star,at.
