brookfield commc ns,west coast entm t,cir.
network automation network and advanced systems concepts systems are both in the business of selling job scheduling and management software,and both advertise on the internet.network sells its software under the mark automate,while systems product is sold under the registered trademark activebatch.network decided to advertise its product by purchasing certain keywords,such as activebatch,which when keyed into various search engines,most prominently google and microsoft bing,produce a results page showing www.network automation.com as a sponsored link.systems objection to network use of its trademark to interest viewers in network website gave rise to this trademark infringement action.
the district court was confronted with the question whether network use of activebatch to advertise its products was a clever and legitimate use of readily available technology,such as google adwords,or a likely violation of the lanham act.the court found a likelihood of initial interest confusion by applying the eight factors we established more than three decades ago in amf sleekcraft boats,cir,and reasoning that the three most important factors in cases involving the internet are the similarity of the marks the relatedness of the goods and the marketing channel used.the court therefore issued a preliminary injunction against network use of the mark activebatch.
mindful that the sine qua non of trademark infringement is consumer confusion,and that the sleekcraft factors are but a nonexhaustive list of factors relevant to determining the likelihood of consumer confusion,we conclude that systems showing of a likelihood of confusion was insufficient to support injunctive relief.therefore,we vacate the injunction and reverse and remand.
factual and procedural background 
systems is a software engineering and consulting firm founded in.it has used the activebatch trademark since,and it procured federal registration of the mark in.systems markets activebatch software to businesses,which use the product to centralize and manage disparate tasks.network is a software company founded in under the name unisyn.its signature product,automate,also provides businesses with job scheduling,event monitoring,and related services.network has approximately total customers,and between and active customers,including fortune companies and and small firms.the cost of a license to use automate typically ranges from to.there is no dispute that network and systems are direct competitors,or that activebatch and automate are directly competing products.
google adwords is a program through which the search engine sells keywords,or search terms that trigger the display of a sponsor advertisement.when a user enters a keyword,google displays the links generated by its own algorithm in the main part of the page,along with the advertisements in a separate sponsored links section next to or above the objective results.see appendix multiple advertisers can purchase the same keyword,and google charges sponsors based on the number of times users click on an ad to travel from the search results page to the advertiser own website.network purchased activebatch as a keyword from google adwords and a comparable program offered by microsoft bing search engine.
as a result,consumers searching for business software who enter activebatch as a search term would locate a results page where the top objective results are links to systems own website and various articles about the product.see appendix a.in the sponsored links or sponsored sites section of the page,above or to the right of the regular results,users see network advertisement,either alone or alongside systems own sponsored link.the text of network advertisements begin with phrases such as job scheduler,intuitive job scheduler,or batch job scheduling,and end with the company web site address,www.network automation.com.the middle line reads windows job scheduling much more.easy to deploy,scalable.trial.
on november,systems demanded that network cease and desist from using the activebatch mark in its search engine advertising,as it was not authorized to use these marks in commerce.in a second letter,systems explained that network use of activebatch in its google adwords keyword advertising infringed systems trademark rights by deceiving customers into believing that network software products were affiliated with systems products.systems threatened litigation unless network immediately ceased all use of systems mark,including removing the mark from the google adwords program.network responded that its use of the activebatch mark was as a matter of law,and filed this lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment of.systems counterclaimed on february,alleging trademark infringement under the lanham act,and moved for a preliminary injunction against network use of the activebatch mark pending trial.
the district court granted injunctive relief on april.noting that the parties did not dispute the validity or ownership of the activebatch mark,the district court ruled that systems was likely to succeed in satisfying the lanham act use in commerce requirement by showing that network used the mark when it purchased advertisements from search engines triggered by the term activebatch.applying the sleekcraft test for source confusion the district court emphasized three factors it viewed as significant for cases involving the internet the similarity of the marks,relatedness of the goods or services,and simultaneous use of the web as a marketing channel.the district court concluded that all three factors favored systems network used the identical mark to sell a directly competing product,and both advertised on the internet.
the district court also concluded that systems mark was strong because,as a federally registered trademark,activebatch is presumptively distinctive.it concluded that the degree of consumer care suggested likely confusion because there is generally a low degree of care exercised by internet consumers.moreover,network intentionally used systems mark to advertise its own product.finally,the district court noted that neither party introduced evidence of actual confusion,and that the likelihood of product expansion was not relevant.
the district court also analyzed whether network infringed systems mark by creating initial interest confusion as opposed to source confusion which occurs when the defendant uses the plaintiff trademark in a manner calculated to capture initial consumer attention,even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of the confusion.quoting nissan motor nissan computer,cir internal quotations omitted.because the district court found that network advertisements did not clearly divulge their source,it concluded that consumers might be confused into unwittingly visiting network website,allowing the company to impermissibly capitalize on systems goodwill.
based on its analysis of the sleekcraft factors and its finding of likely initial interest confusion,the district court concluded that systems had a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its trademark infringement claim.it then presumed a likelihood of irreparable harm,and concluded that the balance of hardships and the public interest favored systems.following entry of the preliminary injunction,network timely appealed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.we review the grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.see,aol advertising,cir.the district court should be reversed if it based its decision on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact.id.quoting stormans,selecky,cir quotation marks omitted.
iii.discussion 
a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.winter natural res.def.council,d.network argues that the district court erred by ruling that systems was likely to succeed on the merits of its trademark claim,and by then presuming a likelihood of irreparable injury.it also contends that the preliminary injunction is overbroad.
to prevail on a claim of trademark infringement under the lanham act,a party must prove that it has a protectible ownership interest in the mark and that the defendant use of the mark is likely to cause consumer confusion.dep t of parks recreation bazaar del mundo,cir.
network does not contest the ownership or its use of the mark.we note that the district court correctly found the prerequisite use in commerce in network use of the mark to purchase keywords to advertise its products for sale on the internet.previously we have assumed,without expressly deciding,that the use of a trademark as a search engine keyword that triggers the display of a competitor advertisement is a use in commerce under the lanham act.see playboy,netscape commc ns,cir brookfield,at see also finance express llc nowcom,d.we now agree with the second circuit that such use is a use in commerce under the lanham act.see rescuecom google,cir holding that google sale of trademarks as search engine keywords is a use in commerce see also thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks unfair competition,ed.suggesting that cases taking a more restrictive view of use in this context are based on an erroneous interpretation of the lanham act.
this case,therefore,turns on whether network use of systems trademark is likely to cause consumer confusion.network argues that its use of systems mark is legitimate comparative,contextual advertising which presents sophisticated consumers with clear choices.systems characterizes network behavior differently,accusing it of misleading consumers by hijacking their attention with intentionally unclear advertisements.to resolve this dispute we must apply the sleekcraft test in a flexible manner,keeping in mind that the eight factors it recited are not exhaustive,and that only some of them are relevant to determining whether confusion is likely in the case at hand.
in sleekcraft,we analyzed the likelihood of consumer source confusion between boats that were sold under the marks sleekcraft and slickcraft.we noted that w hen the goods produced by the alleged infringer compete for sales with those of the trademark owner,infringement usually will be found if the marks are sufficiently similar that confusion can be expected.at.although both boats were designed for towing water skiers,and despite a potential overlap in the markets,we concluded that because slickcraft boats appealed to consumers desiring family recreation and sleekcraft boats appealed to the highly skilled enthusiast requiring sleekcraft higher speeds,the owners were not direct competitors.id.because the goods were not competitive,but merely related,factors in addition to the similarity of the marks were added to the calculus.id.
we identified eight relevant factors for determining whether consumers would likely be confused by related goods strength of the mark proximity of the goods similarity of the marks evidence of actual confusion marketing channels used type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser defendant intent in selecting the mark and likelihood of expansion of the product lines.id.at.we also noted that the list is not exhaustive,and that o ther variables may come into play depending on the particular facts presented.id.at.
the sleekcraft factors are intended as an adaptable proxy for consumer confusion,not a rote checklist.see,fortune dynamic,victoria secret stores brand,cir this analysis is pliant,illustrative rather than exhaustive,and best understood as simply providing helpful guideposts.dreamwerks prod,skg studio,cir the factors should not be rigidly weighed we do not count beans.eclipse data,cir these tests were not meant to be requirements or hoops that a district court need jump through to make the determination.
when we first confronted issues of trademark infringement and consumer confusion in the internet context over a decade ago in brookfield,we noted that w e must be acutely aware of excessive rigidity when applying the law in the internet context emerging technologies require a flexible approach.at.there,brookfield,a software company,marketed an entertainment database program under the mark moviebuff.it sold the software,and offered access to the database,on its website.id.at.west coast,a video retailer,had registered the mark the movie buff movie store.west coast operated a website using the domain name,which included a film database that competed with brookfield product.id.at.
we held that brookfield was likely to succeed in its claim to be the senior user of moviebuff,and that there was a likelihood of source confusion stemming from west coast use of the mark in its domain name.id.at.heeding our repeated warnings against simply launching into a mechanical application of the sleekcraft test,we determined that three of the eight factors were the most important in analyzing source confusion in the context of internet domain names the similarity of the marks the relatedness of the goods and services offered and the simultaneous use of the internet as a marketing channel.id.at.reasoning that the two marks were virtually identical in terms of sight,sound and meaning,id.at,that west coast and brookfield both offered products and services relating to movies,id.at,and that they both used the web as a marketing and advertising device,id.at,we concluded that consumer confusion was likely,particularly given the nature of the consumers at issue,who included casual movie watchers unlikely to realize that they had mistakenly clicked on to west coast site when they had intended to reach brookfield,id.at.
brookfield also asserted that west coast infringed its mark by causing initial interest confusion because it had included moviebuff in its metatags,code not visible to web users embedded in a website to attract search engines seeking a corresponding keyword id.at.although were we to apply the same analysis in the metatags context as we did in the domain name context,we would easily reach the same conclusion as to each of the factors with the possible exception of purchaser care,we declined to do so,reasoning that the question in the metatags context is quite different.id.at.in the metatags context,the question was whether west coast could use the mark moviebuff in the metatags of its website to attract search engines to locate its site when the keyword moviebuff was entered,a question analogous to the issue presented here.as in the domain name context,the degree of care and sophistication of the consumer was a key factor,although the outcome differed.we did not find a likelihood of source confusion because the results list from a search for moviebuff would result in a list that included both brookfield and west coast websites,and if the consumer clicked on west coast site its own name was prominently display ed.id.thus a consumer was much less likely to be confused about which site he was viewing.
finding no source confusion,we nonetheless concluded that west coast use of moviebuff in its metatags was likely to cause initial interest confusion.that is,by using brookfield mark moviebuff to direct persons searching for brookfield product to the west coast site,west coast derived an improper benefit from the goodwill brookfield developed in its mark.id.
five years later in playboy,we considered the practice of keying another situation analogous to that here.netscape operated a search engine that offered an early version of a keyword advertising program.it sold lists of terms to sponsors,and when users searched for the keywords on the list,the sponsor advertisement would be displayed on the results page.at.netscape required its advertisers from the adult entertainment industry to link their ads to one such list that contained more than terms,including trademarks held by playboy.id.at.playboy sued,contending that this practice infringed its trademarks in violation of the lanham act.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of netscape.id.
we reversed,holding that summary judgment was inappropriate because genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether netscape keying practices constituted actionable infringement.id.at.following brookfield,we analyzed the keying issue in terms of initial interest confusion,find ing insufficient evidence to defeat summary judgment on any other theory.id.at.playboy claimed that netscape misappropriated the goodwill of its marks by leading internet users to competitors websites just as west coast misappropriated the goodwill of brookfield mark.id.at.in framing the initial interest confusion inquiry,we stressed that playboy infringement claim relied on the fact that the linked banner advertisements were unlabeled,and were,therefore,more likely to mislead consumers into believing they had followed a link to playboy own website.id.
in playboy,as in brookfield,we applied the sleekcraft test flexibly,determining that evidence of actual confusion was the most important factor.id.at.playboy had introduced an expert study showing that a statistically significant number of internet users searching for the terms playboy and playmate would think that playboy itself sponsored the banner advertisements which appeared on the search results page.id.we noted that this study alone probably suffices to reverse the grant of summary judgment,but we nonetheless analyzed other relevant sleekcraft factors.id.as to the strength of the mark,we credited playboy expert reports showing it had created strong secondary meanings for playboy and playmate.this suggested that consumers who entered these terms were likely searching for playboy products in particular.id.at.analyzing the nature of the goods and consumer,we presume d that the average searcher seeking materials on the internet is easily diverted from a specific product he or she is seeking if other options,particularly graphic ones,appear more quickly.id.at.we concluded that there were genuine issues of material fact with respect to whether consumers were likely to be confused by netscape keying practices.id.at.
concurring,judge berzon was struck by how analytically similar the keyed advertisements in playboy were to the infringing metatags in brookfield.we agree,and also find similarity to the use of the keyword activebatch in this case.judge berzon cautioned that a broad reading of brookfield metatags holding could result in a finding of initial interest confusion when a consumer is never confused as to source or affiliation,but instead knows,or should know,from the outset that a product or web link is not related to that of the trademark holder because the list produced by the search engine so informs him.id.at berzon,concurring.she clarified that the playboy panel holding was limited to situations in which the banner advertisements are not labeled or identified.id.at.
judge berzon analogized the experience of browsing clearly labeled keyword advertisements to shopping at macy,explaining that if a shopper en route to the calvin klein section is diverted by a prominently displayed charter club macy own brand collection and never reaches the calvin klein collection,it could not be said that macy had infringed on calvin klein trademark by diverting the customer to it with a clearly labeled,but more prominent display.id.at.therefore,it would be wrong to expand the initial interest confusion theory of infringement beyond the realm of the misleading and deceptive to the context of legitimate comparative and contextual advertising.
here we consider whether the use of another trademark as a search engine keyword to trigger one own product advertisement violates the lanham act.we begin by examining the sleekcraft factors that are most relevant to the determination whether the use is likely to cause initial interest confusion while the district court analyzed each of the sleekcraft factors,it identified the three most important factors as the similarity of the marks,the relatedness of the goods or services,and the simultaneous use of the web as a marketing channel,for any case addressing trademark infringement on the internet.for this proposition the district court cited,walt disney,cir,which followed brookfield in emphasizing these three factors.see,at brookfield,at.
however,we did not intend brookfield to be read so expansively as to forever enshrine these three factors now often referred to as the internet trinity or internet troika as the test for trademark infringement on the internet.brookfield was the first to present a claim of initial interest confusion on the internet we recognized at the time it would not be the last,and so emphasized flexibility over rigidity.depending on the facts of each specific case arising on the internet,other factors may emerge as more illuminating on the question of consumer confusion.in brookfield,we used the troika factors to analyze the risk of source confusion generated by similar domain names,but we did not wholesale adopt them in the metatag analysis.at.subsequent courts similarly have found the troika helpful to resolve disputes involving websites with similar names or appearances.see,internet specialties west,milon digiorgio,cir ebay,cir interstellar starship,epix,cir,at.the leading trademark treatise correctly explains that the troika analysis is appropriate for domain name disputes.mccarthy at.
given the multifaceted nature of the internet and the ways in which we all use the technology,however,it makes no sense to prioritize the same three factors for every type of potential online commercial activity.the troika is a particularly poor fit for the question presented here.see jonathan moskin,virtual trademark use the parallel world of keyword ads,trademark reporter,arguing that the troika is inadequate for analyzing trademark infringement claims based on search engine keyword advertising because it omits important factors.the potential infringement in this context arises from the risk that while using systems mark to search for information about its product,a consumer might be confused by a results page that shows a competitor advertisement on the same screen,when that advertisement does not clearly identify the source or its product.
in determining the proper inquiry for this particular trademark infringement claim,we adhere to two long stated principles the sleekcraft factors are,and should be applied flexibly,particularly in the context of internet commerce.finally,because the sine qua non of trademark infringement is consumer confusion,when we examine initial interest confusion,the owner of the mark must demonstrate likely confusion,not mere diversion.
we turn to an examination of each sleekcraft factor to analyze whether there is a likelihood of consumer confusion in this case,assigning each factor appropriate weight in accordance with its relevance to the factual circumstances presented here.
strength of the mark 
the stronger a mark meaning the more likely it is to be remembered and associated in the public mind with the mark owner the greater the protection it is accorded by the trademark laws.brookfield,at.two relevant measurements are conceptual strength and commercial strength.conceptual strength involves classification of a mark along a spectrum of generally increasing inherent distinctiveness as generic,descriptive,suggestive,arbitrary,or fanciful.id.a mark conceptual strength depends largely on the obviousness of its connection to the good or service to which it refers.fortune dynamic,at.federal trademark r egistration alone may be sufficient in an appropriate case to satisfy a determination of distinctiveness.lahoti vericheck,cir.however,while the registration adds something on the scales,we must come to grips with an assessment of the mark itself.zobmondo entertainment,llc falls media,llc,cir.commercial strength is based on actual marketplace recognition,and thus advertising expenditures can transform a suggestive mark into a strong mark.brookfield,at.
this factor is probative of confusion here because a consumer searching for a generic term is more likely to be searching for a product category.see id.at generic terms are those used by the public to refer generally to the product rather than a particular brand of the product.that consumer is more likely to expect to encounter links and advertisements from a variety of sources.by contrast,a user searching for a distinctive term is more likely to be looking for a particular product,and therefore could be more susceptible to confusion when sponsored links appear that advertise a similar product from a different source.see contacts,d,wl at determining that contacts was a weak mark in a keyword advertising case because the nature of how third parties use generic and descriptive words on search engines suggested that users who entered the term were likely searching for a type of product.on the other hand,if the ordinary consumers of this particular product are particularly sophisticated and knowledgeable,they might also be aware that systems is the source of activebatch software and not be confused at all.
the district court acknowledged that the parties failed to address the strength of the mark,but it concluded that the factor favors systems.it reasoned that activebatch is a suggestive mark because it requires a mental leap from the mark to the product,quoting brookfield,at,and as a registered trademark it is inherently distinctive.we agree.because the mark is both systems product name and a suggestive federally registered trademark,consumers searching for the term are presumably looking for its specific product,and not a category of goods.nonetheless,that may not be the end of the inquiry about this factor,as the sophistication of the consumers of the product may also play a role.the district court properly declined to consider commercial strength,which,as an inquiry,is unnecessary at the preliminary injunction stage.
proximity of the goods 
related goods are generally more likely than unrelated goods to confuse the public as to the producers of the goods.brookfield,at.t he danger presented is that the public will mistakenly assume there is an association between the producers of the related goods,though no such association exists.sleekcraft,at.the proximity of goods is measured by whether the products are complementary sold to the same class of purchasers and similar in use and function.id.
the proximity of the goods was relevant in playboy,where unsophisticated consumers were confronted with unlabeled banner advertisements that touted material very similar to playboy own products.there,we concluded that under the circumstances,the relatedness of the goods bolstered the likelihood of confusion,and therefore favored playboy.playboy,at.however,the proximity of the goods would become less important if advertisements are clearly labeled or consumers exercise a high degree of care,because rather than being misled,the consumer would merely be confronted with choices among similar products.id.at berzon,concurring s uch choices do not constitute trademark infringement off the internet,and i can not understand why they should on the internet.
because the products at issue here are virtually interchangeable,this factor may be helpful,but it must be considered in conjunction with the labeling and appearance of the advertisements and the degree of care exercised by the consumers of the activebatch software.by weighing this factor in isolation and failing to consider whether the parties status as direct competitors would actually lead to a likelihood of confusion,the district court allowed this factor to weigh too heavily in the analysis.
similarity of the marks 
t he more similar the marks in terms of appearance,sound,and meaning,the greater the likelihood of confusion.brookfield,at.where the two marks are entirely dissimilar,there is no likelihood of confusion.id.similarity of the marks is tested on three levels sight,sound,and meaning.each must be considered as they are encountered in the marketplace.sleekcraft,at citations omitted.
in sleekcraft,we concluded that the marks sleekcraft and slickcraft were similar in terms of sight,sound,and meaning by examining the actual situations in which consumers were likely to read,hear,and consider the meaning of the terms.id.at.such an inquiry is impossible here where the consumer does not confront two distinct trademarks.rather,after entering one company mark as a search term,the consumer sees a competitor sponsored link that displays neither company trademarks.the district court erroneously treated activebatch,the keyword purchased by network,as conceptually separate from activebatch the trademark owned by systems.this is an artificial distinction that does not reflect what consumers encountered in the marketplace.again,however,because the consumer keys in systems trademark,which results in network sponsored link,depending on the labeling and appearance of the advertisement,including whether it identifies network own mark,and the degree of care and sophistication of the consumer,it could be helpful in determining initial interest confusion.
evidence of actual confusion 
a showing of actual confusion among significant numbers of consumers provides strong support for the likelihood of confusion.playboy,at citing thane int l,trek bicycle,cir evidence of actual confusion constitutes persuasive proof that future confusion is likely if enough people have been actually confused,then a likelihood that people are confused is established.however,actual confusion is not necessary to a finding of likelihood of confusion under the lanham act.academy of motion picture arts sciences creative house promotions,cir citing american int l group,american int l bank,cir.indeed,p roving actual confusion is difficult and the courts have often discounted such evidence because it was unclear or insubstantial.sleekcraft,at.
in playboy,the expert report showing a significant number of users were confused by the keying practice at issue was strong evidence that playboy infringement claim should be allowed to proceed.at.playboy,however,was decided at the summary judgment stage,whereas here we examine a sparse record supporting preliminary injunctive relief.as the district court noted,neither network nor systems provided evidence regarding actual confusion,which is not surprising given the procedural posture.therefore,while this is a relevant factor for determining the likelihood of confusion in keyword advertising cases,its importance is diminished at the preliminary injunction stage of the proceedings.the district court correctly concluded that this factor should be accorded no weight.
marketing channels 
convergent marketing channels increase the likelihood of confusion.sleekcraft,at.in sleekcraft,the two products were sold in niche marketplaces,including boat shows,specialty retail outlets,and trade magazines.id.at.however,this factor becomes less important when the marketing channel is less obscure.today,it would be the rare commercial retailer that did not advertise online,and the shared use of a ubiquitous marketing channel does not shed much light on the likelihood of consumer confusion.see playboy,at given the broad use of the internet today,the same could be said for countless companies.thus,this factor merits little weight.
therefore,the district court determination that because both parties advertise on the internet this factor weighed in favor of systems was incorrect.
type of goods and degree of care 
low consumer care increases the likelihood of confusion.playboy,at.in assessing the likelihood of confusion to the public,the standard used by the courts is the typical buyer exercising ordinary caution when the buyer has expertise in the field,a higher standard is proper though it will not preclude a finding that confusion is likely.similarly,when the goods are expensive,the buyer can be expected to exercise greater care in his purchases again,though,confusion may still be likely.sleekcraft,at citations omitted.
the nature of the goods and the type of consumer is highly relevant to determining the likelihood of confusion in the keyword advertising context.a sophisticated consumer of business software exercising a high degree of care is more likely to under
