defendants victor and cathy moseley,victor little secret,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to the plaintiffs,v secret catalogue,victoria secret stores,and victoria secret catalogue,collectively victoria secret,on the ground that the moseleys use of the name victor little secret for their lingerie and adult toy business constitutes trademark dilution under the federal trademark dilution act,c.the district court granted summary judgment to the moseleys on federal trademark infringement claims brought by victoria secret,finding that the company had not provided sufficient evidence to establish a likelihood of confusion between the two marks.however,the district court did find that the victor little secret mark both blurred and tarnished the victoria secret mark under the federal trademark dilution act ftda or the act and,therefore,enjoined the moseleys from making further use of the victor little secret mark.
on appeal,the defendants contend that entry of summary judgment resulted from the district court faulty analysis of the dilution question,when reviewed in light of the leading case of nabisco,pf brands,cir,and from the court failure to require proof of actual economic loss,as required by ringling bailey combined shows,utah div.of travel,cir.to the extent that these two recent cases are not entirely consistent in their analysis of the ftda requirements,we conclude that the second circuit has developed standards that hew most closely to the act and,applying that court analysis to the undisputed facts in this case,we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to victoria secret on the trademark dilution claim.we therefore affirm the district court judgment.
procedural and factual background 
the facts,as considered by the district court and uncontested by the parties,are as follows 
plaintiff v secret catalogue,is the record owner of the victoria secret mark,which has been registered in the united states patent and trademark office since january.v secret catalogue licenses plaintiff victoria secret catalogue,llc and plaintiff victoria secret stores,to use the victoria secret mark.victoria secret sells a complete line of women lingerie,as well as other clothing and accessories.
victoria secret stores operates over stores,and victoria secret catalogue distributes million copies of the victoria secret catalog each year,including in elizabethtown,kentucky,where defendants store i s located.victoria secret products are also sold over the internet.victoria secret has two stores in louisville,kentucky,within miles of defendants store.one store has been open since november,the other since april.in,victoria secret spent over million dollars on advertising its products.according to a recent survey,victoria secret is rated as the ninth most famous brand in the apparel industry.
in february,defendants victor and cathy moseley opened victor secret,a store in a strip mall in elizabethtown selling a wide variety of items,including men and women lingerie,adult videos,sex toys and adult novelties.the moseleys assert that they were not aware of victoria secret catalog or stores until they received a cease and desist letter from counsel for victoria secret on february.the moseleys subsequently changed the name of their store to victor little secret.
not finding the addition of little to the victor secret mark sufficient to quell its concerns,victoria secret brought suit against the moseleys in district court,claiming federal trademark infringement,unfair competition under section a of the trademark act,violation of the federal trademark dilution act,and common law trademark infringement and unfair competition.both parties filed motions for summary judgment.
considering the list of eight factors established in frisch restaurants,elby big boy of steubenville,cir,the district court found that the moseleys were entitled to summary judgment on victoria secret federal infringement claims,because victoria secret had not presented evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact that a likelihood of confusion existed between the two marks.that ruling is not before us on appeal.
instead,we are asked to reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on victoria secret federal trademark dilution act claim.in making its ruling,the district court first noted that unlike the standards that must be met to state an infringement claim,dilution can occur even where the products are not in competition and no likelihood of confusion is possible.to prove a dilution claim,the district court found that the act plain language requires a plaintiff to show that its mark is famous,the defendant is making a commercial use of its mark in commerce,the defendant use of its mark came after the plaintiff mark became famous,and the defendant use of its mark dilutes the quality of plaintiff mark.quoting panavision int l,toeppen,cir.finding it undisputed that the victoria secret mark is famous,that the moseleys are engaged in commerce,and that the registration of the victoria secret mark in long predates the opening of victor little secret in,the district court found the only element in dispute to be whether the moseleys mark diluted victoria secret.
the district court first found the marks to be sufficiently similar to cause dilution by blurring,noting that the marks component words are virtually identical,and that the inclusion of little in the moseleys mark,in smaller font above the original victor secret logo,did little to lessen their similarity next,the district court found that the moseleys mark had a tarnishing effect upon the victoria secret mark,in that included in the inventory sold by the moseleys,in addition to lingerie,are adult videos as well as sex toys and other adult novelties.the court concluded that while the defendants inventory may not be unsavory to all,its more risque quality widely differentiates it from that of the plaintiffs.finding this evidence sufficient to support a dilution claim,the district court granted summary judgment to victoria secret and enjoined the moseleys from using the victor little secret mark.since the issuance of the district court order,the moseleys have successfully operated their business as cathy little secret,apparently without objection from victoria secret.the moseleys nevertheless bring this appeal from the grant of summary judgment in the district court.
discussion 
prior to the passage of the federal trademark dilution act in,actions for trademark dilution were limited to those brought in the states that had enacted dilution statutes,and the standards for finding dilution varied widely between jurisdictions.see.the ftda was crafted because famous marks ordinarily are used on a nationwide basis and dilution protection is currently only available on a system of protection further,court decisions have been inconsistent and some courts are reluctant to grant nationwide injunctions for violation of state law where half of the states have no dilution law.id.the ftda provides that 
the owner of a famous mark shall be entitled,subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court deems reasonable,to an injunction against another person commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name,if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark,and to obtain such other relief as is provided in this subsection.in determining whether a mark is distinctive and famous,a court may consider factors such as,but not limited to 
a the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark 
b the duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the goods or services with which the mark is used 
c the duration and extent of advertising and publicity of the mark 
d the geographical extent of the trading area in which the mark is used 
e the channels of trade for the goods or services with which the mark is used 
f the degree of recognition of the mark in the trading areas and channels of trade used by the mark owner and the person against whom the injunction is sought 
g the nature and extent of use of the same or similar marks by third parties and h whether the mark was registered under the act of march,or the act of february,or on the principal register.
the act further defines dilution as the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services,regardless of the presence or absence of competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties,or likelihood or confusion,mistake,or deception.courts have not made a uniform application of the ftda,however,individual circuits having applied a different set of standards to arising claims,many of which seem to blur the distinction between proving likelihood of confusion in a traditional infringement claim and proving trademark dilution.see mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition.
analysis of the ftda preliminary factors.
in our most recent ftda decision,kellogg exxon,cir,decided some two months after entry of the district court opinion in this case,we adopted the second circuit standards for determining dilution set out in nabisco,at.the nabisco test requires that to establish a dilution claim,the senior mark must be famous it must be distinctive the junior use must be a commercial use in commerce it must begin after the senior mark has become famous and it must cause dilution of the distinctive quality of the senior mark.kellogg,at quoting nabisco,at.without the benefit of our opinion,the district court instead applied a test for dilution established by the ninth circuit in panavision,at.the panavision test requires a plaintiff to prove that the mark is famous the defendant is making a commercial use of the mark in commerce the defendant use began after the mark became famous and the defendant use of the mark dilutes the quality of the mark by diminishing the capacity of the mark to identify and distinguish goods and services.id.the two tests are substantially similar,with the only material difference being that the test requires a plaintiff to prove that its mark is not only famous,but also distinctive.
although in kellogg we did not conduct a full dilution analysis,the second circuit provided an extended discussion of distinctiveness in the nabisco decision,as follows 
distinctiveness in a mark is a characteristic quite different from fame.distinctiveness is a crucial trademark concept,which places marks on a ladder reflecting their inherent strength or weakness.the degree of distinctiveness of a mark governs in part the breadth of the protection it can command.at the low end are generic that name the species or object to which the mark applies.these are totally without distinctiveness and are ineligible for protection as marks because to give them protection would be to deprive competitors of the right to refer to their products by name thus,no one can claim the exclusive right to use the mark car for a car.one rung up the ladder are descriptive that describe the product or its attributes or claims.these also have little distinctiveness and accordingly are ineligible for protection unless they have acquired secondary meaning that is,unless the consuming public has come to associate the mark with the products or services of its user t he next higher rung belongs to suggestive marks these fall in an category they do not name or describe the product for which they are used,but they suggest the qualities or claims of that product.they are more distinctive than descriptive marks,and thus are accorded trademark rights without need to demonstrate that consumers have come to associate them with the user of the mark nonetheless,because they seek to suggest qualities of the product,they possess a low level of distinctiveness.the are given less protection than is reserved for more distinctive that are arbitrary or fanciful.a mark is arbitrary or fanciful if there is no logical relationship whatsoever between the mark and the product on which it is used.however,even within the category of arbitrary or fanciful marks,there is still a substantial range of distinctiveness.some marks may qualify as arbitrary because they have no logical relationship to the product,but nonetheless have a low level of distinctiveness because they are common.the most distinctive are marks that are entirely the product of the imagination and evoke no association with human experience that relate intrinsically to the product the strongest protection of the trademark laws is reserved for these most highly distinctive marks.
nabisco,at citations omitted.
the second circuit went on to note that it took the requirement that a mark be distinctive from the text of the ftda,which requires that the junior mark use must cause dilution of the distinctive quality of the plaintiff mark and lists as a factor to be considered whether the mark is distinctive and famous.id.at.finally,the second circuit concluded that 
the requirement of distinctiveness is furthermore an important limitation.a mark that,notwithstanding its fame,has no distinctiveness is lacking the very attribute that the antidilution statute seeks to protect.the antidilution statute seeks to guarantee exclusivity not only in cases where confusion would occur but throughout the realms of commerce.many famous marks are of the common or or as american,national,federal,federated,first,united,acme,merit or ace.it seems most unlikely that the statute contemplates allowing the holders of such common,albeit famous,marks to exclude all new entrants.that is why the statute grants that privilege only to holders of distinctive marks.
because it applied the panavision test instead of the test derived from nabisco,the district court did not explicitly consider the distinctiveness of the victoria secret mark as a factor of the plaintiffs prima facie case,and the moseleys now contend albeit in a different context that the mark is not distinctive they argue that because there are hundreds of lingerie concerns that use the word secret as part of their mark,it can not be considered an arbitrary or fanciful term deserving a high level of protection.in this argument,however,the defendants err by failing to consider the victoria secret mark as a whole.for in the context of considering two marks similarity,we have endorsed the rule,which serves to remind courts not to focus only on the prominent features of the mark,or only on those features that are prominent for purposes of the litigation,but on the mark in its totality.jet,sewage aeration systems,cir.obviously,the rule is equally applicable in considering a mark distinctiveness.
in this case,for example,although the word secret may provoke some intrinsic association with prurient interests,it is not automatically linked in the ordinary human experience with lingerie.secret is not particularly descriptive of bras and hosiery.nor is there anything about the combination of the possessive victoria and secret that automatically conjures thoughts of women,of course,in the context of plaintiff line of products.hence,we conclude that the victoria secret mark ranks with those that are arbitrary and fanciful and is therefore deserving of a high level of trademark protection.although the district court applied a slightly different test from the one now established in this circuit,the court would undoubtedly have reached the same result under the nabisco test.certainly,we can not say that the court erred in finding that the preliminary factors of a dilution claim had been met by victoria secret.
analysis of dilution.
in this case,the moseleys do not challenge the fact that the victoria secret mark is famous,nor do they dispute that they are using their victor little secret mark in commerce and began doing so after the victoria secret mark became famous.the only element at issue,therefore,is whether their mark dilutes that of victoria secret.as noted above,the ftda defines dilution as the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services,regardless of the presence or absence of competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties,or likelihood or confusion,mistake,or deception.in applying these terms,the circuits have not adopted a uniform approach,instead applying a somewhat amorphous set of factors to each particular case.see,nabisco,at advocating the adoption of a cautious and gradual approach to developing factors to determine dilution.the sixth circuit has not yet conducted a full analysis of a dilution claim under the ftda and,thus,has not articulated the standards it will apply in determining whether a junior mark causes dilution.that task now falls to us.
the district court,in analyzing victoria secret claim,found that 
dilution corrodes a trademark by blurring its product identification or by damaging positive associations that have attached to it.panavision,at.dilution through tarnishing that may create a negative association with the goods or services covered by the senior mark.ringling bailey combined shows,utah div.of travel.in order to dilute a more senior mark,the junior mark must be sufficiently similar.we find that defendants mark is sufficiently similar to plaintiffs mark in order to cause dilution 
the district court went on to find that defendants mark dilutes plaintiffs mark because of its tarnishing effect upon the victoria secret mark while the defendants inventory may not be unsavory to all,its more risque quality widely differentiates it from that of the plaintiffs.
in reviewing the district court truncated dilution analysis,we must now decide which factors are relevant to the determination of a dilution claim under the ftda.although the tests adopted by other circuits vary in the level of detail they apply to the claims,the qualities these tests consider are essentially the same.however,a split has developed among the circuits with respect to one crucial element whether a plaintiff must prove actual,present injury to its mark to state a federal dilution claim.the leading cases are ringling brothers,at,in which the fourth circuit held that a plaintiff must provide evidence of actual,present injury to the famous mark,and nabisco,in which the second circuit explicitly rejected the fourth circuit more stringent approach.thus,in reviewing the present case,we must determine,first,which factors will be taken into account in determining if dilution of a mark has occurred,and second,whether to require a plaintiff to present evidence of actual harm to its famous mark,aligning ourselves with either the ringling brothers or the nabisco line of cases 
the actual harm requirement ringling bailey utah division of travel development.
in ringling brothers,the circus moguls contended that the state of utah use of the slogan the greatest snow on earth diluted their famous mark,the greatest show on earth.see ringling,at.analyzing ringling brothers claims under the ftda,the fourth circuit found that dilution under the federal act consists of a sufficient similarity of marks to evoke in consumers a mental association of the two that causes actual harm to the senior marks economic value as a and advertising agent.id.at.
the fourth circuit in ringling brothers conceded that an actual harm requirement does not leap fully and immediately from the statutory text,but nevertheless found it to lie in the statute legislative history.id.the court traced the origin of modern dilution law to frank schechter seminal article,the rational basis of trademark protection,harv,in which schechter argued that the true harm of diluting junior marks was not consumer confusion but the gradual whittling away or dispersion of the identity and hold upon the public mind of the mark or name by its use upon goods.id.at.the court termed this theory radical and extreme,and stated that there was no legislative adoption of the concept in any form until when massachusetts enacted the first state antidilution statute.ringling,at.however,as the court notes,states followed the lead of massachusetts in the years preceding adoption of the ftda,and adopted modified versions of schechter proposal as state antidilution law.see id.the court found that 
though they of course varied in detail,the state statutes typically had four features of relevance for our interpretive purposes they defined the category of marks protected against dilution solely by reference to their distinctive quality they proscribed not just actual,consummated dilution,but the likelihood of dilution by containing no express reference to harm to the senior mark economic value,they defined dilution in terms susceptible to the interpretation that it consisted solely of a loss of the mark distinctiveness and they provided only injunctive relief.
the court then looked to the restatement third of unfair competition for a summary of how these various statutes were applied by the state courts.the court noted the sheer difficulty that courts have had in getting a firm handle on the basic concept of dilution as cryptically expressed in the typical state statute by an unelaborated reference to dilution of the distinctive quality of a mark.id.at.attempting to synthesize the state court decisions,the fourth circuit found 
al though the typical state statute formulation is susceptible to an reading distinctive quality as essentially synonymous with uniqueness in the schechter model,no court seems to have taken that blunt approach.instead,frequently alluding to schechter identification of the senior mark selling power,and the whittling away of that power as the ultimate concerns of dilution special protective function,the courts seem generally to have assumed that loss of that power,and the economic value it represents,was the end harm at which the antidilution statutes were aimed.
the fourth circuit recognized that the true interpretive problem with the state court decisions had been how that loss of power and economic value could be proved.see id.at.the court found three general approaches.first,during the period of general judicial hostility to the whole statutory dilution concept some courts,seeming to assume that the requisite harm could only be shown by evidence of some form of consumer confusion presumably other than source confusion,invariably found such proof lacking.id.a second approach,delineated by judge sweet in his concurring opinion in mead data central,toyota motor sales,cir,assumed both that likelihood of harm to selling power must be proved,and that such harm could occur despite the absence of any consumer confusion though not expressed in those exact procedural terms,the suggestion was effectively that proof must and could be sought through the normal judicial process of by inference from a set of contextual factors degree of mark and product similarity,that he proposed as relevant for the purpose.ringling,at.finally,the court found that some courts have taken the position,in part at least for the very reason that they consider likelihood of harm to a mark selling power to be incapable of direct or inferential proof,that it may simply be presumed from the identity or sufficient similarity of the marks.id.
the fourth circuit then cast the ftda against this history of state statute interpretation,finding two aspects of its construction to be particularly relevant.most critically,the federal act proscribes and provides remedy only for actual,consummated dilution and not for the mere likelihood of dilution proscribed by the state statutes.and,by specifically defining dilution as the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services,the federal act makes plain what the state statutes arguably may not that the end harm at which it is aimed is a mark selling power,not its distinctiveness as such.id.at.the court found its concededly stringent definition of dilution,requiring an actual lessening of the senior mark selling power,expressed as its capacity to identify and distinguish goods or services to follow from these points.id.to hold otherwise,the court asserted,would be to find a property right in gross in a mark distinctiveness,and to rely upon judicial presumption where actual proof should be required.id.at.
the ringling brothers court then faced the question of how a plaintiff might prove a lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services.the court conceded that the difficulties
