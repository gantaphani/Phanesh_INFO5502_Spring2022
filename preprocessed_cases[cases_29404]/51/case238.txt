background 
harley is universally recognized as a manufacturer of high quality motorcycles.in,it established the harley owners group,a member social club for people who own harley motorcycles.buyers of harley motorcycles receive a free,membership in the harley owners group,but they must pay annual dues or buy a lifetime membership to remain in the club.since,the club has offered travel services to members attending motorcycle rallies.the federal patent and trademark office has issued harley the registered trademarks hog and to refer to its motorcyclist club 
dean and debbie anderson are longtime harley motorcycle owners and members of the shenandoah valley chapter of the harley owners group.in,dean anderson came up with an idea to sell a cruise to motorcyclists.he was tired of attending traditional motorcycle rallies because the weather was unpredictable and because vendors charged inflated prices for food and lodging.he pitched the cruise idea to david gray,harley east coast harley owners group representative,but gray said that harley would not be interested in sponsoring a cruise.the andersons continued to explore the possibility of offering the cruise on their own and eventually incorporated top quality as a means of selling their product.they decided to name the cruise hogs on the high seas a catchy name that they believed captured the essence of their product.
in august,the andersons created the first advertisement for their cruise.it said,annual harley owners cruise rally in large print immediately above a circular logo that contained the words hogs on the high seas and a cartoon pig riding a large motorcycle on an ocean wave.top quality website said,bring your harley friends,hog group members,riding buddies,there wo be a stranger on the ship.top quality advised potential vendors that the trip was an all harley owners cruise ship rally.percent of the passengers on the first cruise owned harley motorcycles.
since november,top quality has sponsored several cruises in the carribean and alaska.passengers are not allowed to bring their motorcycles on the ship,but there are vendors who display motorcycles and products and services.the cruises include entertainment,contests,and excursions that are designed to appeal to motorcycle enthusiasts.
there is evidence that some of top quality potential customers have been confused about whether the cruise is sponsored by the harley owners group.shortly after it was launched,top quality website posted a list of frequently asked questions that included,do i have to be a hog member and can i get on this rally cruise if i do own a harley davidson brand bike.in surveys completed after the cruise,a number of passengers used the word hog to refer to top quality passengers and events.additionally,prospective customers have referred to the cruise in their communication with top quality as hd cruise,harley cruise,and hog cruise.a consumer survey conducted by harley expert suggests that percent of motorcycle riders who view top quality promotional materials believe that harley promotes or approves of top quality cruises.the same survey suggests that much of this confusion stems from top quality use of the word hog and the word association with the harley owners group.
there is also evidence that top quality has attempted to limit any such confusion.its website currently disclaims association with harley and the harley owners group,and it has printed similar statements on literature that it distributes at motorcycle rallies.top quality brochures also state that dean and debbie anderson are the owners of hogs on the high seas and that they are independent cruise consultants.
on january,top quality applied to register the hogs on the high seas mark in connection with travel arrangements in the nature of cruises for motorcycle owners and enthusiasts.on january,harley filed an opposition proceeding against the application,and on june,harley filed the complaint in this case.it alleged trademark infringement,false designation of origin,and unfair competition claims under the lanham act and state law.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court granted top quality and denied harley motion.it concluded that a second circuit decision,harley davidson,grottanelli,cir,which held harley mark generic,collaterally estopped harley from arguing that its mark was protectable.
the district court said that grottanelli pertains to any use of the word hog,including the acronym when hog is used in relation to motorcycle products or services.michigan,top quality service,wl,emphasis in original.the district court further observed as follows 
in holding that hog is generic,the court did not single out the mark as because it refers to people rather than motorcycles.to the contrary,it mentioned the mark as part of harley illegitimate efforts to exclude the term hog from the generic pool thus,the grottanelli court was aware of the mark and that the acronym denoted members of harley owner sic group rather than motorcycles.nevertheless,the court made no distinction between harley application of the term hog to large motorcycles and to members.
id.internal citations omitted.with regard to harley unfair competition claim,the district court recognized that a plaintiff using a generic name can succeed on such a claim if the defendant has not adequately identified itself as the source of its product.the court concluded,however,that top quality had identified itself as the source of its product by disclaiming any association with harley.id.at.harley appeals the district court ruling on top quality motion for summary judgment.
ii.analysis 
the court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is appropriate where the evidence in the record shows no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.steen myers,cir.we take the facts in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.see anderson liberty lobby,d.
