in,james douglas coined the abbreviation obx as a designation for the outer banks.his idea was prompted by a similar abbreviated designation for nantucket and the oval automobile stickers used in europe to identify countries.douglas began putting obx in black letters on white oval stickers to put on automobiles,and initially he gave these obx stickers away for free.while recipients were at first confused,following some persistence,the stickers and the abbreviation caught on beyond douglas most ambitious expectations.he not only placed the letters on oval stickers,but formed a business corporation,and expanded the use of obx to affix the letters to a wide range of items being sold from the outer banks.over the period from to,spent a total of on advertising,promotion,and sponsorships,and the corporation has become financially successful,with an annual revenue in exceeding million.
when questioned about the intended significance of the obx letters,douglas testified that they were used by to signify a geographic location.thus when asked,i s it fair to say that you hope that consumers seeing your obx stickers would think of the geographic region outer banks douglas responded,yes.when asked what his product was and,more particularly,whether it was the oval logo including the letters obx,douglas stated that the company product was actually the obx in general since it had not been used before.explaining how his product was understood,he testified 
q.did you have communications about what obx signified 
thank you.could you tell me about those communications 
a.it stood for the outer banks.
as a result of efforts in promoting obx as a designation for the outer banks,the businesses and residents of the outer banks have come to use the abbreviation obx on a daily basis to refer to the outer banks.local headlines have read,an obx institution says goodbye,and contest winner fell under obx spell.by,thousands of website domain names incorporated obx into their name,ranging from to.businesses use obx to describe their location such as,best pizza in obx or enjoy the obx with us.those wishing to charter a sailboat can call,while a local business directory says welcome to obx,your source to the outer banks businesses.individuals advertise vacation rentals with obx by owner,while realtors welcome obx homeowners.there is an obx swim club,an obx nudist club,and an online forum discussing obx fishing.the initials obx are omnipresent in the outer banks and are universally understood as an abbreviation for outer banks.
beginning in,began efforts to register obx as a trademark on the principal register of the patent and trademark office pto.the pto examiners,however,repeatedly rejected applications,stating,at one time obx may have been an obscure reference to the outer banks of north carolina,however those days are no more.the examiner cited extensive evidence wherein obx and outer banks are used interchangeably.after repeated,unsuccessful efforts,enlisted the assistance of north carolina congressional delegation,and the pto then granted four registrations for obx on the principal register in connection with several classes of products and services,including stickers,sports clothing,tourist sundries,bottled drinking water,entertainment services,ethnic festivals,and sporting events.
after obtaining trademark registrations,undertook efforts to police its trademarks,sending out letters.but the evidence demonstrates that the extensive use of obx made these attempts futile.
bicast,was the target of one of the cease and desist letters because it sold oval stickers bearing ob xtreme in pink cursive script.while bicast had long sold products bearing ob for the outer banks,in,it began producing stickers that added the xtreme language to denote the wide variety of extreme sports available at the outer banks.when bicast refused demand to cease and desist,commenced the present action.
on bicast motion,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of bicast,concluding that the overwhelming evidence showed that obx had become either generic or geographically descriptive without secondary meaning.under either theory,it held,the mark was invalid and hence could not be infringed.the district court,however,declined bicast request,under,to cancel the obx trademarks from the principal register.
from the district court judgment dated june,filed this appeal,challenging the summary judgment entered in favor of bicast,and bicast filed a,challenging the district court refusal to cancel the obx registrations.

on appeal,contends that the geographical descriptiveness of obx is not its fault 
if any geographic connotation to the obx mark has developed over time,it is attributable to the efforts of douglas and and the ensuing success of the goods sold under the mark.indeed,the district court noted that plaintiff efforts to market obx car stickers and other products have been largely responsible for the term ubiquity.a trademark owner,whose efforts whether directly through advertising or indirectly through publicity develop commercial success for goods,should not be punished because its mark has become associated with a geographic location.
citations omitted.yet fails to address specifically the absence of evidence of secondary meaning.it suggests that the universal recognition of obx as an abbreviation for outer banks through promotions and use of the term on a broad array of products provides evidence of secondary meaning.it states 
the extensive media coverage of a relatively small business indicates the success of marketing the obx mark as an indicator of a single source for,among other things,license plates,sports clothing and that famous sticker bearing the mark.it is clear that the public would understand the products to come from a source which owns some form of rights to the obx mark.
