rival claims to the stolichnaya trademarks have been asserted by an agency of the russian federation and by successors in interest to a soviet enterprise.the principal issue is whether federal treasury enterprise sojuzplodoimport fte,an agency of the russian federation,has been endowed by that government with rights and powers that give it standing to pursue claims under section of the lanham act the section claims.the question has been here before.we conclude that the united states district court for the southern district of new york scheindlin,erred in determining whether fte asserted basis for standing was valid under russian law.we further conclude that the district court correctly dismissed all of fte other claims the claims as barred by both res judicata and laches.
fte and oao moscow distillery cristall cristall allege that the defendants unlawfully misappropriated and commercially exploited the stolichnaya trademarks related to the sale of vodka and other spirits in the united states the marks.currently,control over the marks in the united states is exercised by defendants as successors in interest to a soviet state enterprise spirits international spirits international n,spi spirits limited,spi group sa,yuri shefler,and alexey oliynik collectively,spi.the other defendants are licensed distributors of spi william grant sons usa and william grant sons,collectively,william grant allied domecq international holdings and allied domecq spirits wines usa,allied domecq spirits,usa collectively,allied domecq and stoli group usa llp stoli group.
in a prior suit,fte brought claims against spi under section of the lanham act,as well as analogous federal and state law claims.we dismissed fte section claims on the ground that the russian federation itself retained too great an interest in the marks for fte to qualify as an assign with standing to sue.fed.treasury enter.sojuzplodoimport spi spirits,cir.fte claims were either dismissed on the merits,voluntarily dismissed,or dropped during the course of that litigation.
subsequently,the russian federation issued a decree the decree,directing the federal agency for state property management state property management to transfer to fte the rights of the russian federation to the marks.pursuant to the decree,an assignment was executed the assignment,purporting to transfer the russian federation entire right,title,and interest in and to the marks to fte.fte then filed the present lawsuit,once again asserting both section and claims against spi.defendants moved to dismiss.
in a series of orders,the district court ruled that i fte lacked statutory standing to assert the section claims because the assignment was invalid under russian law ii fte claims were barred by res judicata in light of the prior litigation and iii the claims were also barred by laches.
we conclude that the doctrines of comity and act of state preclude a united states court from invalidating an action of a foreign sovereign with respect to a transfer of rights among its branches or entities on the ground that the transfer is invalid under the law of that foreign sovereign.accordingly,because the district court undertook to determine whether the assignment from the russian federation to fte was valid under russian law,we vacate the district court dismissal of fte section claims for lack of standing and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.we affirm the dismissal of fte claims as barred by res judicata and laches.
background 
beginning in the,the soviet union manufactured and marketed premium vodka under the name stolichnaya from the capital in russian.in,a soviet state enterprise called spi obtained a federal trademark in the united states for stolichnaya vodka.spi later renamed vvo spi licensed the use of the marks to various distributors in the united states.those distributors,which at the time included pepsico,sold stolichnaya branded vodka in the united states throughout the and.as the soviet union began to collapse in the early,many soviet state enterprises were privatized.vvo spi was purportedly privatized by its directors and managers under the new name vao spi,which later became controlled by spi.
as the asserted successor in interest to vvo spi,spi represented itself as the owner of the marks.when pepsico license of the marks ended in,spi entered into a series of licensing agreements with defendants allied domecq,william grant,and stoli group to distribute vodka bearing the marks in the united states i allied domecq from to ii william grant from to and iii stoli group from to present.
in,a russian court held that vvo spi was not validly privatized under russian law and that ownership of the marks had remained with the soviet union,and therefore with the russian federation.in,the russian federation formed fte to be the legitimate successor to vvo spi,and fte entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with cristall to distribute vodka bearing the marks in the united states.
in,fte and cristall filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against spi and its allied domecq,alleging violations of section of the lanham act,which provides a cause of action for owners of registered trademarks,and alleging violations of other provisions of the lanham act and state law that do not require trademark registration.the district court dismissed the lanham act claims on the ground that the marks had been incontestable as well as the state law claims of fraud and unjust enrichment.fed.treasury enter.sojuzplodoimport spirits int l,d,fte i.fte remaining state law claims unfair competition and false designation of origin were voluntarily dismissed.

following fte iv,and evidently in response to it,the russian federation issued the decree,which ordered that 
state property management is to conclude with fte an agreement on transferring to the said enterprise the rights of the russian federation to trademarks containing verbal designations stolichnaya stoli used on the territory of the united states on all territories subject to the jurisdiction of the united states of america.
pursuant to the decree,the assignment was executed that transferred to fte the russian federation entire right,title,and interest in and to the marks.
fte and cristall as fte licensee then brought the present lawsuit,again asserting both section and claims.the defendants moved to dismiss,arguing that fte did not acquire statutory standing to bring the section claims because the russian federation assignment was invalid under russian law,and that in any event all of fte claims were barred by res judicata and laches.in a series of decisions,the district court held that fte still lacked statutory standing to bring its section claims because the assignment was invalid under russian law,and that the claims were barred by res judicata as well as laches.the parties.
