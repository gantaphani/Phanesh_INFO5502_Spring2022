superformance international,superformance contends that hartford casualty insurance company hartford,as its insurer under a commercial general liability policy,owes it a defense and indemnity in a trademark infringement action brought against superformance in the district of massachusetts by carroll shelby,carroll shelby licensing,shelby american,and ford motor company.the district court granted summary judgment to hartford,ruling essentially that the policy did not cover injuries arising from conduct that preceded the policy issuance and that the underlying complaint did not allege claims falling within coverage for advertising injury.for reasons that differ somewhat from those given by the district court,we affirm.
superformance,an ohio corporation with its principal place of business in newport news,virginia,is a manufacturer of specialty motor vehicles,including replicas of classic cars or replicars,kit cars,and related parts and accessories.among the replicars it manufactures and promotes for sale are race cars and roadsters modeled after the cobra and shelby cobra designs,and in connection with their sale,superformance employs the use of the names cobra and ford and allegedly other trademarks connected with the original cobra vehicles.
the cobra racing cars,after which superformance replicars are modeled,were designed and manufactured in the by carroll shelby in collaboration with the ford motor company,and the vehicles used the trade name cobra and designs depicting the cobra snake.ford,which owns numerous trademarks that include cobra and the snake,has granted carroll shelby and his businesses,carroll shelby licensing,and shelby american,an exclusive license to use the trademarks relating to cobra and the cobra snake designs for the vintage automobiles created,designed,and manufactured by shelby.carroll shelby owns numerous trademarks that include shelby.
in december,shelby commenced a trademark infringement action against superformance in the district of massachusetts the massachusetts litigation.as originally filed,shelby complaint alleged,in six counts,trademark infringement and dilution under and of the lanham act and and state common law,as well as unfair competition under state common and statutory law.in august,shelby amended its complaint to allege a seventh count for violation of the united states import statutes prohibiting the importation of counterfeit products,particularly motor vehicles using shelby trademarks.three months later,in november,ford motor company intervened in the massachusetts litigation,filing its own complaint in six counts that parallel shelby original six counts.it is in connection with this massachusetts litigation that superformance seeks coverage from hartford under the insurance policy issued by it.
superformance did not purchase its policy from hartford until three months after shelby commenced its action in the massachusetts litigation.specifically,on march,superformance purchased a commercial general liability policy to cover liability for,among other types of injury,personal and advertising injury.the policy was an occurrence policy,which means that it covered only personal and advertising injury if the offense was committed in the coverage territory which includes the united states during the policy period of march,to march.after superformance purchased this policy from hartford,shelby added the seventh count to its complaint in the massachusetts litigation relating to superformance imports of counterfeit vehicles and ford intervened to file its complaint asserting trademark infringement,trademark dilution,and unfair competition claims.
the insurance policy defines personal and advertising injury in relevant part as injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses 
oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person or organization goods,products or services or 
oral or written publication of material that violates a person rights of privacy or 
copying,in your advertisement,a person or organization advertising idea or style of advertisement or 
infringement of copyright,slogan,or title of any literary or artistic work,in your advertisement.
the policy excludes coverage for injury 
arising out of oral or written publication of material whose first publication took place before the beginning of the policy period or 
arising out of the infringement of trademark,trade name,service mark or other designation of origin or authenticity.
several months after superformance purchased the policy from hartford,it tendered the defense of the massachusetts litigation to hartford,characterizing the suit as one for federal trademark infringement,federal and state trademark dilution and related causes of action.hartford denied coverage under the policy,summarizing its position 
plaintiff complaint does not state any claim that could even arguably meet the definition of occurrence,bodily injury,property damage or personal and advertising injury as stated in the policy.in addition,trademark related claims are specifically excluded from coverage.moreover,to the extent any personal and advertising injury occurred prior to march,the policy expressly excludes coverage for material first published before the beginning of the policy period.with respect to advertising injury,plaintiff does not allege any injury sustained from an advertisement of the insured.
superformance thereafter commenced this action for breach of the insurance contract,seeking a declaratory judgment that hartford insurance policy covers the claims alleged in the massachusetts litigation and that hartford breached its duties under the policy.the complaint also seeks money damages,including the costs incurred in defending the massachusetts litigation.
on for summary judgment,the district court entered judgment in favor of hartford,holding that any potential claim is precluded under the policy first publication exclusion.the court found that the shelby complaint as amended and the ford complaint,both of which were filed in the massachusetts litigation after the issuance of the policy,were subject to the exclusion because they used the same language as the original shelby complaint that preceded the policy and the gravamen of the complaints was the same.the court characterized superformance claim against hartford as an attempt to obtain retroactive insurance,which the policy prohibited by limiting coverage to occurrences during the policy period and by including the first publication exclusion.the court also held that even if the exclusion was not applicable to all of the allegations in the massachusetts litigation,most of the offenses asserted against superformance did not qualify as personal and advertising injury as defined by the policy.as to claims of trade dress infringement,which the district court found would be covered by the hartford policy,the court concluded that the allegations failed to state facts sufficient to support any such claims.
from the district court judgment granting hartford motion for summary judgment and denying superformance motion,superformance filed this appeal.
superformance concedes on appeal that counts i through vi of the shelby complaint do not implicate hartford duty to defend because these counts were alleged prior to the policy period and therefore of necessity related to offenses committed before the policy period.it contends,however,that count vii of the shelby complaint and all of the counts of the ford complaint,which were added to the massachusetts litigation after superformance secured the insurance policy,allege violations that were committed during the policy period and therefore require a defense under the policy.
because we can not,as a matter of law,foreclose the possibility that count vii of the shelby complaint and the entire ford complaint allege some conduct occurring during the policy period,we agree that coverage for these counts can not categorically be barred by invocation of the policy,march,to march.accordingly,with respect to those vii of the shelby complaint and the six counts of the ford turn to the language of the
