background 
pure country brought this action against sigma chi on march,asserting a cause of action for civil contempt alleging that sigma chi had violated a consent decree,phi theta delta buchroeder,decree and order of dismissal hereinafter consent decree,entered in the united states district court for the western district of missouri to resolve litigation brought by buchroeder buchroeder against sigma chi fraternity and another college fraternity hereinafter referred to as the buchroeder case and a cause of action under seeking a declaration that sigma chi name and insignia are not protectable under state or federal trademark law sigma chi is barred under the consent decree from taking certain actions including suing pure country for trademark violations sigma chi is barred by waiver,laches,or estoppel from seeking trademark protection and,even if sigma chi trademark is protectable,pure country did not infringe upon it.in its complaint pure country alleged the following facts

sigma chi moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.in support of its motion,sigma chi argued that pure country,as a to the consent decree,lacked standing to assert rights under the consent decree.sigma chi did not file an answer to the complaint.
while sigma chi motion to dismiss was pending,pure country filed a motion to file amended pleading and to add additional parties.pure country also filed,along with its motion,a proposed amended complaint.the amended complaint contains new plaintiffs and defendants,modifications to the original facts and causes of action,and two new causes of action.in its motion to amend the complaint,pure country asserted rule a,provides that a party may amend its pleading before a responsive pleading is filed only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party,and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.joint appendix at plaintiff motion to file amended pleadings and to add additional parties at.

discussion 
denial of motion for leave to amend complaint 
as stated above,before sigma chi had served pure country with an answer to the original complaint and while sigma chi motion to dismiss the original complaint was pending,pure country filed a motion to amend the complaint and to add parties.pure country attached a proposed amended complaint to its motion to amend.the district court denied pure country motion to amend on the ground that it had become moot as a result of the district court grant of sigma chi motion to dismiss.pure country now argues on appeal that the district court erroneously denied its motion to amend because,under.a,it could amend its complaint once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading was served by sigma chi and a motion to dismiss is not a responsive pleading.pure country further asserts that the right to amend includes the right to add causes of action and facts as well as the right to add parties.see brief for appellant at.
in response,sigma chi recognizes that,ordinarily under.a,a plaintiff may amend its complaint once as a matter of course before a responsive pleading is filed.however,sigma chi contends that,by filing a motion to amend the complaint,rather than simply filing the amended complaint,pure country invoked the district court discretionary authority to deny pure country permission to amend the complaint.therefore,sigma chi concludes,the district court denial of the motion to amend is reviewed merely for an abuse of discretion,and none occurred.
to begin,we disagree with sigma chi suggestion that the mere act of filing a motion to amend or seeking leave to amend negates the otherwise applicable as a matter of course language of rule a.in other words,seeking leave to amend does not,by itself,invoke the district court discretionary authority to deny leave if the amendment would otherwise fall within the purview of the first sentence of rule a.in the present case,however,pure country did not merely file a motion for leave to amend the complaint and either implicitly or explicitly rely on the as a matter of course language of rule a.rather,in its motion to amend,pure country expressly quoted and relied upon a different part of the rule.as stated,above,pure country argued to the district court in its motion to amend rule a,provides that a party may amend its pleading before a responsive pleading is filed only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party,and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.joint appendix at plaintiff motion to file amended pleadings and to add additional parties at.in other words,pure country specifically asked the district court to apply a legal standard that is completely different from the one it now urges us to apply on appeal.under the particular circumstances of the present case,we review the district court failure to apply the correct legal standard only for plain error because pure country clearly waived its right to rely on that standard.on that question alone,we find no plain error.
however,in denying pure country motion to amend the complaint,the district court did not exercise any discretion based upon the interests of justice.instead,the district court ignored pure country motion to amend,granted sigma chi motion to dismiss the original complaint,and then denied pure country motion to am
