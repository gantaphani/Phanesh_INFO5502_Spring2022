on january,hensley manufacturing sued propride,sean woodruff,and jim hensley in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.hensley manufacturing brought claims of trademark infringement and unfair competition in violation of the lanham act,common law trademark infringement,breach of contract against jim hensley,misappropriation of trade secrets against woodruff and propride,and tortious interference with business relations.specifically,hensley manufacturing alleged that defendants had misappropriated the plaintiff registered trademark by offering for sale products and services utilizing the hensley trademark,such that there was a strong likelihood of confusion in the marketplace as to the source of origin and sponsorship of the goods.in support of these allegations,the complaint referred to four attached examples of propride promotional and advertising materials.
two of these attached examples are print advertisements by propride.both advertisements state only one man has ever designed a trailer hitch that effectively eliminates trailer sway before it begins.that man is jim hensley.now he has done it again and improved the performance of his old design.both advertisements provide propride telephone number.one advertisement directs the reader to,which is part of propride website,for a free report regarding towing safety.the other advertisement specifically identifies propride and provides its website address.both advertisements also contain a disclaimer at the bottom,which states that jim hensley is no longer affiliated with hensley.
