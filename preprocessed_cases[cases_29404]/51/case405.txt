introduction 
this case concerns the term micro colors and who has the right to use it.the parties use the term micro color,microcolor,and micro colors interchangeably.for purposes of this opinion,we will refer to the term as micro color or micro colors.the minor difference in these terms has no significance in this action.lasting impression i,owns an incontestable,registered trademark,which consists of the term micro colors,set in white,within a black box.it is the registration for this composite mark that is the basis of this litigation.
permanent,kp uses the term micro colors on its products and brochures.upon receiving a cease and desist letter from lasting impression i,in january demanding kp discontinue its use of the term micro color,kp brought this action for declaratory relief against the defendants lasting impression i,and its distributor,mcn international,hereinafter collectively referred to as lasting.kp asserted that lasting did not have the exclusive right to use the term micro colors and that the term was generic and incapable of receiving trademark protection.lasting counterclaimed,alleging that kp use of the term micro color infringed lasting incontestable,registered mark.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication.

ii.factual and procedural background 
kp and lasting are direct competitors in the permanent makeup industry.to better understand the nature of the term micro color,a brief description of permanent makeup and the permanent makeup industry is of use.permanent makeup is similar to a tattoo,in that both are created by injecting pigment into the skin.permanent makeup has both cosmetic and medical uses.for example,it may be used to create permanent eye liner and to enhance eyebrows,or it may be used in scar revision or in cases of pigmentary disorder.permanent makeup is also known as micropigmentation.
the pigments used for permanent makeup are sold in small bottles for use by trained professionals.both kp and lasting have a separate line of pigments for use in the permanent makeup process.these pigments are sold in various colors.further,both kp and lasting sell their pigments to the same end users,such as beauty salons.
lasting began using micro colors commercially as a trademark for its line of permanent makeup pigments in april.the mark was registered on the principal register of the united states patent and trademark office on may,as reg.the mark is registered as a design and word mark and consists of a solid black rectangle,with the words micro and colors in reverse white lettering.the word micro appears directly over the word colors,and the two are separated by a green horizontal bar.in,lasting mark,as registered,became incontestable.an illustration of the registered trademark is shown in appendix 
kp used the term micro color on its flyers beginning in and has continued to use the term on its pigment bottles since.kp use of the term micro color on its bottle labels consists of the word in full capitals before the actual color of the pigment in the bottle.for example,kp use of the word on a bottle containing black pigment would appear as microcolor black.
in,kp adopted a new use of the term micro color.rather than using it only on its bottles,kp began using the term in its marketing brochures.the brochures display the term micro color in a stylized format.micro color sits directly over the word pigment,and a vial with pigment flowing out of it is depicted to the side of the word display.additionally,under both the vial and the phrase micro color pigment is the word chart.both the words pigment and chart appear in a smaller size type than the term micro color,making the term the most dominant feature of the image.the brochure on which this image appears contains a chart displaying all the various colors in which kp pigments are available.an illustration of the term in the marketing brochures is shown in appendix 
in march,kp commenced this trademark declaratory relief action against lasting.in response,lasting,alleging that kp use of the phrase micro color infringed lasting incontestable registration of its micro colors mark and sought damages for the infringement.lasting counterclaim also alleged unfair competition and false advertising.
kp filed a motion for summary judgment.kp contentions consisted of the following lasting picture mark registration did not give lasting the exclusive right to the term micro color separate from the logo the term micro color is generic kp can use micro color under the fair use doctrine the phrase has no secondary meaning lasting has also used micro color in a generic sense and is estopped from arguing the term is not generic lasting can not show likelihood of confusion and kp continuous prior use of the term micro color defeats lasting claim to exclusivity.
lasting moved for summary adjudication of certain issues,principally that kp contention that the term micro colors is generic had no merit,that kp prior use contention had no merit,and that lasting registered trademark was not limited to the composite.
the district court granted kp motion for summary judgment and denied lasting motion for summary adjudication.it held that kp could continue to use the term micro color in the manner it has since and that lasting could continue to use its trademarked logo containing the words micro color.specifically,the district court concluded that the term micro color is generic,and,if not generic,descriptive.the district court then determined that neither party had acquired secondary meaning in the term micro color.finally,the district court held that kp use was protected under the fair use defense,b,and because its use was fair,the court declined to discuss kp prior use contention or likelihood of confusion.
iii.analysis 
standard of review 
a grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.clicks billiards,sixshooters,cir.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.because of the intensely factual nature of trademark disputes,summary judgment is generally disfavored in the trademark arena.entrepreneur media,smith,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.
trademark infringement 
in evaluating the parties motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication,it is easiest to frame the relevant issues in the context of a trademark infringement action.kp motion raises essentially issues that are defenses to an infringement action.
the lanham act allows the holder of a protectable trademark to hold liable any person who,without consent,use s in commerce any registered mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services which is likely to cause confusion.a.before infringement can be shown,the trademark holder must demonstrate that it owns a valid mark,and thus a protectable interest.tie tech,kinedyne,cir.once the trademark holder shows that it has a protectable interest,the holder must show that the alleged infringer use of the mark is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.a b thane int l,trek bicycle,cir.the alleged infringer has a number of defenses available.
trademarks are generally divided into five categories 
generic descriptive suggestive arbitrary and fanciful.the latter three categories are deemed inherently distinctive and are automatically entitled to protection because they naturally serve to identify a particular source of a product two pesos,taco cabana,d.
generic marks are not capable of receiving protection because they identify the product,rather than the product source.see park fly,dollar park fly,d.generic terms are not registrable,and a registered mark may be canceled at any time on the grounds that it has become generic.id.merely descriptive marks,which describe the qualities or characteristics of a product,may be registered only if the holder of the mark shows that the mark has acquired distinctiveness through secondary meaning.id.
one advantage of registration on the principal register is that the mark may attain incontestable status.mccarthy on trademarks unfair competition.incontestable status may be obtained by fulfilling the requirements of.this requires that the registered mark has been in use for five consecutive years and is still in use in commerce.id.in addition,the statute requires that there has been no decision adverse to the registrant claim of ownership of the mark,the right to register,or the right to keep it on the register.id.no incontestable right can be obtained in a mark which is the generic name for the goods or services.id.
the incontestability provisions of the lanham act were designed to provide a means for a trademark holder to quiet title in the ownership of his mark.park fly,at.however,although a mark may become incontestable,the label of incontestability is rather misdescriptive.mccarthy.an incontestable registration is still subject to certain defenses or defects,set forth in,and as above stated does not apply to a mark that is generic.
the summary judgment entered for kp was based on the following determinations 
a.the words micro color,as distinct from lasting entire logo,are not protected because the words are generic and thus can not constitute a valid mark.
even if those words are not generic,they are descriptive and have no secondary meaning and thus can not constitute a valid mark.
c.the fair use defense is applicable to kp and precludes a claim of infringement.
because the district court held that the entire logo with the words micro colors on it was valid and protected but that the words micro colors were not,our first inquiry is whether the words micro colors themselves are protected by the registration of the mark or only the entire logo.we are aided in this inquiry by the sequence of events in the ninth circuit case of park fly dollar park fly,cir,rev,d.
protection afforded to the words micro colors 
in park fly,the mark at issue,which had attained incontestable status,consisted of the words park fly and an airplane logo.the alleged infringer challenged the mark validity arguing that the words park fly were generic with respect to airport parking lots.id.at.park fly had a separate registration for the words park fly without the airplane logo that was not yet incontestable.in addressing the issue of whether the words park fly were generic,this court focused entirely on the words in the logo mark,which was incontestable,as opposed to words in the separate registration of the word mark.
judge kennedy now justice kennedy,in writing for the court,held that because the most salient feature of the logo mark was the phrase park fly,any infringement of the word mark registration would also be an infringement of the logo mark.id.at.thus,the opinion concluded that the words park fly were the most salient feature of the logo mark and that insufficient evidence had been presented to show the words were generic.id.
it is significant that the united states supreme court,upon reviewing the ninth circuit decision in park fly,also recognized that park fly had a separate registration for the words park fly,which had not become incontestable.however,it determined that such registration did not affect the resolution of the matter and focused on the incontestable logo mark in making its ruling.park fly,at.
the supreme court reversed the ninth circuit opinion on a different issue.the ninth circuit opinion had held that a registrant could not use the incontestability of its mark offensively to enjoin infringement and that a challenger could defend such an action on the grounds that the mark is merely descriptive.the supreme court reversed that aspect of the ninth circuit decision,but remanded for consideration of the challenger prior use defense and the defense that there was no likelihood of confusion.
the remand by the supreme court implicitly acknowledged that it was the words park fly as the most salient feature of the logo trademark that were to be considered on remand.the ninth circuit on remand addressed the words of the logo trademark and affirmed the district court finding that the challenger did not qualify for the prior use exception and that there was sufficient likelihood of confusion to justify an injunction in favor of park fly.park fly,dollar park fly,cir.it is clear under ninth circuit law,implicitly approved by the supreme court,that not only lasting logo mark itself is protected by the registration,but also the words micro colors as the most salient feature of the logo mark.in park fly,the words were held to be the most salient feature of a logo with an airplane whereas in this case the words in white on a black background are virtually the only salient feature of the logo.
because the words micro colors are the most salient feature of the mark,those words are the focus of the inquiry on validity.
genericness 
kp contends that the words micro colors are generic and,thus,not entitled to protection.to determine whether a term has become generic,we look to whether consumers understand the word to refer only to a particular producer goods or whether the consumer understands the word to refer to the goods themselves.park fly,at.if the buyer understands the word to refer to the source of the goods,the term is not generic.however,if the disputed term is identified with all such goods or services,regardless of their suppliers,it is generic.id.quotation marks and citation omitted.
federal registration of a trademark endows it with a strong presumption of validity.the general presumption of validity resulting from federal registration includes the specific presumption that the trademark is not generic.overland,cir citations omitted.this presumption of validity extends to the most salient feature of the mark,the words micro colors.
we recently discussed the nature of that presumption in tie tech,at.citing the wording of a,we stated 
validity is a threshold issue.on this point,the plaintiff in an infringement action with a registered trademark is given the prima facie or presumptive advantage on the issue of validity,thus shifting the burden of production to the defendant to prove otherwise or,to put it as we did in vuitton et fils young enterprises,cir,the defendant then bears the burden with respect to invalidity.
id.at.in granting the summary judgment to kp,the district court erred in placing the burden on lasting.the burden was on kp to produce sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption.
the question then becomes what evidence must be produced to overcome the presumption.we noted in tie tech at the summary judgment stage that all inferences from facts must be drawn most favorably to the party.id.in evaluating the summary judgment awarded to kp,those inferences must be drawn in favor of lasting,as the party.we stated in tie tech,after noting that this type of issue is generally viewed as an intensely factual issue,that if the challenger can demonstrate through law,undisputed facts or a combination thereof that the mark is invalid the trademark holder can not survive summary judgment.id.
kp relied principally on an affidavit of the owner,theresa kim plante,which stated there are various synonyms for micro colors,such as micropigment,micro color pigments,micropigment colors and pigment colors.both these terms micropigments and micro colors are abbreviations for micropigmentation colors.they all mean the same thing and are generic.whether all of these terms could be synonyms for each other is highly doubtful.kp produced no evidence that consumers understood them to be synonyms.both parties agree that the cosmetic process is
