the district court,in a trademark and trade dress infringement suit filed against lanard toys by general motors corporation,granted summary judgment for general motors on its claims while denying lanard motion for summary judgment based on the affirmative defenses of laches and estoppel.lanard now appeals those decisions.the dispute is over a series of toy vehicles produced by lanard called the corps atk which resemble the hummer vehicle produced by general motors.based on the following discussion,we affirm the district court decisions.
development of hummer 
in the,the united states government commissioned am general to produce a high mobility military vehicle.the result was called the high mobility vehicle or hmmwv,which was commonly referred to as the humvee.after garnering recognition through its use in the first gulf war,am general decided to introduce a civilian version of the humvee in,known as the hummer.the design of both the humvee and hummer included a front grille with seven vertical shaped slots,bookended by round headlights of approximately equal size to the slots.am general received a registered trademark for the grille design on march.am general never sold more than hummers in any calendar year from to,in part due to a price tag of over.in december of,am general transferred the hummer brand to general motors as well as all intellectual property rights in the civilian vehicle while maintaining all rights in the humvee name and the military vehicle.after the transfer,general motors created the,a smaller version of the hummer.
lanard interactions with the brands 
in,lanard toys,began selling a toy vehicle called the mudslinger.it was modeled after the humvee military vehicle,including a similar grille design to that of the humvee.the box for the mudslinger labeled the toy as a hyper humvee.lanard sales records show that the mudslinger had limited sales between and,including no sales for the years of and.in july,am general contacted lanard regarding the use of their trademarked name of humvee on its toys.after correspondence between the two parties,lanard agreed to stop using the humvee name on its toys,but continued to manufacture the mudslinger toy.there is dispute between the parties as to whether lanard agreed with am general that lanard could continue to manufacture mudslinger toys.
in february,lanard contacted am general regarding putting the humvee name back on its toys.lanard,at the time,was producing a number of military vehicle toys,including the the corps atk vehicle at issue in this case.the atk vehicle has a similar design to that of the mudslinger vehicle.in response to lanard letter,am general sent a letter to lanard to stop using all of am general trademarks.lanard responded by stating that it did not use either the hummer or humvee names on its packaging.
in november,am general sent a demand letter to lanard regarding the atk vehicle nose design.lanard responded by refusing to comply with the demand to stop producing the toy.in november,general motors contacted lanard to inform it that lanard military toy vehicles infringed on the hummer vehicle produced by general motors.lanard again rejected that contention and continued to produce its toys.on march,general motors filed suit claiming that lanard toys infringed on its rights to the hummer vehicle and grille design.
procedural history 
general motors complaint alleged that lanard toys infringed on its hummer vehicle and grille design,resulting in trademark infringement,trade dress infringement,dilution,and common law trademark infringement.on july,lanard filed a complaint against am general seeking a declaratory judgment as to am general rights in the humvee vehicle and grille design.am general,on september,filed a counterclaim against lanard for infringement on its humvee trade dress.in april,all parties moved for summary judgment and the district court granted summary judgment for am general and general motors on their trade dress and trademark infringement claims.the district court dismissed all of lanard defenses except for laches and estoppel.
from march to,a jury trial was held on damages and the issue of laches and estoppel.the jury awarded damages to general motors as a eight percent royalty on sales of the atk,plus over from lanard profits.acting in an advisory capacity,the jury denied lanard laches and estoppel defenses.lanard filed a timely appeal to this court on august.

the district court treatment of the frisch factors 
the district court held that lanard atk vehicle grille design infringed on the hummer nose design trademark trademark.lanard primary objection to the summary judgment against them on the infringement of the trademark was the failure by the district court to discuss any of the frisch factors in its judgment.n ot all of these factors may be particularly helpful in any given case.but a thorough and analytical treatment must nevertheless be attempted.daddy junky music stores,at.lanard argues that no such thorough and analytical treatment was given to the trademark infringement claim in this case.general motors responds by noting that t his court reviews judgments,not opinions,in re big rivers,cir,and argues that there is no need for a detailed analysis because all factors favor a likelihood of confusion.despite general motors contention,lanard argument appears to be a correct one.
daddy junky music stores advises a court to conduct a thorough and analytical treatment of the frisch factors.the district court may have conducted such a treatment,but it has given no indication of its analysis and what reasoning it used to arrive at its conclusion in either its order,or the transcript of the summary judgment hearing.this leaves a reviewing court little to work with in determining whether the trademark infringement claim was deserving of judgment as a matter of law.daddy junky music stores requires that the district court make express factual findings as to the frisch factors.at.with that said,the district court erred in not conducting a proper discussion of the frisch factors.however,because we review a summary judgment motion de novo,the district court silence is not,standing alone,a reversible error and we must now conduct a de novo review of the factors.
likelihood of confusion 
as discussed supra,there are eight factors which we must weigh to determine confusion and,therefore,trademark infringement.upon review of the record,we find there to be sufficient evidence to grant summary judgment in favor of general motors on the issue of a.the strength of the mark factor heavily favors general motors,as the trademark in question has been federally registered and general motors places the grille of a hummer prominently within a number of its advertisements for the vehicle.the similarity of the marks and the defendant intent in selecting the mark both heavily favor general motors,as there is undisputed evidence that the design of the front grille of lanard toys was copied directly from the hummer vehicle.also,the likely degree of purchaser care favors general motors,as the product in question is a series of toys.it is highly unlikely that a child or adult,in the selection of a toy,will carefully evaluate whether the vehicle is actually from the maker of hummer or another source of goods.they will merely recognize the grille shape,recognize the general shape,and purchase based on that recognition.the relatedness of the goods and services also weighs in favor of general motors,as the toy car is quite closely related to the actual car on which the registered trademark of the grille is found.the factors of marketing channels used and likelihood of expansion of product lines do not strongly favor either party in this case.there appears to be no evidence of how the marketing for either product might overlap,and while general motors states it has considered making hummer toys,there is no real proof that the company is seriously considering this possibility.
the only remaining factor is that of evidence of actual confusion.lanard argues that a survey used by general motors to demonstrate actual confusion was actually focused on the overall vehicle trade dress,not the trademark in the grille,an assertion which general motors concedes.the only proof of actual consumer confusion presented by general motors is a purchase order form and a from toys r us section,both of which list lanard toys as humvees.what general motors fails to acknowledge is that the mere use of the humvee name by retail stores does not inherently mean that lanard has infringed on the trademark of the grille design or that the grille design itself is the reason for the confusion.as general motors must acknowledge,the confusion by or toys r us could stem from the overall exterior of the toys and not necessarily from the grille design.in order to prove actual confusion,the confusion must stem from the mark in this case,the grille design.given the uncertainty in this evidence,we hold that the evidence of actual confusion factor does not favor either party,although neither would this factor be determinative on the overall issue of the.see daddy junky music stores,at due to the difficulty of securing evidence of actual confusion,a lack of such evidence is rarely significant.in sum,the weight of the factors in favor of a finding a likelihood of confusion convinces us that summary judgment was appropriate in this case,despite the district court failure to adequately discuss the frisch factors.
trade dress claim 
trademarks and trade dress are separate and distinct causes of action under the lanham act,et.gibson guitar,at.trade dress has been described by the supreme court as the design or packaging of a product which has acquired a secondary meaning sufficient to identify the product with its manufacturer or source.id.quoting traffix devices,mktg.displays,d.
trade dress refers to the image and overall appearance of a product.it embodies that arrangement of identifying characteristics or decorations connected with a product,whether by packaging or otherwise,that make s the source of the product distinguishable from another and promote s its sale.trade dress involves the total image of a product and may include features such as size,shape,color or color combinations,texture,graphics,or even particular sales techniques.
id.at internal citation omitted.
a party seeking to recover for trade dress infringement must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the trade dress is not functional the trade dress is distinctive in the marketplace and has acquired secondary meaning,thereby indicating the source of the goods and the trade dress of the accused product is confusingly similar.stores,samara,d.lanard is silent on the issue of whether the trade dress of its toys is confusingly similar to the trade dress asserted by general motors and am general.this silence is taken as a concession of this element of trade dress infringement.we must therefore review de novo whether there was a material issue of fact as to each of the remaining two elements.the district court held that lanard corps atk vehicle violated the trade dress as a matter of law.
elements and ownership of trade dress 
before addressing the application of the trade dress infringement elements,we must first address lanard challenge to both the ownership of the hummer and humvee trade dress and what that trade dress is comprised of.lanard argument can be summed up in two statements.first,neither the district court,am general,nor general motors listed the appropriate elements constituting the protected trade dress.second,the district court inappropriately lumped together the trade dress of the civilian hummer vehicle owned by general motors with the military humvee vehicle owned by am general,thereby prejudicing many of lanard arguments against trade dress infringement.
i t will not do to solely identify in litigation a combination as the trade dress.rather,the discrete elements which make up that combination should be separated out and identified in a list.mccarthy on trademarks ed.general motors argues that the trade dress was properly identified as the exterior appearance and styling of the vehicles in question.however,
focus on the overall look of a product does not permit a plaintiff to dispense with an articulation of the specific elements which comprise its distinct dress.without such a precise expression of the character and scope of the claimed trade dress,litigation will be difficult,as courts will be unable to evaluate how unique and unexpected the design elements are in the relevant market.
landscape forms,columbia cascade,cir.general motors argues that it met that burden in its summary judgment brief when it identified the trade dress elements as the exterior appearance and styling of the vehicle design which includes the grille,slanted and raised hood,split windshield,rectangular doors,squared edges,while the district court did not repeat this list as the specific trade dress which lanard infringed upon,we hold this is sufficient to fulfill the discrete elements requirement of a trade dress claim.
lanard only dispute that this description by general motors is not an acceptable list of discrete elements involves the at the end of the description.in requiring a list of discrete elements,we are looking to avoid vague and indeterminate references to the overall appearance or look of plaintiff packaging.mccarthy on trademarks.in the end,the question is whether or not the court and the parties coherently define exactly what the trade dress consists of and determine whether that trade dress is valid and if what the accused is doing is an infringement.id.based on the list of elements presented by general motors,it can be understood exactly what they are looking to protect.the marking must be ignored in such a listing as it does not define any further element to be included in the trade dress.see william strunk,white,the elements of style ed.in formal writing,is a misfit.because the listing is not vague and provides exact details as to what general motors seeks to protect,we find the elements listed by general motors to be sufficient to define exactly what constitutes the hummer humvee trade dress.
lanard second argument is that the district court treated the trade dress claims from am general and general motors as the same.the district court referred in its summary judgment order to the trade dress as the trade dress on which the atk vehicle infringed.the two plaintiffs also combined the trade dress claims of the hummer and the humvee throughout their summary judgment brief and subsequent reply brief.however,the design elements of each are not identical,as admitted to by an am general representative the humvee contains certain design elements not present on the hummer,including,but not limited to x shaped cross bars on the doors,a slant back with no windows,mounted weapons or a weapons turret,and a blackout headlight in the left front hood recess.while these distinctions appear to be significant changes to the exterior appearance and styling,they do not change the basic trade dress as defined by the discrete elements listed above.both the military humvee and the civilian hummer share common appearance elements which constitute a trade dress specifically,the grille,slanted and raised hood,split windshield,rectangular doors,and squared edges.the elements listed which were not a part of the civilian hummer design are also not listed in the discrete elements which make up the trade dress as alleged by general general.therefore,the district court combining of the hummer and humvee trade dresses into one trade dress comprising the common elements between those vehicles is permissible.
functionality of trade dress 
lanard also challenges whether the protected trade dress in this case is actually nonfunctional,claiming that as a functional feature,it can not be protected under trade dress law.traffix devices,marketing displays,d.a trade dress nonfunctional nature must be proven by the party asserting the trade dress protection.a traffix,at.
a product feature is functional,and can not serve as a trademark,if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article,that is,if exclusive use of the feature would put competitors at a significant disadvantage.
qualitex jacobson products,d internal quotation marks omitted.if a trade dress is found to be functional,the mere fact that there are other designs which would serve the same functional purpose is no defense to functionality.antioch western trimming,cir.
lanard first objection to the district court ruling on this issue is the court clear misunderstanding of the role of functionality in a trade dress claim.the district court,in its order,stated that lanard defense of functionality is dismissed.this demonstrates an inappropriate shifting of the burden on the issue of functionality from general motors to lanard.the district court erred in its labeling of the issue of functionality as a defense to be proven by lanard,instead of requiring general motors to prove the absence of functionality as an element of trade dress infringement.however,this error is not reversible,and we must continue our de novo review of the issue in order to determine if general motors has proven its trade dress to be.
general motors,in proving,relies heavily on the declaration of robert gula,senior vice president of engineering and product development for am general.gula testified that the appearance of the humvee was unrelated to its function,stating that am general prototype of the humvee could have had a different appearance and still functioned the same way and that the appearance was not essential to the use or purpose of the vehicle.however,gula first statement is insufficient evidence for as the mere existence of other potential designs is no defense to a design functionality.antioch,at.what remains is gula statement that the appearance and styling was not essential to the use or purpose of the vehicle.
lanard counters general motors proof on this issue by quoting from gula deposition testimony in which he stated t he shape of the humvee was basically a byproduct of a vehicle that was designed to meet a performance specification.gula continued to testify that part of those performance specifications were dimensional limitations,maximum width,maximum height,maximum overall length.the army dictated approach and departure angle and i think breakover angle.these specifications all seem to directly affect the exterior appearance and styling of the humvee.however,gula later stated in his declaration that the government technical specification did not address the exterior appearance or the styling of the vehicle.
we conclude that general motors must prevail on the issue of functionality.the trade dress in question has been defined as the exterior appearance and styling of the vehicle design which includes the grille,slanted and raised hood,split windshield,rectangular doors,squared edges,we fail to see what function these elements perform.while we understand that general motors bears the burden of proof of,the plain appearance of the vehicle shows that the elements which comprise its trade dress are inherently.the statement by gula regarding performance specifications,which was relied upon by lanard,does not contribute to what makes up the trade dress.in fact,general motors has managed to significantly alter the height,width,and length of the humvee in creating its newer models of the hummer while maintaining the same trade dress as the original military vehicle.the military undoubtedly had function in mind when designing the humvee.however,this does not necessarily mean that the exterior appearance and style was based on function rather,it was more likely an unrelated afterthought.
lanard repeatedly and dramatically stated during oral argument that it stakes its entire claim in this case on the issue of functionality.unfortunately,this was like picking a show pony in a thoroughbred race.the district court was correct in holding that the hummer humvee trade dress is.
secondary meaning 
finally,lanard argues that an issue of material fact remains as to whether the allegedly protected trade dress has acquired secondary meaning.again,general motors bears the burden of proof on the issue of secondary meaning.stores,at.to demonstrate secondary meaning,the evidence must show that in the minds of the public,the primary significance of the trade dress is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself.inwood,at.this court applies a test to determine whether secondary meaning exists in a trade dress direct consumer testimony,consumer surveys,exclusivity,length,and manner of use,amount and manner of advertising,amount of sales and number of customers,established place in the market,and proof of intentional copying.marketing displays,traffix devices,cir,rev on other grounds,traffix devices,marketing displays,d.
lanard first argues that the district court erred in not applying the test or referring to any of the factors in either its decision or at the summary judgment hearing.additionally,the district court appears to have incorrectly shifted the burden on this issue by stating that lanard defense of secondary meaning is dismissed.secondary meaning is an element of trade dress infringement which must be proven by the plaintiffs,not the defendants.stores,at.on this issue,the district court erred in ruling against such a defense because lanard is not required to present evidence on secondary meaning.that burden falls to general motors.however,as this is de novo review,we must continue to apply the test in order to determine if general motors has sufficiently proven that the trade dress has acquired secondary meaning.
