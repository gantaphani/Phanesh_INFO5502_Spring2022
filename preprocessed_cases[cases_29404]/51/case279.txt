b b hardware b b appeals the district court dismissal,on collateral estoppel grounds,of its trademark infringement action filed against hargis industries hargis.for the reasons explained herein,we reverse the dismissal and remand this matter to the district court for further consideration.
in,b b began manufacturing and selling a fastener product under the name sealtight.this product is largely used in the aerospace industry.pursuant to a application,b b received a certificate of registration for the sealtight mark from the patent and trademark office pto on october.in,hargis began manufacturing and selling,under the sealtite mark,a line of and screws that are used primarily in the metal building industry.
in july,hargis filed an application with the pto to register its sealtite mark,but the pto refused to grant the registration,citing the likelihood of confusion with b b sealtight mark.in march,hargis sought before the pto trademark trial and appeal board ttab to cancel the registration of b b mark.the ttab initially granted the cancellation request,but later reinstated b b registration and stayed the ttab proceedings pending the outcome of a federal trademark infringement action filed by b b against hargis in june in the united states district court for the eastern district of arkansas.after a four day trial held in may,a jury returned a verdict in favor of hargis,determining that b b sealtight mark was merely descriptive and had not acquired a secondary meaning.a panel of this court affirmed that decision on appeal.b b hardware,hargis,cir.
following the affirmance,hargis requested that the ttab resume proceedings regarding hargis request for cancellation of b b mark.the ttab permitted hargis to amend its petition to include as a ground,in accordance with the jury determination,that b b mark was merely descriptive and had not acquired a secondary meaning.in july,the ttab granted hargis motion for summary judgment and canceled the registration of b b sealtight mark.the ttab subsequently reversed itself and held that the motion to amend the petition was untimely,set aside its grant of summary judgment,and dismissed the cancellation proceeding.
in february,b b filed an opposition to the hargis application to register its sealtite mark.in reply,hargis argued that the prior federal action,which determined that there was no trademark infringement,should be given preclusive effect by the ttab.in august,the ttab rejected this argument,holding that the jury in the federal trademark action had not made any findings concerning the likelihood of confusion.the ttab also held that hargis was barred in its attempt to cancel b b mark on the basis that b b mark was merely descriptive because b b mark had been registered for more than five years.
in june,b b filed an affidavit of incontestability with the ttab regarding b b sealtight mark on the grounds that the mark had been on file for five years without challenge.on september,the pto issued a notice of acknowledgement,recognizing that b b sealtight mark had become incontestable.meanwhile,in august,b b filed the present action against hargis,alleging trademark infringement,unfair competition,trademark dilution,and false designation of origin hargis sought an order of dismissal on grounds of res judicata and collateral estoppel based upon the jury verdict.following a hearing,the district court granted hargis motion to dismiss on the basis of collateral estoppel.
in granting the motion to dismiss,the district court recognized b b mark had become incontestable and that this status protected the mark from an attack that it is merely descriptive and without secondary meaning.the district court further recognized that incontestability of a mark addresses one of two elements of a trademark infringement action the court rejected,however,b b argument that receipt of incontestability status after initially losing a trademark infringement action,without more,should prevent the application of collateral estoppel.the district court explained,b b cites no authority for the proposition that incontestability makes any difference where a prior judgment otherwise bars a subsequent infringement action.in reaching this outcome,the district court relied upon the fifth circuit decision in test masters educational services,singh,cir test masters,holding that,t he only recognized exception to issue preclusion for trademark infringement is a material change in the trademark strength over an extended period of time and that mere passage of time as a factor does not permit relitigation of a previously failed claim.the district court held b b claims were barred by collateral estoppel,reasoning that b b reliance on the incontestability of its mark as a basis for denying the application of preclusion lacks persuasive authority.the district court concluded that the jury verdict,which held for hargis on b b prior trademark infringement claim,was entitled to preclusive effect and that application of collateral estoppel was appropriate.the district court granted hargis motion to dismiss the complaint.
at the time of the dismissal order,the district court was unaware that the ttab had sustained b b opposition to hargis request to register its sealtite mark because of the likelihood of confusion with b b sealtight mark.b b sought reconsideration of the district court dismissal order and attached the ttab ruling to its motion to reconsider.in denying the motion to reconsider,the district court held the decision of the ttab is not entitled to preclusive effect and does not create an exception to permit relitigation of trademark infringement.further,the district court noted that the ttab decision was not submitted until after entry of judgment when it could have been brought to the court attention before the motion to dismiss was granted.
on appeal,b b argues the district court erred in granting the motion to dismiss on collateral estoppel grounds.b b also contends the district court should have given deference to the decisions of the ttab that b b sealtight registration could not be attacked on grounds of descriptiveness because hargis challenge was not timely made and the prior district court decision did not address the issue of likelihood of confusion.

the district court determined that b b trademark infringement claim was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel or issue preclusion.
in the eighth circuit,issue preclusion has five elements the party sought to be precluded in the second suit must have been a party,or in privity with a party,to the original lawsuit the issue sought to be precluded must be the same as the issue involved in the prior action the issue sought to be precluded must have been actually litigated in the prior action the issue sought to be precluded must have been determined by a valid and final judgment and the determination in the prior action must have been essential to the prior judgment.

according to b b,the current action should not be barred by application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.b b contends the jury in the prior action did not reach the question of likelihood of confusion because it held instead that b b sealtight mark was merely descriptive and had not acquired a secondary meaning.b b argues,therefore,that the issues raised in this action are not the same as those involved in the prior action that the question of likelihood of confusion was not actually determined in the prior action that no valid and final judgment has been entered on the question of likelihood of confusion and that a decision on the question of likelihood of confusion was not necessary to the
