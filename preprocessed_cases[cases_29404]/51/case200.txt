this case involves a straightforward interpretation of a settlement agreement that disposed of a previous lawsuit that rexair,filed in the district court in against josé saltiel abouaf and his company,hidrofiltros,de méxico,de saltiel and hidrofiltros have filed a complaint alleging that rexair breached the settlement agreement by filing a trademark infringement lawsuit in a portuguese court against an individual who is allegedly affiliated with saltiel.the district court dismissed the complaint,holding that the settlement agreement did not prohibit rexair from filing its portuguese lawsuit.because we believe there is no other reasonable interpretation of the settlement agreement,we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
a.the underlying lawsuit 
rexair is the manufacturer of the rainbow vacuum cleaner,which it distributes in over eighty countries.prior to the litigation,saltiel had distributed rexair products in mexico through his company,hidrofiltros.in,rexair filed a complaint in the district court against saltiel and hidrofiltros,alleging that they another company owned by saltiel,called sold a of the rainbow called the robot.rexair complaint asserted various contract,tort,trademark and copyright claims,and saltiel and hidrofiltros,in turn,asserted several counterclaims.the district court dismissed rexair trademark and copyright claims for lack of jurisdiction because the alleged acts of infringement took place in mexico and were perpetrated by mexican citizens.it also dismissed saltiel and hidrofiltros counterclaims.after those rulings,the only claims that remained were rexair contract and business tort claims.
b.the settlement agreement 
the parties subsequently entered into the settlement agreement at issue in this case,by which saltiel and hidrofiltros agreed,among other things,to pay rexair a total of and to refrain from infringing rexair rainbow trademark in the future,in exchange for the voluntary withdrawal of rexair remaining contract and tort claims.the relevant provisions of the settlement agreement,for purposes of this appeal,are paragraphs and.paragraph states 
saltiel and hidrofiltros agree not to use,either directly or indirectly,through saltiel family members,agents,employees or companies owned or controlled by or affiliated with saltiel,any of rexair trademarks or any confusingly similar trademarks in either printed materials or on machines or accessories.saltiel and hidrofiltros also agree not to use,either directly or indirectly,through saltiel family members,agents,employees or companies owned or controlled by or affiliated with saltiel,any product manual or packaging including the box in which the robot vacuum cleaner is marketed or sold,that is the same or confusingly similar to those used for rexair rainbow products.the sole exception to this is that saltiel and hidrofiltros or their agents or affiliates,without being deemed to be in violation of the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph,may use up the remaining stock of certain existing materials in conjunction with the sale of robot vacuum cleaners 
paragraph states 
the parties agree that the court in which this action is pending,the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan will retain exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over this agreement and over saltiel,hidrofiltros and rexair for purposes of enforcing this agreement 
c.the present dispute 
following the execution of the settlement agreement,no disputes arose between the parties for almost four years.in may,however,the situation changed.rexair filed a lawsuit in lisbon,portugal,against joao paulo da silva vilarinho,an individual who sold turmix robot vacuum cleaners in portugal.rexair alleged that by importing and selling those vacuum cleaners,vilarinho,through his company,delphin lusitana lda,infringed its rainbow trademark.accordingly,rexair requested a seizure of the allegedly infringing products and sought an injunction preventing vilarinho from importing and selling them.
on july,saltiel and hidrofiltros filed a motion in the district court seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction prohibiting rexair from proceeding with the portuguese lawsuit against vilarinho.on july,after briefing and oral argument,the district court denied the motion in a telephonic hearing,reasoning that it would be inappropriate to enjoin an ongoing case in portugal.on july,the portuguese trial court denied rexair motion for injunctive relief against vilarinho,a decision that the portuguese appellate court affirmed on november 
on december,saltiel and hidrofiltros filed the instant complaint against rexair in the district court,alleging breach of contract and seeking declaratory relief.specifically,the complaint alleged that rexair breached the parties settlement agreement by filing a complaint in portugal against an of saltiel,namely vilarinho,alleging various violations of the same or corresponding rexair trademarks which were at issue in the parties underlying dispute.the complaint requested a declaratory judgment providing,among other things,that the district court has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over saltiel,hidrofiltros and rexair for purposes of enforcing rexair trademark s against saltiel and hidrofiltros and others as defined in and of the settlement agreement and to resolve any and all disputes which may arise between saltiel,hidrofiltros and rexair only with respect to such trademark s.
on may,the district court granted rexair motion to dismiss the complaint,holding that the settlement agreement clearly does not require rexair to bring a trademark suit in this court and indeed rexair could not have brought a trademark case,based on portuguese trademark law against vilarinho,a portuguese national and owner of a portuguese company,in this court under the settlement agreement.the district court also reasoned that paragraphs and simply mean that should saltiel and hidrofiltros,or its agents,employees,or affiliates be found in any court of competent jurisdiction to have infringed rexair trademarks,then rexair may come to this court and sue saltiel and hidrofiltros for breach of the settlement agreement for having violated.
rexair argues that this appeal is frivolous and has,accordingly,filed a motion for sanctions against saltiel and hidrofiltros,along with their counsel,pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure and and.

saltiel and hidrofiltros argue that the settlement agreement contains an explicit promise by rexair to forbear the initiation of foreign trademark litigation against them or their agents or affiliates in any forum other than the district court for the eastern district of michigan,and that rexair has breached that promise by filing suit in portugal.specifically,they contend that rexair portuguese lawsuit was brought for purposes of enforcing paragraph of the settlement agreement because it sought to prevent an individual affiliated with saltiel from infringing rexair trademarks.because paragraph provides that the district court retains exclusive jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcing the settlement agreement,saltiel and hidrofiltros claim that rexa
