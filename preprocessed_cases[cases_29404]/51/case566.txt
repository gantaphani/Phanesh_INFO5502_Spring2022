background 
defendants gaffrig performance industries,and livorsi marine,each carry commercial general liability insurance policies with country mutual insurance company.in december,livorsi brought a lawsuit against gaffrig in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.the suit alleged various trademark violations related to the use of the gaffrig precision instruments name.in response,gaffrig filed a lawsuit with similar allegations against livorsi.the suits,which sought both damages and injunctive relief,were consolidated.gaffrig performance industries,livorsi marine,c,c,wl.december.
the language of both gaffrig and livorsi insurance policies gives country mutual the duty to defend and indemnify its insureds in any lawsuit seeking damages based on an advertising injury 
we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal injury or advertising injury to which this coverage part applies.we will have the right and duty to defend any suit seeking those damages.we may at our discretion investigate any occurrence or offense and settle any claim or suit that may result.
as a condition of coverage,the policies require gaffrig and livorsi to notify country mutual of any lawsuit 
if a claim is made or suit is brought against any insured,you must 
immediately record the specifics of the claim or suit and the date received and 
notify us as soon as practicable.
you must see to it that we receive written notice of the claim or suit as soon as practicable.
although gaffrig and livorsi filed their lawsuits on december,neither party informed country mutual of the consolidated suit until august.
country mutual then filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the circuit court of cook county.the insurer sought a judgment that it had no obligation to defend or indemnify either livorsi or gaffrig in connection with the trademark lawsuit.country mutual argued that the claims raised in the lawsuit did not fit the policy definition of advertising injury and that both livorsi and gaffrig breached the notice condition of their policies by failing to inform country mutual of the lawsuits for more than months.
testimony during a brief trial centered on telephone conversations between michael livorsi,the owner of livorsi marine,and gary miller,the country mutual agent for both gaffrig and livorsi.these conversations concerned the possibility of a lawsuit between gaffrig and livorsi and occurred prior to the filing of the trademark suit.as the parties stipulated,country mutual did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit until august,more than months after gaffrig and livorsi filed suit.
in pretrial and posttrial briefing,gaffrig and livorsi argued that country mutual was not prejudiced by the companies delay in notifying their insurer of the lawsuit.the companies argued that because country mutual insured both parties,it had a conflict that would have prevented the insurer from investigating the claim or defending either party in the lawsuit over the gaffrig precision instruments trademark.gaffrig and livorsi therefore argued that the insurer would have had to pay for independent counsel for both parties regardless of when it received notice,and so the timing of the notice did not prejudice the insurer.thus,the delay in notice should not relieve country mutual of its duty to defend.the companies found support for this argument in a line of cases beginning with rice aaa aerostar,d.the opinion in rice stated that,when notice of the lawsuit is the issue,the rule is that the insurer is required to show that it was prejudiced by the insured omission or delay in order to escape liability on its policy.rice,d at.
country mutual argued that the proper inquiry was not whether the insurer was prejudiced,but whether the insureds had given country mutual reasonable notice of the lawsuit.under other appellate cases,prejudice to the insurer is one of several factors in assessing the reasonableness of notice.see,northbrook property casualty insurance applied systems,d.country mutual argued that such a lengthy delay,without an excuse from gaffrig and livorsi,was unreasonable as a matter of law.thus,this breach of the policies notice conditions should relieve country mutual of its obligation to defend and indemnify the companies in their lawsuit.
the circuit court found that the claims in the federal lawsuit potentially fell within the insurance policy language covering advertising injuries,triggering country mutual duty to defend.that conclusion is not at issue in this appeal.the court also determined that gaffrig and livorsi failed to give country mutual the notice to which it was entitled.it addressed gaffrig and livorsi prejudice argument in the following manner 
in determining an insurer liability under the circumstances presented here,there is a case to be made for considering whether late notice actually prejudiced the insurer.however,any such possible argument tends to lose its force where there is no reasonable justification or excuse offered for not having given timely notice.in the present case,there has been literally no evidence of any justification or excuse offered by either of the defendants for a delay of more than months in the giving of notice to country mutual.under the circumstances,unless the court adopts the position that an unambiguous term of a contract may not be enforced unless the aggrieved party demonstrates some direct harm,there can be only one consequence flowing from the facts of this case.
accordingly,the circuit court entered judgment in favor of country mutual.gaffrig and livorsi appealed this decision.prior to the appellate court consideration of the case,the underlying trademark suit was resolved.the federal court granted gaffrig request for an injunction against livorsi use of the disputed trademarks.gaffrig performance industries,livorsi marine,c,c,wl.december.the court did not award monetary damages to either party.in the absence of damages,country mutual duty to indemnify is no longer an issue in this case.the appellate court therefore addressed only the insurer duty to defend.d.
the appellate court premised its decision on two concessions it concluded could be found in the parties briefs.d at.it determined that gaffrig and livorsi conceded that the notice they gave country mutual was unreasonably and inexcusably late.d at.the court also determined that country mutual conceded that,because of the conflict of interest,it could not prove it was prejudiced by the late notice.d at.thus,it framed the issue in the following terms given the circumstances presented to us,did country mutual have to prove prejudice d at.
the court noted the distinction between notifying an insurer of an occurrence and notifying an insurer of a lawsuit.d at.it determined that when notice of an occurrence is the issue,courts consider prejudice to the insurer as one of several factors in the evaluation of whether the insurer received reasonable notice.d at.additionally,some appellate decisions consider prejudice to the insurer only when the insured has a good excuse for the late notice of occurrence or where the delay in notice was relatively brief.d at.however,when notice of suit is the issue,some appellate decisions state that prejudice is required for the insurer to deny coverage based on late notice.d at.
the appellate court then addressed each decision embracing the latter proposition,beginning with rice.d at.it noted that rice was the first case to distinguish between notice of occurrence and notice of suit,and that this distinction did not have a basis in illinois precedent.d at.further,prejudice did not actually play a role in the rice court decision.d at.the court then examined cases citing rice and concluded that these cases also did not rely on the rice dictum for their holdings.d at.citing a line of cases contrary to rice,it concluded that there is no basis for distinguishing between notice of an occurrence and notice of a lawsuit.d at.
the court found that country mutual did not have to prove prejudice in order to deny coverage.d at.it reached the following two conclusions 
an insurer failure to prove prejudice is a factor to consider when determining whether the insured notice was unreasonably and inexcusably late,whether the notice has to do with an occurrence or a lawsuit 
once it is determined the insured notice was unreasonably and inexcusably late,the failure of the insurer to prove it suffered prejudice is irrelevant,whether the notice has to do with an occurrence or a lawsuit.d at.
gaffrig and livorsi petitioned this court for leave to appeal.we allowed their petition.we granted leave to file briefs amici curiae in support of gaffrig and livorsi to the illinois manufacturers association,united policyholders,and several illinois businesses.we also granted leave to the illinois insurance association,property casualty insurers association of america,and national association of mutual insurance companies to file a brief amicus curiae in support of country mutual.
standard of review 
gaffrig,livorsi,and their amici urge this court to adopt the rule that an insurance company that receives delayed notice of a lawsuit must prove that it was prejudiced by the delay in order to be relieved of its duty to defend a policyholder.in essence,they ask us to establish a new rule of construction for certain insurance policy notice provisions.this argument presents a question of law that we review de novo.see travelers insurance eljer manufacturing,construction of insurance contract is reviewed de novo.
when construing the language of an insurance policy,a court is to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the parties as expressed by the words of the policy.central illinois light home insurance.an insurance policy must be construed as a whole,giving effect to every provision.central illinois light,at.if the words used in the policy are unambiguous,they are given their plain,ordinary,and popular meaning.central illinois light,at.although insurance policies are construed liberally in favor of coverage,this rule of construction comes into play only when the policy language is ambiguous.hobbs hartford insurance of the midwest.
this court has previously addressed the proper construction of insurance policy notice provisions.these clauses impose valid prerequisites to insurance coverage.barrington consolidated high school american insurance,see also international harvester continental casualty,d,citing imperial fire insurance of london coos county.a policy condition requiring notice a s soon as practicable is interpreted to mean within a reasonable time.barrington consolidated high school,at.whether notice has been given within a reasonable time depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.barrington consolidated high school,at.breaching a policy notice clause by failing to give reasonable notice will defeat the right of the insured party to recover under the policy.simmon iowa mutual casualty.
in simmon,this court discussed the role of prejudice in the reasonableness analysis.the plaintiff in simmon had been injured in an automobile accident by a policyholder of the insurance company.simmon,at.she promptly notified the policyholder insurance company of the incident and of the lawsuit she filed.simmon,at.although notice was not given by the insured,the court held that it does not matter who notifies the insurer,as long as reasonable notice is given.simmon,at.the court noted that,when examining the facts and circumstances of each case to determine if notice was reasonable,lack of prejudice may be a factor in determining the question of whether a reasonable notice was given in a particular case yet it is not a condition which will dispense with the requirement.simmon,at.
when presented with an alleged breach of an insurance policy notice clause,the vast majority of illinois appellate decisions have utilized an analysis that is consistent with simmon.that is,courts have examined the circumstances of the case,including the presence or absence of prejudice,and determined whether the insurer in question received reasonable notice.see,northbrook,d at,university of illinois continental casualty,d,hartford casualty insurance snyders,d,united states fidelity guaranty maren engineering,d,mcfarlane merit insurance,d.when analyzing whether notice was reasonable some courts have stated that prejudice is not a factor unless the delay in notice is relatively brief or the insured has a good excuse see,twin city fire insurance old world trading,d,fletcher palos community consolidated school district,d,although this additional qualification is not found in simmon.but even that permutation of the simmon rule appropriately locates prejudice as one potential factor in the reasonableness analysis see simmon,at,rather than as a separate consideration to be reached only if there has not been reasonable notice.other factors in the reasonableness analysis may include the specific language of the policy notice provision,the insured sophistication in commerce and insurance matters,the insured awareness of an event which may trigger insurance coverage,and the insured diligence in ascertaining whether policy coverage is available.see northbrook,d at.
illinois courts have generally applied the simmon analysis regardless of the type of notice that is at issue insurance policies are likely to contain two different notice conditions one that requires notice of the occurrence of an incident which may fall within the policy coverage,and one that requires notice of any lawsuit stemming from such an incident.when interpreting notice provisions,most illinois decisions have not differentiated between the two requirements.see,american family mutual insurance blackburn,d,applying same standard to evaluate delayed notice of occurrence and notice of suit employers reinsurance miller insurance agency,d,examining several factors to determine whether notice of suit was given within a reasonable time american home assurance city of granite city,d,requiring notice of occurrence within reasonable time based on facts and circumstances of case.in sum,the simmon rule has been widely accepted as the proper analysis for review of all notice requirements contained in insurance policies.
certain recent appellate cases,however,refer to a different rule.this line of cases begins with rice aaa aerostar,d.in rice,the plaintiff notified the defendant insurer that she had been injured on defendant property,but allegedly failed to notify the insurer of the lawsuit she subsequently filed.rice,d at.the court distinguished between notice of an occurrence and notice of a lawsuit,stating that when the latter is at issue,the rule is that the insurer is required to show that it was prejudiced by the insured omission or delay in order to escape liability on its policy.rice,d at,citing marvel,annotation,modern status of rules requiring liability insurer to show prejudice to escape liability because of insured failure or delay in giving notice of accident or claim,or in forwarding suit papers,wl.however,the appellate court did not apply this rule.instead,it determined that the insurer failed to show it did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit,and reversed the circuit court grant of summary judgment.rice,d at.
the rice court did not cite any illinois precedent in support of its statement that an insurer must show that it was prejudiced by a delay in notice of suit.it relied only on a general annotation.see rice,d at,citing at,wl.the annotation in question also does not cite any illinois case law to support the rule embraced by rice.see at,wl.in fact,the annotation cites several illinois cases in support of the proposition that prejudice to a liability insurer is one factor in the determination of the question of the reasonableness of the insured omission or delay in giving the insurer notice of an accident,or in forwarding suit papers to it.at,wl,citing kenworthy bituminous c
