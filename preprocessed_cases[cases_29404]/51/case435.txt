southern grouts sells exposed quartz aggregate finishes under the registered trademark diamond brite.sells aggregate finishes under the registered trademark colorquartz.southern grouts uses www.sgm.cc and www.diamondbrite.cc to advertise and distribute its products.visitors to www.diamondbrite.cc are automatically redirected to www.sgm.cc.because its website has increased its domestic and international sales,southern grouts wants to register another domain name.according to southern grouts,its diamond brite trademark is more widely known than its company name.
the domain name,however,has been registered to since.that year expanded one of its forty divisions,the traffic safety systems division,which is separate from the division that manufactures and sells colorquartz products.as part of the expansion,bought nearly all the assets of the american electronic sign company.among those assets were multiple patents and trademarks,including the trademark registrations for two different diamond brite marks in connection with electronically controlled display panels and signs.there were also three domain names,including.
integrated the sign company business into its traffic systems division and continued to use the www.diamondbrite.com website for eighteen months.by february,the website included a graphic alerting visitors to the acquisition and provided a link that would take a visitor to traffic safety division website.in early,visitors to www.diamondbrite.com were automatically to traffic safety division website.then,between april and july,deactivated the website,in the sense that a visitor who typed in the domain name would get one of two screens,depending on a browser settings a no page can be displayed message or a search result display listing alternative websites or spellings.
stopped using the diamond brite trademark after the transition of products and customers from the sign company was complete.decided to do that in part because it was worried that diamond brite might dilute its most valuable mark,diamond grade,which it has used since in connection with a retroreflective sheeting material.in august,the united states patent and trademark office cancelled registration for one of its diamond brite trademarks because failed to file a declaration of continued use.by july,registration of its other diamond brite trademark had expired.has,however,continually renewed the registration of the domain name.
according to,it has continued to renew the registration of the domain name to avoid the risk that a competitor of its diamond grade products would use it to create consumer confusion as to the source of its products.additionally,has a policy that once it acquires a domain registration,transfer,or is strongly presumed that the domain name will be renewed absent an explicit decision to the contrary.the domain name in,and.
southern grouts contacted about the domain name three times before filing the complaint in this lawsuit.in southern grouts sent an email to domain name administrator noting that the domain name was not in use and asking if would please let it take the domain name.it is unclear from the record whether responded.then in southern grouts attorney sent a cease and desist letter.that letter claimed that was using the domain,accused of cyberpiracy,and demanded that transfer the domain name to southern grouts.in its response letter,refused to comply with the demand,denied any wrongful conduct,and invited any questions about or evidence of those claims.southern grouts did not accept that invitation.
in southern grouts attorney sent another letter to which stated that it appears that the site has been entirely inactive for more than six years and asked for an amicable and resolution.responded that its position remained the same.in its response letter,also told southern grouts that it would not use the name to compete with southern grouts diamond brite products and explained its concern that the domain name would at some time fall into the hands of someone seeking to create confusion with diamond grade product.the next time heard from southern grouts was when it filed the complaint against in this case.
southern grouts complaint alleged that continued registration of the domain name violated the anticybersquatting consumer protection act,d a,and constituted unfair competition under the lanham act,a both parties filed motions for summary judgment.about a month later,long after the district court deadline for amending the pleadings had passed,southern grouts filed a motion for leave to amend its second amended complaint based on new evidence from the deposition of.b corporate representative.
the district court denied southern grouts motion for leave to amend its second amended complaint.the next day,the court granted summary judgment in favor of and denied southern grouts motion for summary judgment.the court concluded that southern grouts unfair competition and cybersquatting claims were barred by laches and also were without merit.this is southern grouts appeal.
we first consider whether the district court abused its discretion in denying southern grouts motion for leave to amend its second amended complaint.on august,southern grouts filed that motion based on the deposition testimony of corporate representative,fred zonino.zonino testified that had purchased a google adword for diamond brite.an internet user who runs a google search for a term that has been purchased as an adword will see a sponsored link to the purchaser website in a display to the right of the search results.southern grouts asserts that information about that purchase supports its unfair competition claim and likely its cybersquatting claim too.
under the district court scheduling order the deadline to amend pleadings had passed on february.the court denied southern grouts motion to amend because it found that southern grouts had not been diligent and had failed to establish good cause for the delay.we review that judgment only for abuse of discretion.hinson clinch county bd.of,cir tech.res.servs.dornier med,cir.
southern grouts inquired into purchase of google adwords for the first time in a set of interrogatories served on may,which was three months after the deadline to amend pleadings had passed.the interrogatory asked to i dentify each and every instance in which has used the term s diamondbrite,diamond brite,or any confusingly similar term as a google adword or metatag.responded on june,about a month after the interrogatory was served.answered that it ha d located no information indicating that either the traffic control materials division the division that acquired the diamond brite marks and associated domain names or the industrial mineral products division the division manufacturing and selling colorquartz pool finishing products that competed with diamond brite products had used adwords for diamondbrite or diamond brite.
about two weeks later,on june,served its amended and supplemental responses to those interrogatory answers.it admitted that f or a period of at most three to four months sometime between october and february,the industrial mineral products division budgeted per month total for the purchase of several google ad words which included diamond brite.the day after amended its interrogatory answer,at a hearing before the district court on an unrelated motion,southern grouts counsel referred to adword purchase as a shocking development.counsel also observed aloud that it was past the deadline for amending pleadings and that we will take our licks there.
on june and,the parties filed motions for summary judgment.the memorandum supporting southern grouts motion for summary judgment referenced purchase of adwords as part of its attempt to establish that had use d in commerce the trademark diamond brite within the meaning of the lanham act.that memorandum included a section called has admitted to using southern grouts trademark in google adwords.
about a month later on july,southern grouts deposed zonino.zonino was initially scheduled for a deposition on june,but the deposition was postponed at southern grouts request.zonino testified that advertising agency had recommended that purchase the term diamond brite as part of a google adwords campaign for its colorquartz product because someone who was interested in diamond brite may be interested in colorquartz as an alternative kind of finish.he testified that followed his recommendation and that diamond brite was one of the adwords that the advertising agency bought.
on august,southern grouts filed its motion to amend its complaint.the next day again amended its interrogatory response to state that it bought the diamond brite adword through a third party and that the use of it lasted for three weeks.over those three weeks,the sponsored link got thirteen hits,resulted in no sales,and caused no known confusion.
the district court denied southern grouts motion for leave to amend its complaint.it found that southern grouts lack of diligence in pursuing its claim foreclosed a finding of good cause required for the grant of a motion for leave to amend a complaint outside the time prescribed in the district court scheduling order.
a plaintiff seeking leave to amend its complaint after the deadline designated in a scheduling order must demonstrate good cause under.b.see sosa airprint,cir w hen a motion to amend is filed after a scheduling order deadline,rule is the proper guide for determining whether a party delay may be excused.b a schedule may be modified only for good cause and with the judge consent.in sosa,we upheld the district court denial of the plaintiff motion to amend her complaint because the plaintiff failure to comply with the court scheduling order resulted from a lack of diligence in pursuing her claim.at.the record supports the district court conclusion that southern grouts similarly lacked diligence in pursuing its claim 
when southern grouts finally filed the motion to amend its complaint on august,the deadline to amend pleadings had come and gone five months earlier on february,both parties had filed their initial briefs in support of their motions for summary judgment almost a month earlier on june,and fact discovery had been closed for a few weeks since july.although southern grouts argues that the delay in filing its motion for leave to amend its complaint was caused by stonewalling its discovery requests relating to its purchase of google adwords,southern grouts did not serve its first interrogatory about adwords until three months after the deadline to amend pleadings had passed.southern grouts did not depose zonino until after the deadline had passed for amending pleadings and discovery and after the parties had filed motions for summary judgment.that deposition,originally scheduled for june,had been postponed at least once by southern grouts.
we have upheld a district court denial of a motion to amend pleadings at this stage in the proceedings before.see lowe home centers,olin,cir i t is not an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a motion for leave to amend following the close of discovery,past the deadline for amendments and past the deadline for filing dispositive motions.southern grouts attempts to distinguish this case from lowe by arguing that unlike the plaintiff motion in that case,its motion here did not seek to add a new claim,but instead sought only to add information in support of the unfair competition claim that it had already alleged in its second amended complaint.it argues that purchase of a google adword for diamond brite was just another way in which misused southern grouts trademark and is precisely the kind of information discovery is intended to uncover,and ultimately did uncover.
even assuming that the adword purchase was the type of information discovery is intended to uncover,southern grouts dallied too long in discovering it.southern grouts lacked diligence,at the very least,because it waited until august,to file a motion to amend its complaint with information that it had known over a month before when it filed a motion for summary judgment.although southern grouts argues that failed to definitively admit or deny the purchase and that it never received a straight answer until it deposed zonino on july,there is evidence that southern grouts had interpreted first amended interrogatory answers filed on june,as evidence that purchased the diamond brite adword.
on june,southern grouts counsel referred to adword purchase as a shocking development.in the memorandum supporting its motion for summary judgment filed on june,southern grouts asserted that has admitted to using southern grouts trademark in google adwords.as the district court pointed out,southern grouts later motion to amend the complaint came after both parties had briefed motions for summary judgment,and southern grouts even referenced in its motion use of google adwords.instead of putting on notice of the adword allegations it sought to pursue by seeking to amend its complaint,southern grouts slid those allegations into its motion for summary judgment,which it filed after had already filed its motion for summary judgment.
the proper procedure at the summary judgment stage would have been to file a motion for leave to amend its complaint.see gilmour gates,mcdonald and,cir at the summary judgment stage,the proper procedure for plaintiffs to assert a new claim is to amend the complaint in accordance with.a.by filing its motion for leave to amend its complaint a month later,southern grouts waited too late.the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying southern grouts motion for failure to show good cause why it did not amend its complaint before the amendment deadline imposed in the scheduling order or during extensions of that deadline 
we next consider whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to on southern grouts claim that violated the anticybersquatting consumer protection act,d.the district court granted summary judgment because it concluded that the claim was barred by laches and that southern grouts had failed to show had a bad faith intent to profit as required by the statute.
congress enacted the anticybersquatting consumer protection act,d,in,a,stat.the act provides a cause of action for a trademark owner against a person who has a bad faith intent to profit from the owner mark and who registers,traffics in,or uses a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to the owner distinctive mark or that is identical,confusingly similar to or dilutive of the owner famous mark d a i ii.the act sets out a list of nine factors that a court may consider in determining whether a defendant had a bad faith intent to profit.d b i.as other courts have observed,the statute clearly makes consideration of those factors permissive may consider being the key language.see virtual works,volkswagen of,cir we need not,however,march through the nine factors seriatim because the acpa itself notes that use of the listed criteria is permissive.sporty farm sportsman market,cir t he factors are expressly described as indicia that may be considered along with other facts.
southern grouts strongest argument that had a bad faith intent to profit is not based on any of the statute nine permissive factors,but instead focuses on two unique circumstances of the case.see sporty farm,at.the most important grounds for our holding that sporty farm acted with a bad faith intent,however,are the unique circumstances of this case,which do not fit neatly into the specific factors enumerated by congress but may nevertheless be considered under the statute.
first,southern grouts urges us to consider,as a unique circumstance,that through its registration of the domain name,has the ability to monitor the viability and value of internet traffic,the number of hits to www.diamondbrite.com,and the geographic location of all or most of the hits,which could be used to determine strategic commercial information.the only evidence southern grouts offers to support its assertion that had or used that capability,however,was properly ruled inadmissible by the district court.that evidence was the report of expert robert moody.moody report states that my expert opinion is that can,and almost certainly does,enjoy a commercial benefit from its ownership of the domain by accessing and collecting information from that source.in support of that contention,moody relies primarily on the general abilities of neustar ultra services the company to which outsourced its domain name system hosting to allow a user of those services,such as,to log and analyze statistics from its servers.although it claims to rely on the parties discovery and the record,moody report provides no specific citations to either one.as the district court pointed out,and southern grouts does not dispute,moody report does not purport to explain actual abilities or actions with regard to.
after determining that moody report was so pervaded by conclusory statements as to be almost without value and that his opinion was connected to the data only by his ipse dixit assertion,the district court ruled that moody report was inadmissible.we review a district court exclusion of an expert report at summary judgment only for abuse of discretion,see corwin walt disney,cir,and conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion here.see cook ex rel.estate of tessier sheriff of monroe county,cir a trial court may exclude expert testimony that is imprecise and unspecific,or whose factual basis is not adequately explained.see id.n othing in either daubert or the federal rules of evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence which is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert.internal quotation marks omitted.even if the report were admissible,southern grouts did not identify which part of the pages of moody report supports the idea that had the ability to use its control over the domain name to monitor hits,and there is no evidence that it either intended to or actually did use the domain name in that way.there is also no explanation in the report about how that information would be useful to when there are at least six other registered users of the diamond brite mark therefore,southern grouts attempt to establish the first unique circumstance showing had a bad faith intent to profit from the domain name fails.
the second unique circumstance southern grouts proffers is that has kept control of the domain name,not to display content,but to prevent others from registering it.to support that contention southern grouts points out conceded that it did not need the domain name to display content but admitted that it continue d to renew the domain name registration for because it did not want to take the risk that a competitor could obtain the domain name and use it to create confusion among customers and potential customers as to the source of that competitor retroreflective sheeting products similar to diamond grade products.southern grouts also points out that the domain name a month after southern grouts sent it a cease and desist letter and then the domain name again a few months after southern grouts filed the complaint in this lawsuit.as further proof of its point,southern grouts notes that has a corporate policy of renewing domain names as a default rule.
this circumstance does not,however,tip our analysis toward a conclusion that has violated the anticybersquatting consumer protection act.proving bad faith is not enough.a defendant is liable only where a plaintiff can establish that the defendant had a bad faith intent to profit.d emphasis added.we can not read the words intent to profit out of the statute.see friends of everglades.water mgmt,cir w e are not allowed to add or subtract words from a statute we can not rewrite it.nguyen united states,cir we are not authorized to rewrite,revise,modify,or amend statutory language in the guise of interpreting it.
the senate report accompanying the anticybersquatting consumer protection act bolsters our understanding that a bad faith intent to profit is the essence of the wrong that the act seeks to combat.that report defines cybersquatters as those who 
register brand names as internet domain names in order to extract payment from the rightful owners of the marks register marks as domain names and warehouse those marks with the hope of selling them to the highest bidder register marks to prey on consumer confusion by misusing the domain name to divert customers from the mark owner site to the cybersquatter own site target distinctive marks to defraud consumers,including to engage in counterfeiting activities.
lucas nursery and landscaping grosse,cir quoting,wl,at emphasis added.the report says nothing about those who hold onto a domain name to prevent a competitor from using it.
congress enacted the anticybersquatting protection act in response to concerns over the proliferation of internet version of a land grab.virtual works,at.the practice of holding domain names for ransom with an intent to profit directly from selling the domain name itself is the paradigmatic harm targeted by the act.lucas nursery,at see also schmidheiny weber,cir the purpose of the act is to curtail one form of act of registering someone else name as a domain name for the purpose of demanding remuneration from the person in exchange for the domain name.citing cong.rec.daily ed,statement of lott ford motor catalanotte,cir registering a famous trademark as a domain name and then offering it for sale to the trademark owner is exactly the wrong congress intended to remedy when it passed the acpa.eagle hosp.physicians,srg consulting,cir defining cybersquatting as the conduct of one who reserves with a network information center a domain name consisting of the mark or name of a company for the purpose of relinquishing the right to the domain name back to the legitimate owner for a price quoting mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,ed,wl,at identifying cybersquatters as those who register numerous domain names containing american trademarks or tradenames only to hold them ransom in exchange for money.southern grouts accuses not of a design to sell a domain name for profit but of a refusal to sell one.
as the tenth circuit has explained,a defendant could also intend to profit by diverting customers from the website of the trademark owner to the defendant own website,where those consumers would purchase the defendant products or services instead of the trademark owner.utah lighthouse ministry found.for apologetic info.and research,cir.but there is no evidence that has done that.
southern grouts has failed to establish that had a bad faith intent to profit through the existence of either of the unique circumstances it has proffered.it has not established that had any intention to profit from the website by selling the domain name registration,by selling or advertising products on the www.diamondbrite.com website to unsuspecting consumers in search of southern grouts diamond brite products,or by using the domain name in any other way to obtain a profit.
our conclusion that did not have a bad faith intent to profit is not undermined by any of southern grouts arguments challenging the district court assessment of the nine statutory factors that courts may consider in their discretion.the district court found that five factors favored,two factors favored southern grouts,and the two other factors were inapplicable.we agree.
the five factors favoring are the third,fifth,sixth,seventh,and eighth ones.the third factor is the person prior use,if any,of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering of any goods or services.see d b i iii.initially used the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering of the product lines it had acquired through its purchase of the american electronic sign company assets.even though,as southern grouts argues,has not made a bona fide offering of goods in connection with the domain name since the domain name after the lapse in its diamond brite trademark rights,the statute plainly refers to any prior use.there was that,so this factor does favor.
for the fifth factor to favor southern grouts the record must show that inten ded to divert consumers from the mark owner online location to a site accessible under the domain name that could harm the goodwill represented by the mark,either for commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or disparage the mark,by creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source,sponsorship,affiliation,or endorsement of the site.see d b i v.southern grouts points to nothing in the record showing such action with that intent.instead of identifying how inactive www.diamondbrite.com website could harm the goodwill represented by the mark as by creating confusion,causing dilution,or being used for purposes of commercial grouts vaguely asserts that intended to gain commercial advantage in cyberspace.even putting aside southern grouts failure to specify what intended to gain by diverting consumers to the www.diamondbrite.com website,southern grout has failed to submit evidence showing that intended to divert potential southern grouts customers 
the sixth factor,which considers the person offer to transfer,sell,or otherwise assign the domain name to the mark owner or any third party for financial gain favors because it never offered to transfer,sell,or assign the domain name to any party.see d b i vi.instead has consistently refused to turn over the domain name and has repeatedly asserted that it wants to keep the domain name.
the seventh factor,which considers the person provision of material and misleading false contact information when applying for registration or in failing to accurately maintain that contact information,favors because southern grouts has produced nothing to indicate that provided any type of false contact information.see d b i vii.
the eighth factor also favors.that factor considers the person registration or acquisition of multiple domain names which the person knows are identical or confusingly similar to marks of others that are distinctive at the time of registration of such domain names.d b i viii.in its briefs before this court southern grouts does not identify a single domain name,other than,that it contends has improperly registered.southern grouts did offer eighteen such domain names to the district court.that evidence was called into question by the district court,which,using the research method relied on by southern grouts,took judicial notice of the fact that did not actually have registrations for all eighteen domain names identified and that had a legitimate connection to some of them.without clarifying for us what domain names,if any,southern grouts continues to assert that has improperly registered,it vaguely argues that bad faith can clearly be seen through its registration acquisition of a multitude of domain names all consisting of distinctive marks of others which has no legitimate rights to use.we are unconvinced.southern grouts also argues that the registration of the single domain,with knowledge that it incorporates a competitor mark informs an inference of bad faith,like multiple domain names would.that argument,however,is at odds with the plain meaning of the word multiple.id.d b i viii.
although we agree with southern grouts,and the district court,that two of the remaining four factors favor southern grouts,those factors are not enough to tip the scales in its favor.the first factor,which considers the trademark or other intellectual property rights of the person,if any,in the domain name favors southern grouts because even though at one time had rights in two diamond brite marks,its rights in those marks have lapsed.see d b i.
the ninth factor,which considers the extent to which the mark incorporated in the person domain name registration is or is not distinctive and famous,also favors southern grouts.id.d b ix.the district court determined that diamond brite is distinctive and does not challenge that finding.
southern grouts argues that the remaining two second and favor it.the district court disagreed.it found that the second factor,which considers the extent to which the domain name consists of the legal name of the person or a name that is otherwise commonly used to identify that person,was inapplicable because is not the legal or identifying name of a person.see d b i ii.we agree.it found that the fourth factor,which considers the person bona fide noncommercial or fair use of the mark in a site accessible under the domain name,id.d b i iv,was also inapplicable because that factor concerns domain names used for comparative advertising,criticism,comment,or parody and the domain name is not used for any of those purposes,or at all.we agree.
in any event,characterizing those two factors as favoring southern grouts instead of inapplicable would not change the result.a court analysis of whether a defendant had the bad faith intent to profit necessary to a cybersquatting claim is not based on a score card of the statutory factors.as we have already explained,the factors are permissive considerations.see virtual works,at sporty farm,at.whether the second or fourth statutory factors are counted as favoring southern grouts or are considered as neutral because they are inapplicable is irrelevant to the outcome.those two factors offer means for the domain name holder to show good faith reasons for registering the domain name.the absence of those two good faith reasons does not rule out a finding of good faith for other reasons.
because we agree with the district court that southern grouts claim fails on the merits because it did not show had the requisite bad faith intent to profit,we need not address the court alternative holding that the laches defense applies to the cybersquatting claim and bars it.see reyes maschmeier,cir affirming on one of the district court grounds,w e do not reach the other grounds discussed by the district court in the disposition of this case unimex,of hous.and urban,cir the district court dismissed the complaint for a variety of reasons.because we find that the united states has not waived its sovereign immunity in cases such as this,we affirm for that reason alone,and do not reach the district court other grounds for dismissal.
we next consider whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to on southern grouts claim that engaged in unfair competition in violation of the lanham act,a.in granting summary judgment,the district court found that the claim was barred by laches and that southern grouts failed to show a use in commerce by and failed to produce sufficient evidence of a likelihood of confusion.
section a of the lanham act creates civil liability for 
a ny person who,on or in connection with goods or services,or any container for goods,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof which is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,connection,or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person 
under the plain language of the statute southern grouts had to show that in connection with goods or services use d in commerce the term diamond brite.because domain name does not sell or advertise any goods or services,no use of it in commerce is readily apparent.southern grouts argues that made use in commerce in three ways
