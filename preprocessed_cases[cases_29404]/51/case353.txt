enterprises,mde appeals the district court grant of an injunction against any further use of its registered domain name.mde asserts three challenges to the injunction that the jury finding of trademark infringement,which gave rise to the injunction,was the result of an improper jury instruction that the district court erred in finding that the plaintiff claim was not barred by laches and that the injunction is overbroad.we find that each of these claims fails,and affirm the district court grant of the injunction.
chronology 
internet specialties west internet specialties and mde are both internet service providers offering substantially similar services,including internet access,and.internet specialties uses the domain name,which it registered in may of.mde uses the domain name,which it registered in july of.
internet specialties became aware of ispwest existence in late.at that time,the companies did not offer equal services internet specialties offered,dsl and internet access nationwide,whereas mde offered only internet access and only in southern california.internet specialties ceo testified that his company was not concerned about competition from mde at that time,because it did not offer dsl and because the general market for internet technology was so volatile that most companies were expected to go out of business.
mde expanded to service in,and began offering dsl in.both parties agree that the shift from supplying to supplying dsl was a natural and gradual technological evolution which was necessary for mde to stay in business.however,this evolution triggered action by internet specialties.in,after giving mde a letter,internet specialties brought suit alleging that mde use of the name ispwest constituted trademark infringement in violation of the lanham act,a 
the trial was bifurcated.in the first phase,the jury found that mde had infringed on internet specialties trademark,but found no damages from the infringement.in the second phase,the district court ruled that mde did not have a laches defense to the action.accordingly,the court issued an injunction against the use of the name ispwest.
mde moved for a new trial that the district court denied.mde appeals the jury findings,the district court findings,and the scope of the injunction.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and.the district court entered its judgment and permanent injunction on november.the district court denied mde motion for a new trial on december.the notice of appeal was timely filed on january.this court has jurisdiction under.
iii.analysis 
jury instruction 
first we consider mde contention that jury instruction was improper and prejudiced the jury in favor of internet specialties on its trademark infringement claim.we review de novo a district court statement of the law,but its formulation of the instructions for abuse of discretion.medtronic,white,cir we review de novo whether the instructions misstated the law.we review a district court formulation of jury instructions in a civil case for abuse of discretion.internal quotation marks omitted.we hold that instruction correctly states the law and is appropriately formulated.
jury instruction followed the model civil instructions by identifying the elements of trademark infringement,and by listing the eight sleekcraft factors under the element of likelihood of confusion.see,amf sleekcraft boats,cir.after listing these factors,however,departed from the model instructions by stating the following 
in an internet case such as this one,the law considers three of these factors to be of greatest importance i similarity of plaintiff and defendant mark ii relatedness of services and iii simultaneous use of the internet as a marketing channel.
therefore,if you find that the names iswest and ispwest are confusingly similar,and that the services offered by the plaintiff and defendant are related,and that both the plaintiff and the defendant use the internet as a marketing channel,then you should find that the plaintiff has proven there is a likelihood of confusion as i have instructed you unless you find that the remaining factors weigh strongly in the defendant favor.
this instruction is an accurate reflection of the law of our circuit,which places greater import on the internet troika factors in internet cases.interstellar starship,epix,cir,walt disney,cir.the instruction did not,as mde contends,mislead the jury as to the source of these factors the phrase three of these factors clearly refers to the eight sleekcraft factors discussed immediately prior to the sentence at issue.finally,the phrase as i have instructed you,taken in context,was not an attempt to direct the jury to find for the plaintiff.instead,it merely refers back to the judge preceeding instructions on the likelihood of confusion.
therefore,we reject mde claim that jury instruction was improper.accordingly,we do not need to consider internet specialties assertion that mde failed to preserve this issue for appeal.
next,we turn to whether the district court erred in determining that laches did not bar internet specialties trademark infringement claim.laches is an equitable defense to lanham act claims,at.this defense embodies the principle that a plaintiff can not sit on the knowledge that another company is using its trademark,and then later come forward and seek to enforce its rights.grupo gigante de dallo,cir.
the test for laches is first,was the plaintiff delay in bringing suit unreasonable second,was the defendant prejudiced by the delay jarrow formulas,nutrition now,cir tillamook country smoker,tillamook county creamery association,cir.as to whether internet specialties was diligent,we must first decide whether it filed suit within the applicable period,thereby creating a presumption against laches see jarrow,at if the plaintiff filed suit within the analogous limitations period,the strong presumption is that laches is inapplicable.however,if suit is filed outside of the analogous limitations period,courts often have presumed that laches is applicable.the parties dispute the correct starting date for the laches period.the district court found in favor of internet specialties,holding that the period started in when mde began offering dsl,rather than in when internet specialties gained actual knowledge of mde existence.
there is an intracircuit conflict about the correct standard of review for a district court determination of the starting date for laches.in jarrow,the appellate court reviewed the laches determination as a whole,including the starting date,under a clear of discretion hybrid discussed below.at see also grupo gigante,at applying hybrid review from jarrow to entire laches review.however,a more recent case held that a district court decision on the narrow issue of the starting date is reviewed de novo,while giving deference to the ultimate decision on whether laches applied.tillamook,at in an analogous circumstance,the question of when the statute of limitations begins to run for an action at law is reviewed de novo.de novo review is thus appropriate here.we need not resolve this inconsistency because we would reach the same result under either standard of review.
the limitations period for laches starts when the plaintiff knew or should have known about its potential cause of action.tillamook,at see also jarrow,at.in this case,the potential cause of action was a trademark infringement claim.the essence of such a claim centers on the likelihood of confusion between two marks or products,disney,cir the likelihood of confusion is the central element of trademark infringement.brookfield communications,west coast entertainment,cir the core element of trademark infringement is the likelihood of confusion.thus,the question is when internet specialties knew or should have known about the likelihood of confusion between its mark and mde mark.
on this issue,we disagree with the district court.while it is true that mde did not offer dsl in,both companies did offer internet access,and web hosting in the same geographic area under remarkably similar names.a prudent business person should recognize the likelihood of confusion to consumers under such circumstances as existed in.therefore,we find that the laches period started in.accordingly,the presumption of laches does apply,because internet specialties did not file suit until after the period had expired.
this,however,does not end the inquiry.we must still decide whether laches precludes internet specialties claim,bearing in mind the presumption in favor of laches.in our circuit,we apply a hybrid standard of review in this circumstance,reviewing de novo whether laches is a valid defense to a particular action,but reviewing the district court application of the laches factors for abuse of discretion.jarrow,at grupo gigante,at tillamook,at.
the district court appropriately applied the six factors in its laches review we take issue only with its decision regarding the second factor plaintiff diligence in enforcing its mark.internet specialties knew,or should have known,about the likelihood of confusion between the domain names and in.its argument that mde progressively encroached on its market when it shifted from offering access to dsl access is without merit.offering dsl was not an expansion into a new market,but rather a natural growth of its existing business.a junior user growth of its existing business and the concomitant increase in its use of the mark do not constitute progressive encroachment.tillamook,at.in grupo gigante,we rejected a progressive encroachment argument where the plaintiff knew of the potential conflict several years before bringing suit the fact that it chose to wait until the conflict was actual,versus potential,was not an excuse and did not constitute progressive encroachment.at.the same reasoning applies here.internet specialties was not entitled to wait until mde business grew large enough to constitute a real threat,and then sue for trademark infringement.therefore,we find that the district court erred in its conclusion that internet specialties was diligent,the second factor.
however,mde must still satisfy the second prong of the laches test prejudice resulting from internet specialties unreasonable delay in bringing suit.see jarrow,at holding that after a finding of unreasonable delay,laches would not apply unless defendant also demonstrated prejudice.the dissent views this as an case of prejudice,because mde continued to build a valuable business around its trademark during the time that the plaintiff delayed the exercise of its legal rights.dissent,quoting grupo gigante,at.the dissent would hold that the expansion from customers to customers,along with the accompanying sales and expenses,constitutes prejudice.dissent.
while we are sympathetic to mde position,the meaning of prejudice in this context is not so simple.if this prejudice could consist merely of expenditures in promoting the infringed name,then relief would have to be denied in practically every case of delay.tisch hotels,americana inn,cir.laches is meant to protect an infringer whose efforts have been aimed at build ing a valuable business around its trademark and an important reliance on the publicity of its mark.mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition citations omitted emphases added.therefore,we feel compelled to analyze whether mde claim of prejudice is based on mere expenditures in promoting the infringed name,tisch hotels,at,or whether it is based on an investment in the mark ispwest as the identity of the business in the minds of the public.see jarrow,at finding prejudice where had the plaintiff filed suit sooner,the infringer could have invested resources in an alternative identity in the minds of the public.
we find that the district court opinion,to which we owe some deference under the abuse of discretion standard,answers this question.the district court held that mde did not demonstrate prejudice from internet specialties delay in bringing suit,because mde did not spend the time in the interim developing brand recognition of its mark.the uncontested evidence at trial showed that the vast majority of mde advertising took the form of advertisements,through which potential customers are funneled to mde website based on their interest in a particular type of service,internet services in southern california.such advertising creates little to no brand awareness.furthermore,mde typically did not even include the name ispwest in the advertisements it is a simple premise that mde can not create public association between ispwest and the company if it does not even use the ispwest mark in its most prevalent form of advertising.
it is true,as the dissent points out,that mde customers will be forced to change their addresses,and that now people must change,as opposed to.however,the district court found that mde had not shown that it would have to undertake significant advertising expenditures to change its name at this juncture.to the contrary,the evidence showed that mde had successfully changed its name in the past,that internet service providers frequently change their names due to consolidations and mergers,and that the additional costs of registering a new domain name are minimal.
we do not think that our view of prejudice constitutes a defiance of circuit precedent,as the dissent characterizes it.our laches cases have consistently included an analysis of whether,during plaintiff delay in bringing suit,the infringer developed an identity as a business based on its mark.for instance,in jarrow formulas,plaintiff jarrow challenged certain health claims on defendant nutrition now product,a health supplement called.jarrow.jarrow argued the health claims were false and misleading advertising under the lanham act,but we held that jarrow suit was barred by laches.our finding of prejudice expressly rested on the public association that nutrition now had built between the health claims and its product.
nutrition now has closely tied the challenged claims to since initial distribution in.nutrition now has always prominently displayed the claims on product label.nutrition now has also used the claims as a central part of its extensive marketing campaign at bottom,nutrition now has invested enormous resources in trying identity to the challenged claims.
id.at.thus,jarrow analysis of prejudice probed deeper than simply whether nutrition now had spent money expanding its business.we are compelled to do the same.
similarly,our holding in grupo gigante was that a defendant can show prejudice by proving that it has continued to build a valuable business around its trademark during the time that the plaintiff delayed the exercise of its legal rights.at,emphasis added.we found that the defendant was prejudiced where it had operated two grocery stores,with the infringing name prominently displayed at the entrance,for four years after plaintiff discovered the infringement.id.there is a significant difference between the public association of a grocery store and its name,versus the public association of mde and ispwest.a grocery store very identity rests in its name.mde failed to show at trial that its identity had much at all to do with the mark ispwest,inasmuch as mde did not rely on its mark to attract customers.
in conclusion,we find no error or abuse of discretion in the district court finding that mde was not prejudiced within the meaning of a trademark infringement claim.thus,laches does not bar internet specialties lawsuit.
scope of the injunction 
finally,we must decide whether the district court injunction is overbroad.we review a district court grant or denial of an injunction,as well as the scope of the injunction,for abuse of discretion.gallo winery gallo cattle,cir scott pasadena unified school,cir.
under the district court order,mde is enjoined from 
u tilizing any of iswest marks or any variation,derivative,or shorthand notation thereof,or any terms similar thereto,including ispwest,in connection with any product or service,or sham products or services,in any medium,which would give rise to a likelihood of confusion as to the source of such products or services.
mde contends that even if it can not use its mark to market dsl services,it should not be prohibited from using it to market its other services which did not prompt internet specialties lawsuit.we find the scope of the injunction appropriate.the essence of trademark infringement is the likelihood of confusion,and an injunction should be fashioned to prevent just that we find no abuse in the district court determination that,in order to avoid confusion to consumers,mde must abandon all use of the name.
a plaintiff seeking an injunction must establish that the injunction is in the public interest.winter nrdc,d,rev g cir.the wording of the district court injunction reflects the usual public interest concern in trademark cases avoiding confusion to consumers.the dissent would hold that a second type of public burden imposed on the public by the this injunction.the dissent cites only to winter,in which the supreme court held that the public interest in national security defeated an injunction against certain navy training excercises.dissent,citing winter.at.we do not see a sufficient similarity between the public interest in national security and the particularized interest of mde customers that would justify overturning this injunction on the grounds that it burdens the public.
conclusion 
since we affirm the district court findings in internet specialties favor,we do not reach the issues of unclean hands or internet specialties cross appeal on its state law claim.
i respectfully dissent.
e quity aids the vigilant,not those who slumber on their rights,or vigilantibus non dormientibus,aequitas subvenit 
the majority opinion could have used what learned hand wrote about prejudice,and left it at that 
the plaintiff did nothing not a word of protest,or gesture of complaint,escaped it for six years more and still defendant business kept increasing.what equity it can have the hardihood now to assert how it can expect us to stifle a competition which with complete complaisance,and even with active encouragement,it has allowed for years to grow like the mustard tree why we should destroy a huge business built up with its connivance and consent this we find it impossible to understand 
i concur in most of the steps of the majority analysis,as stated below.but when the majority gets to prejudice,the majority defies circuit precedent and for no equitable reason that i can see.and when the majority reaches injunction law,it defies supreme court precedent we have now enunciated a new and unfair standard for prejudice in trademark law.the majority gives no good reason why.
the key,and new,holding is i f this prejudice could consist merely of expenditures in promoting the infringed name,then relief would have to be denied in practically every case of delay,applied in this case to a time period well in excess of the analogous statute of limitations period years compared with and exponential increases in business and expenses around a trademark increase in general business expenses and a increase in advertising expenditures.notably,the language the majority uses in its holding comes from a case where the delay was less than a year the infringement was deliberate and in which longer periods of delay were distinguished the practical effect of this new rule is to eviscerate the defense of laches in trademark law.
the critical dates in this case are,when internet specialties west,internet specialties discovered that enterprises,was using a domain name similar to its own,and,when it finally did something about milon digiorgio innocent infringement.internet specialties waited more than years before writing a cease and desist letter and then filing suit.no one contends that infringement was willful.the only willful decision was by internet specialties,who let things ride in the hope that its competitor would go out of business.
when internet specialties discovered unwittingly infringing ispwest domain name in,ispwest had about customers.in,internet specialties again had the infringement brought to its awareness.someone called internet specialties to collect on a bill thought to be owed by ispwest.thus,internet specialties knew both that ispwest was infringing and,from this and a few other calls,that the infringement caused confusion.yet internet specialties still did not even trouble itself to send a cease and desist letter to ispwest.
in,almost years after internet specialties discovered ispwest infringement,ispwest began offering dsl service in addition to dialup,much faster upload and download speeds.internet specialties found out.still,no action.finally,a few months later,in,internet specialties sent a cease and desist letter to ispwest and filed this lawsuit.
internet specialties first claim of infringement and demand that ispwest stop its activities was more than years after internet specialties knew that ispwest was infringing on its trademark.ispwest had meanwhile grown from customers to,by dint of over million in marketing expenses.
ii.analysis 
the majority opinion is correct up to the discussion of prejudice.we are agreed that jury instruction was not an abuse of discretion t he limitations period for laches starts from the time that the plaintiff knew or should have known about its potential cause of action the two companies offered similar enough services that internet specialties should have recognized the likelihood of confusion in,when it became aware that ispwest was providing internet access,and internet specialties progressive encroachment argument is foreclosed by grupo gigante de dallo and tillamook country smoker,tillamook county creamery because they were not entitled to wait until ispwest business grew large enough to constitute a real threat to internet specialties internet specialties was not diligent internet specialties did not file suit within the analogous statute of limitations period and therefore,a presumption in favor of laches applies and internet specialties delay in bringing suit was unreasonable,so laches bars equitable remedies unless there was no prejudice to ispwest as a result of the delay 
we part ways on prejudice and on the majority affirmance of the injunction.
ninth circuit law,and the law of our sister circuits,has long held that prejudice is established when the party asserting laches prov es that it has continued to build a valuable business around its trademark during the time that the plaintiff delayed the exercise of its legal rights.that was proved here.in,ispwest had customers.in,it had.in,ispwest had in sales.in,it had in sales.at the heart of this expansion was the use of the trademark,ispwest.customers received addresses and used the ispwest domain name.all this expansion happened while internet specialties knew about the infringement and did nothing to stop it.until today,ispwest five or sixfold expansion of its business would have been more than enough to establish prejudice.
as the majority concedes,jarrow formulas,nutrition now,establishes that laches is presumed to bar a claim made outside of the analogous limitations period,years here the district court did not apply this presumption because,as the majority holds,it failed to determine the proper period for laches in fact,the district court applied a presumption against laches.accordingly,the district court necessarily committed an abuse of discretion on this issue,and we can not properly defer to its discretion.the majority deferential review is erroneous.
we extensively considered laches in grupo gigante,a trademark case in which the plaintiff delay was only years,not as in the case at bar we held that prejudice is established and was in that case when the party asserting laches has continued to build a valuable business around its trademark during the time that the plaintiff delayed the exercise of its legal rights.we are obligated to follow circuit precedent,so this rule controls and resolves the case.we did not require,in grupo gigante,brand awareness or public association.neither of those phrases appear in grupo gigante discussion of prejudice.in the case at bar,the majority mistakenly contends that we did require these things.
we held in grupo gigante that laches barred equitable relief that would require the defendant to change the name on its existing stores first,we held that to obta
