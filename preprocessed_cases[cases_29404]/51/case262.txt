beanstalk,which serves owners of intellectual property by negotiating licenses of their property,brought this diversity suit for breach of its contract with am general the substantive issues are governed by the law of indiana.the contract,called a representation agreement,appointed beanstalk an agent of am general to obtain licenses to use the latter hummer trademark.when the contract was made in,am general was the manufacturer of the humvee,a military vehicle that is the successor to the jeep and like the jeep is also sold in a version intended for the civilian market,under the name hummer.beanstalk named general motors as an additional defendant for reasons that will appear in a moment.the district judge granted the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint to which beanstalk had attached the representation agreement for failure to state a claim.b.since the representation agreement was part of a pleading rather than submitted separately,the judge could consider it without converting the defendants motion to one for summary judgment.c berthold types adobe systems,cir.
the agreement made beanstalk am general sole and exclusive nonemployee representative for the purpose of licensing the hummer trademark and entitled beanstalk to percent of the gross receipts received on owner am general behalf under any license agreements made while the representation agreement was in force.each license agreement shall provide for all payments thereunder to be made to beanstalk on owner behalf,and beanstalk is required to account quarterly to am general for all gross receipts actually received during the preceding calendar quarter under any license agreements.am general is given the absolute right to veto,without cause and at its sole discretion,any proposed license,including renewals.license agreement is defined as any agreement or arrangement,whether in the form of a license or otherwise,granting merchandising or other rights in the property,which in turn is defined to mean trademarks and related rights.the contract,which is assignable though by beanstalk only with am consent and contains an integration clause,was to continue until the end of.
the agreement was drafted by beanstalk,but this fact has little interpretive significance since am general is a commercially sophisticated party represented by counsel.most courts now agree with this exception to the principle that contracts are to be construed against the party that drafted it.western sling cable hamilton,so d,wood river pipeline willbros energy services,kinney,iowa dawn equipment systems,cir northbrook excess surplus ins.procter gamble,and cir missouri pacific kansas gas electric,cir first state underwriters agency of new england reinsurance travelers ins,cir eagle leasing hartford fire ins,cir.there are holdouts,illustrated by eastern bus lines,board of education,where the court,quoting an earlier opinion,said that the party who actually does the writing of an instrument will presumably be guided by his own interests and goals in the transaction.he may choose shadings of expression,words more specific or more imprecise,according to the dictates of these interests.no doubt but the other party,if commercially sophisticated and represented by counsel,will insist on clarification.indiana has yet to take a stand on the exception,though the only case from indiana that we can find which bears on it,nationwide mutual ins.neville,leans in favor of rejecting it.no matter am does not need the rule in order to prevail.we add that the rule is in practice a makeweight rather than a tie breaker.
beanstalk set about obtaining agreements for the licensing of the hummer trademark.in,however,two years into the representation agreement with beanstalk,am general entered into a agreement with general motors under which gm would design and engineer a new version of the hummer,would make an loan of million to am general for the construction of a factory to manufacture the new version,would promise to buy a minimum number of the new vehicles,would obtain an option to buy up to percent of am general common would acquire the hummer trademark.gm informed beanstalk that it had not assumed any of am general obligations under the representation agreement and that it would not compensate beanstalk for any license agreements made or renewed after the effective date of the agreement.
beanstalk argues that the agreement between am general and gm,although of course not labeled a license agreement,was one because it transferred the hummer trademark to gm and thus was an agreement or arrangement,whether in the form of a license or otherwise,granting merchandising or other rights in the property for the transfer gave gm the right,indeed the exclusive right,to merchandise the hummer trademark,that is,the property.the contract thus is clear,beanstalk joint venture was an agreement that grant ed gm merchandising rights in the hummer trademark and it did not have to be in the form of a license because the representation agreement says in the form of a license or otherwise and under accepted principles of contract law we should look no further.beanstalk wants percent of so much of the consideration running from gm to am general as represents the value of the hummer trademark.we do not know what the consideration was,or what that value is,because no evidence has been fact,the agreement is not even in the record,though the sketch we have just given of its terms is not contested.
beanstalk is correct that written contracts are usually enforced in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the language used in them and without recourse to evidence,beyond the contract itself,as to what the parties meant.this presumption simplifies the litigation of contract disputes and,more important,protects contracting parties against being blindsided by evidence intended to contradict the deal that they thought they had graven in stone by using clear language.it is a strong presumption,motivated by an understandable distrust in the accuracy of litigation to reconstruct contracting parties intentions,but it is by two principles of contract interpretation that are closely related in the setting of this suit.the first is that a contract will not be interpreted literally if doing so would produce absurd results,in the sense of results that the parties,presumed to be rational persons pursuing rational ends,are very unlikely to have agreed to seek.usa life one ins.of indiana nuckolls,haworth hubbard,merheb illinois state toll highway authority,cir funeral financial systems united states,cir grun pneumo abex,cir catalina enterprises.pension trust hartford fire ins,cir.
this is an interpretive principle,not a species of paternalism.the letters between plaintiff and defendant were from one merchant to another.they are to be read as businessmen would read them,and only as a last resort are to be thrown out altogether as meaningless futilities if literalness is sheer absurdity,we are to seek some other meaning whereby reason will be instilled and absurdity avoided.outlet embroidery derwent mills,cardozo.there is a long tradition in contract law of reading contracts sensibly business contracts of the kind involved not parlor games but the means of getting the world work done true,parties can contract for preposterous terms.if contract language is crystal clear or there is independent extrinsic evidence that something silly was actually intended,a party may be held to its bargain,absent some specialized defense.rhode island charities trust engelhard,cir see also dispatch automation,richards,cir.the second principle is that a contract must be interpreted as a whole.freigy gargaro,harseim booth,allstate ins.hammond,united states schilling,cir lasalle national trust,ecm motor,cir louis joliet bank trust,cir catalina enterprises.pension trust hartford fire ins,supra,at.sentences are not isolated units of meaning,but take meaning from other sentences in the same document.
the second principle thus is linguistic the first reflects the fact that interpretation is a cultural as well as a linguistic undertaking.to interpret a contract or other document,it is not enough to have a command of the grammar,syntax,and vocabulary of the language in which the document is written.one must know something about the practical as well as the purely verbal context of the language to be interpreted.in the case of a commercial contract,one must have a general acquaintance with commercial practices.this does mean that judges should have an or have practiced corporate or commercial law,but merely that they be alert citizens of a society so that they can recognize absurdity in a business context.a blinkered literalism,a closing of one eyes to the obvious,can produce nonsensical results,as this case illustrates.beanstalk is in the business of merchandising trademarks.if,while the representation agreement was in effect,a toy company wanted to make a toy hummer,beanstalk was authorized to grant the toy company a license in exchange for a fee that it would split with am general.the agreement was not that kind of arrangement.it was not an arrangement for the promotion of am general trademark.by the agreement creating the joint venture,am general essentially transferred the hummer business to general motors,retaining a role limited to manufacturing,in a factory built with gm money,a vehicle designed by,engineered by,and to be marketed by that is the significance of the transfer of the trademark gm.quite apart from the option that gm also received to buy a large,doubtless controlling interest in am general,it as if am general had sold its entire business,including its manufacturing assets and all its trademarks,to gm.
beanstalk is not a business broker.it had nothing to do with the joint venture and indeed did even know about it until after it took place.the parties could hardly have intended that beanstalk should get a commission if am general decided,as in effect it did,to get out of the hummer business.a business would not contract to pay an agent for work that the agent did not do but that the business did itself.beanstalk and am general must have known when they signed the representation agreement that if am general ever sold its hummer business,the trademark would go with it,as the purchaser would need it in order to identify the product,while am general would no longer have any need or use for it.indeed,am general would have nothing to attach the trademark a trademark is an identifier,not a freestanding piece of intellectual property hence the rule that a trademark can not be sold in gross,that is,without the assets that create the product that it identifies.united drug theodore rectanus.in re cult awareness network,cir green river bottling green river,cir sands,taylor wood quaker oats,cir beauty time,vu skin systems,cir.the parties would hardly have intended beanstalk to obtain a commission on the sale of the business merely because the sale would inevitably include the trademark.and they would not have wanted to burden the sale with the added cost of allocating the purchase price between the trademark and the other assets involved in the sale,as beanstalk claims they must do in order to compute the commission to which it is entitled on the joint venture.such allocations may be required for tax purposes.see thrifticheck service commissioner,cir friendly.we are not told whether that was the case with the am joint venture.
the unreasonableness of beanstalk position can be seen most clearly by imagining that the joint venture had taken place the day after the representation agreement between beanstalk and am general went into effect.then on beanstalk interpretation it would be entitled to percent of the entire value of the hummer trademark even though it had made absolutely no contribution to that value.that makes no sense it is apparent that the definition of license agreement in the representation agreement covers any agreement that has the function or character of a trademark licensing agreement even if the word license or a cognate term does not appear the sale of a business is an agreement of an entirely different character.the issue of whether a transfer of the use of a trademark is a sale or a license for tax purposes is a thorny one,and has not always been consistently solved in the courts.the basic problem is to determine the extent to which the transferor retains proprietary rights in the transferred asset.if the transferor retains sufficient proprietary rights,the transfer must be considered a license rather than a sale we do not suggest that the nomenclature used in the contract should be finally determinative of the distinction between a license and a sale.consolidated foods united states,cir.indeed not.
beanstalk ignores relevant provisions of the contract,one of which engages beanstalk to be am general sole and exclusive representative,implying that am general employees can negotiate license agreements without going through beanstalk.beanstalk agrees with this interpretation,as it must there is no possible ambiguity,but claims that even when an employee of am general negotiates such an agreement with no involvement by beanstalk,beanstalk is entitled to percent of the revenues that am general obtains under the agreement.no reason is given why am general would compensate beanstalk for services rendered wholly by am general own employees,whom it must compensate.that would be paying double for the same service.
further ignored are the provisions keying beanstalk commissions to gross receipts received obviously by beanstalk on owner that is,am general behalf and requiring beanstalk to account to am general periodically for the gross receipts of the license agreements.this implies that beanstalk would receive receipts only for license agreements that it negotiated.the implication is reinforced by the fact that the representation agreement contains no provision for compensating beanstalk out of receipts received directly by am general,for example under a license agreement negotiated by an employee of am general.
beanstalk goes so far as to argue that,whoever negotiates the license agreement,the receipts generated by it must be paid in the first instance to beanstalk to enable it to take its percent cut off the top.beanstalk thus is arguing that not percent but percent of the consideration that gm paid am general for the agreement that represented the value of the hummer trademark had to be paid to beanstalk.beanstalk argument amounts to saying that if chrysler hired it to license the chrysler trademarks and then sold its entire automobile business to daimler for billion,beanstalk would be entitled to an immediate cash receipt of billion,from which it would deduct percent of the value of the chrysler trademarks and then remit the balance to chrysler.absurd.
against all this it might be argued that to disregard a contractual term,whether on the basis that interpreting it literally would yield absurd results or that other terms in the contract alter the disputed term apparent meaning,requires evidence and thus can not be done on a motion to dismiss.not so.for when we said earlier that the interpretation of a contract is a cultural as well as a linguistic undertaking,we did not add that the materials of interpretation are limited to literal meanings on the one hand and evidence on the other.the cultural background that a judge brings to the decision of a contract case includes as we said a general knowledge of how the world operates,including the commercial world,and this knowledge,precisely because it is general rather than being knowledge of the specific facts of the case adjudicative facts,can show that the literal interpretation of a particular contractual term would be unsound,in which event no evidence need be taken.unelko prestone products,cir.
it would be different if beanstalk,instead of standing on the literal terms of the representation agreement on quicksand,in other to present evidence to show that the agreement means what it says it means.the only evidence it wants to present is that before selling the hummer business to gm,am general approached beanstalk and asked for an express exclusion from the representation agreement of any agreement for the purpose of producing motor vehicles even if such an agreement inc
