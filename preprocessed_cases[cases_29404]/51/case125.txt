the lanham act,provides that a dissatisfied trademark applicant may seek review of an adverse ruling on his trademark application either by appealing the ruling to the court of appeals for the federal circuit,id.a,or by commencing a de novo action in a federal district court,id.b.if he elects to proceed in a district court and no adverse party opposed his application before the patent and trademark office pto,the applicant must name the director of the pto as a defendant and pay all the expenses of the proceeding,whether he succeeds in the action or not,unless the expenses are unreasonable.id.b emphasis added.
in this case,milo shammas,a dissatisfied applicant in an ex parte trademark proceeding,elected to commence a de novo action in the district court.at the end of the proceeding,the director of the pto sought all the expenses of the proceeding from shammas,including salary expenses of the pto attorneys and a paralegal who were required to defend the director.the district court granted the director request and ordered shammas to pay the pto a total of in expenses.
on appeal,shammas argues that the district court erred in shifting the pto attorneys fees to him,contrary to the american rule under which each party bears his own attorneys fees,because the governing statute does not expressly provide for the shifting of attorneys fees.
we reject this argument and affirm,concluding that the imposition of all expenses on a plaintiff in an ex parte proceeding,regardless of whether he wins or loses,does not constitute that implicates the american rule but rather an unconditional compensatory charge imposed on a dissatisfied applicant who elects to engage the pto in a district court proceeding.and we conclude that this compensatory charge encompasses the pto salary expenses for the attorneys and paralegals who represent the director.
in june,shammas filed a federal trademark application for the mark probiotic for use in connection with fertilizer products manufactured by his company,earth.in an ex parte proceeding,a trademark examining attorney for the pto denied shammas application on the ground that the term was generic and descriptive.the trademark trial and appeal board affirmed.
rather than appeal the adverse ruling to the federal circuit,as allowed by a,shammas elected to commence this de novo civil action against the pto in the district court,pursuant to b.the district court granted the pto motion for summary judgment by order dated october,holding that shammas had failed to cast doubt on the finding that probiotic was a generic term.
at the conclusion of the proceeding,the pto filed a motion,pursuant to b,for reimbursement of in expenses that it had incurred in the proceeding,including the prorated salaries of two attorneys,in the amount of,and one paralegal,in the amount of.the pto calculated these sums by dividing the employees annual salaries by hours and multiplying the results by the number of hours expended by the employees in defending the action,a total of hours in this case.the pto also claimed for photocopying expenses.
shammas opposed the motion,arguing that the pto was in essence seeking attorneys fees and that b did not,in authorizing the recovery of all expenses of the proceeding,explicitly provide for the shifting of attorneys fees as,he argued,would be required to overcome the american rule.
following a hearing,the district court granted the pto motion in its entirety.it reasoned 
t he plain meaning of the term expenses,by itself,would clearly seem to include attorney fees.but if any doubt remains about that inclusion,it is removed by congress addition of the word all to clarify the breadth of the term expenses.when the word expenses is prefaced with the word all,it is pellucidly clear congress intended that the plaintiff in such an action pay for all the resources expended by the pto during the litigation,including attorney fees.
shammas focarino,d.
from the district court order,dated january,shammas filed this appeal,challenging the district court authority to award attorneys fees and paralegals fees under b.
section b provides in relevant part,in any case where there is no adverse party,all the expenses of the proceeding shall be paid by the party bringing the case,whether the final decision is in favor of such party or not.
while shammas acknowledges that expenses is a sufficiently broad term that,in ordinary parlance,includes attorneys fees,he argues that in the context of the american rule,that the prevailing party may not recover attorneys fees as costs or otherwise,alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d the statute is not sufficiently clear to reverse the presumption created by that rule.he argues that a district court may not read a federal statute to authorize unless the statute makes congress intention clear by expressly referring to attorney fees.emphasis added.
we agree with shammas that,in ordinary parlance,expenses is sufficiently broad to include attorneys fees and paralegals fees.see american heritage dictionary ed defining expense as s omething spent to attain a goal or accomplish a purpose,such as an expense of time and energy on a project black law dictionary ed defining expense as a n expenditure of money,time,labor,or resources to accomplish a result accord ex rel.smith gilbert realty,d,noting that a legal fee would certainly seem to be an expense which a person incurs in bringing an action under the plain meaning of that phrase.moreover,in this statute,congress modified the term expenses with the term all,clearly indicating that the common meaning of the term expenses should not be limited.and even though the pto attorneys in this case were salaried,we conclude that the pto nonetheless incurred expenses when its attorneys were required to defend the director in the district court proceedings,because their engagement diverted the pto resources from other endeavors.see wisconsin hotline,cir s alaried government lawyers do incur expenses if the time and resources they devote to one case are not available for other work emphasis added.
shammas argument in this case depends on the assumption that if b were to be construed to include attorneys fees,it would constitute a statute that would need to refer explicitly to attorneys fees in order to overcome the presumption of the american rule.this assumption,however,is misplaced under the circumstances of this case.
to be sure,where the american rule applies,congress may displace it only by expressing its intent to do so clearly and directly.in re crescent city estates,cir.but the american rule provides only that the prevailing party may not recover attorneys fees from the losing party.alyeska pipeline,at emphasis added see also,buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human,d t he prevailing party is not entitled to collect attorneys fees from the loser associated coal fed.mine safety health review comm n,cir similar.the requirement that congress speak with heightened clarity to overcome the presumption of the american rule thus applies only where the award of attorneys fees turns on whether a party seeking fees has prevailed to at least some degree.as the supreme court has explained,
w hen congress has chosen to depart from the american rule by statute,virtually every one of the more than existing federal provisions predicates fee awards on some success by the claimant while these statutes contain varying standards as to the precise degree of success necessary for an award of fees,the consistent rule is that complete failure will not justify shifting fees 
ruckelshaus sierra club,d emphasis added see also.highlands conservancy,norton,cir requiring some degree of success,even though the statute authorized courts to award fees whenever they deemed it appropriate.thus,a statute that mandates the payment of attorneys fees without regard to a party success is not a statute that operates against the backdrop of the american rule.
with that understanding of the american rule,it becomes clear that b is not a statute that purports to rebut the presumption of the rule.rather than imposing expenses based on whether the pto prevails,b imposes the expenses of the proceeding on the ex parte plaintiff,whether the final decision is in favor of such party or not.emphasis added.thus,even if shammas had prevailed in the district court,he still would have had to pay all of the pto expenses.because the pto is entitled to recover its expenses even when it completely fails,b need not be interpreted against the backdrop of the american rule.therefore,even assuming that a statute must explicitly provide for the shifting of attorneys fees to overcome the presumption of the american rule,that requirement is not applicable here.
since b does not implicate the presumption of the american rule,shammas argument that the term expenses must explicitly include attorneys fees fails,and we are therefore left with giving the phrase all the expenses of the proceeding its ordinary meaning without regard to the american rule.construing the plain language of b,we conclude that an ex parte litigant who elects to initiate a de novo proceeding in the district court must pay all reasonable expenses of the proceeding,including attorneys fees,whether he wins or loses.
as an alternative argument,shammas contends that expenses of the proceeding,taken in context,should most naturally be read as synonymous with costs of the proceeding that is,taxable costs and that the term taxable costs is a legal term of art that does not include attorneys fees.he provides no explanation,however,for why we should replace the statutory words all the expenses with the words taxable costs.
moreover,we rejected this argument in the context of nearly identical statutory language requiring a dissatisfied patent applicant who opts to challenge the denial of his patent application in an ex parte proceeding in a district court to pay all the expenses of the proceeding.see robertson cooper,cir permitting recovery of a government attorney expenses associated with attending a deposition.in robertson,we reversed the district court holding that the word expenses in the statute practically meant costs,concluding instead that t he evident intention of congress in the use of the word expenses was to include more than that which is ordinarily included in the word costs.see also taniguchi kan pac.saipan,d taxable costs are limited to relatively minor,incidental expenses taxable costs are a fraction of the nontaxable expenses borne by litigants for attorneys,experts,consultants,and investigators.arlington cent.sch.dist.bd.of educ.murphy,d the use of costs,rather than a term such as expenses,strongly suggests that i b was not meant to be an provision that makes participating states liable for all expenses incurred.
apart from the linguistic distinction between expenses and costs,the use of both terms in b also suggests that they were not intended to be read synonymously.in the sentence immediately following the all the expenses language,b provides that the administrative record shall be admitted on motion of any party,upon such terms and conditions as to costs,expenses,and the further of the witnesses as the court imposes.emphasis added.in light of the cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,trw andrews,d quoting duncan walker,d,and the normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning,sullivan stroop,d quoting sorenson sec y of treasury,d internal quotation marks omitted,we conclude that congress did not intend for expenses to be interchangeable and coextensive with costs.
our reading that b imposes a unilateral,compensatory fee,including attorneys fees,on every ex parte applicant who elects to engage the resources of the pto when pursuing a de novo action in the district court,whether the applicant wins or loses,is confirmed by the lanham act structure and legislative history.
under the statutory scheme,a trademark applicant may appeal a trademark examiner final decision denying registration of a mark to the trademark trial and appeal board.see.thereafter,a dissatisfied applicant is given two choices for proceeding further.he can appeal the decision directly to the federal circuit,pursuant to a,or he can commence a de novo civil action in a federal district court,pursuant to b.should he choose the former,the appeal is taken on the record before the pto,id.a,and the court will uphold the pto factual findings unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence,see,recot,becton.should he choose instead to commence an action in a district court,not only is the record of the pto admissible into evidence on the motion of either party,but the parties may also conduct discovery and submit further testimony and other new evidence.b swatch ag beehive wholesale,llc,cir.the district court reviews all the evidence de novo and acts as the trier of fact.see swatch,at.moreover,collateral issues,such as claims for infringement and unfair competition,may be presented and decided as authorized by the federal rules of civil procedure.id.
de novo civil actions under b thus contemplate a more fulsome and expensive procedure.since the statute requires an ex parte applicant to name the pto as a party defendant to such a proceeding,the pto is required to expend substantially greater time and effort and incur substantially greater expense than it would otherwise in an appeal to the federal circuit.by requiring the dissatisfied applicant to pay all the expenses of the proceeding,whether the applicant wins or loses,congress obviously intended to reduce the financial burden on the pto in defending such a proceeding.in light of this purpose,it makes good sense to construe expenses to include attorneys fees and paralegals fees because the time that pto employees spend in defending the director will constitute the majority of the pto expenses in such a this case,over of its expenses.of course,if the dissatisfied applicant does not wish to pay the expenses of a de novo civil action,he may appeal the adverse decision of the pto to the federal circuit.
shammas argues that because defending decisions in federal court is part of the ordinary duty of any administrative agency,awarding personnel expenses to the pto would impose a burden unlike anything else in the law.but this argument fails to recognize that agencies tasked with defending their actions in federal court are ordinarily able to limit the record in court to the agency record and to have their factfinding reviewed deferentially.see,corey sec y,dep t of housing urban dev.ex rel.walter,cir pursuant to the administrative procedures act,federal courts can overturn an administrative agency decision if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,otherwise not in accordance with the law,or unsupported by substantial evidence omissions in original quoting knox dep t of labor,cir trinity am.envtl.prot.agency,cir review of agency action is limited to the administrative record before the agency when it makes its decision.to be sure,it is relatively rare for statutes to allow aggrieved persons to choose between parallel proceedings to challenge agency action.but see,granting aggrieved taxpayers a similar choice of forum.but regardless of its obscurity,b plainly incentivizes trademark applicants to appeal routine trademark denials to the federal circuit.hyatt kappos,en banc noting that congress imposed on the applicant the heavy economic burden of paying a ll the expenses of the proceedings regardless of the outcome under the parallel patent provision in order to deter applicants from procedural gaming alteration in original,aff and remanded,d.
our reading of b is further supported by the statute legislative history,which indicates that b was intended as a straightforward funding provision,designed to relieve the pto of the financial burden that results from an applicant election to pursue the more expensive district court litigation.the all the expenses provision for trademark cases was adopted from a parallel provision in title addressing patents,which in turn is rooted in an amendment to the patent act of the act.the act established a fund for the paymen
