defendant michael kremer was dissatisfied with the hair restoration services provided to him by the bosley medical institute.in a effort to get even,kremer started a website at,which,to put it mildly,was uncomplimentary of the bosley medical institute.the problem is that bosley medical is the registered trademark of the bosley medical institute,which brought suit against kremer for trademark infringement and like claims.kremer argues that noncommercial use of the mark is not actionable as infringement under the lanham act.bosley responds that kremer is splitting hairs.
like the district court,we agree with kremer.we hold today that the noncommercial use of a trademark as the domain name of a subject of which is consumer commentary about the products and services represented by the not constitute infringement under the lanham act.
bosley medical cybersquatting claim is another matter.the issue under the anticybersquatting consumer protection act was whether kremer had a bad faith intent to profit from the use of the trademark in his domain name,such as by making an extortionate offer to sell the site to bosley.because discovery regarding that claim had not been completed,and the issue itself was not within the scope of the summary judgment motions,the district court erred in granting summary judgment to kremer as to cybersquatting.
finally,we hold that the district court should not have granted kremer motion to strike bosley medical claims pursuant to the california statute.bosley medical complaint about the unauthorized use of its trademark as kremer domain name was not so lacking in merit as to be susceptible to an motion to strike at an early stage of the case.
background 
bosley medical provides surgical hair transplantation,restoration,and replacement services to the public.bosley medical owns the registered trademark bosley medical,has used the mark bosley medical since,and registered the mark with the united states patent and trademark office in january.bosley has spent millions of dollars on advertising and promotion throughout the united states and the rest of the world.
michael kremer is a dissatisfied former patient of bosley.unhappy with the results of a hair replacement procedure performed by a bosley physician in seattle,washington,he filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against bosley medical in.that suit was eventually dismissed.
in january,kremer purchased the domain name,the subject of this appeal,as well as the domain name,which is not challenged by bosley.five days after registering the domain name,kremer went to bosley medical office in beverly hills,california and delivered a letter to bosley,founder and president of bosley medical.the first page read

kremer began to use in.his site summarizes the los angeles county district attorney investigative findings about bosley,and allows visitors to view the entire document.it also contains other information that is highly critical of bosley.kremer earns no revenue from the website and no goods or services are sold on the website.there are no links to any of bosley competitors websites.does link to kremer sister site,which links to a newsgroup entitled,which in turn contains advertisements for companies that compete with bosley.also contained a link to the public citizen website.public citizen is the organization that represents kremer in this case.
bosley brought this suit alleging trademark infringement,dilution,unfair competition,various state law claims,and a libel claim that was eventually settled.bosley sought to take discovery aimed at the trademark and libel claims.the magistrate judge granted limited discovery on the libel claims.following discovery,bosley dismissed the libel claims and amended the complaint.
kremer moved to dismiss the first amended complaint and in addition moved for partial summary judgment on the issues of commercial use and likelihood of confusion.bosley filed a for partial summary judgment on the infringement and dilution claims.kremer agreed that the facts were undisputed with regard to the issues of commercial use and likelihood of confusion,and that these issues were ripe for summary judgment.
ruling that kremer use of bosley medical in the domain name was noncommercial and unlikely to cause confusion,the district court entered summary judgment for kremer on the federal claims and dismissed the state law claims under california statute.bosley now appeals.

iii.analysis 
trademark infringement and dilution claims 
the trademark act of lanham act prohibits uses of trademarks,trade names,and trade dress that are likely to cause confusion about the source of a product or service.see,a.in,congress amended of the lanham act to provide a remedy for the dilution of a famous mark.see c.
infringement claims are subject to a commercial use requirement.the infringement section of the lanham act,states that any person who use s in commerce any reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive can be held liable for such use.a.
in,congress expanded the scope of federal trademark law when it enacted the federal trademark dilution act ftda.the ftda allows the owner of a famous mark to obtain an injunction against another person commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name c emphasis added.while the meaning of the term commercial use in commerce is not entirely clear,we have interpreted the language to be roughly analogous to the in connection with sale of goods and services requirement of the infringement statute.see mattel,mca records,cir although this statutory language is ungainly,its meaning seems clear it refers to a use of a famous and distinctive mark to sell goods other than those produced or authorized by the mark owner.see also huthwaite,sunrise assisted living,d,holding that the commercial use requirement of the ftda is virtually synonymous with the in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of goods and services requirement of the lanham act.
the inclusion of these requirements in the lanham act serves the act purpose to secure to the owner of the mark the goodwill of his business and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish among competing producers.two pesos,taco cabana,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in other words,the act is designed to protect consumers who have formed particular associations with a mark from buying a competing product using the same or substantially similar mark and to allow the mark holder to distinguish his product from that of his rivals.see avery dennison sumpton,cir.
the supreme court has made it clear that trademark infringement law prevents only unauthorized uses of a trademark in connection with a commercial transaction in which the trademark is being used to confuse potential consumers.see prestonettes,coty.a only gives the right to prohibit the use of it so far as to protect the owner good will against the sale of another product as his.emphasis added see also mishawaka rubber woolen kresge.explaining that the main purpose of the lanham act is to prevent the use of identical or similar marks in a way that confuses the public about the actual source of goods and services.
as the second circuit held,t he lanham act seeks to prevent consumer confusion that enables a seller to pass off his goods as the goods of another t rademark infringement protects only against mistaken purchasing decisions and not against confusion generally.lang ret.living publ g,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted emphasis added.
as a matter of first amendment law,commercial speech may be regulated in ways that would be impermissible if the same regulation were applied to noncommercial expressions.florida bar went for it,d.the first amendment may offer little protection for a competitor who labels its commercial good with a confusingly similar mark,but trademark rights do not entitle the owner to quash an unauthorized use of the mark by another who is communicating ideas or expressing points of view.mattel,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the district court ruled that kremer use of bosley mark was noncommercial.to reach that conclusion,the court focused on the use in commerce language rather than the use in connection with the sale of goods clause.this approach is erroneous.use in commerce is simply a jurisdictional predicate to any law passed by congress under the commerce clause.see steele bulova watch.obh,spotlight magazine,d.states that unless the contrary is plainly apparent from the context t he word commerce means all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by congress.therefore,the district court should have determined instead whether kremer use was in connection with a sale of goods or services rather than a use in commerce.however,we can affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on any ground supported by the record.lamps plus,seattle lighting fixture,cir.the question before us,then,boils down to whether kremer use of bosley medical as his domain name was in connection with a sale of goods or services.if it was not,then kremer use was noncommercial and did not violate the lanham act.
bosley argues that it has met the commercial use requirement in three ways.first,it argues that a mark used in an otherwise noncommercial website or as a domain name for an otherwise noncommercial website is nonetheless used in connection with goods and services where a user can click on a link available on that website to reach a commercial site.nissan motor nissan computer,cir.however,bosley reliance on nissan is unfounded.
in nissan,nissan motor company sued nissan computer corporation for using the internet websites and.id.at.in nissan,however,commercial use was undisputed,as the core function of the defendant website was to advertise his computer business.id.additionally,the defendant in nissan,like the defendant in taubman webfeats,cir,placed links to other commercial businesses directly on their website.at.kremer website contains no commercial links,but rather contains links to a discussion group,which in turn contains advertising.this roundabout path to the advertising of others is too attenuated to render kremer site commercial.at no time did kremer site offer for sale any product or service or contain paid advertisements from any other commercial entity.see tmi,maxwell,cir holding that the commercial use requirement is not satisfied where defendant site had no outside links.
bosley also points out that kremer site contained a link to public citizen,the public interest group representing kremer throughout this litigation.we hold that kremer identification of his lawyers and his provision of a link to same did not transform his noncommercial site into a commercial one.
bosley second argument that kremer website satisfies the in connection with the sale of goods or services requirement of the lanham act is that kremer created his website to enable an extortion scheme in an attempt to profit from registering.in panavision international,toeppen,cir,this court held that a defendant commercial use was his attempt to sell the trademarks themselves.id.at.similarly,in intermatic toeppen,the court found that toeppen intention to arbitrage the domain name constitute d a commercial use.id.at see also boston prof l hockey ass n,dallas cap emblem,cir holding that trademark law protects the trademark itself,despite the fact that only a reproduction of the trademark itself is being sold,unattached to any other goods or services.
however,in this case,there is no evidence that kremer was trying to sell the domain name itself.the letter delivered by kremer to bosley headquarters is a threat to expose negative information about bosley on the internet,but it makes no reference whatsoever to ransoming bosley trademark or to kremer use of the mark as a domain name.
bosley argues that it was denied an opportunity to pursue discovery on commercial use,and had it been allowed to proceed with discovery,it could further establish that kremer has attempted to sell the domain name.however,in opposing kremer motion for summary judgment,bosley did not make any such objections.bosley failed to request further discovery under federal rule of civil procedure f,but instead moved for summary judgment itself.although bosley reply brief supporting its own motion for summary judgment complained about limited discovery in a footnote,bosley did not move for leave to take discovery.the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the summary judgment without permitting further discovery.
bosley third and final argument that it satisfied the commercial use requirement of the lanham act is that kremer use of bosley trademark was in connection with bosley goods and services.in other words,kremer used the mark in connection with goods and services because he prevented users from obtaining the plaintiff goods and services.see people for the ethical treatment of animals doughney,cir peta.in peta,defendants created a site that promoted ideas antithetical to those of the peta group.id.at.the fourth circuit held that the defendant parody site,though not having a commercial purpose and not selling any goods or services,violated the lanham act because it prevented users from obtaining or using peta goods or services.id.at.
however,in peta,the defendant website provide d links to more than commercial operations offering goods and services.id.at.to the extent that the peta court held that the lanham act commercial use requirement is satisfied because the defendant use of the plaintiff mark as the domain name may deter customers from reaching the plaintiff site itself,we respectfully disagree with that rationale.while it is true that is not sponsored by bosley medical,it is just as true that it is about bosley medical.the peta approach would place most critical,otherwise protected consumer commentary under the restrictions of the lanham act.other courts have also rejected this theory as.see bean,drake publishers,cir see also ford motor,d.
the peta court reading of the lanham act would encompass almost all uses of a registered trademark,even when the mark is merely being used to identify the object of consumer criticism this broad view of the lanham act is supported by neither the text of the statute nor the history of trademark laws in this country.t rademark laws are intended to protect consumers from purchasing the products of an infringer under the mistaken assumption that they are buying a product produced or sponsored by the trademark holder.beneficial beneficial capital.limiting the lanham act to cases where a defendant is trying to profit from a plaintiff trademark is consistent with the supreme court view that a trademark function is simply to designate the goods as the product of a particular trader and to protect his good will against the sale of another product as his.united drug theodore rectanus.see also mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.
the second circuit held in united we stand america,united we stand,america new york,cir,that the use in connection with the sale of goods and services requirement of the lanham act does not require any actual sale of goods and services.thus,the appropriate inquir
