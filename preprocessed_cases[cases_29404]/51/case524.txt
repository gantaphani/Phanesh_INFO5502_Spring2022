background 
skf usa,is a manufacturer of ball bearings located in the united states.it produces bearings in the united states and also imports bearings that are manufactured abroad by skf manufacturing units.skf usa and skf manufacturing units are owned by the same parent company,ab skf,a swedish corporation.
skf usa sells bearings at all levels of the market,both directly to large original equipment manufacturers and to end users.it sells its products through a network of authorized distributors,as well as to some nonauthorized distributors,distributors to which skf usa sells but with whom skf usa does not have an industrial distributor agreement.such nonauthorized goods,made by an skf entity,but not sold or authorized for sale in the united states,are often known as gray market goods or simply gray goods.additionally,skf usa itself imports bearings distributed by its foreign manufacturing units,and skf usa authorized distributors have themselves purchased gray market bearings,including some from companies that were respondents in the commission investigation.
in april,skf usa filed a complaint at the commission against fourteen respondents,alleging they violated by infringement of various registered trademarks in violation of section of the lanham act,a infringement of common law trademarks false representation of source in violation of section a a of the lanham act,a a dilution of registered and common law trademarks in violation of section c,c and false advertising in violation of section a b of the lanham act,a b.
in april,an administrative law judge alj issued an initial determination,finding that four of the bearing and transmission service,cst bearing company,bearings limited,and mcguire bearings violated by infringement of skf usa registered and common law trademarks and making a false designation of source.in re certain bearings packaging thereof,inv.int l trade comm,initial determination.the alj applied the material differences test set forth in gamut trading international trade commission,and found that there were no physical material differences between the bearings that skf usa sold or authorized for sale and those bearings that were imported and sold by the respondents.however,the alj determined that this court has not expressly required that material differences be physical in nature.instead,he determined that the existence and extent of technical and engineering services may constitute material differences in terms of trademark liability despite not being physical characteristics,consistent with the test set forth in gamut.initial determination,slip op.at.
skf usa employs a number of industry specialists,engineers who have expertise in equipment used in particular fields,to provide technical and engineering assistance to its customers,slip op.at.those services consist of services and hotline support.its specialists receive extensive and training each year,and they perform such tasks as troubleshooting,technical support,installation supervision,and end user training.id.the alj found that skf usa will provide customer support to customers who buy skf bearings from skf usa authorized distributors regardless of where the skf bearings came from,slip op.at.he determined that even if skf bearings came from the gray market,skf usa will provide customer service support.id.the alj also found that skf usa provided hotline support as another method of customer service.he heard testimony that skf usa,through its hotline,dealt with such problems as maintenance,installation,and lubrication of its products,slip op.at.he determined that skf usa took reasonable steps to prevent purchasers of skf bearings from nonauthorized sources from using its hotline services.id.
the alj determined that the skf usa bearings and the gray market bearings differed materially in the technical services offered with them,particularly services and hotline support.because skf usa presented evidence that customers would likely be confused as to the degree of technical and engineering services to which they were entitled,and because the evidence of record was devoid of comparable services by respondents,slip op.at,the alj found that there was a likelihood of confusion and therefore a violation of section,slip op.at.the alj thus held that the four respondent companies violated by infringing skf usa registered and common law trademarks and by falsely designating the origin of the ball bearings.the alj,however,determined that skf usa had not carried its burden of proving false advertising or trademark dilution,slip op.at.
thereafter,skf usa,the four respondents,and the commission investigative attorney filed a joint petition for review by the full commission,each contesting various aspects of the alj initial determination.upon review,however,the commission determined that additional information was needed and remanded the case for further in august.specifically,the commission requested information relating to skf usa sales through alternate channels of distribution,including sales on the surplus market and the vehicle service market,and the warranties,product recall procedures,and technical services passed on to the end user relating to those sales.the alj completed that additional fact finding in december,and the case was returned to the full commission in january.
in may,the commission issued its final decision reversing the alj initial decision.first,it agreed with the alj that the question whether material differences can be found in a gray market case based solely on nonphysical differences is a matter of first impression for the commission and an issue not yet specifically addressed by this court.the commission further noted that this court did not hold in gamut that a material difference must be a physical one in order to show gray market trademark infringement,and it declined to create a per se rule that material differences must be physical in nature.final determination,slip op.at.
the commission concluded that the services did not accompany certain of skf usa sales,including alternate channels of distribution consisting of sales chicago rawhide,skf usa business unit relating to the vehicle service market,roller bearing bearing company,gray market distributors,the surplus market,and nonauthorized distributors to end users,slip op.at.sales from these alternate channels of distribution amounted to of skf usa total bearing sales,slip op.at.despite the undisputed of skf usa bearing sales to authorized distributors that were supported by services,the commission determined that the of skf usa bearing sales was sufficient to defeat skf usa argument that the material difference accompanied all or substantially all of its marked bearings.
the commission considered skf usa assertion that a trademark owner to its policies or practices with respect to some of its sales does not defeat a claim of infringement if those sales are insignificant,slip op.at.skf usa argued that in northside development,cir,a preliminary injunction was granted even though of the plaintiff cough drops were found to be nonconforming goods,they did not comply with the freshness date standard that was alleged to have been violated by the infringing goods.however,the commission rejected skf usa argument that held that certain of a trademark owner nonconforming goods may be ignored if they are of de minimis amounts.instead,the commission stated that that case stood for the proposition that,in order to be entitled to relief against a later seller of nonconforming goods,a trademark holder who sells nonconforming goods must show that the later sales measurably diminish the value of an already partially devalued mark.final determination,slip op.at.the commission held that skf usa could not prevail under because skf usa failed to prove that its trademark had been further devalued by the respondents sales,slip op.at.
the commission agreed with the respondents that a trademark owner must show that all or substantially all of its marked goods are accompanied by the characteristic that is alleged to be a material difference.it relied on the fifth circuit decision in martin herend imports,diamond gem trading usa,cir,which held that a trademark owner could not prevent a gray market importer from importing and selling goods of the same quality from the same product line of trademarked porcelain pieces that previously had been imported,offered for sale,or sold by the trademark holder.the commission held that if skf usa had sold or authorized for sale bearings to which services did not predictably and consistently attach,those services can not be considered integral to the goods and can not constitute the basis for finding a material difference.final determination,slip op.at.
the commission examined the alj review of the alleged material difference between skf usa technical and engineering support of the domestic and the gray market goods.it disagreed with the alj decision to limit his analysis of the material differences to bearings sold through authorized channels of distribution and found that the alj broad findings regarding provision of support to end users were not supported by the record.instead,it also considered skf usa sales through the alternate channels of distribution,nonauthorized distributors,gray market distributors,the surplus market,and sales by roller bearing bearing company,a licensee of skf usa.the commission determined that skf usa chose to distribute through authorized and nonauthorized distributors in order to maximize its bearing sales and that by doing so,skf usa undermined its own quality control and failed to provide the same level of service to bearings sold through alternate channels,slip op.at.it also discounted skf usa hotline services as constituting a material difference in the bearings because the evidence showed that consumers in alternate channels faced severe difficulty in obtaining skf usa services,slip op.at.the commission thus concluded that skf usa bearings did not differ materially from respondents bearings because skf usa has authorized the sale of bearings that are not predictably and consistently accompanied by technical and engineering services.id.accordingly,the commission reversed the alj decision and held that the respondent companies had not infringed skf usa trademark and violated.skf usa appeals we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

pursuant to the administrative procedure act,we review the factual findings of the commission under the substantial evidence standard.see c e.we thus will not overturn the commission factual findings if they are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.finnigan int l trade comm n,quoting surface,int l trade comm n.we review the commission legal determinations de novo.see a checkpoint int l trade comm n.
material difference standard 
the first issue we address is whether the distinction between domestic goods and gray market goods must be physical in nature in order to satisfy the material difference test,an issue of first impression for this court.skf usa is essentially in agreement with the commission that differences between authorized goods and gray market goods need not be physical to be material.the intervenors,however,argue that material differences must be physically manifested in the product or its packaging.they assert that the material difference test compares products,not sellers or the services they offer,and that the difference must be shown to be integral to the product.
we agree with skf usa and the commission and hold that physical material differences are not required to establish trademark infringement involving gray market goods.that is because trademarked goods originating from the trademark owner may have nonphysical characteristics associated with them,including services,such that similar goods lacking those associated characteristics may be believed by consumers to have originated from the trademark owner and,lacking such traits,may mislead the consumer and damage the owner goodwill.
generally,gray market goods are defined as genuine goods that are of foreign manufacture,bearing a legally affixed foreign trademark that is the same mark as is registered in the united states gray goods are legally acquired abroad and then imported without the consent of the united states trademark holder.gamut,at.the principle of gray market law is that the importation of a product that was produced by the owner of the united states trademark or with its consent,but not authorized for sale in the united states,may,in appropriate cases,infringe the united states trademark.id.at.
in gamut,a decision of this court involving gray market goods,the kubota corporation filed a complaint at the commission,alleging that gamut and other respondents violated of the tariff act by importing from japan and reselling in the united states used tractors bearing the mark kubota that had been properly affixed in japan.id.at.the alj in that case determined that the respondents infringed kubota trademark because models of the kubota tractors imported by gamut differed materially from the corresponding tractors imported by kubota.specifically,the alj found that the respondents imported japanese tractors lacked english language warning labels and that dealers did not have english language operator or service manuals for those models.id.the alj determined that those differences in labeling,service,and parts for the imported kubota tractors were in part relevant to the finding of a material difference between the authorized tractors and the gray market,used tractors.id.at.the alj concluded that the respondents had infringed kubota trademark and violated.id.gamut and the other respondent companies appealed,and the full commission affirmed.
we began our analysis in gamut with the fundamental inquiry in gray market goods cases whether there are differences between the foreign and domestic product and if so whether the differences are material.id.at.we stated that t he courts have applied a low threshold of materiality,requiring no more than showing that consumers would be likely to consider the differences between the foreign and domestic products to be significant when purchasing the product,for such differences would suffice to erode the goodwill of the domestic source.id.that inquiry involves a question of fact.
the rationale underlying that minimal requirement is that a ny higher threshold would endanger a manufacturer investment in product goodwill and unduly subject consumers to potential confusion by severing the tie between a manufacturer protected mark and its associated bundle of traits.id.at quoting societe des produits nestle casa helvetia,cir nestle.we explained that the consuming public,associating a trademark with goods having certain characteristics,would be likely to be confused or deceived by goods bearing the same mark but having materially different characteristics.id.at.thus,by distinguishing domestic goods from gray market goods that bear a material difference,thereby finding trademark infringement,we upheld the two fundamental policies of trademark law to protect the consumer and to safeguard the goodwill of the producer.id.at.accordingly,because we held that s ubstantial evidence supports the commission finding that consumers would consider the differences between the used imported tractors and the authorized tractors to be important to their purchasing decision,and thus material,we affirmed the commission decision.
we here carry that reasoning a step further and make explicit what may have only been implicit in gamut.we hence conclude that,consistent w
