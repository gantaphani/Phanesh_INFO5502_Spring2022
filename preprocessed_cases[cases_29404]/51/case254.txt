truth of uri,the foundation sued the world church of the creator the world church,alleging,among other things,trademark infringement in violation of the lanham act,et.the district court granted summary judgment in the world church favor,and the foundation appealed.we reversed the judgment of the district court and remanded with instructions to enter an appropriate judgment in favor of the foundation.truth of uri,world church of the creator,cir hereinafter foundation i.following entry of judgment in its favor,the foundation moved for an award of attorneys fees pursuant to a,which allows a court to award reasonable attorneys fees to the prevailing party if the case is exceptional.the district court denied the foundation motion because the foundation had not shown willful infringement on the world church part.because we find this case exceptional,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in our previous opinion,foundation i,at,we recounted the facts giving rise to the foundation lanham act trademark claims,and we need not repeat them here.instead,we focus on the egregious conduct of the world church and its followers,as documented extensively in the record,throughout the course of the litigation below.we recount these facts in some detail because the nature of the world church litigation conduct is central to the foundation argument on appeal.
the foundation and the world church are organizations with diametrically opposing views,to put it mildly.the foundation,a recognized religious charity,practices as a central tenet the promotion of universal love and respect like many other religious organizations,the foundation provides a range of spiritual services,including classes,lectures,and seminars on religion and ministerial services religious consulting ordination services and religious,spiritual,and educational information via the internet.the foundation provides these services and others in connection with the name church of the creator.the foundation began using the name sometime in and subsequently registered the name with the patent and trademark office in.
in contrast to the foundation,the world church subscribes to far less harmonious principles.the world church is a nonprofit organization with goals succinctly described in its slogan dedicated to the survival,expansion,and advancement of the white race.the world church goal is the elimination of jews,blacks,and mud races.the organization first began operating under the name church of the creator upon its founding in and changed its name to world church of the creator at some point in the.the world church registered neither name with the patent and trademark office.although styling itself a church,the world church has had its charity status revoked by both state and federal governments.see,church of the creator,cir,cir illinois world church of the creator.
thus,from at least,the foundation operated under its registered mark church of the creator at the same time that the world church conducted its own affairs under the moniker world church of the creator.during this period,the world church,under the leadership of matthew hale,engaged in or was associated with a number of incidents that heightened public awareness of the world church particular brand of religion.for example,in,hale and other world church members creators made an appearance on the nationally televised jerry springer show,in which they proclaimed hatred for racial minorities,jews,and even christians.more notorious publicity came in,when benjamin smith,a world church devotee,embarked on a multistate shooting spree in which he targeted minorities.smith shot and killed two victims and wounded several others before he took his own life.see,russell working,rampage left lasting wounds,chi,july,at.activities of this sort served to focus the public spotlight in a negative way on the beliefs of the world church members and leaders.
given the confusing similarity in the names of the two organizations,it was certainly possible that the foundation might be mistaken for the unsavory organization headed by hale,and that is precisely what happened.the foundation began to receive angry complaints and denunciations from parties believing that the church of the creator and the world church of the creator were the same entity,or that the foundation endorsed the world church racist creed.as a result,on may,the foundation filed suit against the world church to enjoin its use of the obviously confusing name world church of the creator and for other relief.
initial harassment by world church members 
shortly after filing suit,the foundation began receiving email and voicemail messages from world church followers.a number of the communications were merely rude or offensive,but others took a more threatening tone all grammar,usage,and spelling in original 
perhaps i will drop by and pay you a visit.tom metzger 
race traitors,we will include you in the concentration camps next time around,so you can be with the jews you so love.
if you are wise you will stop such a stupid action as a lawsuite,for your.
i and my racial comrades take a great offense in suing the real church of the creator you wander why hitler took you jewish scum out back then well i hope you realize this will piss my race off even more because of this there may be a rise in so called hate crimes i am not saying i am going to but your sure to piss somebody off to the point of violence hiel hitler,hiel klassen,hiel rockwell white power 
i tell you what your going to do is piss off allot of my aryan brothers and sisters 
you sick,filthy,degenerate assholes burn in hell 
you have no right to the word creator take pride in your racial heritage before your children are smothered by mixed mutts 
i a member of a white racel racial religion called creativity.are church is called the world church of the creator what makes you think that we stould the name from you fucking kike 
the foundation continued to receive messages of this sort throughout the initial stages of litigation in the district court.eventually,the foundation and the world church filed for summary judgment.on january,the district court granted summary judgment in the world church favor.see truth of uri,world church of the creator,c,wl,dist.lexis.the foundation appealed the judgment on february.
harassment during the pendency of the appeal 
the threats and harassment continued unabated after the foundation filed its notice of appeal.indeed,if anything,it seems that the harassment became progressively worse and expanded to include the foundation attorneys.hale now exhorted world church members via email to put pressure to bear on the foundation scoundrel law firm kirkland ellis that is pushing this frivolous and malicious lawsuit against us.hale also provided the names and phone numbers of two of the foundation lead attorneys,labeling one a definite jew and the other a probable jew.hale reminded the email recipients that these scoundrels have brought this suit to consume our time and resources.perhaps their time and resources will be consumed as well.
hale also posted several hotline messages on the world church website,in which he again noted his belief that the foundation lead attorneys are jewish,and he provided their phone and facsimile numbers so that world church members could protest this witch hunt and make the foundation attorneys consume their time and money dealing with the mass of calls from angry white racial loyalists.moreover,hale reminded members that the foundation attorneys,who work at a jew infested law firm,had consumed enough of our time and they could be repaid in kind.hale asked members to continue calling kirkland ellis and voice your opposition to their pursuing this appeal of their harassment lawsuit against us.
in response to hale exhortations,world church members and sympathizers continued their barrage of emails and phone calls to the foundation counsel.a sampling of these communications follows all grammar,usage,and spelling in original 
i urge you to rescind from carrying this case on any further to avoid embarrassment to yourself and to your clients.
i understand that your law firm has appealed a decision handed down by a lower court in the world church of the creator name lawsuit i a member of wcotc and i just want to say that i think it awful that your firm would do this kind of cheap,petty thing in the first place.we had the name first.no one else did and it been proven.why do you and your firm place money ahead of ethics and morals obviously your client is paying a lot of money.shame on your firm.god is watching you.
listen up you kike,you better leave our fuckin church alone or i gon na fuckin kill you.
harassment following the disposition of the foundation appeal 
in july,we reversed the judgment of the district court and remanded with instructions that judgment be entered in the foundation favor.foundation i,at.undeterred by this setback,the world church issued another hotline message on its website within days of our decision.in essence,the hotline made it clear that the world church intended to ignore any federal decision and proclaimed that t here is no power,there is no authority that can tell us,as a church,that we must use a certain name to celebrate our beloved white people our teachings will not be changed or altered to meet the prejudices of a federal judge.the hotline also called for world church members to continue using the infringing name wherever possible.
on august,hale sent a mass email to world church members in which he proclaimed we have called upon sic protests before against these vermin the foundation and its attorneys and these protests have at least had the result of rattling them.hale noted the apparent success of these efforts,which resulted in the jew lead attorney james amend call ing the world church attorney whining about his phone line being jammed with angry creators.
apparently not content with their accomplishments to date,hale stressed to world church members that the harassment campaign must now become deafening as a means to make clear the resolve of our church and its adherents.hale again provided phone numbers and addresses for the foundation itself and its attorneys,and he asked that members ask to speak to any of these scoundrels and spend as much time as you desire taking them away from their mission of destroying our identity and religious liberty.
responding to hale call,a large number of world church members or sympathizers sent a barrage of new email and voicemail messages to both the foundation and its attorneys.as before,some messages were merely offensive or rude,but others were of a more threatening nature again,all grammar,usage,and spelling in original 
the world church of the creator has members in your area and who are on their way to talk to you about the lawsuit.
do us,the people concerned about the preservation of natures finest,a favor.i sure we could supply you with the gun.
the only thing you will be successful in doing is earning the wrath of thousands of creators 
the world church of the creator has had our name for many years more than you you will make a lot of people very angry.
my name is michael and i am a member of the wcotc in east peoria.i think it is absurd that a organization such as yourself would battle for a name instead of allowing us to have the name our founder gave us.

keep praying to your pathetic jew god that does not exist that you and all your brothers of humanity will not suffer the same fate that you are destined to face

voicemail yes,my name is john pierce.i a member of the cotc,the church of the creator,the real church of the creator.personally,i think you a shyster,the ambulance chaser of the worse kind.how dare you persecute the church of the creator 
voicemail yeah,i a member of the wcotc,the real cotc,and i must say that i find your actions extremely offensive we do care what that three judge court of clowns say,we have the right to our religion we will not abide by any of the unconstitutional proclamations of your kangaroo court.to hell with you.
you can pay all the judges you want,hire all the expensive lawyers you want,pass all the crooked laws you want prohibiting us from using our name but none of it will work we will keep the name that our founder ben klassen gave us in.no matter what 
voicemail we will not abide by your distortions,your perversion of the constitution.
harassment following remand 
in the meantime,following our decision reversing the district court,the foundation filed a motion for a permanent injunction and a motion to declare the case exceptional and for award of attorneys fees under a.in support of the latter motion,the foundation argued that the onslaught of harassing communications from world church members made the case exceptional in the way that we have previously described such cases under a those involving truly egregious,purposeful infringement,or other purposeful wrongdoing.badger meter,grinnell,cir.
on august,almost immediately on the heels of the foundation motion for attorneys fees,the world church issued a press release on its website that again included phone numbers for the foundation counsel and directing members to call the jews of kirkland ellis,james amend and paul steadman,and challenge them.
on november,the district court issued an order and injunction complying with our remand,but issued no ruling on the foundation motion for attorneys fees.shortly thereafter,on december,the world church posted yet another press release on its website responding to the district court order and injunction.a sampling of the language contained in the press release follows 
a federal judge has no constitutional power to either rewrite our religion or order the destruction of our religious books 
i matt hale neither have the power nor the desire to change our religion to meet the dictates of a corrupt judge 
we call upon judge lefkow the presiding district court judge to recognize that her alleged order violates the supreme law of the land 
by your actions,judge lefkow,you have made yourself part of the criminal conspiracy to destroy rights 
w e have the right to declare them as open criminals violating the constitution and the highest law of the land.they then obviously are the criminals,and we can treat them like the criminal dogs they are and take the law into our own hands.this is the obvious,logical thing to do.we must meet force with force and open warfare exists.it will then be open season on all jews 
this court order places our church in a state of war with this federal judge and any acting on authority from her kangaroo court 
in addition,as indicated on a white supremacist website on december,the world church apparently began taking steps to flout the district court order and injunction 
the world church of the creator today publically sic violated a federal judge court order to destroy their holy books by shipping their remaining stock of said books out of the state of illinois and the jurisdiction of the local federal appeals court.
according to an email sent out today by matt hale,the books have been shipped to another state.while such a transfer of property is a violation of the court order,it does place the property out of the court power for the moment 
in the email,hale vowed that he was planning many surprises for our enemies both inside and outside the courtroom.
on december,the district court issued an order to show cause why the world church should not be held in contempt given the world church admitted efforts to avoid compliance with the express terms of the injunction.following this order,the world church filed a series of motions,including motions to disqualify the presiding district court judge as well as the foundation counsel the district court denied these motions.
in the meantime,however,hale apparently had undertaken to follow through on his vow to plan many surprises for persons the world church considered enemies.on january,federal agents arrested hale on a indictment for soliciting the murder of judge lefkow and for attempting to influence the judge corruptly and by force.see united states hale,cr.a jury subsequently convicted hale on four of the five counts with which he was eventually charged see united states hale,cr.
ii.the district court denial of the foundation motion for attorneys fees 
on march,while hale criminal proceedings progressed separately before a different judge,the district court issued its order denying the foundation motion to declare the case exceptional and award attorneys fees.see truth of uri,v.the world church of the creator,c,wl,hereinafter foundation ii.the district court specifically found that the world church had sent a barrage of hateful letters,voice and to the foundation and the foundation counsel.id.at.the district court also found that a s the evidence demonstrates,more than communications were sent,and they can be readily traced to incitement by hale,who via called upon world church members to make the foundation and its attorneys consume their time and money dealing with the mass of calls from angry white racial loyalists and to pressure the foundation to drop the law suit.id.the district court concluded that these communications were ugly,even threatening,and described the world church conduct as reprehensible and tortious or criminal.id.at.
nevertheless,the district court denied the foundation motion due to its interpretation of the reach of a.the district court cited our decisions in which a trademark plaintiff was vindicated on the merits and the case subsequently was declared exceptional because the acts of infringement could be characterized as malicious,fraudulent,deliberate,or willful.id.at citing otis clapp son,filmore vitamin,cir.the district court interpreted these prior decisions as requiring the prevailing plaintiff in a trademark case to show willful infringement on the part of the infringer before the case may be declared exceptional and attorneys fees awarded under a.see foundation ii at.
the district court noted that the foundation motion for fees was founded not on any allegation of willful infringement,but instead on its contention that the world church litigation conduct was in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment.see id.at.the foundation supported its motion with citation to authority from the third circuit allowing a finding of exceptionality and awarding attorneys fees to the prevailing plaintiff where the accused infringer engaged in litigation misconduct.see id.at citing securacomm consulting,securacom,cir.the district court declined,however,to extend to the foundation case the broader view espoused by the third circuit,even though the district court acknowledged that t he case before it was more like securacomm consulting than any case cited from the seventh circuit.foundation ii at.instead,the district court concluded that securacomm consulting stands alone in awarding fees for bad faith defense litigation conduct and that authority from this and other circuits indicates that the circumstances of the case did not lend themselves to the fee shifting provisions of the lanham act.id.accordingly,because the foundation had not demonstrated willful infringement on the part of the world church,the district court declined to declare the case exceptional and denied the foundation motion.see id.
nevertheless,on may,the district court found the world church in contempt of its injunction for affirmatively and knowingly flout ing the express terms of the injunction and levied sanctions against it.thereafter,on october,the district court entered a final judgment in the foundation favor,ruling that the world church and its were in contempt of the district court order and injunction and were jointly and severally liable to the foundation for in sanctions and in costs.the foundation appealed the district court denial of the motion for award of attorneys fees 
iii.analysis 
a.the foundation arguments on appeal 
the foundation argues that the district court erred when it concluded that the case was not exceptional.the foundation believes that the district court conclusion was erroneous because its interpretation of a precludes a finding of exceptionality and award of fees to a prevailing plaintiff without willful infringement by the defendant.the foundation posits that there is no such limitation and that the statute and our caselaw allow sufficiently egregious litigation misconduct to serve as the basis for an exceptional case and award of fees to a prevailing plaintiff.
consequently,the foundation urges that the world church actions in the case justify an award of fees because its campaign of harassment went well beyond the pale of acceptable litigation conduct and because it flagrantly disregarded the district court order and injunction.the foundation argues that the world church harassment was part of its strategy to put pressure to bear on the foundation attorneys in order to consume their time and money,and the foundation asserts that it in fact expended time and money responding to the harassment.thus,the foundation contends that the world church behavior amounts to litigation misconduct that is so egregious that it may serve as the basis for attorneys fees under a.
the decision to award fees under a is within the district court sound discretion.see basf old world trading,cir a decision to award attorneys fees under the lanham act is firmly committed to the district court discretion.we normally review for abuse of discretion a district court denial of fees under a.see otis clapp son,at.in this case,however,the district court denied fees on the basis of its interpretation of the scope and meaning of a,so we apply de novo review.see badger meter,at we review the district court conclusions of law de novo.accord securacomm,at o ur review of the scope and meaning of exceptional is plenary.
under a and the standard for prevailing plaintiffs 
resolution of this appeal requires us to answer two fundamental questions.does a require a prevailing plaintiff to show willful or other culpable infringement,and if not,does a defendant litigation misconduct properly serve as a basis for attorneys fees for answers,we look first to the language of a.
section of the lanham act allows under limited,the final sentence of a provides that a court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.a.the statute does not define exceptional case,however.we previously have determined exceptional cases to be those involving some measure of culpability on the part of the losing example,in cases where the acts of infringement can be characterized as malicious,fraudulent,deliberate,or willful.badger meter,at citing hairline creations,kefalas,cir see gorenstein,quality,cir collecting authority.indeed,we have described the latter standard as a canonical formula that we and the other circuits apply when determining whether a case is exceptional and award of fees warranted.see door,door,cir collecting authority.this standard could seem to foreclose a prevailing plaintiff from recovering fees without culpable infringement by the defendant,and this is how the district court interpreted a and pertinent caselaw.yet a says nothing about treating the prevailing party differently depending on its status as plaintiff or defendant.
until now,we have not squarely confronted the question whether,pursuant to a,a trademark defendant litigation conduct,as opposed to its willful infringement,could make the case exceptional and justify the award of fees to a prevailing plaintiff.we have held,however,that a plaintiff litigation conduct may justify an award of fees to a prevailing defendant.for example,in door systems,we concluded that the appropriate inquiry when the defendant is the prevailing party is whether the plaintiff suit is oppressive.see id.at b etween good faith as a safe harbor and deliberateness as an automatic basis for awarding fees is the category of oppressive suits,fairly described as exceptional,in which the case for an award of fees to the defendant is compelling.we have clarified that a suit may be oppressive if it lacked merit,had elements of an abuse of process claim,and the plaintiff conduct unreasonably increased the cost of defending against the suit.s,centra,cir accord ass of prof l baseball leagues,very minor leagues,cir no one factor is determinative,and an infringement suit could be exceptional for a prevailing defendant because of the unusually vexatious and oppressive manner in which it is prosecuted.in short,we have concluded that a case may be exceptional if a losing plaintiff litigation conduct is particularly egregious.see s industries,at plaintiff litigation conduct was oppressive and fees appropriate where plaintiff engaged in such dilatory tactics and antics as not responding to discovery requests,repeatedly failing to serve properly or sign motions,failing to satisfy local rules provisions,ignoring filing deadlines,submitting motions late or not at all,missing scheduled hearings,and otherwise engaging in tactics resulting in an extra nine months of delay and added costs to defendant accord aromatique,gold seal,cir courts have defined the characteristics of exceptional cases with adjectives suggesting egregious conduct by a party.
possible dual standard under a 
these cases seem to treat prevailing plaintiffs and defendants differently with regard to under a.on one hand,a prevailing plaintiff must show culpability with respect to the defendant infringement,while on the other hand,a prevailing defendant must show that the plaintiff litigation conduct was oppressive.see door systems,at the circumstances that are exceptional when the infringer is being asked to pay the victim attorneys fees need not be exceptional when the shoe is on the other foot.accord very minor leagues,at when attorney fees are awarded against a defendant,the court looks to whether the defendant acts of infringement were pursued in bad faith.when attorney fees are awarded against a plaintiff,the court looks to the plaintiff conduct in bringing the lawsuit and the manner in which it is prosecuted.emphasis in original.
such a dual standard likely runs afoul of the approach dictated by the supreme court in fogerty fantasy,d.in fogerty,the court considered whether prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants must be treated alike with respect to under the copyright act,which provides that the court may also award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.some circuits,including this one,favored an approach in which fees would be awarded according to different standards for prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants.see fogerty,at.citing cases from the second,seventh,and circuits.other circuits applied an evenhanded approach with respect to plaintiffs and defendants.see id.citing cases from the fourth and eleventh circuits.the court considered and rejected the arguments that a dual standard should apply and concluded that the evenhanded approach should guide under the copyright act.see id.at.in so doing,the court also concluded that federal statutes in the patent and trademark fields,which are more closely related to that of copyright,support a party neutral approach.those statutes contain language similar to that of,with the added proviso that fees are only to be awarded in exceptional cases.id.at.emphasis added.
thus,in fogerty,the court indicated approval,consistent with the standard applicable in copyright act cases,for an evenhanded approach to in trademark cases,and we and other circuits have acknowledged this interpretation of fogerty.see fasa playmates toys,cir accord securacomm consulting,at stephen boney,boney,cir citing fasa and concluding that,after fogerty,the standard under which bad faith or other malicious conduct satisfies the exceptional circumstances requirement applies to both prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants seeking attorney fees under the lanham act.
the approach 
closer analysis of our a cases does not lead us to the conclusion that we have been applying a dual standard that runs contrary to the supreme court analysis in fogerty.the foundation points out that our caselaw interpreting the statute does not foreclose finding a case exceptional and awarding fees to the prevailing plaintiff for reasons other than culpable infringement.in badger meter,for example,we defined exceptional cases under the statute as those involving truly egregious,purposeful infringement,or other purposeful wrongdoing.at emphasis added.thus,we have recognized that wrongdoing beyond culpable infringement may justify declaring a case exceptional and awarding fees to a prevailing plaintiff.this interpretation does not conflict with our application of the aforementioned canonical formula,but instead clarifies that our interpretation of a does not limit exceptional cases only to those in which the prevailing plaintiff shows willful infringement on the defendant part.
other relevant caselaw is not to the contrary,and we believe the district court read this authority too narrowly.for example,the district court cited otis clapp son to support its conclusion that exceptional cases are ones in which the acts of infringement can be characterized as malicious,fraudulent,deliberate,or willful.see foundation ii,wl,at citing at.but in otis clapp son,we also recognized that section confers a wide scope of discretion on the district court in fashioning a remedy for a trademark infringement subject to the principles of equity.at citations omitted.moreover,the language cited by the district court describes the types of culpable infringement that justify fees,but does not restrict a prevailing plaintiff recovery of fees only to instances in which such culpability is found.nowhere did we interpret the a broad principles of equity as extending no further than culpable infringement.
the district court also cited for support our decision in roulo russ berrie,cir.see foundation ii at the seventh circuit interprets this provision to require a finding of wilful infringement.citing roulo,at.the quoted passage from roulo,however,cites hairline creations,in which we noted that congress intended the provision of a to track the parallel provisions of the patent and copyright statutes.at.this observation further supports fogerty s apparent approval for a standard for under a,and it is evident that a standard requiring a prevailing plaintiff to show willful or other culpable infringement,but allowing a prevailing defendant to recover based on the plaintiff conduct,is inconsistent with a approach for the reasons already discussed.
moreover,hairline creations quotes the language from the legislative history of a that gave rise to the canonical formula,which allows fees where infringement can be characterized as malicious,fraudulent,deliberate,or willful.see at citation omitted.the legislative history does not explicitly state that a prevailing plaintiff can recover fees only if the defendant willfully infringed.instead,this language and similar language in our other cases suggests that to the extent a prevailing plaintiff seeks fees pursuant to a for the defendant infringing use,such infringement must be culpable.
further review of the legislative history indicates that congress did not intend under a to turn only on whether a prevailing plaintiff can show culpable infringement.rather,congress intended that broad principles of equity should guide the award of fees under the statute.specifically,the senate report states that the purpose of the provision is to authorize award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in trademark litigation where justified by equitable considerations,reprinted in,emphasis added.indeed,as mentioned earlier,we have recognized that principles of equity should guide the award of fees under a.see,otis clapp son,at.while congressional intent in this regard is not necessarily dispositive,it is worth noting that the canonical formula itself seems to derive directly from congress intent as expressed in the senate report proposing the adoption of what would become a,reprinted in,it would be unconscionable not to provide a complete remedy including attorney fees for acts which courts have characterized as malicious,fraudulent,deliberate,and willful.emphasis added.
thus,congress expressed its intent that infringing acts be culpable before fees are awarded,but also that broader principles of equity should guide such award of fees under the lanham act.until now,our cases concerning the award of fees to prevailing plaintiffs have centered on culpable infringement rather than whether broader principles of equity may justify shifting of fees.but as far as the goals served by a,both of congress concerns complement each considerations have a broader sweep than the more specific concern that infringers be punished for particularly bad conduct,but the two concerns are not in conflict.turner united states parole comm n,cir when interpreting a statute,courts must look to inferences of congressional intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole.thus,culpable infringement seems a more narrowly defined subset of the many conceivable types of conduct for which fees may be awarded consistent with congress broader concern with equitable considerations in enforcement of trademarks.the district court erroneously confined its analysis to whether the foundation had shown willful infringement by the world church and therefore too narrowly interpreted the reach of a.
the broad discretion accorded a district court under a,which is founded on equitable considerations,is inconsistent with an interpretation that restricts a prevailing plaintiff to recovery of fees only in cases of willful infringement.therefore,we disagree with the district court interpretation of a and relevant authority,for neither the statute nor our caselaw requires willful infringement before fees may be awarded to a prevailing plaintiff.
litigation misconduct as a basis for under a 
having concluded that a prevailing plaintiff need not show willful infringement before a case may be declared exceptional,we must now consider whether a defendant oppressive litigation conduct will support such a declaration.we believe that it can.
we find convincing support for this conclusion in cases examining under the patent act.the language of the patent act provision,which provides that the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party,is identical to the provision at issue in a.supreme court precedent teaches that statutes similar language is a strong indication that they are to be interpreted alike.indep.fed of flight attendants zipes,d see also pennsylvania delaware valley citizens council for clean air,d noting that nearly identical purposes behind statutes lend credence to the idea that they should be interpreted in a similar manner northcross bd.of educ.of memphis city schools,d per curiam s imilarity of language is,of course,a strong indication that two statutes should be interpreted pari passu.hairline creations,at noting that the trademark and patent provisions are parallel provisions.thus,it is appropriate to look to the interpretation of the patent provision for guidance with interpreting a.see securacomm consulting,at citing cjc holdings,wright lato,cir.
a review of these patent cases supports the conclusion that cases may be declared exceptional if the losing party has engaged in vexatious litigation conduct.see,read portec,l itigation misconduct may in itself make a case exceptional.internal quotations and citation omitted,abrogated in part on other grounds by markman westview instruments,en banc,aff,d.these cases support awarding fees to a prevailing plaintiff because of the defendant vexatious litigation strategy,even in the absence of a finding of willful infringement.see,beckman instruments,lkb produkter ab,among the types of conduct which can form a basis for finding a case exceptional are willful infringement,inequitable conduct before the,misconduct during litigation,vexatious or unjustified litigation,and frivolous suit.citation omitted.given the similar aims protected by both the patent and trademark laws,and the identical language used in the respective statutes,we believe that the federal circuit examination of under the patent act lends strong support to our interpretation of the parallel provisions of a.
we also find support for our analysis in the third circuit interpretation of a in securacomm consulting,at.as the district court noted,the facts in securacomm consulting bear some similarity to the facts of this case,at least to the extent that the securacomm consulting defendant engaged in numerous vexatious acts during the course of litigation.the plaintiff,which owned the registered mark securacomm consulting,sued securacom incorporated for various lanham act violations.id.at.the corporate defendant committed numerous acts of misconduct throughout the ensuing litigation.for example,at the outset of the lawsuit,an officer of the defendant threatened to bury plaintiff financially and take everything he had.id.at.the defendant also filed suit in state court accusing the plaintiff and its lawyers of numerous criminal,tortious,and unethical acts id.at.the defendant claims were later dismissed as meritless,see,and the plaintiff subsequently prevailed in its lanham act suit.see id.at.
the district court then determined that the case was exceptional and awarded the plaintiff attorneys fees,because the defendant had sought to secure use of the trademark not simply through fair and vigorous use of the legal process but by first engaging in bad faith negotiations and then seeking to destroy a financially weaker adversary through oppressive litigation tactics.id.at citation omitted.the third circuit affirmed the district court order awarding fees under a.the court explicitly rejected the defendant assertion that willful infringement is the only culpable conduct by a defendant that renders a case exceptional.id.at.instead,the court referred to its prior interpretations of a and concluded that by explicitly referring to bad faith,fraud,or malice as other examples of culpable conduct that might warrant a finding of exceptionality,we recognized that culpable conduct comes in a variety of forms and may vary depending on the circumstances of a particular case.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in securacomm consulting,the court determined that culpable conduct that justifies an award of fees may be broader than willful infringement.id.the court noted that a lthough culpability is often based on the infringing acts,we have not suggested that that was the only conduct that would qualify as exceptional enough to warrant a fee award.id.thus,the court concluded that the language of a authorizing fees does not distinguish between prevailing plaintiffs or defendants and therefore does not preclude using litigating conduct as a basis for the fee.id.
the third circuit evaluated the lanham act legislative history and,consonant with our own analysis,concluded that congress broad view of equitable considerations allows a court to assess the totality of the circumstances in each case,and thus culpable conduct of a defendant in the act of infringement is a relevant factor to consider,but it is not exclusive of other equitable considerations.id.at.securacomm consulting also provided an evaluation of the parallel considerations undergirding the identical provision in the patent act and reached the same conclusion we,that the federal circuit interpretation of the provision of the patent act provides strong support for a broad view of a that allows a prevailing plaintiff to recover fees for a defendant litigation misconduct.see id.at.thus,the third circuit analysis closely tracks our own and further supports our conclusion.
pursuant to a,a case may be declared exceptional and fees may be awarded to a prevailing plaintiff where the defendant litigation conduct was oppressive.this interpretation seems particularly apt given the supreme court disapproval in fogerty for a dual standard with regard to attorneys fees and because a district court has broad discretion under a to fashion an appropriate remedy according to equitable considerations.just as a plaintiff litigation conduct may be found oppressive because it has unreasonably increased the cost of defending against its trademark suit,there is no doubt that an accused infringer
