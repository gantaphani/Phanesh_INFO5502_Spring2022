background 
appellant cordua owns and operates a chain of five restaurants branded as churrascos,the first of which opened in.the churrascos restaurants serve a variety of south american dishes,including grilled meats the churrascos menu describes chargrilled churrasco steak as our signature.cordua applied for registration of the service mark churrascos in standard character format and obtained trademark registration on the principal register the registration on june,for use of the word in connection with restaurant and bar services catering.
on january,cordua filed trademark application serial the application,the application at issue in this case,seeking protection of the stylized form of churrascos for use in connection with bar and restaurant services catering.the trademark examiner rejected the application as merely descriptive and on the basis that the mark is generic for applicant services,barring registration under lanham act e e.on june,the examiner issued a final rejection,again refusing registration of the stylized form of churrascos on the basis of descriptiveness and genericness.with respect to genericness,the examiner concluded that the term churrascos refer s to beef or grilled meat more generally and that the term identifies a key characteristic or feature of the restaurant services,namely,the type of restaurant.
cordua appealed to the board,which affirmed the examiner refusal to register the mark for use in connection with restaurant services.the board agreed with the examiner that churrascos is the generic term for a type of cooked meat and a generic term for a restaurant featuring churrasco steaks.cordua,wl,at.the board held that cordua earlier registration of the underlying churrascos word mark the registration had no bearing on whether the stylized form of churrascos was generic.the board also agreed with the examiner that the stylized form of churrascos was also ineligible for registration because it is merely descriptive of a restaurant serving barbecued steaks and because cordua had not provided sufficient evidence of acquired distinctiveness.cordua appealed.we have jurisdiction under a b.
discussion 
we consider whether the board erred in refusing registration on the ground that the mark is generic.we review the board legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for substantial evidence.aycock eng g,airflite.the standard of genericness is a question of law that we review de novo.see in re save venice.the question of whether a particular mark is generic under the applicable standard is a question of fact,which we review for substantial evidence.in re,in re reed elsevier.
as the supreme court has held,g eneric terms are not registrable,and a registered mark may be canceled at any time on the grounds that it has become generic.park n fly,dollar park and fly,d citing.this is so because g eneric terms,by definition incapable of indicating source,are the antithesis of trademarks,and can never attain trademark status.in re merrill lynch,pierce,fenner,smith,see also princeton vanguard,llc frito lay.
a generic term is the common descriptive name of a class of goods or services.princeton vanguard,at quoting marvin ginn int l ass of fire chiefs.the critical issue in genericness cases is whether members of the relevant public primarily use or understand the term sought to be protected to refer to the genus of goods or services in question.ginn,at.under ginn a test is applied to determine whether a given term is generic.id.at.first,what is the genus of goods or services at issue second,is the term sought to be registered or retained on the register understood by the relevant public primarily to refer to that genus of goods or services see also princeton vanguard,at reed elsevier,at.evidence of the public understanding of the mark may be obtained from any competent source,such as consumer surveys,dictionaries,newspapers and other publications.princeton vanguard,at quoting in re northland aluminum.
at the outset we note that cordua existing registration of the churrascos word mark the registration does not preclude a finding that the stylized form of the mark is generic.cordua contends that the churrascos word mark had achieved incontestable status under lanham act because the registration was more than five years old at the time of the ttab decision and argues that the board failure to fully consider the incontestable registration is error.appellant br.at.
the pto disputes cordua contention that the registration had achieved incontestable status at the time of appeal to the ttab.we need not address this question,because even if the earlier registration were incontestable,incontestability is irrelevant to the question of genericness.section of the lanham act mandates that no incontestable right shall be acquired in a mark which is the generic name for the goods or services or a portion thereof,for which it is registered.a registered mark may be canceled at any time on the grounds that it has become generic.park n fly,at.under the cancellation provisions of of the lanham act,a registered mark that has become generic may be cancelled at any time i ncontestability is never a shield for a mark that is generic.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.mccarthy quoting retail,freebies publ g,cir.cordua conceded at argument that incontestability can not protect a mark against a challenge of genericness.thus,the board did not err in declining to consider the alleged incontestability of the churrascos word mark in evaluating the genericness of the stylized form thereof.
cordua also argues that under b of the lanham act b,registration on the principal register is prima facie evidence of a mark validity,even if the mark has not achieved incontestable status.cordua is correct that registration is prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark b b hardware,hargis,d quoting b.the presumption of validity applies generally against any challenge that the mark is invalid,including an allegation that the mark is generic.see coca cola overland,cir the general presumption of validity resulting from federal registration includes the specific presumption that the trademark is not generic.see also mccarthy when the plaintiff asserts a federal registration in an infringement suit,it constitutes a strong presumption that the term is not generic and defendant bears the burden of overcoming the presumption.
but this proceeding does not involve a challenge to the registration and the churrascos word mark.the presumption of validity of b does not carry over from registration of the older mark to a new application for registration of another mark that happens to be similar or even nearly identical.see,in re shinnecock smoke shop,applicant allegations regarding similar marks are irrelevant because each application must be considered on its own merits.in re nett designs,even if some prior registrations had some characteristics similar to nett designs application,the pto allowance of such prior registrations does not bind the board or this court.the pto is required to examine all trademark applications for compliance with each and every eligibility requirement,including,even if the pto earlier mistakenly registered a similar or identical mark suffering the same defect.thus,whether or not the term churrascos was generic when it was registered,we,like the board,must evaluate the evidence in the present record to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to establish that it is ineligible.
in any event,regardless of the presumption of validity,in registration proceedings the pto always bears the burden of proving genericness by clear and convincing evidence.the patent and trademark office pto bears the burden of establishing that a proposed mark is generic,and must demonstrate generic status by clear and convincing evidence,at citations omitted see also in re.fish fry,in re,trademark manual of examining procedure tmep c i.here,the board opinion acknowledged the presumption of and the correct burden of proof when a proposed mark is refused registration as generic,the office has the burden of proving genericness by clear evidence thereof.cordua,wl,at citing,at.the board sustained the examiner determination that churrascos is a generic term with respect to restaurant services only after concluding that the examiner had proved this fact by clear and convincing evidence.t he examining attorney has established by clear evidence that the general public the consumers of restaurant services understands that churrascos is generic for a type of restaurant,specifically a restaurant that serves churrascos.id.at 
we next consider whether the board properly determined that the stylized form of churrascos is generic.
cordua argues that the board failed to apply the ginn test correctly.the ginn test requires the board to determine,first,what is the genus of goods or services at issue and,second,is the term sought to be registered or retained on the register understood by the relevant public primarily to refer to that genus of goods or services ginn,at.cordua complains,inter alia,that the board and the examiner misapplied the ginn test by concentrating on the wrong genus of services,focusing improperly on cordua own services rather than on the wider genus identified in the application,restaurant services 
at a few points in its decision,the board analysis of genericness addressed cordua own restaurant services.the board opinion noted,for example,that churrasco steak is advertised as the signature dish of cordua churrascos restaurants and is listed as the first entrée on its menu,cordua,wl,at,and suggested that churrascos is generic as applied to cordua own restaurants the churrasco steak is clearly one of the primary items applicant churrascos restaurants serve,id.at.
we agree with cordua that a proper genericness inquiry focuses on the description of services set forth in the certificate of registration.magic wand,rdb.the authority is legion that the question of registrability of an applicant mark must be decided on the basis of the identification of goods set forth in the application regardless of what the record may reveal as to the particular nature of an applicant goods,the particular channels of trade or the class of purchasers to which sales of the goods are directed.octocom,hous.comput,citing cases see also in re.com ip,llc,defining the genus of goods or services at issue as the genus of goods or services for which the applicant sought protection,as set forth in its trademark application can.imperial bank of commerce wells fargo bank,ass n.
thus,the correct question is not whether churrascos is generic as applied to cordua own restaurants but rather whether the term is understood by the public to refer to the wider genus of restaurant services.see ginn,at see also princeton vanguard,at reed elsevier,at.the board suggestion that churrascos is generic as applied to cordua own restaurant services misses the point cordua,wl,at.
however,the board apparent error in considering cordua own restaurant services is harmless.at the first step of the ginn test,the board properly determined t he genus of goods or services at issue,id.at quoting ginn,at,and concluded that the genus of the services at issue is adequately defined by a portion of the recitation of services in the application,specifically restaurant services,id.at citing magic wand,at.this aspect of the board decision reflects the correct approach,and cordua agrees that restaurant services is the relevant genus.
we next address whether the term churrascos is generic for restaurant services generally,as identified in the application.the board found,b ased on the evidence that churrascos is the generic term for a type of cooked meat,that churrascos is a generic term for a restaurant featuring churrasco steaks.cordua,wl,at.the board decision in this respect is supported by substantial evidence.
cordua concedes that the term churrasco is a word in spanish and portuguese referring to barbecue,and the application itself acknowledges that t he english translation of churrascos in the mark is barbecue.under the doctrine of foreign equivalents,foreign words from common languages are translated into english to determine genericness,descriptiveness,as well as similarity of connotation palm bay,veuve clicquot ponsardin maison fondee en,see also in re spirits int l.because churrasco is a common word in spanish and portuguese and because the application itself concedes that churrascos means barbecue,the pto would have been justified in translating churrascos into barbecue and subsequently determining whether the term barbecue is generic when applied to restaurant services.indeed,the examiner aptly remarked that a foreign equivalent of a generic english word is no more registrable than the english word itself.
but the examiner,and the board,did not rely here on the doctrine of foreign equivalents.instead,the examiner and the board found that churrasco is used in the english language to refer to grilled meat.the evidence before the board included,inter alia,three dictionaries that define churrasco as grilled meat.see cordua,wl,at.two of the dictionaries specify that the meat is steak or beef.id.the dictionaries constitute evidence that churrasco is a generic term for grilled meat,especially grilled steak.cordua essentially concedes this point.in its brief,cordua concedes churrasco can be used as a noun meaning grilled steak specially prepared in the churrasco style.appellant br.at.
however,cordua contends that the addition of the s at the end of churrascos makes the term.that is,while cordua concedes that churrasco describes a grilled steak,it argues that adding an s changes the term meaning because churrascos is not the proper pluralization of churrasco in spanish.while each trademark must always be evaluated individually,pluralization commonly does not alter the meaning of a mark.see in re belgrade shoe,ccpa wilson delaunay,ccpa.since churrascos is an term,there is nothing in the record to indicate that the addition of the s at the end alters its meaning beyond making the word plural.in fact,the board found that at least one dictionary presents churrascos as the plural form of churrasco,meaning meat cooked over an open fire.cordua,wl,at.the board also credited an article that appeared in an online version of esquire magazine that used the precise term churrascos to refer to juicy,charred slabs of tenderloin steak.id.at.there is,therefore,substantial evidence to support the board conclusion that churrascos is the generic term for a type of cooked meat.id.
cordua next argues that churrascos or churrasco refers specifically to a style of grilling meat and not to restaurant services.but a term can be generic for a genus of goods or services if the relevant public here,the public understands the term to refer to a key aspect of that genus,a key good that characterizes a particular genus of retail services.a generic name of goods may also be a generic name of the service of selling or designing those goods.mccarthy.we have held that t he test is not only whether the relevant public would itself use the term to describe the genus,but also whether the relevant public would understand the term to be generic.com,at.a ny term that the relevant public understands to refer to the genus is generic.id.
in.com,we affirmed the board determination that is generic for online retail store services in the field of mattresses,beds,and bedding because the term mattress identified a key aspect of such services.id.at.in,we affirmed the board determination that is generic for providing information for others about temporary lodging and travel agency services because the term hotels names a key aspect of such services.at.and in reed elsevier,we affirmed the board determination that is generic for information exchange concerning the law,legal news,and legal services,because an integral,if not the paramount,aspect of information exchange about legal services as reed defines it concerns identifying and helping people to select lawyers.at,alterations and internal quotation marks omitted see also in re tires,tires,tires,wl,at ttab holding that tires tires tires is generic for retail tire sales in re,wl,at ttab a term which is the generic name of a particular category of goods is likewise generic for any services which are directed to or focused on that class of goods.
thus,cordua is wrong that a dish,even a specialty dish,does not identify the genus of restaurant services.appellant br.at.if the relevant public would understand a term denoting a specialty dish to refer to a key aspect of restaurant services,then the term is generic for restaurant services.see hunt masters,landry seafood,cir holding that crab house is a generic term referring to a class of restaurants that serve crabs.
there is substantial evidence in the record that churrascos refers to a key aspect of a class of restaurants because those restaurants are commonly referred to as churrasco restaurants.for example,the ttab decision points to one newspaper article praising a brazilian churrasco restaurant notable for its sizzling food served on spits straight from the fire a second article that describes a churrasco restaurant as a restaurant distinguished by serving m eat of all kinds and a third article that characterizes a churrasco restaurant as a kind of restaurant that serves south american mixed grill.cordua,wl,at.each of these articles constitutes evidence that the public understands the term churrascos to refer to a type of restaurant as well as a dish.each article therefore supports the board conclusion that there is a class of restaurants that have churrascos as a central focus of their services,and that both competitors in the field and consumers use the term churrasco to refer to this type of restaurant.id.at.we perceive no error in this part of the board analysis.
cordua argues that even if churrascos is generic as to churrasco restaurants also known as churrascarias,it is not generic as to all restaurant services.but a term is generic if the relevant public understands the term to refer to part of the claimed genus of goods or services,even if the public does not understand the term to refer to the broad genus as a whole.thus,the term pizzeria would be generic for restaurant services,even though the public understands the term to refer to a particular or type of restaurant rather than to all restaurants.see,northland aluminum,at affirming the ttab determination that bundt is generic for a type of ring cake in re analog devices,wl,at ttab there is no logical reason to treat differently a term that is generic of a category or class of products where some but not all of the goods identified in an application fall within that category,aff,unpublished see also otokoyama,wine of japan,cir generic words for or varieties of a good are ineligible for trademark protection.a registration is properly refused if the word is the generic name of any of the goods or services for which registration is sought.mccarthy.a term need not refer to an entire broad species,like cheese or cake,in order to be found generic.anne gilson lalonde,gilson on trademarks a.
we do not,of course,suggest that the term churrascos is necessarily generic as to any and all restaurant services.had another applicant applied for registration of the mark churrascos in connection not with the entire broad genus of restaurant services but instead with a narrower of restaurant at which grilled meat is not a key aspect of the service provided for example,vegetarian or sushi restaurants the result could well have been different.b y expanding or contracting the definition of a genus of products,a court can substantially affect the final determination of whether a term is generic.mccarthy.it is up to the applicant to identify the genus of goods or services for which it seeks protection.see a,b a,a tmep see also stone lion capital partners,lion capital llp,parties that choose to recite services in their trademark application that exceed their actual services will be held to the broader scope of the application.octocom,at r egistrability of an applicant mark must be decided on the basis of the identification of goods set forth in the application.the pto will generally accept any identification of goods or services so long as it is specific,definite,clear,accurate,and concise.tmep see also in re omega sa,holding that i t is within the discretion of the pto to require that one goods be identified with particularity in a trademark application quoting in re water gremlin,ccpa.
here,cordua sought registration of the stylized form of churrascos in connection with the broad genus of all restaurant services,and the question of genericness must be evaluated accordingly.as the pto points out,registration of the stylized form of churrascos on the principal register would give cordua rights that it could enforce against all others providing restaurant services,including operators of traditional latin american churrascarias churrasco restaurants that specialize in meat grilled in the churrasco style.see a b,see also stone lion capital partners,at t he services recited in the application determine the scope of the benefit of registration.jean patou,theon,the benefits of a principal register registration apply with respect to the goods named in the registration mccarthy.by seeking broad protection for its mark,cordua obliged the pto to direct its genericness inquiry to the broad category of restaurants generally 
finally,we consider whether the stylization of churrascos in the application renders the mark eligible.as the board has previously held,a display of descriptive or otherwise unregistrable matter is not registrable on the principal register unless the design features of the asserted mark create an impression on the purchasers separate and apart from the impression made by the words themselves,or if it can be shown by evidence that the particular display which the applicant has adopted has acquired distinctiveness.in re sadoru,wl,at ttab see also northland aluminum,at affirming the ttab rejection,as generic,of a stylized mark that was not so distinctive as to create a commercial impression separate and apart from the word itself mccarthy in re chem.dynamics,in deciding whether the design background of a word mark may be separately registered,the essential question is whether or not the background material is or is not inherently distinctive if the background portion is inherently distinctive,no proof of secondary meaning need be introduced if not,such proof is essential.citation,internal quotation marks,and emphasis omitted.the board concluded that the display of applicant mark,consisting primarily of stylized letters,does not make the matter registrable,despite the genericness of the term churrascos,since it does not create a separate commercial impression over and above that made by the generic term.cordua,wl,at.
while cordua now describes the stylized form of churrascos as highly stylized,using a unique and arbitrary font,appellant br.at,cordua did not argue before the board and does not argue now that this stylization creates a separate impression,see cordua,wl,at.cordua also did not argue that the stylization,the graphic quality of the stylized form of churrascos has acquired distinctiveness instead,it has argued only that the underlying word mark has acquired distinctiveness.the stylized nature of the mark can not save it from ineligibility as generic.
conclusion 
we affirm the ttab decision that the stylized form of churrascos applied for in the application is generic as applied to restaurant services and therefore.because we hold that the board did not err in concluding that churrascos is generic,we do not reach the board alternate ground of ineligibility,descriptiveness.
the stylized mark hereinafter we refer to this mark as the stylized form of churrascos.
cordua appears to argue that the examiner determination that the c
