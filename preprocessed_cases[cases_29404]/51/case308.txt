the district court entered summary judgment for southern california darts association socal and issued a permanent injunction enjoining dino zaffina from using certain marks that have been used by socal for several decades.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
background 
for forty years or more,socal has promoted the competitive play of the game of darts and has coordinated league play of this game.for a time,beginning in the,members of socal formed and ran a corporation named southern california darts association,the original socal corporation.the corporate powers of the original socal corporation were suspended by the state of california in,apparently for nonpayment of the corporate franchise tax.socal has,for many years,used the following marks its full name southern california darts association the acronym scda the nickname socal darts and a logo featuring the organization full name and a dart board.
zaffina was once a member of socal.zaffina and socal feuded in july over whether zaffina middle initial would be used in socal weekly scoring reports,and zaffina membership in socal came to an end.it is unclear whether zaffina renounced his socal membership or whether the organization expelled him.on january,zaffina registered with the state of california a corporation named southern california darts association,socal,the same name once used by the original socal corporation.zaffina appointed himself president and ceo of socal.he then registered the internet domain name and began to use it to promote socal.
in august,zaffina and socal informed approximately three hundred businesses,by email,of socal existence.these businesses included the host pubs in which the events organized by socal traditionally have been held.in september of the same year,zaffina and socal sued multiple defendants in state court for hosting or participating in events while using socal name and other marks.
on march,socal brought suit against zaffina and socal in the united states district court for the central district of california.in its complaint,socal alleged violations of the lanham act and the california business and professions code,common law trademark infringement,and unfair competition.socal also moved for a preliminary injunction.
on april,the district court granted socal motion for a preliminary injunction,and enjoined zaffina and socal from using socal marks,using urls containing these marks,and representing to the public that they have rights to these marks.see,dist.order pi order.on june,the district court denied zaffina motion for reconsideration of its decision to issue a preliminary injunction.
zaffina and socal filed interlocutory appeals from the district court preliminary injunction.while these appeals were pending,the following developments occurred in the district court.
on august,the district court allowed a motion to withdraw filed by socal counsel,robert racine.the court ordered socal to retain new counsel within thirty days.when socal failed to do so,the district court struck socal answer to the complaint and ordered default to enter against it.
on february,the district court granted socal motion for partial summary judgment against zaffina on its lanham act claim.although zaffina had not filed an opposition to the motion for summary judgment,the district court examined the motion on the merits,and found it meritorious.see,dist.order sj order.socal then moved to withdraw all of its additional claims against zaffina.
on april,the district court entered final judgment against both defendants against socal because of its default,and against zaffina on the basis of the entry of summary judgment on socal lanham act claim.the district court vacated its preliminary injunction and issued a permanent injunction.the permanent injunction again prohibited zaffina,as well as any associated businesses,from using socal marks,from using urls containing these marks,and from representing to the public that they have rights to these marks.it also ordered zaffina to file a notice discontinuing or changing socal corporate name,file cancellations of all fictitious business name registrations using socal marks,and destroy or turn over to socal all marketing products created by zaffina for the purpose of promoting socal.in addition,the district court found zaffina and socal jointly and severally liable to socal in the amount of plus costs 
the district court final judgment mooted the appeals from the preliminary injunction.consequently,on april,we dismissed those appeals.
zaffina now appeals from the district court order entering summary judgment against him,offering a series of threshold challenges and several arguments on the merits 
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see united states arango,cir hambleton.lumber balkin enterprises,cir.
summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a celotex catrett.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we must determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,and whether the district court applied the law correctly.see fortyune am.multi cinema,cir.
an issue of fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson liberty lobby,george morris,cir.a dispute is genuine if a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson,at see freecyclesunnyvale freecycle network,cir.evidence may be offered to support or dispute a fact on summary judgment only if it could be presented in an admissible form at trial.fraser goodale,cir.c.
iii.threshold issues 
zaffina presents four threshold challenges to the district court entry of summary judgment.he argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction,that socal lacks the capacity to sue,that socal lacks standing,and that zaffina was not properly served with socal motion for summary judgment.these contentions are not correct.
jurisdiction 
zaffina first challenges the district court jurisdiction.he argues that socal suit involves no question of federal law,because it implicates neither trademark rights nor statutory trademark rights.it does not implicate trademark rights,according to zaffina,because there is no federal common law of trademark infringement.appellant br.at quoting toho,sears,roebuck,cir.socal suit also does not implicate statutory trademark rights,zaffina argues,because socal has not registered any of the contested marks.
this argument misapprehends the applicable law.the lanham act,ch,grants the federal district courts original jurisdiction over all actions arising under it.see a.another statute grants the district courts jurisdiction over any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents,plant variety protection,copyrights and trademarks.a.
the pertinent part of socal complaint is based on the provision of the lanham act codified at.this section,unlike certain other lanham act provisions,protects against infringement of unregistered marks and trade dress as well as registered marks.brookfield commc ns,coast entm t,cir two pesos,taco cabana.the elements of a cause of action under this provision,which are discussed below,do not include registration.
socal claim does arise under the lanham act,therefore,notwithstanding the fact that socal has not registered any trademarks.accordingly,the district court did have jurisdiction over socal claim pursuant to and.
capacity to sue 
zaffina second threshold argument is that socal lacks the capacity to sue.as noted earlier,the corporate powers of the original socal corporation were suspended in,apparently because it failed to pay the state corporate franchise tax.zaffina contends that socal is,therefore,a delinquent corporation that lacks the capacity to sue.he also asserts that under california law,a person conducting business under a fictitious business name may only sue once he has registered that name.
we have indeed held that,under california law,a delinquent corporation whose powers have been suspended may not bring suit and may not defend a legal action.united states acres of land,cir.however,california law is not dispositive in the present circumstances.
capacity to sue in federal court is governed by federal rule of civil procedure b.under this rule,an individual capacity to sue is determined by the law of the individual domicile a corporation capacity to sue is determined by the law under which it was organized and the capacity of all other parties to sue is determined by the law of the state where the court is located.b.there are two exceptions to rule b,however.the first of these exceptions is relevant in the current case.rule b a states that a partnership or other unincorporated association that lacks the capacity to sue under the law of the state in which the court is located may sue or be sued in its common name to enforce a substantive right existing under the united states constitution or laws.
the district court addressed socal capacity to sue in its pi order.for the purpose of its analysis,the district court assumed that socal is,in essence,the same entity as the original socal corporation.see pi order at.the court correctly recognized,however,that even on this assumption,the suspension of the original corporation powers does not necessarily extinguish socal capacity to pursue federal claims in federal court.
this conclusion follows from our previous decisions in comm.for idaho high desert,yost,cir,and sierra ass for env t ferc,cir.in both of those cases,corporations whose powers had been suspended under california law brought suit in federal court.idaho high desert involved a environmental education and advocacy organization that had forfeited its corporate charter for failure to file an annual report.at.our decision in sierra ass includes less factual detail,but the circumstances of that case appear to have been analogous to those of idaho high desert.see at.
in both cases,applying federal rule of civil procedure b,we treated the plaintiffs as unincorporated associations.we explained that an unincorporated association is a voluntary group of persons,without a charter,formed by mutual consent for the purpose of promoting a common objective.idaho high desert,at quoting local,united steelworkers united steelworkers,afl cio.we held that as unincorporated associations,the plaintiffs in those cases were permitted to sue in federal court,regardless of their capacity to sue under the law of the state in which the court sits,when they were suing for the purpose of enforcing a substantive right existing under the laws of the united states.idaho high desert,at see sierra ass n,at see also thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.
in its pi order,the district court expressly found that socal is an organization formed by the consent of individuals who share a common cause and,therefore,is an unincorporated association.see pi order at.the district court applied idaho high desert and sierra ass to the facts of this case and determined correctly that,notwithstanding the suspension of the corporate powers of the original socal corporation,socal should now be classified as an unincorporated association.see id.the district court implicitly relied on this reasoning in its sj order.the evidence does not place in genuine dispute the district court factual findings,and its legal conclusion was not wrong as a matter of law.see idaho high desert,at for purposes of rule b a,the determination of what constitutes an unincorporated association is a question of federal law.the district court was,therefore,correct in concluding that socal had the capacity to bring its lanham act claim,at least,in federal court.
zaffina also contends that socal lacks standing to sue,arguing that socal is not the real party in interest.rather,according to zaffina,socal is a straw plaintiff,and the real party in interest is david irete,the current president of socal board.
this argument is not meritorious.irete may be personally concerned with,and may have personally contributed to,socal litigation.the interests of legal persons commonly overlap with the interests of their officers and stakeholders.the fact that the interests of other parties are implicated by a suit does not deprive an unincorporated association of standing.a plaintiff has standing if he or she has alleged a personal stake in the litigation to justify exercise of the court remedial powers on his behalf.state of nevada employees ass n,bryan,cir quoting vill.of arlington heights metro.hous.dev.socal has,through its agents,asserted a personal stake in this case,namely the fact that its trademarks have been misappropriated.as we have previously held,ownership of an unregistered trademark is sufficient to establish standing under the lanham act.halicki films,llc sanderson sales,cir.zaffina contention that socal lacks standing to sue is,therefore,without merit.
service of process 
finally,zaffina contends that socal motion for summary judgment was not properly served on him.socal served the motion,by messenger,at the address provided by zaffina to the district court.zaffina argues,however,that the motion was delivered to the receptionist of the larger office at that address,and that that receptionist is not affiliated with zaffina,socal,or any of zaffina other businesses.zaffina admittedly received socal motion by email on january,one month before the district court ruled on the motion.however,he had not consented to service by electronic means.see.b e.
we have held that even where the party to be served received actual notice of the documents in question,the serving party must demonstrate exceptional good cause for failing to comply with rule b.magnuson video yesteryear,cir.socal did not fail to comply with rule b,however.a motion may be served by various methods that may not be used to serve a summons.compare.e,with.b.among other methods,a litigant may serve a motion by leaving it at a person office with a clerk or other person in charge or,if no one is in charge,in a conspicuous place in the office.b b i.
in the circumstances,the receptionist at the business address that zaffina had provided to the district court is reasonably deemed to be a clerk or other person in charge for the purposes of receiving documents.socal,therefore,properly effected service of its motion when its messenger delivered the motion to this receptionist.its service was not deficient even if it is assumed that,for some reason,the motion was not ultimately conveyed to zaffina.see also.b c a motion may be served by mailing it to the person last known address in which event service is complete upon mailing.
this last threshold challenge to the district court order is,therefore,also not meritorious.
the district court entry of summary judgment was based on socal lanham act claim,under a.this provision states,in part,that 
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof which is likely to cause confusion shall be liable in a civil action 
in order to prevail on a suit under this provision,a plaintiff must prove two basic elements it has a valid,protectable trademark,and the defendant use of the mark is likely to cause confusion.applied info.sciences ebay,cir see dep t of parks recreation bazaar del mundo,cir.the first of these basic elements is comprised of two the mark protectability and the plaintiff ownership of the mark.
therefore,socal is entitled to summary judgment if the facts that are not genuinely disputed demonstrate a that the contested marks are protectable b that socal owns these marks and c that zaffina use of these marks is likely to cause confusion.we begin our analysis with the first and third of these elements,to which the district court gave careful attention.
protectability 
whether a mark is protectable depends on its degree of distinctiveness.see zobmondo entm t,llc falls media,llc,cir.there are five traditional categories of distinctiveness generic,descriptive,suggestive,arbitrary,or fanciful.id.citing two pesos,at.generic marks are not eligible for trademark protection.see entrepreneur media.smith,cir.descriptive marks become protectab
