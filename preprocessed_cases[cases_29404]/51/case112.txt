having heard nothing from dluhos,cmg submitted a complaint to the national arbitration forum on june.the complaint requested a udrp dispute resolution proceeding and formally disputed dluhos right to use the domain name,alleging that the domain name was identical or confusingly similar to a trademark owned by the estate that dluhos had no rights or legitimate interests in the name and that he had registered and used the name in bad faith.dluhos had until june,to respond.rather than participating in the dispute resolution process to which he had agreed when he registered the domain name with nsi a year earlier,dluhos submitted a letter of limited appearance to the naf to explain that he would not submit to dispute resolution because he contested the naf jurisdiction over the matter.he added that he would instead file a complaint in federal court.on june,he did just that.he filed a complaint against the strasberg defendants and the cmg defendants with the district court challenging the constitutionality of the dispute resolution process.
