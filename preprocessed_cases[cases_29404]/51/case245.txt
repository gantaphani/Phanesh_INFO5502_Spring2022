lorillard tobacco company sued a e oil,incorporated,its two shareholders,and one of its employees alleging that they violated lorillard trademark for newport cigarettes.the district court granted lorillard motion for summary judgment,awarding in statutory damages.the district court subsequently determined that lorillard was entitled to attorneys fees and entered a permanent injunction.the defendants appeal only the decision determining lorillard entitlement to attorneys fees.we affirm.
thomas kuruvilla and emmanuel joseph each own half of a e oil a e,a corporation that runs a gas station and in chicago,illinois.the corporation employs jose kurian,who is kuruvilla brother.among other items,the station sells cigarettes by the pack.in particular,they sell newport cigarettes,which are manufactured by lorillard.
during a routine visit to the station,a lorillard sales representative noticed five cartons of newport cigarettes that she suspected were counterfeit.she purchased six packs from the suspected counterfeit cartons,which she then sent to lorillard laboratory for inspection.the inspection concluded that all six packs were counterfeit,based on discrepancies in the packaging,printing,and product codes from authentic newport cigarette packs.all of the packs also bore fake tax stamps.based on this evidence,lorillard filed suit against a e,kuruvilla,joseph,and kurian under the lanham act,et,for trademark infringement and obtained a seizure order.the seizure order resulted in the confiscation of three opened packs of counterfeit newport cigarettes found in the station office,which bore the same indicia of counterfeiting.
the critical question remaining in this case is whether a e knew about the counterfeit cigarettes found in the station resolution of the attorneys fees issue requires discerning whether the defendants knowingly sold counterfeit cigarettes.kuruvilla claims that he bought newport cigarettes for resale exclusively from a wholesaler called midwest cash and carry.there was no evidence in the record that midwest cash and carry ever distributed counterfeit cigarettes or that counterfeit cigarettes were ever recovered there.kuruvilla stated that the only other possible source for cigarettes to have entered the store inventory is through customer returns,which occurred at a rate of about one pack every two weeks.a e,however,would not sell returned packs.before the seizure,a customer returned a pack of newport cigarettes,complaining about their quality.kurian,who was working at the time,took another pack of newport cigarettes from a e stock,opened it,and tried one.he agreed with the customer that the cigarette tasted terrible.kurian left the returned pack and the opened pack from the stock in the office,and later told kuruvilla about them.the returned pack and the opened pack from stock were among the three packs seized by lorillard.the origin of the third pack remains unexplained.
the counterfeit cigarettes found at a e were not an isolated occurrence.beginning in the summer of,lorillard became aware of a rash of counterfeit cigarettes infiltrating the chicago market.as a result,lorillard sued over fifty sellers and distributors and investigated a common source.
lorillard claims that the counterfeit cigarettes found at a e came from a company called cigarettes.a e admitted purchasing items from cigarettes,such as soda pop and cigars,through a contact person known to a e only as mohammed,but a e claims never to have purchased any cigarettes from cigarettes.the evidence,however,shows that amin arba endorsed one of the checks kuruvilla wrote to pay cigarettes,and that amin arba is an alias for amin umar,who has been linked to the counterfeit cigarettes.
after initially obtaining a default judgment against the defendants,which the district court subsequently vacated,and after contentious discovery proceedings,lorillard filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion,concluding that a e knew it was selling counterfeit cigarettes,and awarded lorillard in statutory damages.in particular,the district court explained that the individual defendants ignored several warning signs,such as their association with umar,that the newports for sale at a e might have been counterfeit.coupled with defendants behavior at the discovery stage of the litigation,the court finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish that a e,and the individual defendants had knowledge that they were selling counterfeit cigarettes.lorillard then sought a permanent injunction and a declaration of its entitlement to attorneys fees under the statute,which the district court also granted.lorillard subsequently submitted a motion for attorneys fees totaling,although the district court docket indicates that the final amount of the award has not yet been determined the defendants do not appeal the summary judgment ruling that awarded statutory damages or the permanent injunction,but they do appeal the district court decision that lorillard is entitled to attorneys fees.
ordinarily,a district court decision to award attorneys fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion.basf old world trading,cir a decision to award attorneys fees under the lanham act is firmly committed to the district court discretion citation omitted.the award of fees in this case,however,was not made in the discretion of the district court,but rather followed from statutory language requiring the award of attorneys fees if the defendants knowingly used a counterfeit mark.b.because the award of attorneys fees follows from an application of statutory language,we review the district court application of the statute de novo as a question of law.see sosebee astrue,cir noting that although review of an award of attorneys fees is normally reviewed for an abuse of discretion,i f the district court reached its conclusion because of its interpretation of relevant law,then we review that question of law de novo because a district court application of an erroneous view of the law is by definition an abuse of discretion.citation omitted see also rolex watch,michel,cir noting that while assessing a district court determination of attorneys fees is normally reviewed for an abuse of discretion,we review de novo the district court legal analysis and interpretation of the lanham act.citation omitted.in effect,this standard requires us to consider whether the evidence,when viewed in the light most favorable to the defendants,demonstrates that a e knowingly sold counterfeit cigarettes a determination made by the district court in its summary judgment ruling,even though the defendants limited their appeal to the attorneys fee award and did not appeal the summary judgment against them.
relevant here,lorillard sued the defendants based on.this statute makes a person liable who use s in commerce any reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.a.lorillard alleged that the defendants sold counterfeit newport cigarettes,thus violating the statute.the district court awarded attorneys fees based on b,which states that 
in assessing damages under subsection a,the court shall,unless the court finds extenuating circumstances,enter judgment for three times such profits or damages,whichever is greater,together with a reasonable attorney fee,in the case of any violation of section a of this act a or section of title,united states code,that consists of intentionally using a mark or designation,knowing such mark or designation is a counterfeit mark as defined in section d of this act d,in connection with the sale,offering for sale,or distribution of goods or services.
b emphasis added.to prove knowledge of the counterfeiting,lorillard was not required to prove the defendants actual knowledge knowledge includes a willful blindness or a failure to investigate because one was afraid of what the inquiry would yield.louis vuitton lee,cir.if willful blindness occurs,an award of attorneys fees is required by the statutory language absent extenuating circumstances.b the court shall enter judgment with a reasonable attorney fee.see also hard rock caf√© licensing concession,willful blindness is sufficient to trigger the mandatory provisions of subsection citing lee,at.
in this appeal,we must determine whether the record demonstrates that the defendants acted with knowledge or willful blindness in selling counterfeit cigarettes.the district court made a finding of knowledge in the context of awarding damages to lorillard.after thoroughly reviewing the record,we find that the evidence demonstrates that the defendants acted with knowledge or willful blindness.notably,the defendants do not contest on appeal the counterfeit nature of the cigarettes recovered from the station.see.br.at lorillard seized nine counterfeit newport cigarette packs from the a e each of the nine packets apparently bore fake.furthermore,the tax stamps on the counterfeit cigarettes were noticeably fraudulent.lee,at finding willfulness when shop owner failed to consider that expensive goods are unlikely to display poor workmanship,to be lined with purple vinyl,and to be sold by itinerant peddlers at prices.kuruvilla,who buys the cigarettes by the carton,affirmed that he placed the cigarettes on the shelf for sale by the pack.while stocking the cigarettes,he testified that he checks for the tax stamps and examines each pack every time,explaining that before i put them in the counter,i open up a carton,i do check.yet somehow he never noticed any discrepancies in the counterfeit tax stamps,notwithstanding the obviousness of the counterfeit.later,however,in an affidavit submitted in opposition to the summary judgment motion,kuruvilla denies checking tax stamps most of the time,thus contradicting his deposition testimony.a defendant,however,can not create sham issues of fact with affidavits that contradict their prior depositions.ineichen ameritech,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.kuruvilla attempt to create such a sham issue negates his feigned ignorance.
the record contains other contradictory evidence.for example,when kuruvilla spoke with his brother,kurian,about the seizure of the three packs of cigarettes,kurian told kuruvilla about the source of two of the packs.specifically,one pack came from a customer returning a pack of cigarettes,and a second pack from kurian testing a pack from the stock that likewise tasted terrible.kuruvilla,however,contradicted his brother and testified subsequently in a deposition that the cigarette packs belonged to kurian personally.kuruvilla attempted to retract his damaging deposition testimony by stating in the affidavit submitted in opposition to the summary judgment motion that t he three open packs of cigarettes were stale cigarettes returned by customers.again,this statement merely creates a sham issue of fact,since the defendants do not contest on appeal that the seized cigarettes were counterfeits,not just stale.see id.
furthermore,the defendants fail to present any view of the evidence that plausibly explains the presence of counterfeit cigarettes at the station or that refutes lorillard proffered evidence of an illegitimate source.a e and its owners and employee posit only two possible sources for the counterfeits entering the station inventory through their supplier midwest cash and carry or through customer returns.a e would not resell returned packs.thus,customer returns can not account for the six packs of counterfeit cigarettes obtained from the sales shelf.furthermore,customer returns occurred at a rate of about one pack every two weeks,and with the high turnover of inventory kuruvilla purchased cigarettes weekly,customer returns can not explain the six packs found in the sales inventory or the five cartons of suspected counterfeit cigarettes originally viewed by the lorillard sales representative.
the other source defendants proffer is the wholesaler midwest cash and carry.there is no evidence in the record,however,that midwest cash and carry ever trafficked in counterfeit cigarettes.on appeal,the defendants suggest that counterfeit cartons could have been returned to midwest cash and carry by another customer,and then,without midwest cash and carry or the defendants knowing they were handling counterfeits,the counterfeits were resold to the defendants.other than kuruvilla speculative deposition testimony,there is no evidence of counterfeit cigarettes at midwest cash and carry.reed amax coal,cir a bare contention that an issue of fact exists is insufficient to raise a factual issue.citation omitted.more significantly,a e never argued in its response to lorillard motion for summary judgment before the district court that the counterfeit cigarettes could have come from midwest cash and carry.accordingly,a e has forfeited this argument.see benefit,caremark rx,cir c ontentions,not presented in opposition to summary judgment,have been forfeited.
there is simply no evidence in the record to support defendants claims of an innocent source for the counterfeit cigarettes.furthermore,the defendants fail to present any evidence to counter lorillard evidence that the counterfeit cigarettes came from cigarettes,a supplier connected to counterfeit cigarettes.although the defendants denied in depositions ever purchasing cigarettes from cigarettes,they admit that they could have done so.in fact,they acknowledge that they did purchase other products from this company whose name makes it an obvious source for cigarettes.one check written by a e to cigarettes bears the endorsement of amin arba,an alias for amin umar,who as shown below is a known source for counterfeit cigarettes.umar would drive a green van around to various gas stations selling counterfeit cigarettes presumably along with other goods and,it can be reasonably inferred,receiving checks made out to cigarettes.many other checks to cigarettes from other retailers also bear umar endorsement.in other related investigations and lawsuits,lorillard has linked umar specifically to sales of newport counterfeit cigarettes joseph,the of a e,also does business with cigarettes at his other gas stations and,although joseph denies ever speaking to umar,umar telephone records indicate that he placed a call to joseph telephone number once.finally,a e conduct during discovery suggests that it knew about the counterfeit cigarettes.notably,a e did not produce the checks written to cigarettes until july,after a e had inaccurately represented to the district court that lorillard already possessed all business records in defendant possession.the district court found that the individual defendants in this case were less than forthcoming with lorillard at the discovery stage of the litigation stalled and only cooperated after they were held in default.
standing alone,the obvious nature of the counterfeit tax stamps,coupled with the testimony that kuruvilla regularly checked the stamps,would be sufficient to conclude that the defendants acted with willful blindness,at holding that knowledge under the lanham act includes a willful blindness or a failure to investigate because one was afraid of what the inquiry would yield.this case,however,provides additional evidence connecting the defendants to a known source of counterfeit cigarettes.in particular,despite contrary circumstantial evidence,they denied purchasing cigarettes from a known counterfeit source.yet they provided no plausible innocent source for the counterfeits.all this,coupled with the less than forthcoming conduct at the discovery stage,further suggests knowledge or willful blindness to the counterfeit nature of the cigarettes.the only reasonable inference is that the defendants knew of,or were willfully blind to,the sale of counterfeit cigarettes at the station.
when reviewing an appeal from summary judgment,we recognize that,in determining whether a defendant acted with willful blindness to counterfeit products,a s a general rule,a party state of mind such as knowledge or intent is a question of fact for the factfinder,to be determined after trial.chanel,italian activewear of florida,cir citing morissette united states.united
