tsi,a michigan corporation,brought this lawsuit for trademark infringement and unfair competition against thermoscan,a georgia corporation.tsi sought monetary damages and injunctive relief,as well as cancellation of thermoscan allegedly infringing trademark.the district court granted thermoscan motion to enforce a purported settlement that the parties reached during oral argument on thermoscan motion for summary judgment.we reversed the district court order in a prior appeal because a material dispute existed as to whether a meeting of the minds had actually occurred regarding the purported settlement.the case was then remanded for a ruling on thermoscan motion for summary judgment and,if necessary,for a trial on the merits,thermoscan,cir.after allowing the parties to file supplemental briefs,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of thermoscan.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
tsi performs infrared examinations of the human body.after analyzing the resulting images,tsi prepares diagnostic reports that are provided to its clients or their physicians.
most of tsi clients are residents of the greater detroit,michigan area.tsi performs approximately examinations each week at its facility in huntington woods,michigan.although a few clients learn about tsi services on their own,the large majority are referred by their physicians.
on november,tsi received the formal registration of its trademark from the united states patent and trademark office.tsi trademark appears on its office door,stationery,literature,reports to physicians and patients,and informational and advertising materials.
although tsi has sold various medical devices in the past,it no longer markets any products.tsi promotes its services primarily through maintaining and developing contacts with physicians.in addition,it seeks to cultivate relationships with individuals who conduct radio news programs on which tsi services might be mentioned.tsi does not,however,advertise in any magazines,professional journals,or other publications.
thermoscan,a georgia corporation that began its operations in march of,manufactures electronic ear thermometers.sales of these devices increased from million in to over million in.during the same period,thermoscan advertising and promotional expenses increased from million to over million.
on november,thermoscan filed an application to register thermoscan as a trademark for use on its thermometers.it began using the thermoscan trademark on its thermometers in,prior to the completion of the trademark registration process.the united states patent and trademark office accepted thermoscan application and published it for opposition on january.a registration for thermoscan was issued on september.
in october of,tsi attorney informed philip hoekstra,the president of tsi,that thermoscan was using the thermoscan trademark on its thermometers.the attorney recommended that tsi take action against thermoscan for infringement of the trademark.hoekstra decided against pursuing any action at that time because he believed that the thermometers would not interfere with tsi business.
over a year later,in december of,hoekstra sent tsi attorney a facsimile with a subject line reading ref infringement on trademark.that communication included a catalog advertisement for thermoscan thermometer.hoekstra became concerned with thermoscan use of the thermoscan trademark,and the possibility that it might create confusion with tsi services,when he saw the thermometer being sold in drugstores and being advertised in magazines and on television.
in,the gillette company acquired thermoscan.braun,a subsidiary of gillette,began marketing thermoscan thermometers in april of.the trademark braun now appears on all thermoscan packaging and on the thermometers themselves.
despite its awareness of thermoscan products and the thermoscan trademark,tsi did not take any action against thermoscan until august of,when tsi attorney sent thermoscan a protest letter.on september,tsi commenced a proceeding in the united states patent and trademark office to cancel thermoscan registration.tsi cancellation proceeding was suspended to await the disposition of the present lawsuit.
procedural background 
this lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the western district of michigan on january.tsi complaint alleges trademark infringement and unfair competition,in violation of and a,respectively.in addition,tsi requested that the district court,pursuant to its authority under,issue an order directing the commissioner of patents and trademarks to cancel thermoscan trademark registration.
thermoscan filed a motion for summary judgment in october of.the district court conducted a hearing on the motion several months later.during oral argument,the parties reached a purported settlement.the district court then summarized for the record the understanding between the parties with respect to the settlement.despite this development,the parties were unable to agree on the specific terms of their purported agreement in subsequent discussions.thermoscan eventually filed a motion to enforce the settlement or,in the alternative,for a ruling on its motion for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion to enforce the settlement agreement as drafted by thermoscan and dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice on april.
tsi appealed the district court order.we reversed and remanded the case,concluding that it was an abuse of discretion for the court to impose thermoscan version of the settlement upon tsi,thermoscan,cir.
the district court allowed the parties to file supplemental briefs on the motion for summary judgment after the remand.on october,the court granted thermoscan motion for summary judgment and entered judgment against tsi.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
a district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.holloway brush,cir.summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering such a motion,the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
whether a likelihood of confusion test 
in order to prevail on its trademark infringement and unfair competition claims,tsi must establish that thermoscan trademark creates a likelihood of confusion regarding the origin of the goods or services offered by tsi and thermoscan.daddy junky music stores,big daddy family music,cir the touchstone of liability under is whether the defendant use of the disputed mark is likely to cause confusion among consumers regarding the origin of the goods offered by the parties.holiday inns,reservation,cir explaining that a party seeking to avoid summary judgment in a case alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition,in violation of and a,must establish that genuine factual disputes exist concerning those factors that are material to whether confusion is likely in the marketplace as a result of the alleged infringement.
this court has identified eight factors that are relevant in determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists the strength of the plaintiff mark,the relatedness of the goods or services offered by the plaintiff and the defendant,the similarity of the marks,any evidence of actual confusion,the marketing channels used by the parties,the probable degree of purchaser care and sophistication,the defendant intent in selecting its mark,and the likelihood of either party expanding its product line using the marks.daddy junky music stores,at citing frisch restaurants,elby big boy,cir.not all of these factors will be relevant in every case,and in the course of applying them,t he ultimate question remains whether relevant consumers are likely to believe that the products or services offered by the parties are affiliated in some way.homeowners group,home mktg.specialists,cir.
the significance of these factors also varies with the form of trademark infringement at issue.in the first and most common type of infringement,similar marks on directly competing goods or services cause confusion over their origin.this situation is known as palming off,because the defendant junior user misleads the public about the source of its goods or services,leading consumers to purchase the defendant products in the belief that they are buying the plaintiff.ameritech,american info.techs,cir explaining that in palming off,similar marks on competing goods can cause the consumer to mistakenly buy the infringing defendant product as the plaintiff the defendant tries to palm off his goods as the plaintiff.a second form of of sponsorship occurs where the goods do not directly compete,but the trademarks are so similar that consumers might mistakenly believe that the junior user is associated with the senior user.id.in this scenario,the defendant seeks to capitalize on the plaintiff goodwill and established reputation.id.the final type of infringement involving confusingly similar trademarks is reverse confusion of sponsorship.id.reverse confusion occurs where 
the junior user saturates the market with a similar trademark and overwhelms the senior user.the public comes to assume the senior user products are really the junior user or that the former has become somehow connected to the latter.the result is that the senior user loses the value of the product identity,corporate identity,control over its goodwill and reputation,and ability to move into new markets.
id.in the present case,tsi allegations concern both palming off and reverse confusion.
the determination of whether a likelihood of confusion exists is a mixed question of fact and law.data concepts,digital consulting,cir.any disputes about the evidence that pertains to the eight factors set forth above presents a factual issue.id.at noting that i f the facts relevant to the applicable factors are contested,factual findings must be made with respect to each of these factors.in contrast,the further determination of whether a given set of foundational facts establishes a likelihood of confusion is a legal conclusion.homeowners group,at data concepts,at explaining that the balancing of the factual findings to determine the ultimate issue of likelihood of confusion is a question of law.
because this appeal follows the district court grant of summary judgment,we must first determine whether the district court correctly held that no genuine issues of material fact were presented regarding the likelihood of confusion factors.homeowners group,at.the second step of our review involves an inquiry into the legal question of whether the relevant facts create a likelihood of confusion.daddy junky music stores,at noting that after examining the relevant factual findings,the reviewing court must determine whether those findings overall reveal a likelihood of confusion.pursuant to the standard that applies in reviewing a district court grant of summary judgment,both stages of the review are conducted de novo.id.at clarifying that a de novo standard of review applies to all aspects of the district court grant of summary judgment in a trademark infringement case.
strength of tsi trademark 
this factor focuses on the distinctiveness of a mark and its recognition among the public.homeowners group,at explaining that a mark is strong if it is highly distinctive,if the public readily accepts it as the hallmark of a particular source internal quotation marks and citation omitted daddy junky music stores,at the more distinct a mark,the more likely is the confusion resulting from its infringement,and therefore,the more protection it is due.citation omitted.generally,the strength of a mark is the result of its unique nature,its owner intensive advertising efforts,or both.daddy junky music stores,at noting that public acceptance of a mark can occur when the mark is unique,when it has received intensive advertisement,or both citation omitted.
a trademark distinctiveness and resulting strength also depends partly upon which of four categories it occupies generic,descriptive,suggestive,and fanciful or arbitrary.id.whereas a descriptive trademark specifically describes a characteristic or ingredient of an article,champions golf club,v.the champions golf club,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted,a n arbitrary mark has a significance recognized in everyday life,but the thing it normally signifies is unrelated to the product or service to which the mark is attached,such as camel cigarettes or apple computers.daddy junky music stores,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
fanciful or arbitrary marks therefore represent the far extreme on a spectrum of increasing strength among the categories.id.at.even an arbitrary trademark is not a strong mark,however,if it does not achieve broad public recognition across product lines.homeowners group,at hms may indeed be arbitrary and hence inherently distinctive,yet have little customer recognition or strength in the market,or perhaps have high recognition which is limited to a particular product or market segment.see also daddy junky music stores,at noting that a ssigning a category to a mark constitutes only a single step in determining the strength of the mark.
the district court determined that tsi trademark is descriptive because it describes the services that tsi performs.we agree with this conclusion,and so apparently does tsi.hoekstra,tsi president,testified that tsi chose the name because it the best description,in a succinct manner,as to what it is that we doing.
moreover,tsi does not conduct vigorous advertising,but instead seeks to establish contacts within the medical community and relies upon periodic discussions of its services on radio shows.a company lack of advertising does not necessarily reduce the strength of its trademark.see the morningside group morningside capital group,cir noting that w hen a claimant has no need for traditional advertising because of the nature of its market,it should not feel compelled to advertise simply to protect its service mark.the absence of any advertising,however,diminishes the likelihood that most people will be familiar with a company mark,absent evidence that its goods or services have achieved broad public recognition.
tsi does not attempt to establish that its trademark is widely recognized among the general population.instead,it relies upon the presumption that a trademark that has been registered and uncontested for five years is a strong mark.data concepts,at stating that such a presumption exists wynn oil thomas,cir noting that once a mark has been registered for five years,the mark must be considered strong and worthy of full protection.
tsi reliance upon this presumption is misplaced.even where a trademark is incontestable and worthy of full protection,the significance of its presumed strength will depend upon its recognition among members of the public.treating a valid,incontestable trademark as an exceptionally strong mark for the purpose of determining whether confusion is likely to occur,without examining whether the mark is distinctive and in the general population,would shift the focus away from the key question of whether relevant consumers are likely to believe that the products or services offered by the parties are affiliated in some way.homeowner group,at.although a trademark may be strong and worthy of full protection because it is valid and incontestable,wynn oil,at,that does not necessarily mean that its strength is particularly relevant to the ultimate issue of whether confusion is likely to occur.
tsi trademark,although valid and incontestable,is not an especially strong mark.not only is the mark descriptive,but it also lacks broad public recognition.as a result,this factor does not weigh strongly in tsi favor.
relatedness of the goods or services 
this court has identified three categories regarding the relatedness of the goods or services with which trademarks are associated 
first,if the parties compete directly by offering their goods or services,confusion is likely if the marks are sufficiently similar second,if the goods or services are somewhat related but not competitive,the likelihood of confusion will turn on other factors third,if the goods or services are totally unrelated,confusion is unlikely.
daddy junky music stores,at.the relatedness inquiry therefore focuses on whether goods or services with comparable marks that are similarly marketed and appeal to common customers are likely to lead consumers to believe that they come from the same source,or are somehow connected with or sponsored by a common company.homeowners group,at.goods or services are not necessarily related,however,simply because they coexist in the same broad industry.id.
the district court concluded that although tsi and thermoscan might coexist in a very broad industry of medical applications of thermology and infrared identification of heat,tsi services and thermoscan goods are not so related that any confusion is likely to occur.we agree with this conclusion.tsi and thermoscan offer goods and services that utilize similar technology in very different ways.moreover,because they market their goods and services to different segments of the population,tsi and thermoscan do not compete in the marketplace.
tsi contends that the district court prematurely determined that this factor weighs against a likelihood of confusion,and that it instead should have concentrated on the other factors.this position relies upon a belief that the present case implicates daddy junky music stores second category of related goods or services,where the goods are somewhat related but do not compete.we believe that any commonality between tsi services and thermoscan thermometers is insufficient to establish that their products are related for the purpose of determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists.homeowners group,at explaining that companies that operate at different levels in the broad real estate industry and sell to two completely distinct sets of buyers are not similar,even though their services are not totally unrelated.as a result,the second factor supports a finding that confusion is not likely to occur.
similarity of the marks 
this factor entails more than a simple comparison of the trademarks in question.id.explaining that in evaluating similarity of marks,it is axiomatic in trademark law that comparison is not the test internal quotation marks and citation omitted.instead,the relevant inquiry is whether a particular trademark,when viewed alone,would lead to uncertainty about the goods or services that it identifies.daddy junky music stores,at noting that courts must determine whether a given mark would confuse the public when viewed alone,in order to account for the possibility that sufficiently similar marks may confuse consumers who do not have both marks before them but who may have a general,vague,or even hazy,impression or recollection of the other party mark internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also homeowners group,at a court must determine,in the light of what occurs in the marketplace,whether the mark will be confusing to the public when singly presented.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as such,a detailed analysis of specific features of a trademark is not appropriate rather,courts must view marks in their entirety and focus on their overall impressions,not individual features.daddy junky music stores,at.
the district court found that the degree of similarity between the marks is evident.as the district court noted,the two marks and thermoscan are identical except that tsi trademark has an a rather than an o and includes a dash preceding the s.although the typeface and graphical design of the trademarks differ,these contrasts relate to the marks individual features rather than the overall impressions that the marks convey.id.these differences,therefore,do not negate the high degree of similarity between the marks.
thermoscan contends that despite these similarities,the prominent display of the braun name on all thermometers and packaging reduces the likelihood of confusion.several cases support this position.see vitarroz borden,cir noting that w hen similar marks are always presented in association with company names,the likelihood of confusion is reduced,drizzle,cir the fact that a trademark is always used in conjunction with a company name may be considered by the trial court as bearing on the likelihood of confusion.the presence of the braun label on thermoscan thermometers,however,does not eliminate the similarity between the trademarks.instead,this labeling diminishes the likelihood of confusion created by the comparable marks and reduces the importance of this factor.
based upon these considerations,we believe that an average consumer might be unable to recall which trademark identifies tsi services as opposed to thermoscan thermometers.the similarity of the marks thus increases the likelihood of confusion,although the presence of the braun name on thermoscan products decreases the significance of this factor.
evidence of actual confusion 
evidence of actual confusion is undoubtedly the best evidence of likelihood of confusion.daddy junky music stores,at citation omitted.where evidence of actual confusion exists,the weight to which such evidence is entitled varies depending upon both the type and amount of confusion that occurs.homeowners group,at noting that it does not follow that any type or quantum of such evidence of actual confusion is entitled to significant weight.this court has explained that the existence of only a handful of instances of actual confusion after a significant time or a significant degree of concurrent sales under the respective marks may even lead to an inference than no likelihood of confusion exists.id.similarly,confusion that is brief or that occurs among individuals who are not familiar with the products in question is entitled to considerably less weight than are chronic mistakes and serious confusion of actual customers.id.
tsi offered messages that were sent to its internet address,info.com,between november,and july,as evidence that consumers mistakenly believe that it manufactures ear thermometers.six of these messages indicate the writer belief that tsi produces and sells thermometers.specifically,two prospective customers requested rebates or coupons for thermoscan ear thermometers,and a third consumer wanted to obtain a catalog or address of the nearest distributor for the thermometers.the fourth and fifth messages were inquiries about repairs or replacements from individuals who owned thermoscan thermometers that were not working properly.finally,someone wanted to know whether tsi was the manufacturer of thermascan thermometers because of a desire to obtain year compliance information.
most of the remaining inquiries had international origins,including distributors of medical devices and research equipment in austria,eastern europe,japan,and the philippines,a person working with horses in canada,an individual planning to build an alternative hospital in guatemala,a computer hardware development company in china,a company involved in the application of industrial thermography in the automobile industry and electronics in mexico,and a medical company in turkey.the remaining messages were from a medical supply trading company,a physical therapist in hawaii,and an individual with a general interest in tsi medical equipment.all of these businesses and individuals requested information relating to the cost and application of thermography equipment and tsi products.
the district court determined that only the six incidents where individuals contacted tsi to inquire about thermoscan thermometers might support a finding that the authors were confused.according to the court,the remaining messages did not allow for a finding of actual confusion because none of these inquiries mentioned thermometers.instead,their authors sought information pertaining to thermography equipment.we agree with this aspect of the district court analysis.these messages might support a finding that the authors were confused about tsi services,but they do not provide evidence of any confusion regarding whether tsi and thermoscan are associated with each other.
the district court then concluded that the six messages that specifically mentioned thermometers failed to present a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether any actual confusion occurred.to the extent that the district court based its conclusion upon a belief that tsi evidence has no bearing on whether actual confusion occurred,we disagree with its analysis.tsi correctly emphasizes that in the context of a motion for summary judgment,any evidence of confusion,regardless of how minimal,weighs in its favor.daddy junky music stores,at concluding that the district court should reconsider the significance of a single incident of actual confusion on remand.as this court explained in daddy junky music stores,b earing in mind that a successful lanham act plaintiff only must show a sufficient potential of confusion,not actual confusion,the fact that some confusion already has occurred favors plaintiff at least to some extent.at emphasis in original.
the six messages indicating uncertainty regarding whether tsi manufactures any products or only provides services could support a finding that those people were actually confused.but the weight to which those messages are entitled for the purpose of determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists among the general public is a different issue.specifically,several factors considerably reduce the legal significance of tsi evidence of confusion.
first,the six misdirected messages become much less probative of actual confusion when measured against the number of people who have purchased thermoscan thermometers and who have requested information about them.thermoscan sold ear thermometers between january,and july,and it receives,on average,calls each month on its telephone number.six confused customers is legally insignificant in light of the scale of thermoscan operations.checkpoint,check point software,cir explaining that the evidence of actual confusion,including the plaintiff receipt of and customer inquiries pertaining to the defendant products,was legally insignificant because of the size of these companies,and the large number of,customer inquiries,and other communications they receive on a daily basis.
second,the fact that the confusion occurred in messages raises the possibility that consumers sent the inquiries about the thermometers to tsi rather than to thermoscan because they were inattentive or careless,as opposed to being actually confused.johnson son,johnson,cir the owner of a trademark is not entitled to a guarantee against confusion in the minds of careless and indifferent buyers,and merely occasional cases of confusion or thoughtless error by very inattentive purchasers are of very little significance in trademark and unfair competition cases.internal citation omitted.a consumer using a popular internet search engine to locate an address for thermoscan could find tsi website if he or she mistakenly conducted a search for thermascan rather than for thermoscan.duluth mesabi publ g,cir finding the plaintiff receipt of the defendant mail and phone calls to be de minimis and to show inattentiveness on the part of the caller or sender rather than actual confusion.the fact that tsi does not advertise increases the likelihood that the people who sent the messages to tsi were inattentive or careless when attempting to find the address for thermoscan,rather than confused about the source of the ear thermometers.
finally,all of the instances which allegedly support a finding of actual confusion occurred between november,and july.the absence of any evidence of confusion prior to this time period,despite the coexistence of the goods and services since,supports a conclusion that consumers have not been confused about whether tsi is affiliated with thermoscan.homeowners group,at noting that the existence of only a handful of instances of actual confusion after a significant time or a significant degree of concurrent sales under the respective marks may even lead to an inference than no likelihood of confusion exists.moreover,the lack of any indication that consumers were confused prior to november of further bolsters the likelihood that the messages were due to carelessness rather than actual confusion.
based upon all of these considerations,we conclude that the six messages provide only weak support for finding a likelihood of confusion.this factor therefore does not tilt the balance of determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists to a significant degree in either direction.daddy junky music stores,at noting that the absence of evidence of actual confusion is generally entitled to little weight because of the difficulty in obtaining such evidence.
marketing channels used 
the fifth factor requires an analysis of the parties predominant customers and their marketing approaches.homeowners group,at noting that this factor consists of considerations of how and to whom the respective goods or services of the parties are sold.where the parties have different customers and market their goods or services in different ways,the likelihood of confusion decreases.id.explaining that dissimilarities between the parties customers and their methods of marketing their products reduces the likelihood of confusion.this factor becomes particularly important where the other factors are not helpful,because it is very significant in illuminating what actually happens in the marketplace.id.
tsi argues that both parties promote their goods and services to health care professionals,and that they both make use of the internet.the district court,however,found significant differences between the predominant customers of tsi and thermoscan,and concluded that the parties use of the internet as a marketing channel was not entitled to significant weight.we agree.
with regard to the parties customers,thermoscan sells approximately percent of its thermometers directly to consumers for household use,and the remaining percent are sold to physicians and hospitals.tsi,in contrast,depends upon referrals from physicians for the vast majority of its business.these customer bases are sufficiently distinct so as to greatly reduce the likelihood of confusion.
turning to the marketing channels actually used,neither party disputes that consumers can learn about their respective goods and services on the internet.tsi presented no additional evidence of common marketing channels.such proof was in fact unavailable because tsi does not conduct any formal advertising,but instead relies upon its relationship with physicians and the possibility of radio personalities publicizing its services.
nor does the availability of information about the parties goods and services on the internet automatically lead to the conclusion that they use common marketing channels.although we have not previously addressed this issue,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit has explained that s ome use of the internet for marketing,however,does not alone and as a matter of law constitute overlapping marketing channels.entrepreneur media,smith,cir emphasis in original.instead,the relevant questions include whether both parties use the web as a substantial marketing and advertising channel,whether the parties marks are utilized in conjunction with products,and whether the parties marketing channels overlap in any other way.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted emphasis in original.we believe that these considerations are appropriate,because a reference to internet use is no more proof of a company marketing channels than the fact that it is listed in the yellow pages of the telephone directory.
applying the entrepreneur media factors to the present case,tsi does not contend that it uses the internet to market its services,much less that the internet is a substantial means for it to establish the personal contacts that it seeks to cultivate with physicians.the second consideration similarly does not support a finding that the parties use of the internet is significant for the purpose of determining
