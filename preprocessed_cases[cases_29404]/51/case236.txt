american needle sued the national football league nfl,its member football teams,and nfl properties llc to whom we will collectively refer as the nfl defendants,along with reebok international reebok,alleging that the teams exclusive licensing agreement with reebok violated the sherman antitrust act.see.the district court granted summary judgment to the nfl defendants.we affirm.
as the most successful and popular professional sports league in america today,the nfl needs little introduction.indeed,the nfl has inspired countless hours of heated and discussion about the league years of history,including its great players,championship teams,and memorable games.but the only discussion the nfl inspires here involves aspects of the league that are not as well known the league corporate structure,and the nature of its relationships with its member teams and the entities charged with licensing those teams intellectual property.
for those who do not know,the nfl is an unincorporated association of now separately owned and operated football teams that collectively produce an annual series or season of over interrelated football games.each season culminates in a championship game better known as the super bowl.as such,the product that the teams produce extensive coordination and integration between the teams.after all,nfl football is produced only when two teams play a football game.thus,although each team is a separate corporate entity or partnership unto itself,no team can produce a product of nfl itself,much less a full season of games or the super bowl.likewise,the teams individual success is necessarily linked to the success of the league as a whole to put it another way,it makes little difference if a team wins the super bowl if no one cares about the super bowl.
realizing that the success of the nfl as a whole was in their best interests,in the early the individual teams sought to collectively promote the nfl is,the intellectual property of the nfl and its member compete against other forms of entertainment.with this promotional effort in mind,in the nfl teams formed nfl properties a separate corporate entity charged with developing,licensing,and marketing the intellectual property the teams owned,such as their logos,trademarks,and other indicia and conduct ing and engag ing in advertising campaigns and promotional ventures on behalf of the nfl and its member teams.among other things,the nfl teams authorized nfl properties to grant licenses to vendors so the vendors could use the teams intellectual property to manufacture and sell various kinds of consumer products that bear the teams logos and such as team jerseys,shirts,flags,and,as pertinent here,like baseball caps and stocking hats.
for a while after its establishment,nfl properties granted headwear licenses to a number of different vendors simultaneously one of those vendors was american needle,which held an nfl headwear license for over years.but then in,the nfl teams authorized nfl properties to solicit bids from the vendors for an exclusive headwear license.reebok won the bidding war,and in the nfl teams allowed nfl properties to grant an exclusive license to reebok for ten years.nfl properties thus did not renew american needle headwear license,or the licenses of the other headwear vendors.
american needle responded to the loss of its headwear license by filing an antitrust action against the nfl,nfl properties,the individual nfl teams,and reebok.as relevant here,american needle claimed that the exclusive headwear licensing agreement between nfl properties and reebok violated of the sherman antitrust act,which outlaws any contract,combination or conspiracy,in restraint of trade.as american needle saw it,because each of the individual teams separately owned their team logos and trademarks,their collective agreement to authorize nfl properties to award the exclusive headwear license to reebok was,in fact,a conspiracy to restrict other vendors ability to obtain licenses for the teams intellectual property.american needle also contended that,by authorizing nfl properties to award the license to reebok,the nfl teams monopolized the nfl team licensing and product wholesale markets in violation of of the sherman antitrust act.see id.
one year after american needle brought its suit,the nfl defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on the company claim.the nfl defendants argued that,under the united states supreme court decision in copperweld independence tube,d,and its progeny,they were immune from liability under.in copperweld,the supreme court concluded that a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary are a single entity for antitrust purposes.id.at.the court based its conclusion on its determination that the relationship did not yield the risks that the sherman antitrust act was enacted to combat.id.at.specifically,the court stated that agreements between companies are generally subject to review because they deprive the market of the independent sources of economic power that competition requires.id.at.but because the relationship is always guided or determined not by two separate corporate consciousnesses,but one,the relationship does not deprive the market of any independent sources of economic power.id.at.
federal courts in later cases extended the concept beyond the context of a relationship,stating that affiliated companies or individuals could also be considered a single entity in certain circumstances.see,jack russell terrier network am.kennel club,cir eleven line.state soccer ass n,cir chi.prof l sports basketball ass bulls ii,cir city of pleasant associated,cir.relying on this gradual extension of copperweld,the nfl defendants asserted that they functioned as a single entity when collectively promoting nfl football by licensing the nfl teams intellectual property,and were thus immune from liability under.
american needle did not immediately oppose the nfl defendants motion.instead,the company moved for a continuance under.f on the ground that it was unable to present admissible evidence to dispute the nfl defendants defense.that evidence,american needle stated,was in the possession of the defendants.the company therefore asked the district court for the opportunity to take discovery regarding the nfl defendants defense and a number of issues generally,and included a list of discovery requests.
the nfl defendants,in turn,objected to american needle discovery requests on the ground that,as a whole,they were not limited to the issue.the nfl defendants,did,however,offer to produce a wide range of documents they considered to be related to their defense.the district court reserved judgment on the nfl defendants objection,and urged american needle to narrow its discovery requests.in response,american needle made additional discovery requests that were even more extensive in scope and number than its original requests.the nfl defendants again objected,and the district court ruled that,until the nfl defendants motion was resolved,discovery would be limited to the issue.the court then ordered the nfl defendants to produce all documents pertinent to their defense.
discovery ensued.the nfl defendants abided by the district court order and disclosed a voluminous amount of documents related to their defense.but when discovery concluded,american needle filed a second rule f motion.as it had done earlier,american needle stated that it was unable to present admissible evidence to dispute the nfl defendants defense because that evidence was in the possession of the defendants.american needle then listed discovery requests it sought to have the nfl defendants complete most of those requests were copied verbatim from the requests american needle made earlier.the district court took american needle second rule f motion under advisement,and ordered the company to respond to the merits of the nfl defendants motion.
shortly after briefing completed,the district court issued an order in which it both denied american needle rule f motion,and granted the nfl defendants motion for summary judgment on american needle claim.the district court determined that further discovery on the issue was
