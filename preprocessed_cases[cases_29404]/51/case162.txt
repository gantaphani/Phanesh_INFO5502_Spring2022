facts and proceedings 
paulsson geophysical services,paulsson is a california corporation that provides seismic imaging services to the oil and gas exploration and production industry.it markets a vertical seismic profile service called massive vsp and holds trademarks registered in the united states for both and massive vsp.axel sigmar is a resident of texas who is the registered agent for reservoir systems,rsi and sigma research,sri,both texas corporations.sigmar is also the president of the board of administration for reservoir systems internacional rsm,a mexican corporation 
in,paulsson and the appellants began discussing the possibility of a cooperative business venture.paulsson knew that sigmar was in contact with petroleos mexicanos pemex regarding a contract to provide seismic data acquisition services.in order to facilitate discussions between the parties,paulsson entered into mutual nondisclosure agreements with sigmar and sri in march and march.in march,paulsson provided rsi with a letter of authority,allowing it to promote paulsson massive vsp services in mexico.in may,rsi granted all rights under the letter of authority to rsm,but the grant also indicated that it gave rsm the right to use paulsson technology,not just promote it.the assignment to the mexican corporation was made in texas and filed in the texas secretary of state records and certified with an apostille although sigmar and paulsson later negotiated to amend the letter of authority to permit rsi to promote paulsson technology through rsm,the amendment was not finalized.both before and after issuing the letter of authority,paulsson specified to the appellants that the letter did not grant rsi a license to use paulsson technology or to commit paulsson to perform services.on july,rsm and pemex entered into a contract in which pemex would receive seismic profiles using paulsson massive vsp technology.
paulsson later became concerned that the appellants had obtained the contract with pemex by offering paulsson services even though they had no authority to do so.paulsson also became concerned about the use of its trademarks because it believed that the appellants planned to perform the contract with pemex by using a different system while still purporting to provide paulsson technology.
paulsson filed suit on december,moving for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent sigmar,rsi,sri,and rsm from using paulsson trademarks or other proprietary information.sigmar,rsi,and sri denied that the court had subject matter jurisdiction over the action in their answer,but they did not move to dismiss the action on that basis.the district court issued a temporary restraining order and granted the motion for a preliminary injunction.on february,the case was reassigned from judge yeakel to judge sparks.on may,the district court granted rsm motion to dismiss for lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction.
sigmar,rsi,and sri appeal the district court grant of paulsson motion for a preliminary injunction.they also assert that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.

iii.discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction 
t he legislation of congress will not extend beyond the boundaries of the united states unless a contrary legislative intent appears.steele bulova watch.in bulova,the supreme court addressed the issue of whether a district court had jurisdiction to award relief to an american corporation against acts of infringement consummated in a foreign country by a citizen and resident of the united states.id.at.the court noted the broad jurisdictional grant in the lanham act.id.at.the act applies to trademark infringement in commerce and defines that term as all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by congress.id.at.quoting.
regarding the jurisdictional question before it,the court concluded that w here there can be no interference with the sovereignty of another nation,the district court in exercising its equity powers may command persons properly before it to cease or perform acts outside its territorial jurisdiction.bulova,at.however,the court relied in part on the fact that the infringing party activities were not confined within the territorial limits of a foreign nation.id.at.the defendant had brought some of the materials used in its infringing activities from the united states to mexico,and some of the watches he assembled were later found in texas.id.at.
relying on bulova,this court affirmed a district court assertion of jurisdiction to enjoin trademark infringement in saudi arabia after analyzing the following 
c ertain factors are relevant in determining whether the contacts and interests of the united states are sufficient to support the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction.these include the citizenship of the defendant,the effect on united states commerce,and the existence of a conflict with foreign law.the absence of any one of these is not dispositive.nor should a court limit its inquiry exclusively to these considerations.rather,these factors will necessarily be the primary elements in any balancing analysis.
am.rice.rice growers coop.ass n,cir internal citation and footnotes omitted still,this court noted that some effect on united states commerce,as opposed to a substantial effect,may be sufficient for that factor.id.at.it determined that the infringing party sales in saudi arabia had more than an insignificant effect on united states commerce.id.at.however,like the bulova court,this court also emphasized the importance of the fact that the infringing party was a united states corporation.id.at.it noted,n o principle of international law bars the united states from governing the conduct of its own citizens upon the high seas or even in foreign countries when the rights of other nations are not infringed.id.internal quotations omitted.
the district court did not address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction over sigmar,rsi,and sri in detail.in its opinion dismissing the suit against rsm for lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction,it noted that it had jurisdiction over lanham act claims against united states citizens.the appellants do not dispute that they are citizens of the united states.nor do they assert that the trademarks at issue are protected by mexican law.their argument rests solely on their contention that paulsson failed to show any effect on united states commerce.
the language of bulova and american rice suggests that a district court may have jurisdiction over lanham act claims against united states citizens properly before it where there is no interference with a foreign nation sovereignty,regardless of the effect on united states commerce.however,the facts of those cases involved the movement of goods that had some effect on united states commerce.here,there is no need to decide what is the smallest effect on united states commerce that is necessary to sustain a court jurisdiction over united states citizens committing trademark infringement in a foreign country,because the appellants activities in this case rose to the level of the infringing parties in bulova and american rice.
the three appellants and the appellee were all engaged in commercial activity in the united states.the two trademarks at issue were registered in the united states.rsi received a letter of authority from paulsson while conducting commercial activity in the united states.it then executed,within the united states,an assignment of those rights to a mexican corporation,rsm.in that assignment,sigmar acknowledged on rsi behalf that,although rsm would be the prime contractor with pemex,rsi would be acting as a subcontractor using paulsson and sri proprietary technologies.rsi even availed itself of the facilities of the state of texas to record the assignment and obtain an is defined that the document could be used in mexico.the assignment clearly was transported or transmitted across the border to mexico where rsm conducted negotiations with pemex.
on june,rsi entered into a services agreement with rsm to provide oil exploration activities under rsm contract with pemex the agreement claimed that rsi would use sri technology.sigmar signed the services agreement on behalf of both rsi and rsm.on the same day,in furtherance of rsm contract with pemex,rsi and rsm entered into an agreement to sublicense rsm to use the base technology,seismic technology,and equipment that rsi was licensed by sri to use.sigmar signed the sublicense agreement on behalf of both rsi and rsm.based upon rsm response to interrogatories,the services agreement and the sublicensing agreement were the only contracts between rsi and rsm.
although the above agreements did not mention paulsson technology or trademarks,the record indicates that its technology and marks were central to rsi and rsm future work with pemex.rsm business information document dated july,expressed that it would provide services to pemex utilizing massive vsp equipment and that rsi had an exclusive agreement to provide the massive vsp in mexico.the document also explained that i n order to provide services to pemex,rsi ha d entered into a variety of arrangements with specialized service providers,including paulsson and sri.sigmar testified that the purpose of the business information document was to obtain financing for rsm.
he pursued such financing from a corporation in new york.in an agreement dated july,that corporation agreed to obtain in financing for.the funding would be guaranteed by a lien on assets and an assignment of all rights related to the use of patents related to seismic imaging technology held by rsi and granted to rsm in mexico.sigmar signed the agreement on behalf of both rsm and rsi.the financing from that agreement,however,was never obtained.
on approximately may,rsi entered into a loan agreement and subsequently received from a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in texas.based upon from the delaware corporation to rsm officials,it is clear that the financing was for rsi and rsm in mexico.rsi was subsequently sued in harris county,texas for failing to repay the loan.
on july,rsm entered into a contract with pemex titled work to obtain and process data from massive seismic vertical profiles in the marine or inland areas,using massive vsp technology,for the assets of pemex.the total amount of the contract was.
rsi subsequently chartered a vessel on october,from a different delaware corporation with its principal place of business in texas.the vessel was to be delivered in texas city,texas for operations in mexico gulf of mexico and the first thirty days of the charter were to cost.in the agreement,various obligations of the vessel owner were extended to rsm and pemex,which were included as rsi customers.the vessel owner subsequently filed suit against rsi for failing to pay for extensions of the charter.
during,rsm transferred to rsi.
these significant contracts and financial transactions were clearly related to rsi support of rsm contract to use massive vsp technology.based upon our review of the record,we disagree with the appellants confident assertion in their brief that there is no evidence showing any effect on united states commerce.these activities not only had some effect they had a substantial effect on united states commerce.although not necessarily violations of the lanham act,these activities were all essential steps in the course of business consummated abroad,the misuse of paulsson trademarks.bulova,at.therefore,we hold that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the lanham act claims against the appellants.
preliminary injunction 
a court should issue a preliminary injunction if the movant shows 
a substantial likelihood of success on the merits,a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not issued,that the threatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs any harm that will result if the injunction is granted,and that the grant of an injunction will not disserve the public interest.

with regard to the preliminary injunction element of establishing a substantial likelihood of success on the merits,the appellants do not dispute the marks eligibility for protection or that paulsson is the senior user.they only argue that the district court erred in finding that there was a likelihood of confusion.they also claim that the court did not make a finding regarding the irreparable injury element,and,if it did,it was in error.
likelihood of success 
in determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists,this court considers the following nonexhaustive list of factors the type of trademark allegedly infringed,the similarity between the two marks,the similarity of the products or services,the identity of the retail outlets and purchasers,the identity of the advertising media used,the defendant intent,and any evidence of actual confusion.no one factor is dispositive,and a finding of a likelihood of confusion does not even require a positive finding on a majority of these digits of confusion.

the appellants claim that the district court failed to consider the digits of confusion in making its decision to grant the preliminary injunction.they also claim the district court erred in granting the injunction because of the lack of confusion over the use of the marks and the unlikelihood of potential confusion.
