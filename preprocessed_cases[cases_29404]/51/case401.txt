playboy enterprises international,pei appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of netscape communications corporation and excite.pei sued defendants for trademark infringement and dilution.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.because we conclude that genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on both the trademark infringement and dilution claims,we reverse and remand.
this case involves a practice called keying that defendants use on their internet search engines.keying allows advertisers to target individuals with certain interests by linking advertisements to terms.to take an innocuous example,a person who searches for a term related to gardening may be a likely customer for a company selling seeds.thus,a seed company might pay to have its advertisement displayed when searchers enter terms related to gardening.after paying a fee to defendants,that company could have its advertisements appear on the page listing the search results for terms the ad would be keyed to terms.advertisements appearing on search result pages are called banner ads because they run along the top or side of a page much like a banner 
defendants have various lists of terms to which they key advertisers banner ads.those lists include the one at issue in this case,a list containing terms related to sex and entertainment.among the terms in this list are two for which pei holds trademarks playboy and playmate.defendants require companies to link their ads to this set of words.thus,when a user types in playboy,playmate,or one of the other listed terms,those companies banner ads appear on the search results page 
pei introduced evidence that the banner ads displayed on defendants search results pages are often graphic in nature and are confusingly labeled or not labeled at all.in addition,the parties do not dispute that buttons on the banner ads say click here.when a searcher complies,the search results page disappears,and the searcher finds him or herself at the advertiser website.pei presented uncontroverted evidence that defendants monitor click rates,the ratio between the number of times searchers click on banner ads and the number of times the ads are shown.defendants use click rate statistics to convince advertisers to renew their keyword contracts.the higher the click rate,the more successful they deem a banner ad.
pei sued defendants,asserting that they were using pei marks in a manner that infringed upon and diluted them.the district court denied pei request for a preliminary injunction,and this court affirmed in an unpublished disposition on remand,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.we reverse.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to pei,and drawing all reasonable inferences in pei favor,we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law the moving this case,the the initial burden of identifying for the court the portions of the materials on file that it believes demonstrate the absence of any genuine issue of material fact.if the moving party meets its initial burden,the burden shifts to the party to set forth,by affidavit or as otherwise provided by rule,specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.we may not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter but may only determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial 
iii.discussion 
trademark infringement 
with regard to pei trademark infringement claim,the parties disagree on three points.first,the parties dispute whether a direct or a contributory theory of liability applies to defendants actions.we conclude that defendants are potentially liable under one theory and that we need not decide which one.second,the parties disagree regarding whether pei has successfully shown that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the likelihood of consumer confusion resulting from defendants use of pei marks.we conclude that a genuine issue of material fact does exist.finally,the parties dispute whether any affirmative defenses apply.we conclude that no defenses apply.we will address each dispute in turn.
theory of liability.
whether the defendants are directly or merely contributorily liable proves to be a tricky question.however,we need not decide that question here.we conclude that defendants are either directly or contributorily liable.under either theory,pei case may proceed.thus,we need not decide this issue.
pei case for trademark infringement.
the core element of trademark infringement,the likelihood of confusion,lies at the center of this case no dispute exists regarding the other requirements set forth by the statute pei clearly holds the marks in question and defendants used the marks in commerce without pei permission 
pei strongest argument for a likelihood of confusion is for a certain kind of confusion initial interest confusion initial interest confusion is customer confusion that creates initial interest in a competitor product although dispelled before an actual sale occurs,initial interest confusion impermissibly capitalizes on the goodwill associated with a mark and is therefore actionable trademark infringement 
pei asserts that,by keying advertisements to pei trademarks,defendants actively create initial interest confusion in the following manner.because banner advertisements appear immediately after users type in pei marks,pei asserts that users are likely to be confused regarding the sponsorship of banner advertisements in addition,many of the advertisements instruct users to click here.because of their confusion,users may follow the instruction,believing they will be connected to a pei cite.even if they realize immediately upon accessing the competitor site that they have reached a site wholly unrelated to pei,the damage has been done through initial consumer confusion,the competitor will still have gained a customer by appropriating the goodwill that pei has developed in its mark.
pei theory strongly resembles the theory adopted by this court in brookfield communications,west coast entertainment corporation in brookfield,a video rental company,west coast entertainment corporation,planned on using as a domain name for its website and using a similar term in the metatags for the site brookfield had trademarked the term moviebuff,however,and sued west coast for trademark infringement the court ruled in favor of brookfield.it reasoned that internet users entering brookfield mark plus or searching for brookfield mark on search engines using metatags,would find themselves at west coast website.although they might realize,immediately upon accessing,that they have reached a site operated by west coast and wholly unrelated to brookfield,some customers who were originally seeking brookfield website may be perfectly content with west coast database especially as it is offered free of charge.because those customers would have found west coast site due to west coast misappropriation of brookfield goodwill in its mark,the court concluded that brookfield withstood summary judgment 
in this case,pei claims that defendants,in conjunction with advertisers,have misappropriated the goodwill of pei marks by leading internet users to competitors websites just as west coast video misappropriated the goodwill of brookfield mark.some consumers,initially seeking pei sites,may initially believe that unlabeled banner advertisements are links to pei sites or to sites affiliated with pei.once they follow the instructions to click here,and they access the site,they may well realize that they are not at a site.however,they may be perfectly happy to remain on the competitor site,just as the brookfield court surmised that some searchers initially seeking brookfield site would happily remain on west coast site.the internet user will have reached the site because of defendants use of pei mark.such use is actionable 
although analogies to brookfield suggest that pei will be able to show a likelihood of confusion sufficient to defeat summary judgment,we must test pei theory using this circuit test for the likelihood of confusion to be certain.accordingly,we turn to that test now.
the ninth circuit employs an test,originally set forth in amf sleekcraft boats to determine the likelihood of confusion.the eight factors are 
strength of the mark 
proximity of the goods 
similarity of the marks 
evidence of actual confusion 
marketing channels used 
type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser 
defendant intent in selecting the mark and 
likelihood of expansion of the product lines 
in the internet context,courts must be flexible in applying the factors,as some may not apply moreover,some factors are more important than others.for example,a showing of actual confusion among significant numbers of consumers provides strong support for the likelihood of confusion for that reason,we turn first to an examination of factor four evidence of actual confusion.
factor evidence of actual confusion.
the expert study pei introduced establishes a strong likelihood of initial interest confusion among consumers.thus,factor four alone probably suffices to reverse the grant of summary judgment.
pei expert,ford,concluded that a statistically significant number of internet users searching for the terms playboy and playmate would think that pei,or an affiliate,sponsored banner ads containing adult content that appear on the search results page.when study participants were shown search results for the term playboy,believed that pei sponsored or was otherwise associated with the banner ad displayed when shown results for the term playmate,held the same belief.using control groups,ford also concluded that for of those participants viewing playboy searches and of those viewing playmate searches,the confusion stemmed from the targeting of the banner advertisements.the individuals were not confused by random,advertisements.
defendants criticize ford procedures and conclusions.they offer their own interpretations of his data,with significantly lower rates of confusion.defendants cite cases identifying probabilities of confusion of and less as de minimis and then argue that ford results showed de minimis confusion as well.their critique of ford methods and interpretations formed the basis of a motion to exclude his expert testimony and report before the district court.the district court denied that motion,however,and allowed the introduction of the evidence.
defendants may have valid criticism of ford methods and conclusions,and their critique may justify reducing the weight eventually afforded ford expert report.the district court evidentiary ruling is not before us on appeal,however,and weighing admissible evidence at this stage is improper defendants arguments prove the point that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding actual confusion.the presence of ford criticized but uncontradicted report,with its strong conclusions that a high likelihood of initial interest confusion exists among consumers,thus generates a genuine issue of material fact on the actual confusion issue.
because actual confusion is at the heart of the likelihood of confusion analysis ford report alone probably precludes summary judgment.in the interest of being thorough,however,we will examine the other seven sleekcraft factors.on balance,they also support pei.
factor one strength of the mark.
pei has established that strong secondary meanings for its descriptive marks exist,and that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether it created the secondary meanings thus,the first sleekcraft factor favors pei.
at this point,defendants concede that they use the marks for their secondary meanings thus,they concede that the marks have secondary meanings.they offer only a weak argument regarding the strength of the meanings given that defendants themselves use the terms precisely because they believe that internet searchers associate the terms with their secondary meanings,disputing the strength of the secondary meanings is somewhat farfetched.the only meaningful dispute is whether pei created the strong secondary meanings associated with the mark.
pei offered evidence,in the form of expert reports,tending to show that pei did create the secondary meanings of playboy and playmate.pei expert evidence countered the defendants expert evidence to the contrary,and suffices to generate a genuine issue of material fact on this issue.
factor two proximity of the goods.
from an internet searcher perspective,the relevant goods are the links to the websites being sought and the goods or services available at those sites.the proximity between pei and its competitor goods provides the reason netscape keys pei marks to competitor banner advertisements in the first place.accordingly,this factor favors pei as well.
factor three similarity of the marks.
no doubt exists regarding this factor.aside from their lack of capitalization,their font,and the fact that defendants use the plural form of playmate,the terms defendants use are identical to pei marks.thus,they are certainly similar 
factor five marketing channels used.
this factor is equivocal.pei and the advertisers use identical marketing channels the internet.more specifically,each of their sites appears on defendants search results pages.given the broad use of the internet today,the same could be said for countless companies.thus,this factor merits little weight.
factor six type of goods and degree of consumer care expected.
this factor favors pei.consumer care for inexpensive products is expected to be quite low low consumer care,in turn,increases the likelihood of confusion 
in addition to price,the content in question may affect consumer care as well.we presume that the average searcher seeking materials on the internet is easily diverted from a specific product he or she is seeking if other options,particularly graphic ones,appear more quickly.thus,the and graphic nature of the materials weighs in pei favor as well.
factor seven defendants intent in selecting the mark.
this factor favors pei somewhat.a defendant intent to confuse constitutes probative evidence of likely confusion courts assume that the defendant intentions were carried out successfully.in this case,the evidence does not definitively establish defendants intent.at a minimum,however,it does suggest that defendants do nothing to prevent that result from confusion.moreover,they profit from such.
defendants monitor rates on the advertisements they display.that is,they monitor the number of times consumers are diverted to their advertisers sites.they use the rates as a way to gauge the success of the advertisements and to keep advertisers coming back to their services.although some may be the result of legitimate consumer interest,not confusion,some may be expected to result from confusion.defendants will profit from both kinds of.and they do nothing to ensure that only based on legitimate interest,as opposed to confusion,occur.
pei introduced evidence suggesting that labeling the advertisements would reduce rates.it would also reduce confusion.however,although defendants control the content of advertisements in other contexts,defendants do not require that advertisers identify themselves on their banner ads.moreover,they do not label the advertisements themselves.perhaps even more telling,defendants refuse to remove the terms playboy and playmate from their lists of keywords,even when advertisers request that they do so 
the above evidence suggests,at a minimum,that defendants do nothing to alleviate confusion,even when asked to do so by their advertisers,and that they profit from confusion.although not definitive,this factor provides some evidence of an intent to confuse on the part of defendants.this factor thus favors pei.
factor eight likelihood of expansion of product lines.
because the advertisers goods and pei are already related,as discussed within factor two,this factor is irrelevant.
having examined all of the sleekcraft factors,we conclude that the majority favor pei.accordingly,we conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to the substantial likelihood of confusion.we now proceed to the defenses advanced by defendants.
defendants assert three defenses fair use,nominative use,and functional use.because we have found that a genuine issue of fact exists as to likelihood of confusion under sleekcraft,we must deny summary judgment as to the fair use defense.a fair use may not be a confusing use accordingly,we turn to defendants other asserted defenses.
defendants assert that they make a nominative use of pei marks.we apply a slightly different test for confusion in the nominative use,as opposed to the fair use,context to be considered a nominative use,the use of a mark must meet the following test 
first,the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark second,only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service and third,the user must do nothing that would,in conjunction with the mark,suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder 
before we apply this test to the facts at hand,we would like to emphasize what facts are not at hand.we note that defendants use of pei marks to trigger the listing of pei sites,and other sites that legitimately use pei marks is not at issue here.in addition,we note that we are not addressing a situation in which a banner advertisement clearly identifies its source with its sponsor name or in which a search engine clearly identifies a banner advertisement source.we are also not addressing a situation in which advertisers or defendants overtly compare pei products to a competitor saying,for example if you are interested in playboy,you may also be interested in the following message from a different,named company.rather,we are evaluating a situation in which defendants display competitors unlabeled banner advertisements,with no label or overt comparison to pei,after internet users type in pei trademarks.
the situation with which we are dealing runs afoul of the first requirement for nominative use.accordingly,we do not consider the other prongs.
defendants could use other words,besides pei marks,to trigger banner advertisements.indeed,they already do so.the list they sell to advertisers includes over terms besides pei marks.there is nothing indispensable,in this context,about pei marks defendants do not wish to identify pei or its products when they key banner advertisements to pei marks rather,they wish to identify consumers who are interested in entertainment so they can draw them to competitors websites.accordingly,their use is not nominative.thus,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment based on nominative use.
defendants final asserted defense,functional use,also fails.defendants appear not to have raised this defense before the district court.even if they have not waived the defense,however,it fails.under the functional use doctrine,parts of a design that have a functional use may not receive trademark protection we do not have such a case here.
nothing about the marks used to identify pei products is a functional part of the design of those products.pei could easily have called its magazine and its models entirely different things without losing any of their intended function.thus,the marks are not functional and may be granted trademark protection 
the fact that the marks make defendants computer program more functional is irrelevant.defendants designed their program to identify consumers interested in entertainment so that some percentage of those consumers might be attracted to competitors websites,thereby helping defendants generate advertising revenue.thus,defendants might conceivably be unable to trademark some of the terms used in their program because those terms are functional within that program.because we are not dealing with defendants wish to trademark their computer program,but with pei ability to protect the trademarks it already uses to identify its products,the doctrine of functional use does not help defendants here.
we hold that genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to defendants keying practices.thus,we conclude that summary judgment was inappropriate on the trademark infringement claim.
trademark dilution 
we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on pei second cause of action,trademark dilution and remand for further proceedings.we conclude that pei has established that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding two of the three elements that the parties dispute the famousness of the marks and defendants commercial use of the mark we will address each of the three disputed elements in turn.
famousness of the mark.
the federal dilution statute provides eight factors courts may use,along with other relevant factors,i n determining whether a mark is distinctive and famous.those eight factors are 
a the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark 
b the duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the goods or services with which the mark is used 
c the duration and extent of advertising and publicity of the mark 
d the geographical extent of the trading area in which the mark is used 
e the channels of trade for the goods or services with which the mark is used 
f the degree of recognition of the mark in the trading areas and channels of trade used by the marks owner and the person against whom the injunction is sought 
g the nature and extent of use of the same or similar marks by third parties and 
h whether the mark was registered under the act of march,or the act of february,or on the principal register 
no grounds exist to contest factors b,c,d,e,and h,all of which favor pei.defendants directly contest only factor g the nature and extent of use of the same or similar marks by third parties.we conclude that pei has established a genuine issue of material fact regarding factor g.accordingly,the first contested requirement of trademark dilution favors pei for purposes of summary judgment.
defendants introduced evidence that more than forty trademark registrations exist for the terms playboy and playmate,as well as evidence that hundreds of companies use the terms within their company names.plaintiffs countered,however,by showing that a many of the companies cited by defendants are active infringers whom pei is diligently pursuing b others are merely companies who have applied for similar marks but who have not yet received them and c still others are listed several times.the remainder,pei asserts,are in different fields or in localized areas and should not be counted,at least not when considering whether pei marks are famous within their market 
thus,defendants introduced evidence of use and pei disputed the evidence with evidence of its own showing that defendants list was substantially.a dispute of material fact thus exists as to the only factor relevant to the famousness of the marks that defendants contest.accordingly,the first contested requirement of dilution favors pei on summary judgment.
defendants commercial use of the mark.
congress intended to limit only commercial speech,as opposed to political or other more closely protected speech,when it passed the dilution statute thus,it included the requirement that the use be a commercial one a successful argument that defendants make no commercial use of the marks,then,would be an argument that the speech associated with their actions was political,not commercial.defendants do not make such an argument,and it would be difficult to do so in light of the clear evidence of the commercial nature of their enterprise.accordingly,pei has satisfied the second disputed requirement of dilution.
dilution of distinctive quality of marks.
we conclude that the district court erred when it held,applying the standard then in force that pei had shown no likelihood of dilution.however,because the supreme court recently clarified the standard for withstanding summary judgment on dilution claims,we vacate the district court decision on this point and remand with instructions to discovery to allow the parties to introduce evidence that may satisfy,or undermine,the new standard 
under the old standard,pei established a genuine issue of material fact regarding likelihood of dilution.with respect to blurring pei introduced evidence suggesting that a significant number of internet users assume that advertisements are sponsored or somehow affiliated with pei after a search using pei trademarked terms.defendants did not counter that evidence.with respect to tarnishment plaintiffs introduced evidence tending to show that consumers consider the materials in the banner ads to be inferior to the materials offered by pei and that consumers are confused regarding sponsorship of the banner ads.defendants also did not counter that evidence.
defendants argue that dilution can not be found because they do not label their own goods with pei marks.however,when one considers things from the consumers perspective,defendants argument fails.according to pei evidence,in the minds of consumers,defendants implicitly label the goods of pei competitors with its marks.
finding fault with the methods used to collect and evaluate pei evidence regarding internet searchers association between the keyed advertisements and pei,defendants criticize pei evidence regarding the likelihood of blurring.as with the evidence regarding the likelihood of confusion in the infringement claim,however,defendants critique of pei evidence pointed to a genuine issue of fact on this issue,not to summary judgment.
defendants did not counter pei evidentiary showing in support of tarnishment.accordingly,pei showed a likelihood of tarnishment as well.
because we conclude that the district court erred under the traditional theories of dilution,we need not reach the parties arguments regarding whether panavision international,applies,whether it created a new species of dilution,or whether it remains valid after congress enacted the anticybersquatting consumer protection act of accordingly,if the old standard applied,we would reverse and remand for judgment proceedings.
because the old standard,requiring a showing of a mere likelihood of dilution,no longer applies,we vacate the district court decision as to the third element of the dilution claim and remand in order to allow the district court to apply the proper standard under that standard,to withstand summary judgment,a party must show that actual dilution has occurred pei current evidence does not establish actual dilution.thus,we remand with instructions to discovery and to allow motions directed at the new standard.
genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on pei dilution claim.the fame of the marks and the likelihood of dilution are in dispute,thereby precluding summary judgment.
iv.conclusion 
genuine issues of material fact exist as to pei trademark infringement and dilution claims.accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants and remand for further proceedings.
reversed and remanded.
i concur in judge nelson careful opinion in this case,as it is fully consistent with the applicable precedents.i write separately,however,to express concern that one of those precedents was wrongly decided and may one day,if not now,need to be reconsidered en banc.
i am struck by how analytically similar keyed advertisements are to the metatags found infringing in brookfield communications west coast entertainment,cir.in brookfield,the court held that the defendant could not use the trademarked term moviebuff as one of its metatags.metatags are part of the html code of a web page,and therefore are invisible to internet users.search engines use these metatags to pull out websites applicable to search terms.see also promatek,equitrac,cir adopting the brookfield holding.
specifically,brookfield held that the use of the trademarked terms in metatags violated the lanham act because it caused initial interest confusion.brookfield,at.the court explained that even though there is no source confusion in the sense that consumers know who they are patronizing,there is nevertheless initial interest confusion in the sense that,by using or moviebuff to divert people looking for moviebuff to its website,the defendant improperly benefits from the goodwill that the plaintiff developed in its mark.id.at.
as applied to this case,brookfield might suggest that there could be a lanham act violation even if the banner advertisements were clearly labeled,either by the advertiser or by the search engine.i do not believe that to be so.so read,the metatag holding in brookfield would expand the reach of initial interest confusion from situations in which a party is initially confused to situations in which a party is never confused.i do not think it is reasonable to find initial interest confusion when a consumer is never confused as to source or affiliation,but instead knows,or should know,from the outset that a product or web link is not related to that of the trademark holder because the list produced by the search engine so informs him.
there is a big difference between hijacking a customer to another website by making the customer think he or she is visiting the trademark holder website even if only briefly,which is what may be happening in this case when the banner advertisements are not labeled,and just distracting a potential customer with another choice,when it is clear that it is a choice.true,when the search engine list generated by the search for the trademark ensconced in a metatag comes up,an internet user might choose to visit,the defendant website in brookfield,instead of the plaintiff website,but such choices do not constitute trademark infringement off the internet,and i can not understand why they should on the internet.
for example,consider the following scenario i walk into macy and ask for the calvin klein section and am directed upstairs to the second floor.once i get to the second floor,on my way to the calvin klein section,i notice a more prominently displayed line of charter club clothes,macy own brand,designed to appeal to the same people attracted by the style of calvin klein latest line of clothes.let say i get diverted from my goal of reaching the calvin klein section,the charter club stuff looks good enough to me,and i purchase some charter club shirts instead.has charter club or macy infringed calvin klein trademark,simply by having another product more prominently displayed before one reaches the klein line certainly not.see gregory shea,note,trademarks and keyword banner advertising,cal,comparing keyed banner advertisements to a customer entering a supermarket,requesting tylenol,and then being directed to the pain reliever section which includes generic acetaminophen,along with other generic and pain relievers julie rajzer,comment,misunderstanding the internet how courts are overprotecting trademarks used in metatags,highlighting the world in which kellogg raisin bran and post raisin bran both appear next to one another on the same aisle.
similarly,suppose a customer walks into a bookstore and asks for playboy magazine and is then directed to the adult magazine section,where he or she sees penthouse or hustler up front on the rack while playboy is buried in back.one would not say that penthouse or hustler had violated playboy trademark.this conclusion holds true even if hustler paid the store owner to put its magazines in front of playboy.
one can test these analogies with an example if i went to macy website and did a search for a calvin klein shirt,would macy violate calvin klein trademark if it responded as does,for example with the requested shirt and pictures of other shirts i might like to consider as well i very much doubt it.
accordingly,i simply can not understand the broad principle set forth in brookfield.even the main analogy given in brookfield belies its conclusion.the court gives an example of blockbuster misdirecting customers from a competing video store,west coast video,by putting up a highway billboard sign giving directions to blockbuster but telling customers that a west coast video store is located there.brookfield,at.even though customers who arrive at the blockbuster realize that it is not west coast video,they were initially misled
