this appeal involves a claim for trademark infringement under the lanham act.we must determine if plaintiff has raised a genuine factual issue as to whether defendant alleged infringement was willful,entitling plaintiff to an award of defendant profits and attorneys fees.the district court entered partial summary judgment in favor of defendant on the trademark infringement claim and certified its order for immediate interlocutory review under.c.plaintiff timely filed its notice of appeal.our appellate jurisdiction is appropriate under.
in addressing the issue of willfulness,we take this occasion to establish the appropriate definition of that term in the context of an award of profits.we hold that the willfulness required to support an award of profits under the lanham act typically requires an intent to appropriate the goodwill of another mark.for the willful component of an award of attorney fees,we adopt the same definition of willful.on the facts of the instant case,we find that a sufficient factual dispute exists on these issues to warrant submission to a jury.accordingly,we reverse.
background 
plaintiff western diversified services western markets and sells extended or aftermarket automobile warranties to consumers wishing to purchase protection beyond the terms of a standard manufacturer warranty.in connection with this service,western owns two federally registered service marks the advantage and the advantage plus.western has used these marks in commerce since and sells approximately warranties per month.
defendant hyundai motor america hyundai first entered the automobile market in,quickly experiencing soaring sales and growth.by september,however,hyundai cars became known for their maintenance problems and revenues seriously lagged.responding to this perception,executives in hyundai marketing department marketing decided to offer a comprehensive manufacturer warranty which they named the hyundai advantage.prior to settling on the name,however,marketing asked the hyundai legal department legal for clearance,pursuant to company policy.legal then referred the matter to outside intellectual property counsel counsel to conduct a trademark search.on september,counsel issued an opinion letter to hyundai stating that the use and registration of the hyundai advantage was possible but subject to risk.specifically,counsel letter pointed out that western owned registrations for the advantage and the advantage plus and had shown a willingness to litigate.nevertheless,counsel ultimate opinion was that the use and registration of the hyundai advantage was justifiable.
since,hyundai had been selling extended warranties under the name hyundai protection plan hpp.when hyundai began the overhaul of its manufacturer warranty program in,it decided to update the hpp warranties as well.this task was delegated to executives in hyundai assurance products division assurance,who initially decided to call the new hpp plans and plus.
unfortunately,regulations in several states prohibited the use of the term in hyundai particular warranty plans.as a result,hyundai went back to the drawing board,and,in october,assurance executives internally selected the names advantage and advantage plus for the hpp warranties.
one month later,western wrote to hyundai general counsel demanding that hyundai cease use of the term the hyundai advantage in connection with its manufacturer warranty.hyundai rejected the demand,and,shortly thereafter,western filed suit against hyundai in the district court for the district of utah.
western complaint alleged,inter alia,a service mark infringement claim under the lanham act.western originally sought recovery only based upon hyundai manufacturer warranty,the hyundai advantage,but later amended its complaint to include hyundai extended warranties,advantage and advantage plus.western sought a combination of monetary and injunctive relief,including an award of hyundai profits and attorneys fees.despite the pendency of the lawsuit,hyundai went forward with its new extended warranty program,developing a brochure describing its advantage and advantage plus extended warranties.
prior to any discovery,hyundai filed a motion for partial summary judgment under.c.in a series of orders,the court granted the motion on the lanham act claims as they related both to hyundai manufacturer warranty and to hyundai extended warranties.the district court then issued a rule b certification of its partial summary judgment orders for immediate interlocutory review.on appeal,plaintiff contests only the summary judgment order as it relates to defendant extended warranties,advantage and advantage plus.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of partial summary judgment de novo and must apply the same legal standard used by the district court.simms ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.under.c,summary judgment is only appropriate if the pleadings and admissible evidence produced during discovery,together with any affidavits,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
damages under the lanham act generally 
the lanham act explicitly prescribes the range of monetary remedies available to a plaintiff who has successfully proven a trademark violation 
when a violation of any right of the registrant of a mark shall have been established in any civil action arising under this chapter,the plaintiff shall be entitled,subject to the principles of equity,to recover defendant profits,any damages sustained by the plaintiff,and the costs of the action the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.
a.in the instant case,western seeks an award of the profits hyundai earned from use of western mark and reasonable attorneys fees.as demonstrated below,the critical requirement of both remedies is a showing that the defendant willfully infringed the plaintiff mark.
award of profits 
an accounting of profits is not automatically granted upon a showing of infringement.see champion spark plug sanders.as the statute makes clear,any award of profits is subject to the principles of equity.a.however,it is not required that the plaintiff demonstrate actual damages to sustain a profit award.bishop equinox int l,cir bishop i.
an award of profits in the absence of actual damages is usually predicated on one of two theories unjust enrichment or deterrence.see id.at.the unjust enrichment theory is based on the idea that trademarks are protected property rights.id.at.the misappropriation of that right,thus,results in an unjust enrichment even if the two parties are not in direct competition with each other.see also blue bell frontier refining,cir noting the theory that a trademark infringer holds his profits in trust for the benefit of the other party.similarly,the deterrence theory recognizes that an award of profits may be proper as a means to prevent willful trademark infringement.bishop i,at.
whatever the theory that motivates the rule,a finding of actual damage remains an important factor in determining whether an award of profits is appropriate.id.thus,while the existence of the plaintiff actual damages is not a prerequisite to an award of the defendant profits,this issue remains relevant to our inquiry.given the punitive nature of the remedy and the possible windfall to the plaintiff,the potential for inequity is necessarily heightened when a party seeks a profit award in the absence of actual damages.to that end,we require a showing that defendant actions were willful to support an award of profits under a.id 
even with a finding of willfulness,a court may still exercise its discretion to reduce or even eliminate a profit award in the name of fashioning an equitable remedy to meet the needs of each case.see,estate of bishop equinox int l,cir bishop ii.this is accomplished by carefully weighing the equities on both sides of the scale to determine whether,in the district court judgment and within its wide discretion,the plaintiff may receive a portion of the infringing defendant profits.id.thus,an award of profits involve
