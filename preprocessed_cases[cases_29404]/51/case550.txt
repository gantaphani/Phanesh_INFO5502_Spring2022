background 
save venice is a new york corporation devoted to preserving and restoring some of the cultural treasures of venice,italy.since,save venice has used the service mark save venice for fundraising and newsletters in conjunction with its preservation efforts.the save venice service mark has been registered on the principal register since reg.in addition,since save venice has used the currently unregistered lion of mark design for its newsletters and fundraising activities.on january,save venice filed an application with the united states patent and trademark office pto for a composite mark which amalgamates the phrases the venice collection and save venice,with a drawing of the lion of as shown below 
the applicant sought registration on the principal register of this mark to cover a variety of goods in nine different international designated classes,including potpourri,tableware made of precious and nonprecious metals,lamps,clocks,art prints,paper products,residential furniture,dinnerware,glassware,bedding and carpets with the exception of some glass products,none of the applicant designated goods originated in venice 
the pto examiner refused registration of those goods not originating in venice under e because she considered that the mark was primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive.according to the examiner,the primary significance of the composite mark is geographic.that is,the examiner determined that the mark primarily signifies the geographic location,venice,italy.relying on an encyclopedia and a gazetteer,the examiner found that venice,italy is a location known for paper,publishing,printing,textiles,jewelry,art objects,glassmaking,housewares and lace.finding that all of the applicant claimed goods are associated with traditional venetian products,the examiner rejected the application on the grounds that the public would mistakenly believe that venice,italy was the source of applicant goods sold under the proposed mark.
save venice requested reconsideration,arguing that the primary significance of the mark is not geographic but rather a qualitative evocation of the history,art,culture and beauty of venice.in addition,save venice submitted a declaration by its executive director who asserted that she knew from personal experience that no venetian industry produces or sells any of the applicant goods.the pto granted reconsideration.however,using information from web sites and published books on flags of the world and on venice,italy,the examiner established that the lion design in the proposed mark is a substantially identical reproduction of the lion of mark from the venetian flag and the regional flag of veneto.further,the examiner determined that the public clearly identifies the lion of mark as symbolizing the city of venice.the examiner concluded that,when viewed as a whole,the composite mark is primarily geographic due to this unique symbolic design and the prominent wording the venice collection.finally,the examiner found that although some of the goods claimed by the applicant are not goods for which venice is best known,consumers could reasonably believe they originated in venice as ancillary products related to the traditional crafts and industries of venice as part of a natural expansion of venetian industries.given the geographic significance of the applicant mark and the association between the applicant claimed goods and traditional venetian products,registration was refused because the mark was found primarily geographically deceptively misdescriptive.
save venice appealed to the board,which affirmed the examiner refusal to register the mark.in re save venice,wl ttab march.noting the prominence of the venice collection lettering within the mark and the symbolic importance of the lion of mark to venetian culture,the board upheld the examiner finding that the primary significance of the mark is the geographic location venice,italy.in considering whether consumers would associate applicant goods with venice,italy,the board divided the goods into two groups goods identical to traditional venetian products,and goods related to such products.in considering the first identical to traditional venetian board found a clear association between those goods and venice,italy the board determined that the second for which there was no direct evidence indicating they were the type produced in venice reflect ed product types,decorative themes and material composition that consumers would associate with the city of venice.accordingly,the board upheld the examiner refusal to register the mark.save venice appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a b.
