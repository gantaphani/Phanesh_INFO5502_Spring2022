bumble bee seafoods,bumble bee appeals the district court adverse rulings following a bench trial on the trademark issues of likelihood of confusion and dilution.because we find that confusion was likely,we reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of bumble bee.
background 
louis kemp is from a family that had been engaged in the wholesale and retail seafood business since.in,kemp started kemp foods,which made and sold artificial crab products containing surimi,a,processed fish product.in,kemp sold the seafood business to oscar mayer foods corporation for million pursuant to a stock acquisition agreement.under the agreement,kemp transferred all trademarks used in his business,including kemp,kemp and kemp design to oscar mayer.he further agreed not to use these marks or any variation thereof on any products,except as permitted under the agreement.under the agreement,kemp retained the right to market,sell or otherwise distribute certain listed products bearing a composite trademark consisting of the word kemp or kemp and preceded by one or more additional words,the selection of which shall be approved in advance in writing by oscar mayer.
about six months after signing the agreement,an oscar mayer executive asked kemp for permission to use the name louis kemp to market surimi products.oscar mayer previously had achieved success with or marks oscar mayer,louis rich.kemp agreed and entered negotiations with oscar mayer to amend the agreement.ultimately,the amended agreement did not contain all of oscar mayer desired terms,namely,express permission to use the term louis kemp on all products and exclusion of kemp from using the term louis kemp on any food products.similarly,the amended agreement did not contain kemp desired term,namely,the express reservation of a broad right to use the term louis kemp on products other than surimi 
under the amended agreement,kemp granted oscar mayer the right to use and register the marks louis kemp and louis kemp seafood co the louis kemp marks for products and other seafood accessory products within the natural zone of expansion.the amended agreement also included a revised reservation of rights for kemp that provided 
it is agreed that kemp,or any entity in which he has an interest,may utilize a composite trademark consisting of the word kemp or kemp and preceded or followed by one or more additional words the selection of which shall be approved in advance in writing by oscar mayer in connection with the marketing,selling,or distribution of certain listed products.
in,oscar mayer sold the surimi business to tyson foods,who in turn sold the business to bumble bee.con agra foods subsequently acquired bumble bee.before october,bumble bee and its predecessors spent over million to promote and advertise the louis kemp marks.by october,the louis kemp marks had achieved a brand awareness of,bumble bee louis kemp seafood company held a share of the market for retail seafood and louis kemp was the number one surimi seafood brand with a market share.it is undisputed that bumble bee owns numerous registered trademarks for kemp,including the term kemp without restriction as to font,trade dress or form,and more narrow registrations for the term kemp along with certain design elements.in addition,bumble bee owns registration numbers and for the mark louis kemp and and for the mark louis kemp seafood company.
in april and may,kemp wrote to jeno paulucci of luigino,a prospective business partner,to propose the formation of a new company to develop and sell a line of precooked wild rice products.kemp noted his intention to take advantage of the goodwill associated with the louis kemp marks goodwill that bumble bee,tyson,and oscar mayer had invested million to develop when he stated 
products can use the louis kemp brand name which has national recognition with over million spent on advertising,million lbs of louis kemp product sold annually with a market share of the prepackaged retail market in its category.april letter 
we could use the louis kemp brand name where we can and want to,to take advantage of the considerable equity it possesses and or any and all other brands the company can utilize,now and in the future to develop any other specialty food items that would meet the compan y s goal for growth and success.may letter 
while kemp expressly stated that he desired to take advantage of the considerable equity that the louis kemp brand name possessed,and while he may have believed that he was entitled to do so under the contract,he also recognized the risk attendant to this appropriation of goodwill.he sought and obtained an opinion letter from counsel in which counsel advised that he could use his name,louis kemp for precooked wild rice products.in counsel opinion,these products were sufficiently different from fish products to avoid confusion.counsel did advise against using the term louis kemp seafood company,using type font or script similar to that used by then tyson,and using the marks on products that contained surimi.
kemp and his newly formed company,quality finer foods entered a custom packing and sales agreement with luigino.under the sales agreement,kemp granted luigino the right to cancel the agreement if any meaningful action in the sole discretion of luigino attorney is threatened or commenced against quality finer foods or its owner,louis kemp,for trade mark infringement,violation and the like.apparently,paulucci,his attorney,or others at luigino also recognized the risk attendant to using the trademark louis kemp.
in october,kemp began commercial use of the mark louis kemp on wild rice,chicken and wild rice soup,and wild rice with stir fry vegetables.kemp did not seek bumble bee approval,as per the amended agreement,for use of the mark on wild rice products.kemp use was accompanied by trade dress that differed from bumble bee trade dress and did not include the words seafood in particular,bumble bee displayed its louis kemp seafood mark against a blue background and kemp displayed the louis kemp mark against a white and red striped background,using a different font.kemp juxtaposed the mark with a scene of lakes and wild rice while bumble bee mark appeared on packages that permitted potential consumers to view the surimi product.kemp sought registration of the trademark louis kemp as applied to precooked wild rice products.the patent and trademark office rejected kemp application based on a finding that kemp mark was confusingly similar to bumble bee mark.
on march,tyson,then owner of the louis kemp marks,sent kemp a cease and desist letter.tyson alleged infringement and likelihood of confusion.on march,kemp responded by explaining that he believed the amended agreement permitted his use of the trademark louis kemp on products.kemp then filed this suit to seek a declaratory judgment regarding a contractual right to use the trademark louis kemp.kemp also brought tortious interference and unfair competition claims against tyson and bumble bee.tyson and bumble bee filed trademark infringement and dilution counterclaims against kemp based on federal and minnesota law.in,kemp stopped selling wild rice products under the louis kemp mark.
over the next few years,litigation proceeded on many fronts,including state and bankruptcy courts in california,as well as the united states district court in minnesota.on may,upon stipulation of the parties,the district court below entered an order granting consent judgment which held that the only remaining issues were the issues of trademark infringement and dilution as set forth in tyson and bumble bee counterclaims 
the district court then held a bench trial to resolve the outstanding issues of whether kemp use of the louis kemp mark infringed or diluted bumble bee trademark rights.the evidence included the trial testimony of kemp former salesman for the wild rice products,patrick melby.melby claimed that actual confusion existed among brokers.in fact,melby testified that these professional buyers always asked if there was a connection between the wild rice and surimi companies and that they always had to have it explained to them that the two products came from different companies.this evidence was undisputed.the district court,however,discounted this evidence and stated,the court does not extract from his testimony the inference or conclusion that confusion among brokers was rampant.
tyson and bumble bee submitted a customer survey that purported to show confusion among relevant consumers.the district court discounted the survey as infirm.the district court noted that the pool of survey participants did not accurately reflect the target market and that problems with the format of the surveyor questions called into doubt the validity of the survey results.
kemp testified that during the many years that he sold seafood products under the kemp trademarks,another firm sold dairy products under an identical kemp trademark with no reports of actual consumer confusion.an executive from con agra the company that owned bumble bee testified that he was not aware of any reports of actual confusion between the louis kemp seafood products and the third party dairy products.also,the evidence showed that kemp promoted the sale of his wild rice products as side dishes for fish,and bumble bee promoted its surimi products for use with rice.
finally,during trial,kemp again made clear his intention to take advantage of the goodwill and brand equity that bumble bee and its predecessors had built in the trademark louis kemp 
well,is it a fact that you used the mark louis kemp on you r wild rice products solely to take advantage of the huge investment that oscar mayer and tyson invested in the brand 
absolutely true and that because the agreement i made with them and they made with me.
the district court applied the six factor test from squirtco,cir listing the following as factors to consider in assessing the likelihood of confusion the strength of the owner mark the similarity of the owner mark and the alleged infringer mark the degree to which the products compete with each other the alleged infringer intent to pass off its goods as those of the trademark owner incidents of actual confusion and the type of product,its costs and conditions of purchase the squirtco factors.the district court noted kemp concession that the first and sixth factors weighed in favor of finding a likelihood of confusion.the district court then analyzed the remaining four factors.in doing so,the district court conducted a comparison of the parties respective products trade dress discounted similarities in the marks due to differences in the trade dress noted the absence of competition between the products found that kemp did not intend consumers to associate his products with bumble bee products found no evidence of actual confusion and,ultimately,found that there was neither a likelihood of confusion nor actual dilution.as a result,the district court granted judgment in favor of kemp.
ii.of confusion 
we review application of the squirtco factors and the ultimate determination of a likelihood of confusion for clear error.children factory,benee toys,cir conagra,george hormel,cir.reversal under the clear error standard is appropriate in this case because,after reviewing the record,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson city of bessemer city,d quoting united states united states gypsum.
kemp argues that minor differences in trade dress,as previously described,establish that the marks are dissimilar.he argues further that he did not have an intent to misappropriate the goodwill consumers associate with bumble bee mark and that his receipt of advice from counsel proves this fact.he also argues that the underlying products were not in competition with one another and that there was no evidence of actual confusion.although he concedes that the first factor the strength of the mark and the sixth factor the type of product,its costs,and conditions of purchase support a finding that confusion is likely,he argues that,on balance,the squirtco factors support the conclusion that no confusion is likely.
the factors from squirtco guide our analysis,but the ultimate determination of whether confusion is likely is not to be mechanically determined through rigid application of the factors.under squirtco,no one factor controls,and because the inquiry is inherently,different factors may be entitled to more weight in different cases.squirtco,at r esolution of this issue does not hinge on a single factor but requires a consideration of numerous factors to determine whether under all the circumstances there is a likelihood of confusion.further,the factors are not entirely separable.for example,it is inappropriate to conduct a comparison of the elements of two products trade dress,as urged by kemp,without reference to the senior mark strength or the market conditions under which likely consumers would see the marks.see,wynn oil thomas,cir i t is axiomatic in trademark law that comparison is not the test.quoting levi strauss blue bell,cir.rather,our comparison of the similarity between marks and products must occur in a context that recognizes how consumers encounter the products and how carefully consumers are likely to scrutinize the marks.see homeowners group,home marketing specialists,cir instead,the marks must be viewed in their entirety and in context.a court must determine,in the light of what occurs in the marketplace,whether the mark will be confusing to the public when singly presented.internal quotations omitted.
applying the factors in this manner,kemp concession that bumble bee mark is strong means that there must be greater degree of dissimilarity between the senior mark and the offending mark.compare general mills,kellogg,cir determining that a mark is weak means that consumer confusion has been found unlikely because the mark components are so widely used that the public can easily distinguish slight differences in the marks,even if the goods are related.with squirtco,at a strong and distinctive trademark is entitled to greater protection than a weak or commonplace one.also,a greater level of dissimilarity is required because the products in this case are not priced or sold in a manner that suggests a high level of consumer sophistication or deliberation in the identification of product source.see first national bank,in sioux falls first national bank,south dakota,cir c onsumers tend to exercise a relatively high degree of care in selecting banking services.as a result,customers are more likely to notice what,in other contexts,may be relatively minor differences in names.astra pharm,beckman instruments,cir t here is always less likelihood of confusion where goods are expensive and purchased after careful consideration.electronic design sales,data,p urchaser sophistication is important and often dispositive because s ophisticated consumers may be expected to exercise greater care.third bracket in original quoting pignons de mecanique de precision polaroid.cir squirtco,at t he kind of product,its cost and the conditions of purchase are important factors in considering whether the degree of care exercised by the purchaser can eliminate the likelihood of confusion which would otherwise exist.quoting grotrian,helfferich,schulz,th.steinweg nachf.steinway sons.cir.
as to the second squirtco factor,then,we reject kemp argument that slight differences in trade dress such as type font,text color,and package art make confusion unlikely.bumble bee mark and kemp mark share a dominant phrase louis kemp.viewed in reference to the facts that bumble bee mark is strong and likely consumers are not expected to exercise great scrutiny in the purchase of,supermarket items,we must conclude that the second squirtco factor,similarity of the marks,does not strongly support kemp position 
turning to the third factor,the degree of competition,we note that the two products,wild rice products and products,were not in direct competition.a showing of direct competition,however,is not required,and the factor,degree of competition requires a broader examination of the products relationship in the market.see a a providing for protection against confusion regarding origin,sponsorship,or approval mutual of omaha ins.nova
