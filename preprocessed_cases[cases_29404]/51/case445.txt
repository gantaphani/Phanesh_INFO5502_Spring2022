development and distribution of the coolmail software 
in late,byron darrah darrah developed a program the software that provides users with notice of new and serves as a gateway to the users application.on december,darrah distributed the software over the internet by posting it on a unix user site called sunsite,from which it could be downloaded for free.darrah had named the software coolmail and this designation appeared on the announcement sent to the on sunsite as well as on the software,both of which accompanied the release.
the software was distributed without charge to users pursuant to a gnu general public license that also accompanied the release.a gnu general public license allows users to copy,distribute modify the software under certain restrictions,users modifying licensed files must carry prominent notices stating that the user changed the files and the date of any change.after the release of the software,darrah received correspondence from users referencing the coolmail mark and in some cases suggesting improvements.in,darrah released two subsequent versions of the software under the same mark and also pursuant to the gnu general public license.
in early,a german company named gmbh sought permission from darrah to include the software in a package sold as a compilation of programs.darrah consented and,pursuant to the gnu licensing agreement,distributed the software in its compilation product and in subsequent versions thereof.sold and continues to sell the software compilation in stores in the united states and abroad,as well as over the internet.
ii.launch of techsplosion coolmail service 
in,appellant carson formed techsplosion,for the purpose of operating a business based on an service that he had developed.on april,techsplosion began offering the service on the internet under the mark coolmail.two days later,techsplosion activated the domain name techsplosion delivered an solicitation under the coolmail mark to approximately members of the paramount banner network,an internet advertising network,also created and operated by carson.techsplosion charged no fee to subscribe to the service and generated revenues through the sale of banner advertisements on its web site.
iii.planetary motion service application for trademark registration 
appellee planetary motion is a computer software and telecommunications company that developed and owns an electronic mail service called coolmail.as part of its service,planetary motion enables a person to check via telephone without logging onto a computer.on april,planetary motion filed three applications to register the mark coolmail with the united states patent and trademark office.though planetary motion was aware that darrah software also bore the mark coolmail,it represented in its applications that it was not aware of any mark upon which its proposed registered mark would infringe.planetary motion launched its coolmail service to subscribers on june.
iv.planetary motion complaint and subsequent acquisition of darrah rights 
on april,planetary motion filed a complaint against techsplosion.in the complaint,planetary motion alleged infringement of the alleged mark coolmail for use in connection with services.planetary alleged federal trademark infringement and unfair competition under section a of the lanham act,a,as well as injury to business reputation and dilution under florida statute.
on june,techsplosion filed an answer,affirmative defenses,and counterclaims.the counterclaims alleged infringement of the mark coolmail for use in connection with services.techsplosion alleged unfair competition,false designation,description,and representation under the lanham act,common trademark infringement,common law unfair competition,and injury to business reputation and dilution.
in july of,planetary motion purchased from darrah all rights,title,and interest to the software including all copyrights,trademarks,patents and other intellectual property rights on august,planetary filed an amended verified complaint,adding a claim for dilution under section c of the lanham act,c,and alleging violation of trademark rights assigned from darrah.
disposition of planetary motion complaint 
on january,the district court entered an order granting planetary motion motion for summary judgment and denying carson and techsplosion motion for summary judgment.the district court based the order on two findings that the alleged mark was affixed to darrah software,and that darrah distribution of the software over the internet constituted a transport in commerce,resulting in the creation of trademark rights and priority,and there was a likelihood of confusion because the marks are essentially the same.the district court did not reach the issue of whether techsplosion use of coolmail in connection with its service diluted planetary motion mark.
on the same date,the district court entered final judgment granting planetary motion permanent injunctive relief.see.the order also awarded planetary motion profits and damages,as well as attorney fees and costs,pursuant to section of the lanham act.the district court requested a report and recommendation from a magistrate judge fixing the amounts to be awarded.
a notice of appeal was filed on february.on february,techsplosion filed an emergency motion to stay pending appeal,reasserting that darrah never established any rights in the alleged mark.this motion was denied on february.
on may,the magistrate judge entered his report recommending that planetary motion be awarded in attorneys fees and in costs,but that its request for damages be denied for lack of specificity.techsplosion served its appeal brief on may.on june,the district court entered an order adopting the report and recommendation in its entirety.on july,techsplosion filed a notice of appeal from the order adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation

prior use in commerce 
under common law,trademark ownership rights are appropriated only through actual prior use in commerce,coast community college,cir citation omitted.under the lanham act the term use in commerce is defined in relevant part as follows 
the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade,and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark a mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce on goods when a it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto,or if the nature of the goods makes such placement impracticable,then on documents associated with the goods or their sale,and b the goods are sold or transported in commerce 
the district court found that because the statute is written in the disjunctive,sale or transport,darrah wide distribution of the coolmail software over the internet,even absent any sales thereof,was sufficient to establish ownership rights in the coolmail mark.appellants contend that transport in commerce,darrah free distribution of software over the internet with no existing business,no intent to form a business,and no sale under the mark is insufficient to create trademark rights.appellants brief at.appellants argument lacks merit.
the parties do not make clear the two different contexts in which the phrase use in commerce is used.the term use in commerce as used in the lanham act denotes congress authority under the commerce clause rather than an intent to limit the lanham act application to profit making activity.united we stand,united we stand,am,cir citation omitted,cert.denied,d,art.i,cl.because congress authority under the commerce clause extends to activity that substantially affects interstate commerce,united states lopez,d,the lanham act definition of commerce is concomitantly broad in scope all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by congress.see also steele bulova watch.larry harmon pictures williams rest.allowing registration for an intrastate provider of restaurant services with an undefined interstate clientele,cert.denied,d.the distribution of the software for over the internet satisfies the use in commerce jurisdictional predicate.see,planned parenthood fed of,bucci,wl the nature of the internet indicates that establishing a typical home page on the internet,for access to all users,would satisfy the lanham act in commerce requirement,aff,cir,cert.denied,d.
nevertheless,the use of a mark in commerce also must be sufficient to establish ownership rights for a plaintiff to recover against subsequent users under section a.see new england duplicating mendes,cir after finding use in commerce jurisdiction predicate satisfied,court noted that t he question remains whether the plaintiff has established that he was the owner of the mark,for under only the owner of a mark is entitled to have it registered.the court in mendes set forth a two part test to determine whether a party has established prior use of a mark sufficient to establish ownership 
e vidence showing,first,adoption and,second,use in a way sufficiently public to identify or distinguish the marked goods in an appropriate segment of the public mind as those of the adopter of the mark,is competent to establish ownership,even without evidence of actual sales.
id.at.see also new west,at 
courts generally must inquire into the activities surrounding the prior use of the mark to determine whether such an association or notice is present.see,johnny blastoff,rams football,cir the determination of whether a party has established protectable rights in a trademark is made on a case by case basis,considering the totality of the circumstances,cert.denied,d.under the totality of circumstances analysis,a party may establish use in commerce even in the absence of sales.a lthough evidence of sales is highly persuasive,the question of use adequate to establish appropriation remains one to be decided on the facts of each case new west,at quoting mendes,at.the court in new west recognized that mere advertising by itself may not establish priority of use,but found that promotional mailings coupled with advertiser and distributor solicitations met the mendes public identification ownership requirement.id.at.thus,contrary to appellants assertions,the existence of sales or lack thereof does not by itself determine whether a user of a mark has established ownership rights therein compare marvel comics defiant,finding announcement of plasmer title to million comic book readers and promotion at annual trade convention sufficient to establish trademark ownership rights,notwithstanding lack of any sales with warnervision entm t empire of carolina,finding toy manufacturer promotional efforts insufficient to establish priority of use where only a few presentations were made to industry buyers,even though one resulted in a sale to a major toy retailer,aff in part,vacated in part,cir 
similarly,not every transport of a good is sufficient to establish ownership rights in a mark.to warrant protection,use of a mark need not have gained wide public recognition,but s ecret,undisclosed internal shipments are generally inadequate.blue bell,farah,cir in general,uses that are de minimis may not establish trademark ownership rights.see,paramount pictures white,wl trademark tr.app.bd finding no bona fide use in ordinary course of trade where mark was affixed to a game consisting of three pieces of paper and distributed for the purpose of promoting musical group.
we find that,under these principles,darrah activities under the coolmail mark constitute a use in commerce sufficiently public to create ownership rights in the mark.first,the distribution was widespread,and there is evidence that members of the targeted public actually associated the mark coolmail with the software to which it was affixed.darrah made the software available not merely to a discrete or select group such as friends and acquaintances,or at a trade show with limited attendance,but to numerous via the internet.the software was posted under a filename bearing the coolmail mark on a site accessible to anyone who had access to the internet.communicated with darrah regarding the software by referencing the coolmail mark in their.appellants argue that only made use of the software,but there is no evidence that they were so few in number to warrant a finding of de minimis use.
third,the mark served to identify the source of the software.the coolmail mark appeared in the subject field and in the text of the announcement accompanying each release of the software,thereby distinguishing the software from other programs that might perform similar functions available on the internet or sold in software compilations the announcements also apparently indicated that darrah was the of coolmail and included his address.the user manual also indicated that the software was named coolmail.the german company was able to locate darrah in order to request permission to use his software in its product under the mark coolmail.appellants do not assert that was unaware that the software was called coolmail when it contacted darrah.
fourth,other potential users of the mark had notice that the mark was in use in connection with darrah software.in investigating whether the mark coolmail existed before submitting its trademark registration application for its service,planetary motion was able to discover that darrah was using the mark to designate his software product.
fifth,the software was incorporated into several versions of a product that was in fact sold worldwide and specifically attributed ownership of the software to darrah under the coolmail mark.any individual using the product,or competitor of,that wanted to know the source of the program that performed the notification function,could do so by referring to the user manual accompanying the product there is no support for the argument that for a trademark in software to be valid,the mark must appear on the box containing the product incorporating it,that the mark must be displayed on the screen when the program is running,or that the software bearing the mark be a selling point for the product into which it is incorporated.there is no requirement that the public come to associate a mark with a product in any particular way or that the public be passive viewers of a mark for a sufficient public association to arise.
sixth,software is commonly distributed without charge under a gnu general public license.the sufficiency of use should be determined according to the customary practices of a particular industry.see at the committee intends that the revised definition of use in commerce see note,supra be interpreted to mean commercial use which is typical in a particular industry.emphasis added.that the software had been distributed pursuant to a gnu general public license does not defeat trademark ownership,nor does this in any way compel a finding that darrah abandoned his rights in trademark.appellants misconstrue the function of a gnu general public license.software distributed pursuant to such a license is not necessarily ceded to the public domain and the licensor purports to retain ownership rights,which may or may not include rights to a mark 
appellants cite heinemann general motors,aff,cir,for the proposition that darrah was a hobbyist unworthy of common law trademark protection.heinemann is factually distinguishable from the case at hand.the plaintiff in heinemann used a mark in connection with his automobile before an automobile manufacturer independently had adopted the same name for a new model.the court held that the plaintiff had not established common law ownership rights based on two findings.first,the court found that because heinemann purpose in using the mark was to open at a later date an automobile equipment shop which would have capitalized upon the slogan,he merely attempted to reserve a trade or service mark pending the creation of a trade or business.at.the court reasoned as follows 
while the law does not require a nationwide business an old,established business or even a profitable business for the acquisition of property interests in trade or service marks,it does require a presently existing trade or business for such acquisition.the exhibits disclose that plaintiff had only a desire to open a business in futuro.to hold otherwise would make a trade mark a property right in gross,instead of a right appurtenant.
id.emphasis in original.the heinemann court also found that plaintiff heinemann activities consisted merely of occasionally racing or displaying the automobile at fairs as a hobby,as evidenced by his testimony that he was employed at an oil company.id.here,darrah did not attempt to warehouse the mark by promoting a product he merely intended to develop and distribute at a later date.darrah use of the mark to designate the distributed software and each subsequent version thereof indicates that his use was not mere sporadic or token use furthermore,unlike heinemann,darrah activities pertained to his chosen profession.darrah is employed as a computer systems administrator,which entails the management and oversight of computer networks and systems as well as the development of software in support thereof.
appellants also rely on decosta columbia broad,cir,cert.denied,d,to argue that darrah is an eleemosynary individual and therefore unworthy of protection under unfair competition laws.the decosta court did not hold that the that the absence of a enterprise renders one an eleemosynary individual,nor did it hold that such individuals categorically are denied protection.rather,the decosta court expressed misgivings of extending common law unfair competition protection,clearly available to eleemosynary organizations,to eleemosynary individuals id.the court reluctance to extend protection to eleemosynary individuals was based on an apparent difficulty in establishing a line of demarcation between those eleemosynary individuals engaged in commerce and those that are not.but as the sufficiency of use to establish trademark ownership is inherently,the court need not have based its decision on such a consideration.mendes,at.common law unfair competition protection extends to organizations because they nonetheless engage in competition with other organizations see girls clubs of,boys clubs of,aff,cir.thus,an eleemosynary individual that uses a mark in connection with a good or service may nonetheless acquire ownership rights in the mark if there is sufficient evidence of competitive activity 
here,darrah activities bear elements of competition,notwithstanding his lack of an immediate.by developing and distributing software under a particular mark,and taking steps to avoid ceding the software to the public domain,darrah made efforts to retain ownership rights in his software and to ensure that his software would be distinguishable from other developers who may have distributed similar or related software.at.competitive activity need not be fueled solely by a desire for direct monetary gain.darrah derived value from the distribution because he was able to improve his software based on suggestions sent by.just as any other consumers,these discriminate among and share information on available software.it is logical that as the software improved,more used his software,thereby increasing darrah recognition in his profession and the likelihood that the software would be improved even further.
in light of the foregoing,the use of the mark in connection with the software constitutes significant and substantial public exposure of a mark sufficient to have created an association in the mind of public.
ii.likelihood of confusion 
the district court supported its determination of likelihood of confusion with the following findings the mark used by planetary motion coolmail is essentially the same as that used by techsplosion coolmail both marks are used in connection with services both plaintiff and defendants serve customers via the internet and both use the internet to promote their services.appellants do not dispute the accuracy of these findings.rather,appellants claim the district court improperly based its analysis on a comparison of the parties respective services,rather than on a comparison of techsplosion coolmail service to the coolmail software.appellants argue that the latter comparison is required because planetary motion acquired its rights to the coolmail mark by assignment of rights in darrah software,and under the natural expansion doctrine this is a use unrelated to planetary motion current use of services.thus,appellants argument in essence goes to whether the scope of trademark protection enjoyed by planetary motion extends from the initial use in connection with the software to the current use in connection with planetary motion services.
the scope of protection enjoyed by a trademark owner is not restricted to the owner original use.the natural expansion doctrine is applied to determine the proper scope of protection where a mark owner previous use differs from its current use,and the junior use intervenes.under this doctrine,the first trademark owner rights are limited to goods on which the mark has already been used or that lie within the realm of natural expansion t his appears to be no more than a specific application of the familiar related goods test.mccarthy,see also carnival,at.
the court in explained that a senior user rights may extend into uses in related product or service markets termed the related goods doctrine,and that an owner of a common law trademark may use its mark on related products or services and may enjoin a junior user use of the mark on such related uses at citing mccarthy,to.this rule is limited by equitable considerations.the court in carnival noted that a trademark owner can not by the normal expansion of its business extend the use or registration of its mark to distinctly different goods or services not comprehended by its previous use where the result could be a conflict with valuable intervening rights established by another through extensive use of the same or similar mark for like or similar goods and services.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.
courts determine the proper scope of protection of a mark in the context of intervening uses by applying the source or sponsorship test.under this test,a trademark owner has protection against use of its mark on any product or service which would reasonably be thought by the buying public to come from the same source,or thought to be affiliated with,connected with,or sponsored by,the trademark owner.mccarthy.the public perception in this regard is determined at the time the junior user first used the mark on the product or service to which the allegedly infringing mark is affixed carnival,at.the court in explained that related use is merely a facet of the likelihood of confusion test and therefore requires an inquiry into the seven factors affecting the likelihood of confusion at.
we find that the relatedness between notification software and a service that allows users to check via telephone line is not so attenuated that the district court mistakenly failed to limit planetary motion rights in the mark to its use in connection with the software.consumers reasonably could attribute the software and an service under the same name to the same source for several reasons both the software and the service belong to the same general field of commerce,information technology,and both deal more specifically with appellants do not dispute planetary motion contention that major firms in this field sell software as well as provide service see darrah affidavit.at.both the software and the service involve sending messages over the internet the former provides a functionality that enables a user with capability to receive notification of new mail,and the latter enables subscribers to the service to send and receive.both the software and the service were promoted over the internet to those who make use of.
furthermore,the equities do not necessarily favor techsplosion techsplosion coolmail service had not been in operation for an extended period of time before planetary motion entered the market under the name coolmail,and planetary motion is not merely attempting to reserve the mark for a future business endeavor.accordingly,we sustain the district court finding of likelihood of confusion.
iii.relief 
review of the district court award of injunctive relief,attorney fees and costs is for abuse of discretion.see burger king weaver,cir,cert.dismissed,d,at.
injunctive relief 
appellants assert that the injunctive relief awarded by the district court is impermissibly vague and overbroad.appellants contend that the language imposes a grossly unfair burden on techsplosion,as it does not allow for a determination of what is and is not permitted under the injunctive provisions.appellants brief at.federal rule of civil procedure d states in relevant part every order granting an injunction shall be specific in terms and shall describe in reasonable detail the act or acts sought to be restrained.d.a clear and unambiguous order is one that leaves no uncertainty in the minds of those to whom it is addressed,who must be able to ascertain from the four corners of the order precisely what acts are forbidden.king allied vision,cir citations omitted.optimally,the injunction 
should clearly let defendant know what he is ordered to do or not to do.a court order should be phrased in terms of objective actions,not legal conclusions.an injunction which merely forbids a defendant from performing acts of unfair competition,or from infringing on plaintiff trademarks and trade secrets adds nothing to what the law already requires.
john harland clarke checks,cir quoting mccarthy,at emphasis added.
notwithstanding these strictures,appellate courts do not set aside injunctions under rule d unless they are so vague that they have no reasonably specific meaning.gallo winery gallo cattle,cir.rather than applying rule d rigidly,appellate courts determine the propriety of an injunctive order by inquiring into whether the parties subject thereto understand their obligations under the order.williams city of dothan,cir citing combs ryan coal,cir,cert.denied sub nom.simmons combs,d,modified,cir.furthermore,the degree of particularity required depends on the nature of the subject matter.mccomb jacksonville paper.decrees of generality are often necessary to prevent further violations where a proclivity for unlawful conduct has been shown.
here,although several parts of the order are phrased in terms of legal conclusions,the order,read as a whole,clearly indicates what techsplosion is forbidden from doing according to the order,techsplosion is permanently enjoined from using the name coolmail in connection with or other services,in connection with software,and as part of the domain name of its website.these limitations sufficiently define the scope of the injunction and give context to the arguably legally conclusory language included therein.furthermore,the use of any similar mark after references to coolmail does not detract from this level of specificity.see planned parenthood,upholding preliminary injunction that prohibited defendant from using mark or any colorable imitation of that mark anywhere on the internet and from taking actions likely to cause confusion among internet users regarding planned parenthood endorsement or sponsorship of defendant site.appellants do not propose any reading of the language in the injunction that would impermissibly prohibit conduct that techsplosion arguably has the right to do.bunn aaa replacement parts,cir finding injunction impermissible where broad reference to opinion findings of fact appeared to enjoin perfectly legal acts.but see ambrit,kraft,cir an injunction can be therapeutic as well as protective.in fashioning relief against a party who has transgressed the governing legal standards,a court of equity is free to proscribe activities that,standing alone,would have been unassailable.citation omitted,cert.denied,d.nor do appellants explain how the wording of the injunction could lend itself to alternate interpretations.in the absence of any apparent contextual ambiguities or alternate readings prohibiting legal conduct,it is unlikely that appellants will misapprehend what conduct is proscribed,or will incur liability to contempt citations for activities not contemplated by this order.
attorney fees 
awards of attorney fees are reviewable only to determine if the trial court abused its discretion in granting or denying them see charles mercer,cir.stat.provides for injunctive relief only.under section a of the lanham act,however,courts may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in exceptional cases.a.see also montgomery,at.exceptional cases are those where the infringing party acts in a malicious,fraudulent,deliberate,or willful manner.burger king pilgrim pride,cir quoting,reprinted in,internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the district court awarded attorney fees without articulating a basis for doing so,let alone the factual circumstances that would warrant such an award furthermore,there is nothing in the record to support a finding of malicious,fraudulent,deliberate,or willful conduct on the part of planetary motion.remand is therefore unnecessary on this issue.accordingly,we find that the award of attorney fees is an abuse of discretion and vacate the award.
award of costs 
under the lanham act,a successful party subject to the principles of equity may recover defendant the infringer profits any damages sustained by the plaintiff,and the costs of the action.a.see babbit,dynascan,cir.to recover costs under the lanham act,therefore,a plaintiff need not establish that the alleged infringer acted maliciously,fraudulently,deliberately,or willfully.because it was within the district court discretion to award costs,and in the absence of any evidence that would warrant a finding that the balance of equities necessarily tipped in favor of techsplosion,we uphold the award of costs to planetary motion.
conclusion 
accordingly,the district court order and final judgment are affirmed,except that the order adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation,with respect to the award of attorney fees,is vacated.
the assignee of a trade name or service mark steps into the shoes of the assignor.premier dental prods.darby dental supply,cir,cert.denied,d.appellants do not contest the validity of the assignment from darrah,nor do they dispute that in purchasing rights to darrah software,planetary motion succeeded to all rights possessed by darrah.

courts may use an analysis of federal infringement claims as a measuring stick in evaluating the merits of state law claims of unfair competition.see investacorp,arabian inv.banking investcorp,cir,cert.denied,d.
in the absence of registration,rights to a mark traditionally have depended on the very same elements that are now included in the statutory definition the bona fide use of a mark in commerce that was not made merely to reserve a mark for later exploitation.allard,advanced programming,cir.common law and statutory trademark infringements are merely specific aspects of unfair competition.new west nym of,cir citing,inter alia,dresser,heraeus engelhard vacuum,cir,cert.denied,d.
appellants appear to have conceded that if darrah sent out original programs and related manuals,this would satisfy the affixation requirement gigliotti counsel for techsplosion the mark has to be on the product or on the associated documentation.it is on court it is not on the associated documentation how about the original programs darrah sent out and manuals that went with it,and all that material,was that enough for.gigliotti yes,your honor,that is affixation however,he did not meet the sale to.in any case,the affixation requirement is met because the software was distributed under a filename that is also the claimed mark,was promoted under the same mark,was accompanied by a user manual bearing the mark,and was sold in a compilation under the mark.
it is uncontested that darrah adopted the mark coolmail before appellants use of the mark in connection with their service.
this ownership test is not for the purpose of establishing the use in commerce jurisdictional predicate of the lanham act.see,of kpb,cir.see supra discussion in text.
this ownership requirement parallels the statutory definition of trademark any word,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof used by a person to identify and distinguish his or her goods from those manufactured or sold by others.the seventh circuit has held that a higher quantum of use may be necessary to establish ownership rights under common law than under the statute because the notice function of registration is lacking.see zazu designs,cir.in addition,the continuity of a user commercial activities in connection with the mark is also relevant to determining whether use is sufficient to establish common law ownership.circuit city stores,carmax,cir a party establishes a common law right to a trademark only by demonstrating that its use of the mark was deliberate and continuous,not sporadic,casual or transitory.
appellants cite future domain trantor,wl for the proposition that there must be a sale in order to satisfy the use in commerce requirement.future domain,however,turned not on the existence of sales but whether the extent of the purported mark owner activities created a public association between the mark and the product.there,the court determined that a computer software manufacturer promotion of a mark at a trade at most persons actually received or requested information about the mark and where no orders were not sufficient to create such an association.id.at.
courts applying the totality of circumstances approach routinely have found evidence of a few sales of goods to which the mark had been affixed insufficient to establish trademark ownership.for example,in zazu designs,at,the plaintiff hair salon had sold a few bottles of shampoo bearing the mark zazu both over the counter and mailed over state lines.the court found that such limited sales neither link the zazu mark with the plaintiff product in the minds of consumers nor put other producers on notice.id.at.

because a gnu general public license requires licensees who wish to copy,distribute,or modify the software to include a copyright notice,the license itself is evidence of darrah efforts to control the use of the coolmail mark in connection with the software.
appellants contend that the district court erred in ignoring the first sentence of the present definition of use in commerce the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade,and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark,which was added pursuant to the trademark law revision act of revision act,stat.the court in allard found that a magistrate judge reliance on case law that antedated the revision was proper because the language of the revised definition is entirely consistent with the traditional rules governing ownership of trademarks.at.the allard court noted that the purpose of this revision was to eliminate token use as a basis for registration,and that the stricter standard contemplates instead commercial use of the type common to the particular industry in question.id.citation omitted.the reason token use was expressly eliminated was that the revision act had created an application system that rendered such a commercial sham unnecessary.see cong.rec.the revision did not alter the meaning of the phrase sold or transported in commerce or in any way increase the quantum of use necessary to acquire trademark ownership as developed by common law.see id.congress intent that the revised definition still encompass genuine,but less traditional,trademark uses must be made clear.for example,such uses as clinical shipments of a new drug awaiting fda approval,test marketing,or infrequent sales of large or expensive or seasonal products,reflect legitimate trademark uses in the normal course of trade and are not to be excluded by the house language.there is no evidence to support the contention that darrah purpose was merely to secure trademark rights to reserve the mark for future use.
it is unlikely that the plaintiff activities in de performances and distribution of his picture at local rodeos,parades,hospitals,generate a public association sufficient to confer him common law trademark ownership rights.the court assumed arguendo,however,that the plaintiff activities did warrant protection,and went on to find that the evidence did not support a finding of likelihood of confusion.
the decosta court recognized that the law of unfair competition protects eleemosynary organizations which function in commerce and,in form,resemble business enterprises the happenstance that they are ventures,and therefore removed,as such,from the rigors of business c
