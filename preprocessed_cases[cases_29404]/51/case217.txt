the fourth,sixth,tenth,and circuits apply different tests of exceptionality depending on whether it was the plaintiff or the defendant who prevailed.in the fourth and circuits a prevailing plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorneys fees if the defendant infringement most cases under the lanham act charge trademark infringement was willful or in bad faith these terms being regarded as synonyms,while a prevailing defendant can qualify for an award of attorney fees upon a showing of something less than bad faith by the plaintiff,such as economic coercion,groundless arguments,and failure to cite controlling law.retail services freebies publishing,cir reader digest ass n,conservative digest.
in the tenth circuit the prevailing plaintiff has to prove that the defendant acted in bad faith,while the prevailing defendant need only show lack of any foundation of the lawsuit,the plaintiff bad faith in bringing the suit,the unusually vexatious and oppressive manner in which it is prosecuted,or perhaps for other reasons as well.national ass of professional baseball leagues,very minor leagues,cir.given the fourth item in this list,the tenth circuit can hardly be said to have a test.
the sixth circuit asks in the case of a prevailing plaintiff whether the defendant infringement of the plaintiff trademark was malicious,fraudulent,willful,or deliberate,and in the case of a prevailing defendant whether the plaintiff suit was oppressive.eagles,american eagle foundation,f d,cir.as factors indicating oppressiveness,eagles quotes the tenth circuit list but states in the alternative,quoting see id.at our opinion in s industries,centra,cir,that a suit is oppressive if it lacked merit,had elements of an abuse of process claim,and plaintiff conduct unreasonably increased the cost of defending against the suit.

and where are we,the seventh circuit,in this jumble in door systems,door systems,cir,we said that the test was whether the conduct of the party from which the payment of attorneys fees was sought had been oppressive,and that whether the plaintiff suit was oppressive turned on whether the suit was something that might be described not just as a losing suit but as a suit that had elements of an abuse of process,whether or not it had all the elements of the tort.but that,we said,would not be the right question if the plaintiff had prevailed and was seeking the award of attorneys fees.in such a case the focus would be on whether the defendant had lacked a solid justification for the defense or had put the plaintiff to an unreasonable expense in suing.id.the quoted passage was actually discussing the award of attorneys fees under the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act.but fees were also sought under the lanham act,and the to make sense of one of the definitions of exceptional namely,malicious,fraudulent,deliberate,or willful that is found,as we noted earlier,in the that the test is the same under both statutes oppressive,in the sense expounded in door systems.id.at.
in later cases we said that oppressive conduct by a plaintiff that might justify an award of reasonable attorneys fees to the defendant would be conduct that lacked merit,had elements of an abuse of process claim,and plaintiff conduct in the litigation unreasonably increased the cost of defending against the suit,s industries,centra,supra,at see also central,brett,cir that oppressive conduct by defendants included not only willful infringement of the plaintiff trademark but also vexatious litigation conduct,truth of uri,world church of the creator,cir and that a finding that a suit was oppressive could be based solely on the weakness of the plaintiff claims,s industries,centra,supra,at,or the plaintiff vexatious litigation conduct.truth of uri,world church of the creator,supra,at.so vexatious litigation conduct by the losing party can justify the award of attorneys fees to the winner,regardless of which side engages in such conduct,as long as it the losing side.
it is surprising to find so many different standards for awarding attorneys fees in lanham act cases.the failure to converge may be an illustration of circuit drift the heavy caseloads and large accumulations of precedent in each circuit induce courts of appeals to rely on their own circuit law,as if each circuit were a separate jurisdiction rather than all being part of a single national judiciary enforcing a uniform body of federal law.but whether the difference in standards generates actual differences in result is unclear because the opinions avoid commitment by using vague words and explicit escape clauses,with the tenth circuit catchall perhaps for other reasons as well taking the prize.to decide whether the standards differ more than semantically would require a close study of the facts of each case.
it may be helpful in the interest of clarity,simplicity,and uniformity to start with first principles,by asking why the lanham act makes an exception,albeit a narrow one if exceptional is to be given proper force,to the american rule that forbids shifting the litigation expenses of the prevailing party to the loser.
the reason has been said to be that the public interest in the integrity of marks as a measure of quality of products is so great that it would be unconscionable not to provide a complete remedy including attorney fees for acts which courts have characterized as malicious,fraudulent,deliberate,and willful,and the award of fees would make a trademark owner remedy complete in enforcing his mark against willful infringers,and would give defendants a remedy against unfounded suits,sess.in addition,the patent and copyright statutes authorize the award of attorneys fees,id.at,and trademark law protects an analogous form of intellectual property.
a more practical concern is the potential for businesses to use lanham act litigation for strategic to obtain a judgment or defeat a claim but to obtain a competitive advantage independent of the outcome of the case by piling litigation costs on a competitor.almost all cases under the act this one,as we see,is a rare exception,whether they are suits for trademark infringement or for false advertising,a,are between competitors.the owner of a trademark might bring a lanham act suit against a new entrant into his market,alleging trademark infringement but really just hoping to drive out the entrant by imposing heavy litigation costs on him.see,peaceable planet,ty,cir.trademark suits,like much other commercial litigation,often are characterized by firms desire to heap costs on their rivals,imposing marketplace losses out of proportion to the legal merits.mead johnson abbott laboratories,cir.the increased ease of bringing suit in federal court and the greater availability of remedies may extend the competitive battlefield beyond the shelves of the supermarket and into the halls of the courthouse.commentators have already suggested that the availability of large damage awards will motivate firms to litigate false advertising suits aggressively in the hope of winning large damage awards and impairing the competitiveness of a business rival,particularly a new entrant.james kobak mary fleck,commercial defamation claim added to revised lanham act.similarly,a large firm sued for trademark infringement by a small one might mount a defense to a meritorious claim in the hope of imposing prohibitive litigation costs on the plaintiff.
these,then,are the types of suit rightly adjudged exceptional for in a battle of equals each contestant can bear his own litigation costs without impairing competition.
when the plaintiff is the oppressor,the concept of abuse of process provides a helpful characterization of his conduct.unlike malicious prosecution,which involves filing a baseless suit to harass or intimidate an antagonist,abuse of process is the use of the litigation process for an improper purpose,whether or not the claim is colorable.the gist of the abuse of process tort is said to be misuse of legal process primarily to accomplish a purpose for which it was not designed,usually to compel the victim to yield on some matter not involved in the suit if the plaintiff can show instigation of a suit for an improper purpose without probable cause and with a termination favorable to the now plaintiff,she has a malicious prosecution or a wrongful litigation claim,not a claim for abuse of process t he abuse of process claim permits the plaintiff to recover without showing the traditional want of probable cause for the original suit and without showing termination of that suit.dan dobbs,the law of torts.abuse of process is a prime example of litigating in bad faith.
the term abuse of process is not used to describe behavior by defendants.id.it has been said that while it is obvious that the torts of abuse of process and malicious prosecution are prevalent and damaging to both innocent defendants as well as the judicial process,it is not so obvious where the line is that separates an attorney zealous advocacy from his tortious interference with the litigation processes.leah pollema,beyond the bounds of zealous advocacy the prevalence of abusive litigation in family law and the need for tort remedies.city.but the need to draw that line is the same whether the plaintiff is attacking or the defendant is defending.if a defendant trademark infringement or false advertising is blatant,his insistence on mounting a costly defense is the same misconduct as a plaintiff bringing a case frivolous or not not in order to obtain a favorable judgment but instead to burden the defendant with costs likely to drive it out of the market.predatory initiation of suit is mirrored in predatory resistance to valid claims.
we conclude that a case under the lanham act is exceptional,in the sense of warranting an award of reasonable attorneys fees to the winning party,if the losing party was the plaintiff and was guilty of abuse of process in suing,or if the losing party was the defendant and had no defense yet persisted in the trademark infringement or false advertising for which he was being sued,in order to impose costs on his opponent.
this approach captures the concerns that underlie the various tests and offers a pathway through the semantic jungle.it can account for most of the case outcomes in the various circuits with the exception of those that make it easier for prevailing defendants to obtain attorneys fees than prevailing plaintiffs.the usual rule,notably in civil rights cases,is the reverse a prevailing plaintiff is presumptively entitled to an award of attorneys fees,while a prevailing defendant is entitled to such an award only if the plaintiff suit was frivolous,fogerty fantasy,inc,christiansburg garment eeoc,sullivan william randolph,cir.but those are cases in which the plaintiff is an individual and the defendant a corporation or other institution,implying an asymmetry of resources for litigation.plaintiffs and defendants in lanham act cases usually are symmetrically situated they are businesses.of course they may be very different in size,but this is not a reason for a general rule favoring prevailing plaintiffs or prevailing defendants,for there is no correlation between the size of a party and which side of the litigation he on.big businesses sue big and small businesses for trademark infringement and false advertising,and small businesses sue big and small businesses for the same torts.disparity in size will often be relevant in evaluating the legitimacy of the suit or defense,but it is as likely to favor the defendant as the plaintiff.
but there a puzzle cases such as chambers nasco,state that one of the inherent powers of a federal court is to assess attorney fees when a party has acted in bad faith,vexatiously,wantonly,or for oppressive reasons.for similar formulations,see,mach will county sheriff,cir mañez bridgestone firestone north american tire,llc,cir.that sounds a lot like the abuse of process test that we think best describes the exceptional case that merits an award of attorneys fees under the lanham act.but if we are right about our interpretation of exceptional case,the question arises why congress bothered to include a provision in the act for did the courts already have inherent power to award fees for abuse of process in lanham act cases 
although the fee provision of the lanham act dates only from,already by then the courts inherent power to assess fees for abusive litigation was recognized.see,rich united states ex rel.industrial lumber,newman piggie park enterprises.but in fleischmann distilling maier brewing,decided eight years before the fee provision was added to the lanham act,the supreme court held that attorneys fees could not be awarded in cases under the act it was that decision which prompted congress to add the provision.fleischmann rejected the proposition that courts could award fees in cases under the act without explicit statutory authorization.the recognized exceptions to the general rule of no fee shifting were not developed in the context of statutory causes of action for which the legislature had prescribed intricate remedies i n the lanham act,congress meticulously detailed the remedies available to a plaintiff who proves that his valid trademark has been infringed.it provided not only for injunctive relief,but also for compensatory recovery measured by the profits that accrued to the defendant by virtue of his infringement,the costs of the action,and damages which may be trebled in appropriate circumstances when a cause of action has been created by a statute which expressly provides the remedies for vindication of the cause,other remedies should not readily be implied.id.this reasoning is co
