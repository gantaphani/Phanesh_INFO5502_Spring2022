times mirror magazines,tm owns and publishes field stream magazine.tm and its predecessor in interest,the columbia broadcasting system cbs,entered into a series of agreements with defendants to govern the use of the name field stream as a trademark.at the core of this appeal lies tm contention that the agreements left tm with a residual common law right to use the mark in connection with all items associated with hunting and fishing.we conclude that no such residual right exists and that the parties relative rights to the mark are governed by their agreements.because defendants acted within their rights under the agreements and tm has not shown that the public interest requires rescission of the contracts,we affirm.
background 
field stream magazine has been published since.the magazine focuses on hunting,fishing,and other outdoor themes and reaches approximately million readers per month.
the magazine owners were not the first to register field stream as a trademark,however.gordon ferguson company,the owner of gordon ferguson merchandising company collectively,g f,has been in business since.g f began selling clothing under the name field stream in and first registered the name as a trademark for clothing in.tm registered field stream as a trademark for its monthly magazine on october,and later registered the mark for video cassette tapes featuring outdoor activities calendars credit card,debit card and cash disbursement services and entertainment services.
in,defendant jerome lavin took control of the various g f businesses.in,lavin formed defendant field stream licenses company fslc to license the field stream mark to third parties that manufacture and sell clothing.
the disputes and resulting agreements 
cbs,which then owned field stream magazine,and g f eventually came into conflict over use of the mark,and in,they entered into an agreement the agreement to resolve that conflict.cbs agreed that g f had the exclusive rights,worldwide in and to the use of the trademark field stream on and in connection with items of apparel.the agreement defined apparel as any item of clothing or dress which may normally be worn on the human body,excluding however,jewelry,boots,shoes and other items of footwear.cbs also agreed not to contest any trademark registration application that g f made in connection with apparel.
g f,in turn,acknowledged the exclusive worldwide rights of cbs to use the field stream trademark for magazines and publications and on such other products,related to hunting,fishing and associated outdoor activities,as have been offered and sold by field stream magazine under such trademark in the past including by way of example but not limitation figurines,prints,books,and binoculars.the agreement allowed cbs six months to review its prior offerings and expand the list of items on which it had used the mark.cbs did not add to the list.g f also gave cbs an exclusive license to use the mark in connection with socks and a license for men ties and women scarves.finally,g f recognized that cbs was concerned over the use of the mark on the following merchandise which is extensively advertised in field stream magazine,namely,fishing rods,reels,lures,lines,guns,shells and bullets,tents,and sleeping bags.to avoid alienating field stream magazine advertisers,both parties agreed to neither manufacture nor sell these items using the mark.
in,fslc filed five intent to use itu trademark applications in connection with the field stream mark for merchandise including sunglasses hunting knives and hunting seats utility boxes flashlights clocks watches desk accessories retail clothing store services and retail sporting goods and services.after tm objected to the applications,the parties again entered into negotiations over their respective rights in the field stream mark.pl.compl.
the resulting agreement,signed in agreement,reaffirmed the agreement except as specifically modified.it also terminated tm right to use the mark on ties and scarves deleted the portion of the agreement that prevented tm from using the mark on fishing rods,reels,lures,lines,guns,shells,and bullets and gave tm the exclusive right to use the mark on these items required fslc to delete utility boxes sold empty and hunting and archery equipment from its applications required fslc to replace hunting knives in the applications with pocket knives and cutlery,and table knives,not designed for use primarily for hunting and fishing required fslc to specify that the sunglasses covered by the application were not designed for use primarily for hunting or fishing and provided that fslc would withdraw entirely another application.in return for the amended and withdrawn applications,tm agreed not to oppose fslc remaining itu applications.
on november,fslc filed additional itu applications for products,some of which were related to hunting,fishing,and similar outdoor activities.after tm objected,the parties entered into two additional made in agreement and the other in.
the agreement did not specifically address the itu applications.it continued the and agreements except as specifically modified terminated tm right to use the mark on socks gave tm the exclusive right to use the mark in connection with tents and sleeping bags provided for payments of royalties by tm to fslc on sales of tents and sleeping bags and by fslc to tm on sales of socks precluded tm from disposing of its mark for tents and sleeping bags without fslc consent and fslc from selling its mark for socks without tm consent provided for sharing profits equally should the mark for sleeping bags,tents,or socks be sold and precluded each party from using the other typography for the mark the agreement also included the following paragraph

in june,the parties signed the field stream itu and related matters settlement agreement agreement,which recites that the parties wished to settle the itu controversy and related matters.the agreement contains a merger clause this agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the itu applications and related subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior written and oral agreements or statements by and between the parties hereto.
in addition to these general provisions,the agreement set out the rights of the parties in four areas first,it granted an exclusive right to use the trademark on certain goods to each of the parties second,it provided a mechanism for one party to capture an exclusive right to use the trademark in connection with goods listed in the itus but not allocated to either of the parties third,for certain other products,it allowed the parties to attempt to capture the right to use the mark on an alternating basis and fourth,it contained provisions designed to discourage future trademark contests and litigation.
the agreement gave tm the exclusive right to use the mark in connection with fuel additives for gasoline engines,trolling motors for crafts,and electric depth finders and required fslc to delete these items from its itu applications.fslc received the exclusive right to the mark in connection with many other items including life saving vests,portable refrigeration devices,electric blankets,and storage boxes except boxes designed and sold exclusively as fishing tackle boxes.
as to goods listed in the itu applications but not specifically allocated to either party,the agreement allowed the party that first used or licensed the mark in connection with a particular class of goods an exclusive right to the mark for that class,provided that the user or licensor followed certain notification procedures.a party that commenced use or sale of any such product was required to notify the other party in writing,and upon written request to provide substantial evidence of use,which was defined as i copies of written contracts ii product designs,samples or prototypes iii purchase orders or paid invoices and iv product sales material or advertising.
if,on the other hand,a party merely began negotiating the sale of a license,it was required only to notify the other party.for a period of ninety days after notification,the negotiating party had the exclusive right to negotiate the license.if the negotiating party failed to strike a bargain within the period or abandoned its efforts,the other party could seek a licensing arrangement.upon discontinuing its efforts within the period or arriving at an agreement,the negotiating party was obligated to notify the other party.if the negotiating party entered into an actual agreement,it was required to certify that its licensee i is a third party that is not an affiliate,ii has an operating business,and iii is in the product business for the goods to be licensed or has the qualifications to be in such business.
tm had a first opportunity to license row boats,speed boats,canoes,inflatable boats,boat trailers,canoe paddles,boat oars,boat ladders,maps,boat covers,and motors for craft.for any of these products that tm did not license within a year,fslc would get the exclusive licensing right for the next twelve months.thereafter,the parties alternated exclusive rights on any of the products that remained unlicensed every twelve months.
in provisions designed to avoid future litigation,tm agreed to withdraw its opposition to fslc remaining itu applications,and both parties promised that they would not file any future applications to register the trademark for any product except based upon actual use or licensing of the trademark for such product.the parties also agreed to use their best efforts to not use,license or apply for registration of the trademark for a product that is confusingly similar to a product used,licensed or registered by the other party under the trademark.finally,they agreed that 
if a party hereto has a product specified to be reserved exclusively to that party the use party,the other party shall not at any time file any opposition or cancellation with the patent and trademark office pto,commence any civil proceeding for damages or injunctive relief,or make any other legal claim that directly or indirectly would hinder the use party use of the trademark for a product reserved exclusively to the use party or prevent the pto from issuing a trademark registration to the use party 
in june,fslc gave tm notice that it had entered into negotiations with a prospective licensee,the national buying syndicate nbs.these negotiations did not succeed,but during a period beginning in july,fslc entered into five license agreements that tm claims are shams.the licensed items included camping equipment,toys,furniture,utility boxes for use,trucks,vans,cars,and recreational vehicles.in november and august,fslc entered into licensing agreements with triad sportswear for the use of the mark on hunting and fishing apparel.in january,fslc licensed the mark to suntime international for use on watches.
the lawsuit and the district court decision 
on december,tm filed a lawsuit against fslc.tm alleged breach of contract,trademark infringement,false designation of origin,and unfair competition.in addition to other relief,tm sought rescission of all its contracts with fslc,a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief limiting fslc right in the mark to apparel,and cancellation of some of fslc registrations and applications for registration.fslc answered and counterclaimed,alleging that tm breached the agreement by opposing some of fslc trademark applications and filing this lawsuit.
after the completion of discovery,fslc and lavin moved for summary judgment.judge chin granted their motion in a careful and thorough opinion.see times mirror magazines,field stream licenses,d.he first found that the agreement settled all outstanding matters between the parties and therefore declined to address alleged breaches that occurred before june.id.at.next,he found that each of the agreements was clear on its face.id.at.after parsing each of the agreements,judge chin also found that the agreements did not,either singly or in combination,give tm the exclusive right it claimed to all goods associated with hunting and fishing.id.at.alternatively,he found that even if the earlier agreements could be construed as giving tm an exclusive right to use the mark in the areas of hunting and fishing,the agreement superceded all prior agreements and set out rules for the licensing of products not listed in the itus.id.at.the court also found that the agreement did not prohibit either party from capturing products listed in the itu applications by licensing the mark to a third party but rather explicitly contemplated such captures.id.
applying the general principles that it had formulated,that is,that breaches were not actionable,tm did not have an exclusive right to use the mark in connection with hunting and fishing products,and either party could capture the mark for use in connection with a given product by licensing the mark to a third party,judge chin rejected tm claim that defendants materially breached the agreements by developing and attempting to sell a utility box that could be used as a fishing tackle box attempting to capture fields of use by misrepresenting that it was engaged in bona fide negotiations to license the mark to nbs entering into sham licensing agreements developing,manufacturing,or selling products intended for hunting,fishing,sporting,or other outdoor activities falsely claiming in applications to the united states patent and trade office that it had used the mark in connection with certain products.id.at.
in discussing the utility box claim,judge chin held that the agreement only required fslc to amend its itu application to exclude storage boxes designed and sold exclusively as fishing tackle boxes and did not prohibit fslc from using the field stream mark in connection with fishing tackle boxes.id.at.therefore,fslc retained the right to capture fishing tackle boxes by first use,and its use of the mark in connection with the boxes did not violate the agreement.id.
judge chin also rejected tm contention that fslc negotiations with nbs breached the agreement.he found that the agreement did not require that negotiations with potential licenses be substantial and bona fide but rather required only that the negotiating party notify the other party that it had begun negotiations.id.at.because fslc never reached an agreement with nbs,the judge found fslc had no obligation to comply with any of the other requirements of the first use provision.id.at.judge chin further noted that even though fslc did not notify tm that it had terminated negotiations with nbs,tm conceded that none of its breach of contract claims were based on this alleged lack of notification and,in any event,a breach based on failure to notify tm of the termination of negotiations would be immaterial as a matter of law.id.at.
tm contention that licensing agreements between fslc and bimini bay outfitters,folsom,casual lifestyles,adventurous products,a sporting frame of mind,and waldoch crafts were illusory and breached the agreement fared no better.tm based its argument on the following indicia fslc drafted all the agreements the agreements did not contain minimum advertising,net worth,or license fee requirements only brief negotiations and financial discussions preceded the licensing the licensees did not advertise or otherwise market the products they produced and few,if any,products were actually manufactured and sold.id.at.finding that the agreement required only that fslc provide tm with a copy of the license agreement and certification of the licensee independence and capacity,judge chin rejected tm argument.id.
because judge chin already had rejected tm claim that the agreements gave tm an exclusive right to use the mark in connection with the broad category of products relating to hunting,fishing,and outdoor activities,he found that fslc did not breach the agreement by selling such products.id.at.
the judge rejected tm claim of breach based on misstatements in trademark applications because two of the claimed misstatements were not false,and the third,even if false,was not material.id.at.
in addition to seeking rescission based on alleged express breaches of the agreements,tm argued that it was entitled to rescission because fslc breached the agreements implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing.judge chin found that tm could not prevail on this argument because tm had not shown it was deprived of any benefits of the contracts.id.at.he additionally found that tm waived its right to termination by continuing to do business with fslc after the alleged breaches.id.at.
the court also rejected tm trademark infringement,false designation of origin,and unfair competition claims,finding the claims to be precluded by the parties contracts and declining to set the contracts aside to protect the public interest.in rejecting the public interest argument,the court found that confusion caused by the concurrent use the parties agreements allowed would not create a level of confusion that would cause harm to the consuming public.id.at.
in october,judge chin conducted a bench trial on fslc counterclaim,found in fslc favor,and awarded fslc attorney fees and costs as damages for tm breach.the judgment entered at the end of the litigation stated that the agreement did not entirely supercede all prior agreements and that the other agreements continued to govern the parties rights in the mark except to the extent that any matters addressed in a prior agreement are covered in a subsequent agreement.
contentions on appeal 
this appeal followed.tm principally contends that the district court misconstrued its task by looking exclusively to the agreements to determine the scope of tm trademark rights rather than first assessing tm original common law right in the mark the court erred when it found fslc did not materially breach the agreements even if tm bargained away its right to use the mark on the contested items,fslc use of the mark would confuse the public,requiring that the court prevent fslc from using the mark and the district court erred by finding that tm filing of the lawsuit and of opposition to fslc trademark applications were not justified by fslc material breaches.

ii.tm rights in its mark before entering into the agreement.
in tm view,the district court failure to conduct a trademark analysis to determine the scope of tm preexisting trademark rights engendered its most serious error finding that tm did not have an exclusive right to use the mark on products related to hunting and fishing.that is,because the court assumed tm had no rights in the mark prior to signing the concurrent use agreement,the court mistakenly examined the agreements to find what rights they gave each of the parties rather than what portion of tm previously existing rights they took away.we agree that tm and fslc may have rights under both the common law of trademarks and the contracts.see,sterling drug,bayer,cir addressing separately breach of contract claim based on concurrent use agreement and trademark infringement claim based on the lanham act.
tm claim is that as the holder of a strong mark,it is entitled to expand into other fields and can treat a junior user in those related fields as an infringer.possession of a famous or strong mark entitles the possessor to broad protection for related goods,mobil oil pegasus petroleum,cir.this general principle applies to magazines.see,triangle publ ns,rohrlich,cir protecting seventeen magazine trademark,seventeen,against use by a girdle manufacturer because mark was fanciful or arbitrary and consumers likely would be confused as to the magazine sponsorship of the girdle,overruled in part,monsanto chem.perfect prods,cir.but esquire,esquire,slipper,cir holding that magazine publisher can not pluck a word with favorable connotations for his goods or services out of the general vocabulary and appropriate it to his exclusive use no matter how much effort and money he may expend in the attempt but that mark was entitled to some protection.
fslc argues that tm rights in the mark are limited by tm plus failure to use the mark for anything but its magazine,books,prints,and binoculars.fslc also points out that it has used the field stream mark on clothing related to hunting for almost ninety years.
we conclude for two reasons that the rights of the parties to use the mark in connection with the goods at issue in this lawsuit are defined by the agreements rather than by any residual trademark right.first,the parties use of the marks prior to the agreement does not demonstrate that tm had a greater right than fslc to expand use of the mark into the general domain of goods associated with hunting and fishing.second,as explained in the next section,the agreements address all of the breaches that tm claims fslc committed.
tm emphasizes its use of the field stream mark in connection with its hunting and fishing magazine,but tm ignores or minimizes fslc and g f almost use of the same mark for clothing including fishing and hunting clothing.g f extensively used the mark in price lists and catalogs for its hunting,fishing,and outdoor apparel,beginning as early as.it also registered the mark for clothing in.because fslc continually maintained its registration of the mark,fslc mark is incontestable and,as a matter of law,it has acquired secondary meaning.gruner jahr usa publ g meredith,cir.
although tm has produced little or no evidence of the strength of its mark at the time the publisher began entering into contracts with fslc and no proof of the mark strength in when fslc first used it,we see no reason to question tm contention that the mark had long since acquired secondary meaning identifying it as the source of field stream magazine.nor does fslc question tm assertion that field stream is far better known as the magazine mark than as g f mark for clothing.nevertheless,by,both parties used the mark on products associated with hunting and fishing and both had a strong mark.
as a consequence of both parties long term use of the mark,this litigation is very different from the more usual case in which a senior user attempts to protect its mark against infringement by a junior user in a related field.for instance,in mobil oil,the senior user had used its mark for its petroleum business for fifty years when the junior user adopted a closely related mark for its oil trading business,causing the senior user to bring a prompt infringement claim.at.in triangle publ ns,we found that the title seventeen was arbitrary and fanciful,the junior user adopted the name in bad faith,and the association of seventeen with teenage girls clothing likely would cause confusion as to source.at.in contrast,we now address the scope of protection to be accorded two rightful users of the mark.both tm and fslc had used the mark in connection with goods associated with hunting and fishing before they entered into any of the concurrent use agreements,but neither had attempted to enter the related markets at issue in this lawsuit.under these circumstances,neither party had an automatic entitlement to expand into the market for other hunting and fishing products to the exclusion of the other.see physicians formula cosmetics,cabot cosmetics,cir stating that t he owner rights in such appendant markets are easily lost they must be asserted early,lest they be made the means of reaping a harvest which others have sown internal quotation marks and citation omitted.because neither g f nor cbs acted promptly to capture by actual use the many products associated with hunting,fishing,and the outdoors,the dist
