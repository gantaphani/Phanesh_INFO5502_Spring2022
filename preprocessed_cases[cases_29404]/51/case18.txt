this appeal arises out of a trademark dispute between colt defense llc colt and bushmaster firearms,bushmaster over bushmaster use of the term in conjunction with its sale of certain firearms.the district court concluded that the term was generic and not entitled to trademark protection.we affirm.

an intellectual property dispute arose between colt and the military in the mid.colt claimed that the military had breached a licensing agreement concerning the technology for the by disclosing proprietary information to third parties.as part of the settlement of this dispute,the military and colt executed the carbine addendum to technical data sales and patent license agreement addendum.the addendum recognized colt right to the proprietary information incorporated in the carbine design and defined the term carbine to mean the compact carbine designed by colt,mm,having a barrel,with a telescoping buttstock,that is capable of firing in the and or three round bursts,defined in government specification the design set forth in was deemed proprietary to colt and,as part of the addendum,the military designated colt as its sole supplier of until.
outside of the military context,colt and bushmaster have long competed in the sale of carbines.bushmaster is the leading producer of carbines for the united states commercial and markets,while colt is the leading supplier to the military but also sells to foreign governments,law enforcement agencies,and the public.
colt and bushmaster each use the term in marketing versions of their carbines.bushmaster began using in its advertising in and has since done so continuously.in,bushmaster began to refer to the type weapon in its advertising to avoid possible confusion.colt has also used continuously in its advertising since at least and registered on the principal register of the patent and trademark office in.other carbine manufacturers,including heckler koch,also use in their advertising.

heckler koch settled with colt.in the settlement agreement,heckler koch was not required to pay colt any money but acknowledged that colt owns the trademark and agrees that colt trademark is a valid and enforceable trademark that should not be cancelled on the grounds of genericness.
bushmaster did not settle and,in due course,moved for summary judgment on colt infringement claim and its own cancellation counterclaim.the motion was assigned to a magistrate judge,who recommended granting bushmaster motion.the magistrate judge concluded that the undisputed evidence established that was a generic term for a class of carbines and therefore could not be trademarked by colt.colt objected,but the district court adopted the recommendation without opinion.colt appealed.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see calvi knox county,cir.in so doing,we take as true the facts documented in the record below,resolving any factual conflicts or disparities in favor of the nonmovant.see mulvihill golf,cir.a grant of summary judgment will be upheld if,after construing the record favorably to the nonmoving party,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.

a proposed mark can not acquire trademark protection unless the mark is distinctive,that is,unless it serves the purpose of identifying the source of the goods.two pesos,taco cabana,d.the supreme court has divided marks into five categories of distinctiveness generic,descriptive,suggestive,arbitrary,or fanciful.see id.citing abercrombie fitch hunting world,cir friendly.the further along this spectrum a term falls,the more likely it is to receive trademark protection.id.
generic terms,being the least distinctive,receive no trademark protection.see park n fly,dollar park fly,d lund trading aps kohler,cir.a generic term is one that does not distinguish the goods of one producer from the goods of others.instead,it is one that either by definition or through common use has come to be understood as referring to the genus of which the particular product is a species.keebler rovira biscuit,cir internal quotations omitted.stated differently,a generic term answers the question what are you while a mark answers the question where do you come from mccarthy.for a term to be generic,then,its primary significance to the relevant public must be to identify the nature of a good,rather than its source.magic wand,rdb.
where,as here,the party claiming infringement has registered the term on the principal register,the registration establishes a rebuttable presumption that the term is not generic.a door.door,cir keebler,at.this presumption may be overcome where the alleged infringer demonstrates genericness by a preponderance of the evidence.keebler,at see also yellow cab of sacramento yellow cab of elk grove,cir pizzeria uno temple,cir.in deciding genericness,evidence of the relevant public understanding of a term may by obtained from any competent source.schwan ip,llc kraft pizza,cir internal quotations omitted.such sources include consumer surveys,keebler,at,the use of the term in media publications,murphy door bed interior sleep,cir,use of the term by competitors in the industry,schwan,at,purchaser testimony concerning the term,in re merrill lynch,pierce,fenner,and smith,and the plaintiff use of the term,retail,freebies publ g,cir.
with this background,we consider the record evidence supporting bushmaster contention that is generic.there are several examples of media publications using in a generic fashion for example,an article appearing on a website called described the carbine as like the but more compact and featur ing a collapsible stock.this article,and several similar ones,refer to the as a type of carbine with certain characteristics,not a brand of carbine sold by a certain producer,and therefore support a determination of genericness.see murphy door bed,at concluding that evidence of numerous examples of newspaper and magazine use of the phrase murphy bed to describe generally a type of bed indicated genericness.in addition,there are several articles in the record that review and compare carbines made by different producers.consistent with generic use,these articles predominantly refer to the name of the manufacturer as the source identifier for an weapon,bushmaster,colt,rock river.
