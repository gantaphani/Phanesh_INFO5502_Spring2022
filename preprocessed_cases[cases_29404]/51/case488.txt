this case presents the question of whether plaintiff appellant yale preston preston owns united states patent the patent and the patent,or whether he assigned rights in those patents to defendant cross appellant marathon oil company marathon pursuant to an employment agreement entered into shortly after he began work as an employee.in the alternative,marathon asserts that it has a common law shop right to use the invention or otherwise owns the invention because marathon engineer thomas smith,one of the defendants in this action,is a.
following several summary judgment motions and a bench trial,the district court entered the following judgments relevant to this appeal declaring that preston is the sole inventor of the patent and that smith was misjoined as an inventor ordering the pto to issue a new certificate reflecting that preston is the sole inventor of that patent declaring marathon the owner of the and patents pursuant to preston employment agreement and that preston is in breach of the agreement for failing to assign his rights,as he promised to do.the district court also entered summary judgment in favor of marathon on its shop right claim,finding that,even if marathon did not own the rights to the patents by assignment or otherwise,it had a shop right to practice the inventions reflected therein.
on appeal,preston challenges the district court summary judgment ruling regarding marathon asserted shop right and the judgment regarding the assignment of his ownership interest in the relevant technology to marathon.we and.we affirm the district court judgment that preston assigned his rights in the and inventions to marathon pursuant to his employment agreement with marathon.because that assignment was automatic,however,we vacate the district court judgment that preston is in breach of that agreement.for the reasons explained below,we do not reach the lower court other judgments.
background 
preston employment agreements 
in a letter dated february,pennaco energy,pennaco,a subsidiary of marathon collectively,pennaco and marathon are referred to as marathon,offered employment to preston as a relief pumper in marathon coal bed methane well operation in the powder river basin in northeastern wyoming.in addition to describing preston proposed responsibilities,compensation,and benefits,the letter indicated that preston was being hired under the policy of employment at will whereby you or the company is free to terminate the employment relationship at any time and for any reason without cause or liability other than as prescribed by law.preston countersigned the letter on february.
preston started work for marathon sometime in march,although there is a factual dispute as to the precise date on april,preston signed a document entitled marathon oil company and subsidiaries employee agreement the april employee agreement.brenda williams signed on behalf of marathon on the same date.the parties agree that the april employee agreement was executed after preston began employment and constitutes a separate employment document from the february letter.the april employee agreement contained the following provisions relevant to this dispute 
definitions 
d intellectual property means all inventions,discoveries,developments,writings,computer programs and related documentation,designs,ideas,and any other work product made or conceived by employee during the term of employment with marathon which relate to the present or reasonably anticipated business of the marathon group,or were made or created with the use of confidential information or any equipment,supplies,or facilities of the marathon group.such property made or conceived by employee or for which employee files a patent or copyright application within one year after termination of employment with marathon will be presumed to have been made or conceived during such employment.
disclosure and assignment of intellectual property.
employee agrees to promptly disclose to marathon and does hereby assign to marathon all intellectual property,and employee agrees to execute such other documents as marathon may request in order to effectuate such assignment.
previous inventions and writings.
below is a list and brief description of all of employee unpatented inventions and unpublished writings.marathon agrees that such inventions and writings are not intellectual property and are not the property of marathon hereunder.if no listing is made,employee has no such inventions or properties.
under paragraph,preston wrote resonating manifold.
although the agreement provides that it shall be governed and construed in accordance with ohio law,both parties agree that wyoming law applies pursuant to the appropriate choice of law rules.it is undisputed that marathon did not provide any additional consideration to preston for signing this document beyond his continued employment by marathon.
the patented technology 
the technology at issue relates to the improvement of machinery used to extract methane gas from coal in a coal bed methane gas well.one way to extract the gas is to pump water out of a coal seam aquifer,which relieves the pressure holding the methane and allows the methane to escape up the well.the wells include an inner tubing that runs through the center of the well casing to the surface of the coal formation.water is pumped up through the inner tubing,allowing methane gas to be produced through the annulus of the well,or the area surrounding the inner tubing inside the well casing.once the methane reaches the top,it is collected by gathering lines at a manifold,from which it is transferred through downstream market pipelines.
one problem that occurs in coal bed methane gas wells is that water columns form in the annulus,which is the path by which gas flows to be released from the well.the water can push the gas down into the well bore and cause gas to enter the water conduit,which causes what is known as gas locking.gas locking is undesirable because it makes the pump less efficient and causes the pump to age quickly with less water in the pump for lubrication and cooling purposes.the invention at issue in this case includes the placement of baffle plates in the annulus of the well.the baffle plates contain holes that function to separate the water and gas,thereby allowing the gas to escape more easily.
figure of the patent is a diagram of a typical coal bed methane well.
in this diagram,the pump pumps water from the well bore out of the well through the water conduit,which reduces pressure on the gas and allows it to escape through the gas flow path or annulus.the manifold would be the portion above the surface that collects gas from several wells into a single gathering line.
installation of preston baffle system 
in august,preston was promoted to scada operator a position which involves collection of raw well data,such as gas production levels and liquid levels.around that time,preston first raised the idea of using baffles to reduce water in a methane well annulus to a coemployee,jeb beachem.preston showed him a conceptual drawing of his baffle system.beachem suggested preston share this idea with preston supervisor,chuck cornelius,who put preston in touch with marathon engineer thomas smith.
over the thanksgiving weekend,preston created drawings of his baffle plates using a company computer.in december,preston met with smith and discussed his baffle system thereafter,preston hired a company on marathon behalf to make baffle plates to begin installation in marathon wells.preston contends he only ordered baffle plates,but the district court found that,in fact,baffle plates were ordered.supporting this finding is an invoice addressed to preston identifying baffle plates that were purchased for the price of,which marathon paid.
preston personally participated in the installation of his baffle system in three wells from january,through february.preston employment with marathon ended effective april.between april and july,marathon installed preston baffle system in eight additional wells.preston contends that he did not consent to or authorize the installation of his system in the eight additional wells,and the district court found that undisputed evidence shows that preston was not aware of the installation in the other eight wells.marathon removed the baffles in all eleven wells between the end of and may.
evidence of preston development of the baffle system 
as discussed below,the parties dispute the extent to which preston developed his baffle system before coming to work at marathon.preston himself offered inconsistent testimony at trial as to when he first arrived at the idea,saying at one point he invented it in in the six weeks before he joined marathon and,at another point,that he may have invented it one to two years before joining marathon.there is no dispute,however,that he never made the invention,physically constructed it before joining marathon.preston claims to have drawn a handful of sketches of his invention before joining marathon,but says he lost or misplaced them in or.preston also prepared some conceptual sketches during his employment with marathon that he showed to his.preston,however,never discussed a resonating manifold with anyone at marathon or mentioned that the baffle plates he had drawn were part of a resonating manifold.the only sketch of preston invention in evidence was one preston drew during a break at his deposition in august.he claims that it is identical to the one he drew before joining marathon,but,as discussed below,the district court found that his testimony on this point was not credible.
the and patents 
soon after installation of preston baffle system began,and while preston still was employed at marathon,smith initiated marathon internal patenting process.on february,he emailed a colleague at marathon to begin the process,explaining that preston has designed and installed a prototype downhole gas separator baffle assembly that appears to be patentable and could be a significant new technology breakthrough in the powder river basin for coalbed n atural gas production.findings of fact and conclusions of law at.the district court found that preston knew that the invention was going through marathon patenting process,and at no time did preston object to smith being a during marathon patenting process.id.
about two months after his employment at marathon ended,on june,preston filed his own patent application covering his baffle system.that application ultimately issued on november,as the patent.preston is listed as the sole inventor on the patent.
on june,marathon filed a patent application that ultimately issued on april,as the patent.the patent names both smith and preston as.the patent initially was rejected for obviousness and over the patent.that rejection was withdrawn,however,when marathon amended the patent to clearly define the annulus between the casing and a tubular,which are neither disclosed or sic suggested in the prior art of record.the examiner noted that the patent does not claims sic the baffles being positioned in the annulus between the casing and the tubular,does not claim surface baffles.
procedural history 
in march,marathon filed a lawsuit in texas state court alleging that preston breached his employee agreement by refusing to assign his patent to marathon.the lawsuit was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.marathon then filed suit in wyoming state court alleging the same claim for breach.preston counterclaimed for patent infringement and conversion.
in november,preston filed a complaint in the district court for the district of wyoming asserting counts for patent infringement a declaration that preston is the sole inventor of the patent unjust enrichment based on marathon use of his invention conversion same breach of implied contract based on an alleged implied contract that marathon would compensate preston for his invention and misappropriation of trade secrets.marathon raised several affirmative defenses and counterclaimed for a declaration that preston has agreed to assign his rights in the patent to marathon.smith also counterclaimed,seeking a declaration that he is the of the patent.
following five summary judgment motions,the district court issued an order on december,making the following rulings marathon acquired a shop right to preston baffle system invention and,therefore,is entitled to summary judgment on preston patent infringement claim preston claims for unjust enrichment,conversion,and trade secret misappropriation are barred by the shop right doctrine or because they are untimely issues of fact preclude judgment on preston claim that he is the sole inventor of the patent issues of fact preclude judgment for defendants on preston claim for breach of implied contract and summary judgment as to whether preston employment agreement is valid is inappropriate.
following a bench trial on the remaining issues,the district court found that preston was the sole inventor of the patent but that preston was required to assign his interest in the and patents to marathon pursuant to his employment agreement.it also found that preston was in breach of that agreement for not doing so.
on appeal,preston challenges the district court summary judgment ruling as to marathon shop right and the judgment as to ownership.marathon filed a protective as to inventorship of the patent,which it advises we need not address if the district court judgment as to ownership of the patents is affirmed.
after oral argument,we certified a question to the wyoming supreme court,inquiring whether,under wyoming law,continuing the employment of an existing employee constitutes adequate consideration to support an agreement containing an intellectual provision.on may,the wyoming supreme court answered yes,continuation of employment is sufficient consideration for an agreement requiring assignment of intellectual property.preston marathon oil.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
preston primarily argues on appeal that he did not assign his rights in the or patents to marathon because the april,employee agreement is invalid for lack of consideration,and even if enforceable,did not function to assign rights in his invention to marathon.because both of these arguments fail,we do not reach preston argument that the district court erred in finding that marathon owns a shop right to use his invention.likewise,because marathon owns the inventions at issue pursuant to the april employee agreement,we need not address marathon protective challenging the district court finding that smith was misjoined as an inventor of the patent.answer brief of appellants at marathon has filed a protective as to inventorship of the patent,an issue that this court need not reach if it affirms the district court findings as to ownership.
preston employment agreement is valid and enforceable 
preston first argues that he did not assign his rights in his baffle system to marathon because the april employee agreement,which contains the intellectual property assignment provision on which marathon relies,is unenforceable for lack of consideration.according to preston,pennaco offer letter of february,which preston signed on february,constituted an express,written employment agreement that embodied the terms of his employment.he contends that,under wyoming law,the april employee agreement was not a valid,enforceable modification of those terms absent additional consideration beyond continued employment.
the district court rejected preston argument below,finding that the april employee agreement was a valid,binding,condition of preston unilateral employment with marathon.in its summary judgment ruling,the district court found that,under wyoming law,consideration is not required to modify the terms of an employment agreement.preston subsequently requested that the district court certify the question raised under wyoming law to the wyoming supreme court,contending that the district court failed to consider hopper all pet animal clinic.in hopper,the wyoming supreme court found that additional consideration was required,even in employment relationships,to support a provision added during the term of employment.id.at.the district court denied preston request,distinguishing hopper on grounds that it involved a provi
