national beverage corporation,shasta beverages,and freek beverage corporation collectively,national appeal the district court grant of a preliminary injunction prohibiting national from infringing upon the trade dress of hansen beverage company line of monster energy drinks.the preliminary injunction restrains national,inter alia,from selling or marketing its line of freek energy drinks in their current containers or containers confusingly similar to monster current trade dress.we reverse because the district court abused its discretion when it determined that hansen is likely to succeed on the merits.
background 
hansen produces and markets the monster energy line of energy drinks.the line consists of a family of four drink varieties,each packaged in containers bearing a large m and the word monster.each variety uses a distinct color combination.the combinations generally consist of a dark background either black or grey depending on the variety and one bold accent color unique to the variety.
in august,national began selling its line of freek energy drinks in the detroit area.like the monster products,the freek line of beverages consists of four flavor varieties,each packaged in containers featuring a dark background and one of four distinctive accent colors.unlike the monster products,freek packaging prominently features the word freek written in a unique,stylized font and the distorted image of a frightening,creature face.
soon after national began distribution of its product,hansen brought this action under section a of the lanham act,a,alleging that national line of freek energy beverages infringes monster trade dress at a hearing on hansen motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court issued a tentative ruling in favor of hansen and made supporting findings of fact from the bench.in its oral findings,the court stated that a preliminary injunction was warranted because hansen had shown a probability of success on the merits,irreparable injury,and that the balance of hardships tipped in its favor.the district court subsequently affirmed its tentative ruling and issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting national from manufacturing,distributing,shipping,advertising,marketing,promoting,selling,or offering to sell the freek energy drinks in containers the same or similar to their current containers or any containers confusingly similar to plaintiff current monster trade dress.the injunction also orders national to immediately withdraw from the market any freek energy drinks in containers having an appearance the same or similar to their current containers or any containers confusingly similar to plaintiff current monster trade dress.
this interlocutory appeal followed.see a.
discussion 
the central issue in this appeal is whether the grant of a preliminary injunction constitutes an abuse of discretion because hansen failed to demonstrate probable success on the merits.see vision sports,melville,cir a preliminary injunction may be granted if the moving party has shown probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable harm.in an action for trade dress infringement under section a of the lanham act,probable success on the merits is established by a showing that the movant trade dress is protectable and distinctive,and the accused product trade dress creates a likelihood of consumer confusion.clicks billiards,sixshooters,cir 
although national faults the district court for failing adequately to define the elements of monster trade dress,there appears to be no dispute that monster packaging features at least some protectable,marks the key issue,therefore,is whether the district court erred in finding that freek trade dress creates a likelihood of confusion 
national contends that the district court erred in finding a likelihood of confusion because it improperly refused to give preclusive effect to findings by the district court for the district of nevada in hansen beverage rockstar,case.in that case,the court found that monster trade dress is weak and entitled to limited protection.reviewing de novo the district court decision not to apply issue preclusion,see mcquillion schwarzenegger,cir,we affirm that ruling.we conclude that the nevada district court findings are not entitled to preclusive effect here because they were not necessary to that court decision,which was based on a determination that the trade dress of rockstar is unlikely to be confused with monster trade dress see reyn pasta bella,llc visa usa,cir stating the elements of issue preclusion.see also eureka fed.sav.loan ass american cas,cir if the decision could have been rationally grounded upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration,collateral estoppel does not preclude relitigation of the asserted issue.quoting davis cox summa,cir.
national also contends that the district court should have given preclusive effect to an alleged finding by the nevada court that the only protectable elements of monster trade dress are the word monster and a large,we reject this argument because,among other reasons,the nevada court summary judgment order does not define with sufficient clarity the scope of monster protectable dress.
even without issue preclusion,however,we conclude that we must reverse because the district court finding of a likelihood of confusion is clearly erroneous.see vision sports,at a preliminary injunction order may be reversed if the district court based its decision on clearly erroneous findings of fact.in this circuit,the likelihood of confusion is determined by considering the eight factors identified in amf sleekcraft boats,cir abrogated in part on other grounds by mattel,walking mountain,cir we have cautioned against mechanical application of the sleekcraft standard,noting that s ome factors are much more important than others,and that the relative importance of each factor will be.brookfield commc ns,west coast entm t,cir see also entrepreneur media,smith,cir w e do not decide whether confusion is likely by considering mechanically the number of sleekcraft factors that weigh in favor of either party,or by giving the same weight to a particular factor from case to case.
here,as in many cases,similarity of the marks is the factor most probative of the likelihood of confusion see,walt disney,cir similarity of the marks is always a critical question in the analysis.although the district court did not identify any specific similarities between the two trade dresses,it found that the products look quite similar and referred generally to their vast similarities.we conclude that the district court finding of similarity of appearance is clearly erroneous.
the two trade dresses are similar in overall appearance only to the extent that they both feature aggressive graphics and bold accent colors against dark backgrounds.however,these elements are widely employed in the crowded energy drink market and are therefore unlikely to lead to confusion as to source.see miss world uk america pageants,cir,abrogated on other grounds by eclipse assocs.data,cir noting that in a crowd of similar marks on similar goods confusion between any two in the crowd is unlikely because customers may have learned to carefully pick out one from the other quoting thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks unfair competition,at ed.
the appearance of the competing trade dress speaks for itself.monster products are distinguishable from the other energy drinks on the market largely because the word monster and a large m are prominently displayed on the cans.freek trade dress does not feature either of these marks instead,it displays prominently its own trade name freek along with a distinctive depiction of a distorted and frightening face the freek man.these very significant differences weigh heavily against a finding that consumer confusion is likely to result from the overall look of the packaging.see squibb,cir w e conclude that,although the trade dresses of tylenol pm and excedrin pm share many similar elements,the prominence of the trade names on the two packages weighs heavily against a finding of consumer confusion resulting from the
