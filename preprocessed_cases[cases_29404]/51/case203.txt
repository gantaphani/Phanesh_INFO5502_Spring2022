plaintiff appellant kellogg company appeals from the district court affirmation of the trademark trial and appeal board ttab decision to permit the registration of the word mark toucan gold by defendant appellee toucan golf,tgi,a manufacturer of promotional golf equipment.
kellogg claims that tgi word mark and its corresponding toucan logo create a likelihood of confusion with,and dilute the distinctiveness of,kellogg five and incontestable toucan sam logos and word mark under the lanham act as amended,et.
we affirm the decision of the district court and deny kellogg claims.tgi use of the word mark toucan gold does not create a likelihood of confusion among consumers,principally because tgi use of its mark is in an industry far removed from that of kellogg.also,tgi toucan logo,as a realistic toucan design,does not create a likelihood of confusion with kellogg more cartoonish toucan sam designs.furthermore,kellogg has not presented any evidence that tgi use of its marks actually dilutes the fame or distinctiveness of any of kellogg marks.
kellogg,a delaware corporation based in battle creek,michigan,is the largest producer of breakfast cereal in the world.on july,kellogg first introduced toucan sam on boxes of froot loops cereal.kellogg has used toucan sam on froot loops boxes,and in every print and television advertisement for the cereal,since.toucan sam is an anthropomorphic cartoon toucan.he is short and stout and walks upright.he is nearly always smiling with a pleasant and cheery demeanor,but looking nothing similar to a real toucan.he has a royal and powder blue body and an elongated and oversized striped beak,colored shades of orange,red,pink,and black.he has human features,such as fingers and toes,and only exhibits his wings while flying.moreover,in television advertisements over the past forty years,toucan sam has been given a voice.he speaks with a british accent,allowing him to fervently sing the praises of the cereal he represents,and to entice several generations of children to follow his nose because it always knows where to find the froot loops.
kellogg is the holder of five toucan sam marks at issue in this case.the first was registered on august,under united states patent and trademark office uspto reg,and consists of a simplistic toucan design,drawn with an exaggerated,striped beak,standing in profile with hands on hips and smiling,as reproduced below 
the second mark was registered march,under uspto reg,and consists of an updated version of the same toucan,standing and smiling with his mouth open widely and pointing his left index finger upward 
the third mark is for the word mark,toucan sam.this mark was registered on june,under uspto reg.the fourth mark,registered on june,under uspto reg,is a shaded drawing of toucan sam flying,with wings spread,and smiling.
the fifth mark,registered january,under uspto reg,is essentially the same drawing as in the fourth mark,except unshaded,as reproduced below 
together the five registrations indicate that kellogg marks are for use in the breakfast cereal industry,and on clothing.
in,peter boyko created tgi,an ohio corporation with its principal place of business in mansfield,ohio,with his wife,janice boyko,and daughter.tgi is a manufacturer of golf equipment,mainly putter heads.tgi creates putter heads from polycarbonate plastics,purchases shafts and grips from outside sources,and then assembles and sells the putters.principally,tgi clientele consists of companies who use tgi goods as promotional gifts at charity events.for this purpose,tgi prints the name or logo of its client on the putter head or other piece of equipment being sold.tgi rarely,if ever,sells directly to retailers or the public.
tgi likewise uses a toucan drawing,known as golfbird or lady golfbird,to represent its products.tgi has placed this logo on letterhead,business cards,its web site,and even on the outside of its building in mansfield.golfbird has a body,and tgi displays golfbird in a myriad of color schemes for different purposes.invariably,however,she has a long,narrow,yellow beak with a black tip,not disproportionate to or unlike that of a real toucan.golfbird is always seen perched upon a golf iron as if it were a tree branch.she has no human features whatsoever,and resembles a real toucan in all aspects except,perhaps,her variable body coloring 
tgi has not registered its golfbird logo with the uspto.on december,however,tgi did file an intent to use application with the uspto for the word mark toucan gold.the application,as later amended,sought to use the mark in relation to golf clubs and golf putters.specifically,tgi planned to use the mark for its newest line of putters which consist of a putter head on a boron graphite shaft.on august,the uspto published tgi application for opposition.kellogg filed an opposition with the ttab,asserting that tgi proposed use of the mark toucan gold for merchandise infringed upon kellogg toucan sam marks under the lanham act by creating a likelihood of consumer confusion.on may,the ttab dismissed the opposition without testimony.
on july,kellogg appealed the ttab decision to the district court below,and commenced a de novo review under b.in its complaint,kellogg again claimed that tgi use of the word mark toucan gold created a likelihood of confusion among consumers with respect to kellogg toucan sam word mark.kellogg added a likelihood of confusion claim with respect to the golfbird logo as well.furthermore,kellogg added a dilution claim under the federal trademark dilution act of ftda.see and c.on september,after a four day bench trial,the district court dismissed kellogg complaint.the judgment was then entered on september.the court found that confusion was highly unlikely,principally because kellogg is in the business of selling cereal,whereas tgi is in the business of selling putters.moreover,the court found no dilution because the parties marks are visually and verbally distinct.kellogg filed a notice of appeal on october,and this matter is timely before this court pursuant to fed.a a.
ii.standard of review and jurisdiction 
the ttab may refuse to register a trademark that so resembles a registered mark as to be likely,when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant,to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.recot,becton,quoting d.
the federal courts have jurisdiction over appeals from the ttab.a party who lost before the ttab may appeal the decision to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit under a substantial evidence standard of review.see,in re thrifty.otherwise,a party may appeal the ttab decision,to be reviewed de novo,to the united states district court in any district where venue is proper.b.a disappointed party may present new evidence before the district court that was not presented to the ttab.dickinson zurko,d.kellogg has chosen the latter route.
we review the district court legal conclusions de novo but review its factual conclusions for clear error.see mclaughlin holt pub.schs.bd.of,cir.
iii.analysis 
essentially,kellogg seeks to block the registration of the toucan gold word mark,and to prevent further commercial use of both the word mark and the golfbird logo.to this end,kellogg asserts that there is a lanham act violation because there exists a likelihood that consumers will be confused as to the source of tgi products.moreover,kellogg asserts that,regardless of our confusion analysis,tgi use of its marks dilutes the fame of kellogg marks,and therefore tgi is in violation of the ftda.
likelihood of confusion 
in order to show trademark infringement under the lanham act,and that tgi is not entitled to registration,kellogg must show that tgi use of its marks constitutes use in commerce of a reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive see also taubman webfeats,cir.
this court has established an test for determining when a likelihood of confusion exists between the origins of two products,thermoscan,cir daddy junky music stores,big daddy family music center,cir frisch restaurants,elby big boy,cir.the factors are the strength of the plaintiff mark the relatedness of the goods or services offered by the parties similarity of the marks any evidence of actual confusion the marketing channels used by the parties the probable degree of purchaser care and sophistication the defendant intent and the likelihood of either party expanding its product line using the marks,at daddy junky music stores,at frisch restaurants,at.not all of these factors will be relevant in every case,and t he ultimate question remains whether relevant consumers are likely to believe that the products or services offered by the parties are affiliated in some way.homeowners group,home mktg.specialists,cir.thus,the question here,as in all trademark cases,is whether we believe consumers of tgi golf equipment are likely to think it was manufactured by kellogg.see,taubman,at stating that the only relevant question is whether there is confusion as to the origin of the respective products citing daddy junky music stores,at.none of the factors is dispositive,but the factors guide us in our ultimate determination.see landham lewis galoob toys,cir.
strength of kellogg marks 
the first factor of the test focuses on the distinctiveness of a mark and the public ability to recognize it.see,at.in daddy junky music stores,we recognized a spectrum of distinctiveness for trademarks,ranging from generic to fanciful.daddy junky music stores,at.for example,the word cereal is generic,whereas the names xerox and kodak are fanciful,having been completely fabricated by the trademark holders.see eastman kodak weil,misc,see also armstrong cork world carpets,cir arrow distilleries,globe brewing,cir giving as other examples of fanciful marks aunt jemima and rolls royce aunt jemima mills rigney,cir.
we find the toucan sam word mark and logo each to be fanciful.kellogg completely created the name toucan sam.kellogg also completely fabricated toucan sam logo design.he does not resemble a real toucan.his unique shape,coloring,size,and demeanor are entirely the creation of kellogg,and not reminiscent of anything seen in the wild.therefore,as a logo,he is also a fanciful mark and distinctive.
in further support of the strength of its toucan sam marks,kellogg has submitted survey information indicating that of americans recognize toucan sam,and of children who recognize him correspond him with froot loops.moreover,kellogg has submitted extensive records detailing the massive amount of time,money,and effort expended in regard to the marketing of toucan sam and froot loops.we need not delve into kellogg records we find the fact that kellogg is the largest cereal maker in the world,that froot loops is one of its best selling cereals,and that toucan sam has appeared in every print and television advertisement for froot loops since enough to establish that toucan sam is visually recognizable by an overwhelming of american consumers.coupling that with his distinctiveness,toucan sam is a very strong mark.
relatedness of the products 
in consideration of the second factor,we must examine the relatedness of the goods and services offered by each party.we have established three benchmarks regarding the relatedness of parties goods and services.first,if the parties compete directly,confusion is likely if the marks are sufficiently similar second,if the goods and services are somewhat related,but not competitive,then the likelihood of confusion will turn on other factors finally,if the products are unrelated,confusion is highly unlikely,at daddy junky music stores,at.
tgi makes golf equipment,mainly putter heads.tgi also sells bag tags,divot tools,and full sets of clubs,but has never sold any merchandise unrelated to golf.
kellogg is primarily a producer of breakfast cereal,but has branched off from cereal and sold products in other industries on a limited basis.it has also at times licensed its name and characters to outside companies.kellogg asserts before this court that it has sufficiently entered the golf equipment industry.in support of this claim,kellogg presents a catalog,wherein it offers for sale golf balls and golf shirts on which is imprinted the picture of toucan sam.moreover,kellogg has presented a animated television advertisement wherein toucan sam is portrayed soliciting his froot loops on a golf course,and interacting with a bear.kellogg claims these materials indicate that the toucan sam marks are related not only to the manufacture of breakfast cereal,but to the golf equipment industry as well.
however,kellogg,although it is the largest producer of breakfast cereal nationally,has not presented evidence that its golf equipment has been marketed nationally.the golf balls and shirts are available on a limited basis,either through the aforementioned is not widely through select local theme stores,such as kellogg own cereal city in battle creek,michigan.moreover,the commercial in which toucan sam plays golf is nonetheless an advertisement for froot loops,not golf equipment.the district court found that kellogg presence in the golf industry was insignificant,and nothing more than a marketing tool to further boost sales of its cereal.we agree.we find that one thirty second advertisement does not render toucan sam a golfer,nor does a novelty catalog make kellogg a player in the golfing industry.in any event,trademark law is grounded on a likelihood of confusion standard.we find that no consumer would associate kellogg with golf equipment based on kellogg extremely limited licensing of its characters on novelty items.we also believe that if any consumers ever did associate kellogg and toucan sam with golf based on the commercial,it is highly unlikely that they would still do so twenty years after the advertisement last aired.we find the parties products completely unrelated.and under the benchmarks established in this circuit,the second factor therefore supports a conclusion that confusion is not likely to occur.see,at stating that confusion is highly unlikely where goods are completely unrelated.
similarity of the marks 
kellogg argues that it can prove a likelihood of confusion notwithstanding the unrelatedness of the goods.it has presented several cases to demonstrate that courts have held for trademark owners relying heavily on the similarity of the marks,even where the parties goods were in different product markets.see,recot,at finding likelihood of confusion between frito lay and fido lay even though one is used for snack chips and one is used for dog food hunt foods,gerson stewart,holding hunt for canned goods and hunt for cleaning products confusingly similar american sugar refining andreassen,finding domino for sugar and domino for pet food confusingly similar yale robertson,cir finding yale for flashlights and locks confusingly similar quality inns int l,mcdonald,finding similarity between mcsleep inn and mcdonald trademarks john walker sons,bethea,finding johnnie walker whiskey and johnny walker hotels confusingly similar.but each of these cases is distinguishable.in some of the cases cited by kellogg,the courts did find that the goods were related.see,recot,at finding that some snack chip makers might also make dog food hunt foods,at finding a relationship between the respective products american sugar refining,at finding goods related because both are sold at grocery stores yale,at finding locks and flashlights related because the trade has so classed them.in the other cases cited by kellogg,the names,as well as other marks,were either not only similar,but substantially identical,see john walker sons.at comparing johnnie walker whiskey to johnny walker hotels and finding infringement where defendant also used same color scheme and same script or the similar portion of the senior mark was both famous and fanciful,and thus so distinctive that its use would transcend its market recot,at stating that frito lay word mark casts a long shadow which competitors must avoid citations omitted quality inns.at intimating that the prefix mark mc used by mcdonald is highly distinct
