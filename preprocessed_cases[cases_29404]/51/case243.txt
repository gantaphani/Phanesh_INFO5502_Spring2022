the pine tar incident 
it undisputed george brett was a great baseball player.the statistics from his years in the show,all with the kansas city royals,seal the deal hits,home runs,and a career batting average of.only three other musial,hank aaron,and willie their careers with more than hits and home runs,while still maintaining a lifetime batting average over.brett selection to the hall of fame,on the first ballot in,was richly deserved.yet for all his accomplishments,many who love baseball will always think of the pine tar incident as the capstone of his career.it is a joy to recall.
it was july,and the royals,trailing to the new york yankees,had a man on first but were down to their final out in the top half of the ninth inning.brett was at the plate.the yankees ace closer,goose gossage,was on the mound.and brett crushed an fastball over the mark into the right field seats,giving kansas city the lead.pandemonium broke out in the royals dugout.the yankee stadium crowd fell silent.but things were about to change.
while the royals were celebrating,the yankees fiery manager,billy martin,walked calmly unusual for him to home plate where he engaged the umpire,tim mcclelland,in quiet conversation.martin pointed to an obscure rule and we sometimes think the federal rules of appellate procedure are obscure,which provides that any substance including pine tar that a player might rub on his bat handle for a better grip can not extend more than inches.see major league baseball official rules b.martin,pointing to a lot of pine tar on the bat brett left behind as he circled the bases,asked mcclelland to check it out.mcclelland,using home plate as a ruler,determined that pine tar covered inches of the bat handle.so the bat,mcclelland ruled,was illegal.
with his ruling ready for delivery,mcclelland took a few steps toward the jubilant royals dugout and gave the signal for using an illegal bat,the home run was nullified,and brett was out.game over.yankees win.and all hell broke loose.an infuriated george brett charged out of the dugout and rushed mcclelland as martin,who looked like the cat who ate the canary,stood off to the side.it was one of the great rhubarbs in baseball history.and that how it ended,at least for july.
but baseball,like our legal system,has appellate review.the royals protested the game and,as luck would have it,american league president lee macphail to use a phrase with which we are accustomed reversed and remanded for further proceedings.the game resumed three weeks later with kansas city ahead.it ended after minutes when royals closer dan quisenberry shut the door on the yankees in their half of the ninth to seal the win.the whole colorful episode is preserved,in all its glory,on youtube,at.youtube.com watch v cu wxylkto last visited june.see also retrosheet boxscore,kansas city royals,new york yankees,at.retrosheet.org boxesetc b nya.htm last visited june.
our case today 
and so,at last,we come to this case which presents another albeit a less compelling appeal of a dispute involving george brett and a baseball bat.we begin with the facts.
in,brett joined tridiamond sports,a manufacturer of baseballs,baseball bats,gloves,and other related accessories,to form brett brothers sports international,brett brothers.tridiamond was incorporated in by joe sample,a former airline executive who had served as and president of international ambassador,a company specializing in the organization of travel programs.international ambassador was purchased in by former major league baseball commissioner peter ueberroth,and informal conversations with ueberroth soon gave sample an idea.ueberroth mentioned the difficulty some players had in adjusting from the use of metal baseball bats at the high school and collegiate levels to the wood bats of professional baseball.initially introduced in the early as a alternative for leagues operating under a smaller budget due to the breakability of wood bats,metal bats were eventually believed to generally outperform wood ones,joseph crisco et,batting performance of wood and metal baseball bats,med.sci.in sports exercise,a consensus more or less confirmed by scientific studies,see,id.at fred bryant et,dynamic and performance characteristics of baseball bats,research quarterly because the use of metal bats may inflate hitting statistics,a player professional prospects may be misevaluated,and the shift to wood bats may reveal a great player to be merely a very good difference,potentially,between a highly compensated major league career and a decade spent on buses shuttling from appleton to the quad cities.
sample realized that the uncertainty of the switch potentially created a market niche for a bat that combined the best of both worlds the production and feel of the wood bat with the of the metal bat.he thus formed tridiamond and initiated research on the construction of a more durable wood bat.eventually the company developed a specialized process of grading,lamination,and fiberglass reinforcement that enabled the product they were looking for.tridiamond initially sold three bat models with names inspired by sample background in aviation the mirador,the stealth,and the bomber.
brett brothers now sells eight different models of wood bats used throughout all levels of amateur and professional baseball.relevant for our purposes is the stealth model,which the brett brothers web site describes as follows 
the stealth bats are constructed of laminates from hand selected and graded hardwoods.the patented boa reinforcement on the handle significantly enhances durability.the choice of wood for the barrel has proven to greatly reduce the chipping and flaking characteristic in ash bats.
this model has ncaa approval for all levels of play and is also besr certified.
the stealth bat is available in,and lengths with weight drops up to ounce.
brett.sports international,very best in,at last visited june.the first recorded sale of the stealth bat occurred on july,when twelve bats were sold to tim nolan of in rockford,illinois.brett brothers has since sold more than stealth bats to all manner of customers worldwide,including through retail outlets in states and via its web site.
the plaintiffs in this action,central manufacturing,and stealth industries collectively central,are both controlled by leo stoller,who serves as president and sole shareholder.stoller similarly operates a number of other companies,including,s industries,and sentra manufacturing.stoller alleges that his companies have been using the stealth trade name and mark for a wide range of products since at least.indeed,stoller has registered the stealth mark for things like boats,motorcycles,bicycles,automobile paint,billiard and dart equipment,auto locks,window locks,comic books,lawn sprinklers,metal alloys,pest elimination devices,and other products.s industries,ecolab,wl,at.in,stoller,through sentra manufacturing,filed a trademark registration with the united states patent and trademark office pto claiming ownership of the stealth mark for s porting goods,specifically,tennis rackets,golf clubs,tennis balls,basketballs,baseballs,soccer balls,golf balls,cross bows,tennis racket strings and shuttle cocks.sentra was awarded the mark in it was eventually transferred to central in.
in,central filed a mark application with the pto for using the stealth word mark on baseball bats,softball bats and bats.later that year,central entered into a licensing agreement with blackwrap,for the use of the stealth word mark on its bats a similar agreement was reached for with easton sports,in.in five years after the first brett brothers sale of bats,the pto granted the mark for baseball bats.central soon became aware of brett brothers use of the stealth word mark and filed suit in the northern district of illinois,alleging violations of the lanham act,et,and the illinois deceptive trade practices act,ilcs et.central believes that because they registered the stealth mark for baseballs and other sporting goods in,they have priority of use of the mark for baseball bats,and brett brothers is guilty of infringement and unfair competition.see,a.the inquiry under illinois law mirrors
