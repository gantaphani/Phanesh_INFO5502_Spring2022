defendants armada oil gas company,armada,allie berry,ali jawad,and sam haddas appeal the november,final judgment of the district court,after a bench trial,in favor of plaintiffs,pdv midwest refining and citgo petroleum corporation citgo,on defendants counterclaim against plaintiffs for violations of the petroleum marketing practices act pmpa,et.specifically,defendants contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs as to whether,under the pmpa,plaintiffs voluntary loss sale of a trademark that defendants had been granted a right to use constituted a valid reason for termination of the franchise relationship between armada and a now defunct subsidiary of plaintiffs parent company.defendants also contend that the district court erred in its legal analysis and factual findings pertaining to the subsequent bench trial on defendants pmpa claims.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
procedural history 
on may,plaintiffs and citgo filed a verified complaint against defendants,alleging,among other things plaintiffs had delivered goods for which they had not been compensated quantum meruit breach of guaranty agreement against jawad anticipatory breach of contract specific performance fraud and recission of transactions induced by fraud.plaintiffs claims stemmed from allegations that defendants had obtained petroleum products from plaintiffs and failed to pay for them.defendants filed a countersuit alleging violations of the pmpa,and a claim of intentional interference with business expectancies and relationships against citgo.
in their complaint,defendants contended,inter alia,that the termination of the franchise relationship between one of parent company subsidiaries,the company,and armada was not based on any ground under which such termination would be permitted under the pmpa.defendants also alleged that the real reason for the termination was because of withdrawal from the marketing of motor fuel in the relevant geographic market.defendants further alleged that the withdrawal was a sham,and in any event violated the pmpa for other reasons.
and union oil company of california unocal,one of general partners,named as defendants,had been parties in this action.however,the remaining parties stipulated to the dismissal of those two companies from this suit,and and citgo agreed to assume any liability for violation of the pmpa on the part of either or unocal 
plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on their claims,and on october,the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on their breach of contract and guaranty claims.the district court found that and citgo were entitled to partial summary judgment as to,but that a material issue of fact existed as to another to which plaintiffs alleged that they were entitled.the district court also granted summary judgment in favor of citgo on defendants interference with business expectancies and relationships counterclaim.
as for defendants pmpa counterclaim,the district court found that had clearly stated its reasons for terminating its agreement with armada as required by the pmpa.the district court recognized that at least one reason offered by was that it had lost the right to use the union trademark.loss of a right to grant the right to use the trademark which is the subject of the franchise is identified in the pmpa as a legitimate basis for franchise termination.see c.defendants contended,however,that this section does not apply where a franchisor loss of the trademark can be categorized as voluntary.the district court rejected this argument based on the weight of authority that had addressed that issue.however,the district court also found that a disputed issue of material fact precluded summary judgment in plaintiffs favor as to defendants claim that termination of the franchise relationship was based solely upon a withdrawal from a specific geographic market,as defendants contended,or for the reasons cited by plaintiffs,and whether termination of the franchise was made in good faith and in the ordinary course of business,as required by the pmpa.further,the district court found that factual issues existed as to whether had complied with the pmpa notice provisions regarding termination of the franchise.
the parties entered into a settlement agreement on june.pursuant to a stipulation entered into by the parties,final judgment in this action would be entered upon resolution of defendants counterclaim.id.the dispute regarding the was resolved pursuant to the settlement.further,pursuant to the stipulation,the district court entered final judgment in favor of and citgo in the amount of plus interest on their breach of contract and guaranty claims.
the only issue remaining for trial was that part of defendants pmpa counterclaim that survived summary judgment.the district court conducted a bench trial on that claim from june,to july.on october,the district court filed its opinion,resolving all claims in favor of plaintiffs,and entered final judgment in plaintiffs favor on november.defendants subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal.
and citgo are subsidiaries of petroleos de venezuela,pdv.and citgo are delaware corporations with their principal places of business in tulsa,oklahoma.was an illinois general partnership with its principal place of business in illinois.armada is a michigan corporation with its principal place of business in dearborn,michigan.armada is a distributor of petroleum products,primarily gasoline,some of which it distributes to independent retail gasoline stations under licensed brand names or trademarks of large oil and refining companies.
in,pdv and unocal entered into a joint venture to form.pdv and unocal became percent owners of from until the two parent companies decided to restructure in the late unocal brought marketing and a license to use the union trademark to the partnership,and pdv brought a fixed price crude oil supply agreement to the partnership.pursuant to a trademark license agreement,acquired the right to use the trademarks of its parent company unocal.
in,armada entered into a contract with to purchase union brand gasoline,which armada then resold to independently owned gas stations.armada became an jobber which,as explained at trial,means essentially the same thing as marketer or distributor or franchisee.the agreement was renewed in,and remained in effect throughout the relevant period of the armada relationship.the agreement between the parties provided that could terminate or its agreement with armada for any reason permitted under the pmpa.defendants berry,jawad and haddas executed a written contract the guaranty that provided that they would pay any indebtedness owed by armada to.
president jerald thompson testified at trial that from its inception,the unocal pdv partnership was strained.the deal had apparently been an economically disadvantageous endeavor for pdv.the crude oil supply agreement that pdv brought to the deal contained a fixed margin provision that resulted in pdv supplying with crude oil at a price substantially below prevailing market prices.pdv had tried to buy out unocal share in because of the economic drain on pdv,but unocal wanted too much money.finally,in or around,unocal decided to exit the downstream segment of the oil industry,which involves the refining and marketing segment of the industry unocal desire to exit the downstream segment of the market apparently led it to drop its asking price for its share of,and resulted in unocal and pdv entering into negotiations to restructure.
on december,pdv and unocal entered into a letter of intent loi regarding the restructuring of.by its terms,the loi was intended to provide a framework for continuing negotiations between the parties.it stated that the letter was not intended to represent or constitute a binding agreement between,or commitment on the part of,either party,as to the matters addressed therein.president thompson testified that during the first couple of months of,citgo became involved with the negotiations between pdv and unocal,and during due diligence review,issues arose that threatened the deal,particularly issues surrounding environmental liability.thompson testified that there was a period in march when negotiations were suspended to allow the parties time to consider their positions and have some whiff of a period.he testified that during that period both sides withdrew and there was concern that no deal would take place.however,the negotiations did resume.
as part of the proposed restructuring of,pdv and unocal took steps to ensure that their intended transaction would be in compliance with the pmpa.stephen bednar,citgo senior corporate counsel,testified at trial that he became involved with the restructuring and worked with an outside attorney to assist with the pmpa compliance issues.
during negotiations,pdv became aware that as part of its decision to exit the downstream segment of the industry,unocal had sold its union trademark to another company,tosco corporation.the parties dispute as to exactly when tosco purchased the trademark.according to defendants,citgo representative marty sedlacek testified at his deposition that at some point in,before pdv and unocal executed the december,loi,unocal already had sold its rights to the union trademark to tosco.at trial,sedlacek testified that he had been mistaken earlier.there was also other evidence at trial that the tosco deal took place in.
the restructuring of was completed on april,pursuant to the partnership interest retirement agreement pira.pdv acquired unocal percent interest in.agreed to pay approximately million to unocal to acquire substantially all of marketing and refining assets.the pira provided that could designate a party to administer franchise agreements such as the one had with defendant armada.designated citgo to oversee this administration.the april,agreement also entitled to use the union trademark for the period after the closing date of the transaction.
citgo sent a letter to all distributors,including armada,dated april,which provided initial notice of the contract reached on april.that letter stated that after refining and marketing assets were transferred to,there will be a twelve month transition period during which citgo has agreed to supply union branded petroleum products to armada.during this transition period,armada will be able to continue to use the union marks,and accept the union credit card.during this transition period,armada agreements will continue in place and be administered by citgo.at.
on april,sent all union franchisees,including armada,written notification of termination of the franchise relationship by certified mail,as required by the pmpa.this notification expressly stated that terminates the sales agreement and any franchise relationship,effective may.armada received a second letter from on april,as well,essentially providing the same information regarding the sale of all of assets to pdv however,that letter pertained only to unbranded gasoline and not union gasoline.the letter pertaining to unbranded gasoline did not discuss the pmpa because unbranded contracts are not subject to the requirements of the pmpa.
on may,the restructuring closed and citgo began operating the former assets,supplying union gasoline to franchisees.between april and may,armada took over million worth of union gasoline from and citgo and refused to pay for it.armada conduct in that regard formed the basis for plaintiffs lawsuit.on may,armada franchise with was terminated as set forth in the april,notice of termination.

defendants assert several arguments on appeal.defendants challenge the district court grant of summary judgment in plaintiffs favor as to defendants counterclaim under the pmpa.specifically,they argue that the district court wrongly determined that a voluntary loss of a trademark can serve as a valid means of terminating a franchise relationship under the pmpa.defendants also contend that the district court erred,after the bench trial,in ruling that plaintiffs had presented valid bases for terminating the franchise under the pmpa and otherwise followed proper procedures under the pmpa in terminating the franchise.for instance,defendants argue that even assuming that a voluntary loss of a trademark is a sufficient basis to terminate a franchise relationship,the district court erred in finding as a factual matter that unocal sale of its trademark rights to tosco occurred on march,such that notice to armada on april,that plaintiffs were terminating the franchise was timely under the pmpa.further,defendants argue that plaintiffs real reason for terminating the franchise with armada was withdrawal from the relevant geographic market area,and that where withdrawal from a geographic market is the reason that a franchisor relies upon to end a franchise under the pmpa,the franchisor must follow certain procedures that were not followed in this case.below,after a brief discussion of the pmpa and some of the policies underlying the implementation of that act relevant to this appeal,we will address defendants arguments in turn.
a.the pmpa 
congress enacted the pmpa in to create a uniform set of rules covering the grounds for termination and of motor fuel marketing franchises,and to protect franchisees from arbitrary or discriminatory termination or of their franchises.massey exxon,cir citing brach amoco oil,cir citing,cong d sess,reprinted in cong.admin.news.congress enacted the pmpa to allay three specific concerns that franchisee independence may be undermined by the use of actual or threatened termination or nonrenewal to compel compliance with franchisor marketing policies that gross disparity of bargaining power may result in franchise agreements that amount to contracts of adhesion and that termination or nonrenewal may disrupt the reasonable expectations of the parties that the franchise relationship will be a continuing one.massey,at citation omitted.the m ost important thing the pmpa is intended to prevent is the appropriation of good will that occurs when a franchisor arbitrarily takes over a business that the franchisee has turned into a successful going concern.thompson amoco oil,cir quoting brach,at.consistent with congressional intent,this court must grant the pmpa a liberal construction consistent with its overriding purpose to protect franchisees.gulf,chevron,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.to that end,t he pmpa prohibits termination of any franchise agreement or of any franchise relationship except on the basis of specifically enumerated grounds and upon compliance with certain notification requirements.massey,at.
this court has recognized,however,that in adopting the pmpa,congress struck an explicit statutory balance between the interest of franchisees in freedom from arbitrary and discriminatory franchise terminations and the interest of franchisors in freedom to transfer motor fuel marketing assets in response to changing marketing conditions,at.thus,although congress intended strong protection of the interest of franchisees,in an age of increasing corporate competition,the major petroleum firms must retain the freedom to seek greater economic efficiency through corporate reorganizations,mergers and acquisitions.see also meghani shell oil,d,aff,cir citing approvingly for this proposition.
a franchisee may bring a civil action regardless of the amount in controversy if the franchisor fails to comply with the termination requirements set forth in or of the pmpa.see a.t he franchisee has the burden of proving the termination of the franchise c.in the instant case,there is no question that plaintiffs terminated the franchise.thus,the burden then falls on plaintiffs as franchisor to produce evidence to establish as an affirmative defense that such termination was permitted under section b brach,at.
with regard to the termination of franchises,a of the pmpa provides 
except as provided in subsection b of this section,no franchisor engaged in the sale,consignment,or distribution of motor fuel in commerce may terminate any franchise prior to the conclusion of the term,or the expiration date,stated in the franchise or fail to renew any franchise relationship 
subsection b of delineates some of the grounds for termination or of a franchise relationship.that subsection states in pertinent part that a franchisor may terminate or fail to renew such a relationship if the following transpires 
the occurrence of an event which is relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which termination of the franchise or nonrenewal of the franchise relationship is reasonable,if such event occurs during the period the franchise is in effect and the franchisor first acquired actual or constructive knowledge of such occurrence i not more than days prior to the date on which notification of termination or nonrenewal is given 
b c i emphasis added.
further,subsection c lists examples of events relevant to the franchise relationship that may form a proper basis for termination.that subsection provides in pertinent part 
as used in subsection b c of,an event which is relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which termination of the franchise or nonrenewal of the franchise relationship is reasonable includes events such as 
loss of the franchisor right to grant the right to use the trademark which is the subject of the franchise,unless such loss was due to trademark abuse,violation of federal or state law,or other fault or negligence of the franchisor,which such abuse,violation,or other fault or negligence of the franchisor,is related to action taken in bad faith by the franchisor.
although there are specific grounds outlined under c upon which termination or is proper,the statute itself makes clear that this list is not exclusive,but merely illustrative.see c explaining that the events referred to in subsection b c as being proper for termination or includes those listed in subsection c russo texaco,cir.legislative history supports this view.see,sess,reprinted in cong.admin.news,the enumerated list is not exclusive.congress delegated to the courts the discretion to determine what events,other than those enumerated,constitute an event which is relevant to the franchise relationship as a result of which termination or is reasonable.brach,at explaining that congress delegated to the courts the task of interpreting the scope of b c.
courts must carefully scrutinize the reasonableness of terminations whether or not the terminating event is specifically enumerated in c.marathon petroleum pendleton,cir citing darling mobil oil,cir.t he grounds specified as justification for termination or nonrenewal of a franchise are intentionally broad enough to provide to franchisors the flexibility which may be needed to respond to changing market conditions but not so broad as to deny franchisees meaningful protections from discriminatory terminations brach,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
a franchisor needs to provide only one valid reason for termination under the pmpa.see thompson,at explaining that where franchisor offered franchisee two reasons for termination,only one needed to be valid in order to justify termination under the pmpa.thus,notice of a legitimate ground for termination is not made ineffective by defective notice for additional grounds for termination.see stuart exxon.with that backdrop in mind,we turn to the various arguments raised in this appeal.
whether voluntary loss of a trademark may justify termination under the pmpa 
on april,sent its franchisees official notice of termination.that letter stated 
on april,the owners of the company entered into a definitive agreement for the distribution of the refining and marketing assets of the company to an indirect subsidiary of petroleos de venezuela,which will become the owner of those assets.the transaction is scheduled to close on may.because unocal will no longer have an interest in the refining and marketing assets,right to use the unocal and trademarks and credit card will be terminated.general offices will be closed following completion of the transaction and its employees will be separated from the company.will cease to operate as an refining and marketing company.
the asset purchaser has designated its affiliate citgo petroleum corporation citgo to administer the orderly termination of contracts with customers.a termination notice period of one year after the closing of the transaction for continued use of the unocal and trademarks and credit card was negotiated as part of the transaction.citgo will continue unocal and branded supply under your current agreements for the one year period following closing of the transaction.you will be contacted by a citgo representative concerning ongoing operation of your marketership during the one year termination notice period.
please refer to your marketer sales agreement dated.as a consequence of the transaction described above,and as a result of the termination of right to use the unocal and trademarks and credit card,hereby terminates said marketer sales agreement and does hereby terminate any franchise relationship,effective as of may,one year from today date.all agreements relating to the marketer sales agreement are also hereby terminated and as of the effective date,may.
in compliance with the provisions of the petroleum marketing act,you are hereby notified that the grounds for the above action are that 
an event has occurred which is relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which termination of the franchise and of the franchise relationship is reasonable.
has lost the right to grant the use of the trademark which is the subject of the franchise.
this termination and notice affects your marketer relationship with only.you may be required to send notices of termination or under the provisions of the petroleum marketing practices act to franchisees of your company,if any.it is your responsibility to determine the need for and method for compliance with any obligations you may have to your franchisees under the act.will not be sending any notices to your customers as no franchise relationship exists between and its marketers customers.
in accordance with the requirements of the petroleum marketing and practices act,enclosed herewith is a copy of the summary of the provisions of title i of said act as published by the united states department of energy.
the company 
defendants first argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the ground that unocal sale of its trademark constituted a loss of the franchisor right to grant the right to use the trademark,as defined in the pmpa.see c.
in russo,the second circuit squarely addressed this issue.in that case,the appellants claimed that texaco,violated the pmpa when it terminated their franchises.id.at.texaco decided to purchase certain assets of getty oil company.id.at.because of the size of the purchase,texaco realized that it might face antitrust violations if it did not divest certain assets it had acquired.therefore,texaco agreed to sell to power test most of getty gasoline station assets and supply contracts,among other things,but texaco was to have retained ownership of the getty trademark.id.however,the federal trade commission ftc intervened in the texaco getty transaction,as the agency believed that c ontrol by texaco of getty marketing operations is likely to reduce price competition in the gasoline and middle distillate marketing provided by getty id.a final consent order required that texaco divest in good faith its ownership of the getty brand name and trademark.id.at.on march,texaco informed getty dealers the appellants in that action that their franchise relationships would be terminated pursuant to b c of the pmpa.id.texaco asserted that the termination was based on the fact that it had lost the right to grant the use of the trademark that was the subject of the franchise.id.citing c.the appellants responded by arguing,among other things,that the word loss in c implies an involuntary loss of the right to grant the right to use a trademark and that texaco divestment of the getty trademark was voluntary.id.at.the second circuit rejected this argument.it found that loss as used in c intends to cover voluntary and involuntary situations.id.at.it looked to the pmpa legislative history as well as to decisions from other circuits to reach its holding.id.
the court first noted that the word loss appears twice in c,in c involving the franchisor loss of the right to grant the franchisee use of the leased marketing premises and c loss of a trademark.the second circuit noted that although the legislative history of the pmpa does not indicate the precise meaning of the expression loss as it relates to loss of a trademark under c,the legislative history makes clear that where a franchisor voluntary decision not to renew an underlying lease results in the loss of the franchisor right to grant possession of the leased marketing premises through expiration of an underlying lease,termination is nevertheless reasonable under b c.id.citing senate report at,reprinted in cong.admin.news at.the court also pointed out that other circuits interpreting c have construed loss to include a voluntary loss.id.citing lugar texaco,cir veracka shell oil,cir.relying on the doctrine of in pari materia,the second circuit held that there was no reason to treat the word loss differently inasmuch as it appears twice in the same section of the statute.id.the second circuit explained that i t is a settled principle of statutory construction that w hen the same word or phrase is used in the same section of an act more than once,and the meaning is clear as used in one place,it will be construed to have the same meaning in the next place.russo,at citing united states nunez,cir,cert.denied,d quoting meyer united states,cir.
defendants urge this court to reject the reasoning of russo on several grounds,none of which we find persuasive.defendants contend that the second circuit lengthy discussion as to whether loss under c can be voluntary was merely dictum,inasmuch as the court ultimately determined that because the ftc required texaco to divest the getty trademark,the loss of the trademark was involuntary.strictly speaking an obiter dictum is a remark made or opinion expressed by a judge,in his decision upon a cause,by the is,incidentally or collaterally,and not directly upon the question before the court blacks law dictionary,ed citation and internal quotation marks omitted.although dictum is unnecessary to the decision,it may nevertheless be followed if sufficiently persuasive.central green united states,d quoting humphrey ex r united states.see also black at although lacking precedential value,dicta may be considered persuasive.even assuming that the second circuit lengthy discussion regarding whether the voluntary loss of a trademark could be considered a loss under c was dictum,we find that court analysis of the issue and persuasive.id.
defendants next argue that the legislative history cited by the second circuit involved situations in which the underlying leases expired under their own terms and the franchisors made voluntary determinations not to renew those leases.defendants contend that russo cited no authority for the proposition that a franchisor can terminate an unexpired lease and use it as the basis for ending the franchise under the pmpa,such as occurred in this case with the trademark.defendants essentially contend that russo reached the wrong result because c involves expiration of an underlying lease,which by its terms can expire,which is different than the loss of a trademark,which may be held in perpetuity or for a long period of time.
while defendants may be correct that the second circuit cited cases involving situations where the leases were going to expire on their own terms and the franchisors decided not to renew them,this does not mean that the authority relied on by the second circuit did not support that court conclusion that a franchisor decision to terminate or a lease can be either voluntary or involuntary.in one of the cases relied on by the court in russo,veracka,the franchisee contended that the franchisor had violated c of the pmpa when it elected to take affirmative steps to terminate a lease agreement that otherwise would have automatically been extended for another year,per the agreement terms.id.at.the first circuit rejected the franchisee argument that loss of a lease for purposes of terminating a franchise under the pmpa can occur only where such loss is outside the control of the franchisor.id.at.in the instant case,defendants make an argument similar to that made by the franchisee and rejected by the court in veracka,that loss as used in the pmpa was intended to apply only in situations where the loss was involuntary or the result of an occurrence outside of the control of the franchisor,and not,as here,where the loss might be considered voluntary.
after russo was decided,the eleventh circuit also held that c encompasses a franchisor voluntary relinquishment of its lease.hutchens eli roberts oil,cir.the eleventh circuit relied on such cases as veracka and lugar,both of which were relied on by the russo court.particularly,hutchens noted that the court in veracka had pointed out that c does not make reference to the cause of the underlying lease termination,and legislative history suggests that congress intended to include voluntary terminations to be within the scope of c.id.
according to the senate report 
expiration of the underlying lease could occur under a variety of circumstances including,for example,a decision by the franchisor not to exercise an option to renew the underlying lease.however,it is not intended that termination or should be permitted based upon the expiration of a lease which does not evidence the existence of an arms length relationship between the parties and as a result of expiration of which no substantive change in control of the premises results.
id.citing,sess,reprinted in cong.admin.news,emphasis added.
the eleventh circuit held that in deciding whether the termination of a franchisor underlying lease falls within section c the cause of the lease termination is not determinative.rather,we must be satisfied that the termination represents an arms length transaction id.at citing hifai shell oil,cir veracka,at.thus,a s long as the franchisor decision to relinquish its lease is an arms length transaction in which it actually gives up control over the premises,it makes no difference whether the relinquishment is accomplished through cancellation of the lease or a decision not to renew it.id.at emphasis added.
we believe that the district court did not err in finding that a loss of a trademark can be voluntary under the pmpa.see russo,at.as the second circuit noted,while there is no text in the legislative history regarding whether loss of a trademark under c may be voluntary as it pertains to a legitimate reason to terminate a franchise under b c,legislative history and the weight of judicial authority regarding loss of a lease under c indicates that the loss under that provision may be voluntary or involuntary.russo,at hutchens,at.reading the word loss in the two subsections in pari materia,there is no reason why the same meaning should not be attributed to the word in both places.united states stauffer chem,cir holding that i n interpreting the meaning of one provision of an act it is proper that all other provisions in pari materia also be considered.in stauffer,this court reasoned that since the term representative appeared in two sections of the clean air act that both dealt with inspections by the environmental protection agency,and the meaning of the term was clear as to one of the sections,the term should be construed consistently in both sections.id.at.such reasoning favors finding that the district court in the instant case did not err inasmuch as the word loss appears in c twice,and that section deals exclusively with events that are relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which termination or of the franchise relationship is reasonable.because the loss of a lease may be voluntary,so too may the loss of a trademark.id.
plaintiffs also point out that if congress intended to ascribe different meanings to the word loss in the two subparts of the same section,it could have done so expressly when it amended the pmpa in further,when it amended the statute,which was well after russo was decided,congress could have made clear that loss of a trademark can not be voluntary,as through a sale of the trademarks or other assets including the trademarks,but instead must be involuntary.congress,however,did not do so.as the supreme court has held,congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it a statute without change.lorillard pons,d.
defendants further contend that whether voluntary or involuntary,the franchisor right to grant the right to use a trademark can not serve as a basis for the termination of a franchise where the loss the trademark resulted from the fault or negligence and occurred as a result of bad faith on the part of the franchisor.defendants contend that a fact question exists as to whether divestiture of the trademark rights in the present case was undertaken in good faith or merely taken to avoid the pmpa requirements.defendants obviously rely on language in c,which provides that the loss of the right to grant the right to use the trademark is a legitimate reason to terminate a franchise provided that such loss is not due to trademark abuse,violation of federal or state law,or other fault or negligence of the franchisor,which such abuse,violation,or other fault or negligence is related to action taken in bad faith by the franchisor.c.defendants contend that where the loss of the trademark was in bad faith,such as through a sham business transaction,then c may not serve as a valid means of termination under the pmpa.
while the district court concluded that loss of the trademark may be voluntary when deciding plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,the district court nevertheless found that summary judgment was inappropriate as to when plaintiffs acquired knowledge that they were to lose the trademark,which,as explained below,was important for purposes of insuring that plaintiffs had complied with pmpa notice requirements.similarly,the district court found that factual issues existed as to whether plaintiffs termination of the franchise was based on the reasons they advanced loss of the trademark and the reorganization of or premised on the reason defendants claimed,a decision on plaintiffs part to withdraw from the geographic market.thus,those issues were not resolved until after trial.
reasons offered for termination 
defendants contend that even if loss of the trademarks was a valid reason for termination,plaintiffs failed to comply with pmpa notice requirements regarding that specific reason for termination of the franchise relationship.defendants also appear to argue that loss of the trademarks was in bad faith and the result of a sham business transaction undertaken so that plaintiffs could avoid dealing with their franchisees under the pmpa.defendants further contend that the district court clearly erred in concluding that plaintiffs did not withdraw from the relevant geographic market.they contend that plaintiffs stated reasons for termination restructuring and loss of the trademarks are pretextual,and what really occurred was a withdrawal from the geographic market,which involves extra requirements in order that termination is proper under the pmpa,and that such requirements were not met here.
plaintiffs argue that they provided defendants with two valid reasons for their termination of the franchise,neither being withdrawal from the relevant market,and neither of which is pretext for what was really a withdrawal from the relevant market.plaintiffs contend that their decision to end the franchise must stand or fall on at least one valid reason,and,more importantly,on the reasons for termination that they actually provided to defendants.
as previously stated,the april termination letter set forth two grounds for the termination that an event had occurred which is relevant to the franchise relationship and as a result of which termination of the franchise and of the franchise relationship is reasonable,and that uno ven had lost the right to grant the use of the trademark which is the subject of the franchise 
pursuant to b c,in order for notice of an event listed under c such as notice regarding loss of a trademark to be timely,the franchiser could not have acquired actual or constructive knowledge of the event that triggered the termination more than days prior to the date on which notification of the termination was given.id.defendants contend that even if the loss of the trademark was the true reason for armada termination,it would not be a valid reason unless unocal or had actual or constructive knowledge of the loss of the trademark no more than days before the official termination notice was issued on april.defendants contend that plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of showing that the unocal sale of its trademark to tosco occurred in march,as the district court found.defendants point out that marty sedlacek at his deposition stated that the trademark rights at issue were sold to tosco months before the letter of intent was entered into on december.further,defendants point out that thompson testified that procuring the union logo was not discussed during any of the negotiations to which he was a party.however,thompson never testified,as defendants appear to contend,that unocal had sold the union trademark or that he knew that unocal had sold the trademark when the loi was executed in december.he testified that it was revealed at some point during the negotiation sessions that unocal was in negotiations with tosco to buy unocal west coast refining marketing assets,and that found out about the sale sometime in march.
the district court found as a matter of fact that on march,unocal sold to tosco the union trademarks along with all of unocal west coast refining and marketing assets.we,of course,do not review this factual finding de novo,but rather for clear error.burzynski,at.the district court pointed out that thompson,citgo senior corporate counsel bednar,and unocal representative brian conners all provided consistent testimony concerning the timing of the transaction.further,the district court found persuasive another published opinion that referenced the transaction.see unified dealer group tosco,d,on march,tosco purchased from the union oil company of california union the products company which included approximately service stations in california.tosco also acquired the exclusive right to use the union and trademarks in perpetuity.plaintiffs,as did the district court,point out that despite sedlacek deposition testimony,which he later claimed was wrong,thompson,bednar,and conners each testified that unocal sold the trademark rights to tosco in march,well within days of when defendants received their notice of termination and before the april,represented the agreement between pdv and unocal regarding.in light of this evidence,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the sale of the union trademarks closed on march,and at that time,plaintiffs acquired knowledge of the loss of the trademarks.see burzynski,at see also b c i 
the district court found that termination was proper,pursuant to b c,as a result of the uno ven restructuring,and pursuant to c,as a result of the loss of the trademarks.the district court acknowledged that the reasons provided by plaintiffs regarding the termination were related,but the court analyzed them separately.
as for the restructuring,the district court explained that under the pira,internal structure changed drastically.unocal sold its percent ownership to pdv,and the latter then assumed all of assets.trademark was terminated,although distributors were allowed to continue using the union trademarks until may.we agree with the district court that the restructuring is an event that alone constituted a sufficient basis to terminate the franchise however,we also conclude that we need not consider the loss of the trademark and the restructuring as separate events.the factual situation in this case is that both events occurred,are clearly related,and that as such,both events combined create a valid reason for the termination.
the restructuring is not an event enumerated as a ground for termination under c.under this circuit jurisprudence,even where the relevant event that occurs is enumerated under c,this court must still scrutinize the reasonableness of the termination.marathon,at.but see russo,at once having ascertained that an event is encompassed by one of the twelve enumerated events,a court need make no further inquiry as to the reasonableness of the termination.citing lugar,at.the district court scrutinized the reasonableness of the termination in the instant case to determine whether it was made in good faith and in the normal course of business.see,brach,at.when considering whether a event constitutes a permissible basis for termination,courts generally determine whether one of the enumerated events is similar to an event actually listed under the act.brach,at explaining that courts do not have carte blanche to define the parameters of b c and that the enumerated list under c was intended as a guide for the courts.
as explained above,c explicitly states that loss of a trademark constitutes a permissible ground for termination.however,there are other sections under c that involve situations where the occurrence of the event disables the franchisor from providing an essential element of the franchise such as loss of a franchisor right to grant possession of the leased marketing premises through expiration of an underlying lease or condemnation of the leased premises russo texaco,citations omitted.as the district court in russo noted,these events suggest a sort of involuntary loss of the right to franchise by the franchisor.id.whether the event that triggered the decision to terminate can be characterized as voluntary or involuntary,however,is not dispositive,as it is the reasonableness of the decision to terminate that is critical.c russo.at involuntariness is not the sine qua non of reasonableness.further,as this court has stated,although the pmpa purpose is to regulate coercive relationships between franchisors and franchisees,and to protect franchisees from discriminatory and arbitrary practices,the pmpa struck a balance between those goals and the interests of franchisors in freedom to transfer motor fuel marketing assets in response to changing marketing conditions,at.this court explained that the pmpa constituted a diminution of the property rights of franchisors and thus should not be interpreted to reach beyond its original language and purpose.id.citing checkrite petroleum,amoco oil,cir,cert denied,d.
further,this court has noted that in balancing the competing interests of the pmpa in an age of increasing corporate competition,the major petroleum firms must retain the freedom to seek greater economic efficiency through corporate reorganizations,mergers and acquisitions,at.this court also explained 
there is nothing in the language of the pmpa suggesting that a major national acquisition and large scale divestiture for bona fide business reasons was intended to be stymied by the right of individual franchisees to insist on a prior relationship on exactly its former terms.a permanent status quo in the relationships of major national oil corporations with each other was not mandated by congress through the pmpa.in a rapidly changing economy fixed preservation of business relationships may spell financial death to the detriment of franchisees as well as franchisors.
id.citing russo.at.
in evaluating an economic business decision as it pertains to the pmpa,congress cautioned against courts applying the business judgment rule,that is,whether a particular business decision was wise.brach,at.rather,courts should determine whether the business decision at issue was made in good faith,a subjective standard,and whether the determination was made in the normal course of business.id.the good faith requirement looks to whether the franchisor actions are designed to conceal selective discrimination against individual franchises,but avoid s judicial scrutiny of the business judgment itself.unocal kaabipour,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
in the instant case,we agree with the district court that there is no evidence that the unocal pdv transaction regarding was conducted in anything other than good faith.the evidence showed that had been an economic drain on pdv mr because the partnership agreement contained a fixed margin provision whereby pdv had to supply with crude oil at a price substantially below prevailing market prices.pdv had tried to buy out unocal share in prior to,but unocal wanted too much money.finally,in or around,unocal decided to exit the downstream segment of the oil industry,which involves the refining and marketing segment of the industry,and unocal agreed to lower its asking price.paid approximately million to purchase unocal share of.
further,as part of the restructuring,trademark license agreement was terminated.as part of unocal plan to exit the downstream segment of the business in an transaction,separate from the pdv unocal deal,unocal sold its rights to the union trademarks to tosco.relinquishment of its trademark rights was an essential part of the overall transaction,at explaining that the pmpa does not require a large scale divestiture undertaken for bona fide business reasons to be stymied by the right of individual franchisees to insist on a prior franchise relationship on exactly its former terms.defendants have failed to point to a shred of evidence that would establish that the sale of the trademark to tosco and related loss of the trademark were undertaken in bad faith.see c see also reyes atlantic richfield,arco,cir explaining that once a franchisor shows that termination occurred for a valid reason under the pmpa,franchisee is entitled to present evidence to show that the termination was based on an illegitimate criterion.likewise,other than speculation,defendants have failed to show that plaintiffs restructuring was not conducted in good faith and for valid business reasons.id.therefore,we hold that the restructuring and loss of the trademarks constituted a valid and reasonable basis to terminate the franchise.russo.at holding that large scale divestiture of assets,including trademark rights,constituted a sufficient basis for termination of franchise under the pmpa.inasmuch as only one valid reason is needed under the pmpa to terminate a franchise,plaintiffs here,which have offered two,albeit related and intertwined,reasons for the termination,certainly have met their burden of showing that termination was proper see thompson.
withdrawal from the relevant geographic market 
as explained earlier,defendants also argue that the real reason plaintiffs terminated their franchise relationship with armada was because plaintiffs intended to withdraw from the market and not,as plaintiffs contend,as result of loss of the trademark restructuring.def
