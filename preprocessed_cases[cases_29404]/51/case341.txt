david lahoti appeals the district court bench trial judgment that his use of the vericheck georgia state service mark owned by vericheck,violated the consumer protection act acpa,d,the lanham act,et,the washington consumer protection act wcpa,and various washington common law doctrines.lahoti,who has previously been found liable for cybersquatting activities,obtained the domain name,but did not use the website to offer any goods or services.we conclude that the district court factual decision that the vericheck mark was a distinctive,legally protectable mark under the acpa and federal trademark law was based in part on reasoning contrary to federal trademark law and based in part on reasoning that could support the district court conclusion.because we believe the district court should decide the issue of distinctiveness in light of the principles we explain,we vacate the district court opinion and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
vericheck,vericheck is a georgia corporation that provides electronic financial transaction processing services,including check verification,check guarantee,check collection,account verification,automated check handling,and payment processing services.vericheck has advertised itself on its website as t he leader in check verification and guarantee services,and check verification underlies a large part of its operations.vericheck operates a website at and also owns the domain names,and.vericheck unsuccessfully attempted to secure the domain name the domain name from a canadian company in.
in vericheck gained a georgia state registration for its service mark which consists of a checkmark over the word vericheck the disputed mark.the georgia registration states that the mark is used in connection with check verification and check collection services.vericheck tried to obtain federal registration of the disputed mark,but in the united states patent and trademark office pto denied the application because an arizona company the arizona company had already registered a vericheck trademark the arizona mark for use with check verification services.the arizona company first obtained federal registration in and renewed its mark in.the arizona company did not use the arizona mark in connection with services that compete with vericheck,and there is no evidence that the arizona mark was used on the internet.the arizona company did not further renew its registration in,and its mark expired while this case was pending.
david lahoti considers himself an internet entrepreneur.lahoti claims that in the late he contemplated going into the business of transaction verification and security.as a preliminary move,as he tells it,he began registering a number of domain names with the veri prefix.lahoti successfully acquired the domain name in,but he never developed a transaction verification service.instead,the website consisted only of a few lines of code redirecting visitors to a different website with search result links,including links to vericheck competitors.lahoti earned income when visitors to clicked on links at the website to which they were redirected.
vericheck frequently received calls from its customers complaining that they were confused because they visited but could not find information on vericheck.lahoti told the district court that before registering the domain name in he performed a trademark search and internet search and he concluded that his use of the domain name would not be a trademark issue.he also said that when he reserved the domain name he was not aware of vericheck existence.
this case does not reflect the first time lahoti has registered domain names that were similar to the names or trademarks of other companies lahoti had previously registered more than four hundred domain names containing the trademarks of other companies,including,and.in at least two cases,the united nations world intellectual property organization ordered lahoti to give up control of some of his domain names because they infringed on a trademark.in the united states district court for the central district of california in lahoti the case,no,wl,concluded that lahoti was a cybersquatter and that his registration,attempted sale,and use of the domain name violated federal trademark law and the acpa.
in vericheck contacted lahoti and offered to purchase the domain name.doubtless this fit into lahoti business plan as an internet entrepreneur.lahoti first asked for,and then reduced his demand to,but negotiations soon ended.in vericheck filed an arbitration complaint pursuant to the uniform policy.the arbitrator ordered the transfer of the domain name to vericheck,but instead of complying,lahoti sought a declaratory judgment in the district court that he did not violate the lanham act cybersquatting or trademark infringement provisions.vericheck counterclaimed that lahoti actions violated the lanham act,the acpa,the wcpa,and washington state common law.thus the issues were first framed in the district court.
both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to vericheck,but only on the question of whether lahoti acted in bad faith.the district court found that lahoti did not use the domain name to sell goods or services or for a legitimate use,and it stated that the domain name linked to several of vericheck competitors.it also noted lahoti past cybersquatting activities.the district court concluded that lahoti acted in a bad faith attempt to profit from his use of the domain name and that no reasonable jury could decide otherwise.
after a bench trial on the remaining issues,the district court decided for vericheck on all claims and counterclaims.the district court determined that the disputed mark was inherently distinctive,which was necessary for vericheck to prevail on any of its trademark or acpa claims.the district court concluded that vericheck had established the other elements of its counterclaims,granted vericheck injunctive relief and statutory damages,and awarded vericheck attorneys fees under both the wcpa and the lanham act.lahoti appeals the district court merits decision and its award of attorneys fees.
this case turns in large part on the standard of review.we have previously held that a district court classification of a trademark strength is a factual determination to which we apply clear error review.see jockey club,jockey club of las vegas,cir stating that the strength or weakness of the mark in question is a factual issue that is not to be set aside unless clearly erroneous norm thompson outfitters,motors,cir reviewing w hether the trial court was clearly erroneous in finding as facts t hat the slogan is descriptive,rather than a suggestive slogan,or a coined,arbitrary,or fanciful slogan

when reviewing for clear error,we do not defer to a district court categorization of a mark if its decision is based on incorrect law.see forum of am.forum,cir stating that a review of a district court trademark classification must toe a line between reweighing the evidence and disregarding our responsibility to make sure that the district court trademark classification was based on correct legal standards stroh brewery,cir reviewing the district court trademark categorization de novo for legal error before applying clear error review.although we may affirm on any ground supported by the record,even if it differs from the district court rationale,lambert blodgett,cir,where it is unclear whether the district court relied on proper law,we may vacate the judgment and remand with instructions to apply the correct legal standard.see united states,cir.
to show trademark infringement,vericheck must demonstrate that it owns a valid mark,and thus a protectable interest,and it must show that lahoti use of the mark is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.kp permanent,lasting impression i,cir quoting a b.federal trademark registration is not a prerequisite for protection under the lanham act,and for infringement claims such as vericheck,the same standard applies to both registered and unregistered trademarks,walt disney,cir quotation omitted.on its acpa claim,vericheck also must prove that lahoti acted with a bad faith intent to profit from the disputed mark.d a i.
on appeal lahoti challenges the district court determination that the disputed mark is a distinctive and valid mark he argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that his actions created a likelihood of consumer confusion he challenges the district court conclusion that he acted in bad faith and he argues that the district court erred by awarding vericheck attorneys fees.
vericheck can not prevail on its trademark claims unless its disputed mark is distinctive.see disc golf ass champion discs,cir to recover for the infringement of a trademark the plaintiff had to prove that the design is inherently distinctive or acquired distinctiveness through a secondary meaning mccarthy on trademarks without achieving distinctiveness a designation does not have the legal status of a trademark or service mark.no mark.distinctiveness is also required to sustain an acpa claim.d a ii establishing liability in the case of a mark that is distinctive at the time of registration of the domain name.suggestive,arbitrary,or fanciful marks are inherently distinctive,but a mark that is generic,or one that is descriptive and lacks a secondary meaning,is not distinctive and does not receive trademark protection.two pesos,at.the district court determined that the disputed mark is suggestive and thus distinctive,and on appeal lahoti contends that the mark is descriptive 
deciding whether a mark is distinctive or merely descriptive is far from an exact science and is a tricky business at best.banff,federated dep t stores,cir see also mccarthy on trademarks as with tonal shade variations in the colors of the visible spectrum of sunlight,the categories of the trademark spectrum often become difficult to distinguish at the boundaries.some cases pose an easy conclusion that a mark is merely descriptive,as for example would be the case if a restaurant chain sought a trademark in a name such as delicious foods,or a taxicab company sought a trademark in the name reliable cab,or a clothing company in a name such as ready wear.other marks are just as plainly distinctive,as for example in fanciful marks where the letters do not form a word in the dictionary and there is no apparent logical connection to the goods,such as exxon gas or xerox copiers.but legions of trademark lawyers can stay busy arguing about how marks in the middle,not so plainly descriptive,nor so plainly distinctive,should be categorized.see pizzeria uno temple,cir the line between descriptive and suggestive marks is scarcely pikestaff plain and the distinction to be given the two terms is frequently made on an intuitive basis rather than as a result of a logical analysis susceptible of articulation.alteration and quotation omitted.
we have said that the primary criterion for distinguishing between a suggestive and a descriptive mark is the imaginativeness involved in the suggestion,that is,how immediate and direct is the thought process from the mark to the particular product.fellowship church ananda church of,cir quotation omitted.a mark is suggestive if imagination or a mental leap is required in order to reach a conclusion as to the nature of the product being referenced.filipino yellow pages,asian journal publ ns,cir.by contrast,a mark is descriptive if it define s a particular characteristic of the product in a way that does not require any exercise of the imagination.yellow of sacramento yellow cab of elk grove,cir.
but after taking note of the general rule of law that a mark is suggestive if it takes imagination or a mental leap to identify the referenced product,and applicable guiding principles,a trier of fact is still left with a hard task of judgment.where does vericheck fall in the continuum between marks that are plainly suggestive,and therefore distinctive,and those that are plainly distinctive as the reviewing court,our role is limited to determining whether the district court clearly erred in deciding that the disputed mark was suggestive in the context of vericheck financial transaction processing services,which include check verification services.
both parties support their arguments with references to other appellate decisions on distinctiveness.however,as with other areas in which we apply a deferential standard of review,past appellate decisions affirming on clear error review do not establish that the trademark at issue or similar trademarks are distinctive or descriptive per se,but only that the district court classification was a plausible interpretation of the record.stated another way,an appellate decision affirming that a trademark is or is not distinctive,after that conclusion was reached in a trial,means only that the decision of the trial court,to whose judgment we significantly defer when a issue such as this has been tried,is within the range where an appellate court should affirm absent clear error.
not surprisingly,appellate courts have upheld district court classifications of arguably distinctive trademarks as descriptive,and vice versa.compare jockey club,at affirming district court classification that jockey club is not distinctive when applied to condominiums and a private membership club,with playtex,cir affirming district court classification that wet ones is suggestive as applied to individual towelettes.our analysis of these past precedents reinforces the principle that appellate courts grant considerable deference to district court trademark classifications.indeed,we are aware of only a handful of published opinions in the past forty years in which a district court determination that a mark is suggestive rather than descriptive was held to be clearly erroneous on appeal.see forum,at reversing district court classification of forum as suggestive as applied to business training programs security,first sec,cir reversing district court classification of security center as suggestive as applied to private storage facilities vision ctr.opticks,cir reversing district court classification of vision center as suggestive as applied to a clinic providing optical goods and services.these few exceptions are entirely consistent with the maxim that absent legal error we owe great deference to a district court factual decision on whether a mark is distinctive.and these cases mean more in establishing the boundaries between the trial courts and the appellate courts than they do in establishing for all cases that a particular mark is distinctive or descriptive.
the district court determined that the disputed mark was suggestive in part because the pto had granted federal trademark registration to the arizona mark,which like the disputed mark consisted solely of a design around the word vericheck.there can be no serious dispute with the principle that a federal trademark registration of a particular mark supports the distinctiveness of that mark,because the pto should not otherwise give it protection.registration alone may be sufficient in an appropriate case to satisfy a determination of distinctiveness see a stating that pto registration is prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark retail,freebies publ g,cir t he fact that a mark is registered is strong evidence that the mark satisfies the statutory requirements for the distinctiveness necessary for trademark protection.moreover,we agree with the district court that the pto registration of the arizona mark is evidence of the disputed mark distinctiveness,given the strong similarity between the appearance and purposes of the arizona mark and the disputed mark deference to the pto classification decision is sensible because the pto has special expertise that we lack on this issue.see lone star steakhouse saloon,alpha of,cir given the difficulty in determining whether a mark is descriptive or suggestive,courts have often given due regard to the determination of the patent and trademark office,which necessarily decides whether a mark is descriptive or suggestive in its decision whether to register the mark.
although the statutory presumption of distinctiveness applies only when the mark holder own mark has been registered,courts may also defer to the pto registration of highly similar marks.see borinquen biscuit trading,cir holding that the pto acceptance of these other marks containing rica for registration supports the idea that rica can be an inherently distinctive term mccarthy on trademarks t hird party mark registrations may in some cases support the argument that a designation is not descriptive.the fact that the pto registered a number of marks containing the same designation without requiring proof of secondary meaning is some evidence that the pto considers the designation not descriptive.in particular,we agree with the fourth circuit that nearly identical marks used for similar products may be viewed in a common light when the pto has found one of them to be suggestive.see search,llc,cir stating that the principle that a mark is suggestive because pto found a nearly identical mark to be suggestive seems to make some intuitive sense when the marks describe similar services.
however,it should be noted that in some cases a series of prior registrations is evidence of the descriptiveness of a mark.as mccarthy explains 
t registrations of composite marks including an allegedly descriptive term can be used to help prove the descriptive nature of that term.for example,introduction of many registrations for electronic products of marks with suffix could be evidence that those third parties and the public consider such a suffix descriptive,such that there would be no likely confusion between daktronics and tektronix.
mccarthy on trademarks.see also cutter,air prods,mccarthy another test of connotations is to determine the extent to which other sellers have used the mark on similar merchandise.that is,if others are in fact using the term to describe their products,an inference of descriptiveness can be drawn.lahoti has made a version of this argument in this case,noting that,in addition to the use of the arizona mark by one business,a number of other businesses use a variation of the mark in conjunction with check verification services.it will be for the district judge to consider any such argument on remand.
the pto appeal board has cautioned that a third party registration is not determinative of distinctiveness if circumstances have materially changed since the registration or if the registration is distinguishable because it combines one part of the disputed mark in that case with nondescriptive terms.see in re sun microsystems,ttab holding that third party registrations of marks containing beans are not evidence that agentbeans was distinctive for software written in the java computer programming language because other registrations combine d beans with what appear to be nondescriptive terms,and because beans had recently become a popular term for a form of java code.here,by contrast,the arizona mark and disputed mark are not just similar but are identical in text,and both were registered for use with check verification services.more importantly,the parties did not present any evidence with regard to whether technological changes impact whether the term vericheck should be considered to describe or rather only to suggest check verification.we conclude that the federal registration of the arizona mark shows that the pto thought vericheck was distinctive and not descriptive of check verification services.the district court decision to rely on the third party pto registration of the arizona mark for evidence that the disputed mark is distinctive was legally proper and not clearly erroneous.
nonetheless,the district court based its decision that the disputed mark was distinctive in part on reasoning that is contrary to federal trademark law.context is critical to a distinctiveness analysis.whether a mark is suggestive or descriptive can be determined only by reference to the goods or services that it identifies.rodeo collection,seventh,cir see also mccarthy on trademarks t he mark brilliant may be descriptive on diamonds,suggestive on furniture polish,and arbitrary on canned applesauce.a related principle is that a mark need not recite each feature of the relevant goods or services in detail to be descriptive.in re operating.
the district court erred to the extent it required that the disputed mark describe all of vericheck services to qualify as descriptive.the district court reasoned that the disputed mark does not immediately call to mind the broad array of electronic transaction processing services that vericheck provides.however,a mark does not have to meet this requirement to be found descriptive.the inquiry is whether,when the mark is seen on the goods or services,it immediately conveys information about their nature.in re patent trademark servs.inc.
the district court further erred when it reasoned that the disputed mark could have described services that are unrelated to those offered by vericheck,such as baggage checking and background verification.the mark must be evaluated as if it were seen on the goods or services,which means the mark must be examined in the industry context rather than in the abstract.see id.
the district court also misapplied the law by asserting that lahoti improperly breaks down the mark into two component parts,veri and check,in order to argue that consumers will immediately presume that vericheck provides check verification services.emphasis added.rather,courts may analyze all components of the mark in determining whether those parts,taken together,merely describe the goods or services offered.in re oppedahl larson llp,in considering a mark as a whole,the trademark trial and appeal board may weigh the individual components of the mark to determine the overall impression or the descriptiveness of the mark and its various components.
in analyzing the compound vericheck mark,the district court may therefore have broken the mark into veri and check,to separately view the component parts as a preliminary step on the way to an ultimate determination of probable customer reaction to the composite as a whole.mccarthy on trademarks see also bernard commerce drug,cir holding that arthriticare is descriptive of an arthritis medication by analyzing arthriti and care separately telemed,cir holding that telemed is a descriptive mark by analyzing meaning of tele and med.even though the district court ultimately analyzed the disputed mark component parts individually,we can not be sure that the district court,having earlier misstated the law,properly accounted for those individual components.
we conclude that the district court decision that the vericheck mark was a distinctive,legally protectable mark under the acpa and federal trademark law was based in part on reasoning contrary to federal trademark law and based in part on reasoning that could support the district court conclusion.accordingly,because the district court did not rely exclusively on the proper legal standard,we vacate the judgment to the extent it determined the disputed mark was distinctive.we remand to permit the district court to determine whether the mark is distinctive or descriptive taking into account the principles that we have outlined here.see,at
