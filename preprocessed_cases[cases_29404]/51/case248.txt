ty,the manufacturer of beanie babies,brought suit for trademark infringement against softbelly,and affiliated companies and individuals unnecessary to discuss separately.softbelly manufactures a very similar looking and feeling product that it calls screenie beanies.they differ from beanie babies mainly in having chamois bellies and being sold to the public through computer stores for use in wiping computer screens.
the case was tried to a jury,but rather than allow it to render a verdict the judge entered judgment as a matter of law for ty under.he awarded ty both injunctive relief and some in damages.he also dismissed softbelly counterclaims,which softbelly had abandoned in the district court and though it is anyway too late seeks halfheartedly to resuscitate on appeal.sokaogon gaming enterprise associates,cir colburn trustees of indiana university,cir.later he denied softbelly motion to vacate the judgment under.b on the ground of witness tampering.softbelly challenges this denial as well as the judgment.
the issues at the trial were three.the first was whether beanies,which ty claims to be a common law trademark owned by it it has a registered trademark on beanie babies,has become a generic term for small plush toys,in the shape of animals,that are filled with materials to give the toys a soft and floppy feel.if beanies has become a generic become,that is,can not be a legally protected trademark.the second issue is whether,if beanies has not become generic,the designation screenie beanies is likely to make consumers think that softbelly product is actually a ty brand.the third issue is whether screenie beanies dilutes the beanies or beanie babies trademarks.
on the first issue,on which the burden of proof rested on ty because beanies is not a registered mark,shoe shonac,cir filipino yellow pages,asian journal publications,cir blinded veterans ass blinded american veterans foundation,ty presented the following evidence in an effort to prove that beanies is not generic 
a survey by henry ostberg of men and women over the age of,interviewed at nine different malls throughout the country,found that percent of the respondents thought beanies a brand name.ostberg selected the cutoff because he was told by ty that most of the purchasers of beanbag toys are over.if percent of the relevant consuming public thinks beanies a brand name,as many of percent may think it in fact percent of the respondents in ostberg survey did.but the legal test of genericness is primary significance.kellogg national biscuit.division of schering bausch lomb,cir thermos aladdin industries,cir thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed id.ostberg results are evidence that the primary significance of beanies is still as the name of ty brand.
a linguist testified that percent of the references in news articles to the word beanie were to ty products and that dictionaries do not list it as a generic word.
a statistician sampled ebay and yahoo auctions and found that more than percent of all references to beanie s were to ty products.
in a phone survey conducted in,more than percent of the respondents identified beanies as relating to ty or beanie babies.
ty polices the use of beanie s vigorously by filing lawsuits,sending cease and desist letters,and opposing trademark applications for the word or its cognates.
this evidence was not conclusive.but softbelly presented very little contrary evidence.in fact,the only evidence it placed before the jury was a survey of to girls which found that many of them consider beanies the name of the product rather than just ty brand name the testimony of a teenage girl that she considers beanies the name of the product and a statement by ty warner,ty ceo,that refers to another firm having sold a zoo beanies product in.the judge was right that softbelly evidence was not enough,in the face of ty evidence,to create a triable issue whether beanies is generic.the testimony of one teenager proves nothing at all,and the survey was to girls being an arbitrary subset of consumers of beanbag stuffed animals.see universal city studios,nintendo,cir mccarthy,supra,robert bird,streamlining consumer survey analysis an examination of the concept of universe in consumer surveys offered in intellectual property litigation,trademark.softbelly argues that ty warner has identified teenage girls as his product largest group of consumers.not so in the testimony softbelly cites,warner states that his prime market consists of girls to,followed by to.of course,this testimony also casts a shadow over ostberg testimony for ty.and warner reference to zoo beanies proves nothing at all,for the name might be an infringement of ty trademark.
to determine that a trademark is generic and thus pitch it into the public domain is a fateful step.it penalizes the trademark owner for his success in making the trademark a household name and forces him to scramble to find a new trademark.and it may confuse consumers who continue to associate the trademark with the owner brand when they encounter what they thought a brand name on another seller brand.think of ostberg there would be a problem even if they were only percent.the fateful step ordinarily is not taken until the trademark has gone so far toward becoming the exclusive descriptor of the product that sellers of competing brands can not compete effectively without using the name to designate the product they are selling.imagine the pickle that sellers would be in if they were forbidden to use brassiere,cellophane,escalator,thermos,or dry ice to denote being former trademarks that have become generic terms.the problem is not that language is so impoverished that no other words could be used to denote these products,but that if no other words have emerged as synonyms it may be difficult for a seller forbidden to use one of the trademarked words or phrases to communicate effectively with consumers.
sometimes a trademark owner will sponsor a generic term precisely in order to avoid its mark becoming generic.xerox succeeded with copier,and sanka was saved from becoming generic by the emergence of decaf to denote the product of which sanka was for long the brand.but because beanies is so much shorter and punchier than the alternatives that have emerged so far for designating the product,such as plush beanbag animals,ty may be fighting a losing war to keep its beanies trademark from becoming beanies a generic term.but it won this battle.
more precisely it won this battle on the basis of the evidence that the judge permitted to be presented to the jury,as distinct from that evidence plus the evidence that the judge excluded.the excluded evidence consisted of the results of a lexis search that revealed generic uses of the term beanie s in newspapers an internal ty memo written by warner himself in which he said we want to emphasize our beanies are not just any special.set us apart from our competitors beanies and other internal memos,reporting on trade shows,in which employees of ty used beanies in a generic sense,as in product called floppies.they are a larger version of the beanies concept.heard through rumor mill that they are sold out of their beanies until november.or plush images booth had beanies that were similar in look,but fabric was inexpensive and it looked like a cheap knockoff of product.the judge excluded all this and more evidence tendered by softbelly because softbelly had failed to include it in the list of exhibits attached to the pretrial order.he also excluded ebay screens indicating widespread use of beanies in a generic sense on the separate ground that softbelly had failed to summarize these exhibits.the source of his authority to exclude them is unclear.it is not,as the judge thought,because that provision merely authorizes summaries and empowers the judge,if summaries are introduced,to require production of the materials summarized.but we may assume that ordering the making of summaries is inherent in a trial judge authority to manage a lawsuit in an efficient manner.
nevertheless the judge was too severe in these rulings,especially when his lenity toward ty is weighed in the balance.
