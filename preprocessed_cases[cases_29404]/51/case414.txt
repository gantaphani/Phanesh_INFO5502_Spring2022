this case concerns the validity of a product configuration trademark for the safecut device.the issue presented is whether summary judgment was appropriate on grounds that the design is functional and therefore not protectible as a trademark.underlying this question is the evidentiary role of a trademark registration in such a proceeding.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment against the trademark holder because the product design is not fanciful,but instead wholly functional,and consequently can not have trademark significance.
background 
tie tech makes and markets wheelchair securement systems for private and public vehicles.one of its products,the safecut,is used in emergencies to facilitate the quick release of individuals from their securement systems.tie tech,which designed and marketed this cutter beginning in the,describes its product as a,webbing cutter that is made of durable polycarbonate.an advertising image portrays the safecut device in action a hand is gripping the device with four fingers fitted through an enclosed oval opening an elongated prong of plastic guides the webbing towards a recessed cutting blade.tie tech offered the following depiction of the device 
in,the patent and trademark office pto registered the entire configuration and arbitrary embellishment of the safecut device as a trademark on its primary register specifically excepted from this trademark were the scalloped finger indentations on the handle which the examiner had previously concluded to be functional,thus precluding registration of those aspects of the design.tie tech achieved this result not without considerable struggle.the examiner originally rejected the application because,among other grounds,he concluded that the entire configuration was functional in design.after an appeal to the trademark trial and appeal board ttab,however,the application was remanded for further reconsideration,and the examiner without explanation limited his conclusions about functionality to the finger indentations on the handle and the shape of the partially concealed blade.
kinedyne is a competitor of tie tech in the market.as late as june,kinedyne was selling its own distinctive.after some of kinedyne customers expressed dissatisfaction with kinedyne original cutter,one of its sales representatives requested a cutter similar to the safecut design.according to kinedyne regional director,he understood that the representative wanted a design because kinedyne design did not meet unspecified states satisfaction.
in response to the special request,kinedyne redesigned its.the resulting kinedyne cutter is virtually indistinguishable from the the color,the manufacturer name embossed in the polycarbonate frame,and the absence of the scalloped finger indentations in the handle,the most noticeable difference.
upon discovery of kinedyne new cutter,tie tech sued kinedyne for trademark infringement under the lanham act,as well as for unfair competition and consumer protection claims under washington state law.kinedyne moved for summary judgment,arguing that,as a consequence of its functionality,the design mark was invalid pursuant to b.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment for kinedyne.
discussion 
the principal issue in this case is whether the district court properly concluded,as a matter of law,that tie tech product configuration is functional and thus unprotectible.tie tech appeal is.it first argues that the mere fact of trademark registration alone should have been sufficient to create a material issue of fact and defeat summary judgment.in the alternative,tie tech argues that it presented sufficient evidence beyond its registration of to warrant reversal.we address each contention in turn recognizing that at the summary judgment stage our charge is not ourselves to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson liberty lobby,d.
evidentiary value of registration 
the relationship between trademark protection and functionality is well established the physical details and design of a product may be protected under the trademark laws only if they are nonfunctional clamp,cir.the lanham act codifies this common law requirement by prohibiting registration of a mark for a product configuration that is functional.see e no protection for a mark which comprises any matter that,as a whole,is functional.consistent with this threshold registration requirement,congress has allowed defendants in an infringement action to raise an affirmative defense of invalidity based on a mark functionality.b.this defense,however,is not raised on a clean slate.rather,it provides the challenger of a mark the opportunity to rebut prima facie evidence of the mark validity.a registration shall not preclude another person from proving any legal or equitable defense set forth in subsection b.section a,entitled evidentiary value,provides that a ny registration shall be admissible in evidence and shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of the registrant exclusive right to use the registered mark emphasis added.
as prima facie evidence of validity,the registration certificate is simply evidence that in the judgment of the law,is sufficient to establish a given fact,or the group or chain of facts constituting the party claim,and which if not rebutted or contradicted,will remain sufficient.black law dictionary ed emphasis added.
the cases often refer interchangeably to prima facie evidence of validity and presumption of validity.see,america online,v.at t,cir liquid controls liquid control,cir.we note that from an evidentiary viewpoint,establishment of a prima facie case is often seen as creating a presumption.for example,in the title vii context,e stablishment of a prima facie case in effect creates a presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against the employee.jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence a joseph mclaughlin,ed.thus,while we prefer to use the statutory language because it more precisely conveys the evidentiary nature of the registration,we acknowledge the interchangeability of the terms in practice.
in trademark terms,the registration is not absolute but is subject to rebuttal.in essence,the registration discharges the plaintiff original common law burden of proving validity in an infringement action.vuitton et fils young,cir see also a in absence of registered mark,plaintiff has burden of proving.
terminology with respect to the invalidity defense based on functionality is likewise not wholly consistent.the cases variously refer to the defendant as having the burden of proof or having assumed a shifting burden of production.this mixing and matching of terms has engendered some confusion in the analysis.for example,in vuitton we held that the registration shifts the burden of proof from the plaintiff,who would have to establish his right to exclusive use in a common law infringement action,to the defendant,who must introduce sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of plaintiff right to such protected use.id.at.in contrast,the seventh circuit concluded that t he presumption really serves only to shift the burden of production to the defendant.liquid controls,at.
although the description of the burden shifting is different in these two cases,the result is the same.overall,the plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of persuasion in a trademark infringement action,namely proof of infringement.a necessary concomitant to proving infringement is,of course,having a valid trademark there can be no infringement of an invalid mark.see,furs,cir characterizing the plaintiff burden in an infringement action as a test thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.
validity,then,is a threshold issue.on this point,the plaintiff in an infringement action with a registered mark is given the prima facie or presumptive advantage on the issue of validity,thus shifting the burden of production to the defendant to prove our case,to provide evidence of functionality.or,to put it as we did in vuitton,the defendant then bears the
