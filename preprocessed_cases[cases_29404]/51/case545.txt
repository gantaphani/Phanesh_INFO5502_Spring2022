background 
transclean is the assignee of the patent,which is directed to an automatic transmission fluid changing apparatus.the fluid circulates from an automobile automatic transmission case to a radiator and back via circulation lines.patent at,ll.the invention of the patent is designed to tap into a fluid circulation line and become part of the circulation system for the duration of the fluid changing procedure.id.at,ll.in that configuration,the invention collects used fluid as it circulates around and into the machine,while supplying new fluid into the circulation system.id.prior to the invention,such machines were not capable of matching the supply rate of new fluid to the outflow rate of used fluid.id.at,ll.as a result,one of two problems was likely to occur.first,if the supply rate was less than the outflow rate,the transmission could become starved of fluid,which could lead to excessive heating and damage to the transmission.id.second,if the supply rate exceeded the outflow rate,a buildup of internal fluid pressure could stress and damage seals in the transmission.id.the invention aimed to solve these problems by balancing the supply rate to the outflow rate.id.at,ll.claim,the only independent claim,reads as follows 
in a fluid replacing apparatus for an automatic transmission an improvement having fluid circulation inlet and outlet ports comprising 
a fluid receiver adapted to be connected to the fluid circulation output port on said automatic transmission 
a source of fresh transmission fluid adapted to be connected to the fluid circulation inlet port on said automatic transmission so that fluid circulates therethrough and 
means connected to said fluid receiver and said source of fresh fluid,for equalizing the fluid flow into said fluid receiver and out of said source of fluid.
id.at,ll.emphases added.
as can be seen,the claims recite a means for equalizing the fluid flow in the manner authorized by.the specification discloses several structures corresponding to the claimed means.according to one structure,the fluid receiver and source of fresh transmission fluid are segregated portions of the same tank,and the means for equalizing is a flexible diaphragm that defines the boundary dividing the tank into two segregated portions.id.at figure.a structure with those characteristics is the subject of claim,which reads as follows 
the apparatus of claim in which the means for equalizing the flow is comprised of means disposed intermediate the fluid receiver and source,said means exhibiting resilient characteristics for exerting a force,related to the pressure existing in the fluid circulation circuit of said transmission and said receiver,upon the fluid in said source.
id.at,ll.emphasis added.another structure corresponding to the means for equalizing in claim is a pair of tanks,one for used fluid and one for fresh fluid charged by pressurized air.id.at.
bridgewood is a competing distributor of transmission service equipment to automobile service businesses.bridgewood accused device is the embodiment described in its own patent.briefly,bridgewood device consists of a reservoir divided into two chambers by a free floating piston.patent,abstract.the reservoir above the piston is initially filled with fresh fluid,and the reservoir below the piston is initially empty and compressed.id.extending from each chamber is a line for connection to an automobile automatic transmission fluid circulation system at a point where a technician breaks the fluid circuit.id.thereafter,operation of the transmission pump sends used fluid into the bottom chamber,thereby forcing the piston to expel fresh fluid from the top chamber into the transmission fluid circulation system.id.when the technician can see fresh fluid being pumped into the bottom chamber,the procedure is halted,as the fluid has been essentially completely replaced,even though not all of the used fluid could possibly be expelled,attorney fees opinion at.
bridgewood is no longer in business,having sold all of its assets,including goodwill,to century manufacturing company for a total of,which was above and beyond the book value of bridgewood tangible net worth.century subsequently took a license under the patent from transclean,agreeing to a royalty rate of nine percent.
transclean sued bridgewood for infringement of the patent and its total fluid exchange and total fluid x change trademarks,as well as false advertising by bridgewood promotional claims that its device replaced or every drop of fluid.before trial,both parties filed motions for partial summary judgment,transclean seeking summary judgment on the issues of patent infringement and validity,and bridgewood seeking summary judgment of noninfringement of claim as well as transclean trademarks.the court granted all of those motions except that relating to claim.more specifically,the court granted summary judgment that the patent was not anticipated by either patent,issued to becnel,or japanese patent.summary judgment opinion at.furthermore,the court granted transclean motion for summary judgment that bridgewood infringed claims and of the patent,after precluding bridgewood from arguing noninfringement of those claims as a sanction for bridgewood failure to answer an interrogatory seeking its bases for arguing noninfringement.id.at.finally,the court granted bridgewood motion that bridgewood had not infringed transclean trademarks.id.at.
the case was then tried to a jury,which found that bridgewood willfully infringed claim and engaged in false advertising.the jury awarded transclean three types of damages for the patent infringement.damages opinion at.the first was a reasonable royalty based on bridgewood sales of infringing devices the second was additional damages for the infringement and the third was a reasonable royalty based on bridgewood sale of its business.id.
in a motion,bridgewood sought to overturn the jury damages awards.the court partly agreed and held that as a matter of law transclean was not entitled to more than for patent infringement.id.at.transclean also filed a motion seeking enhanced damages and attorney fees pursuant to and in light of the jury finding of willful infringement,but the court denied both requests.id.at.additionally,transclean filed a motion pursuant to minnesota private attorney general statute,seeking attorney fees it incurred in pursuing the false advertising claim,but the court denied that request as well.id.

patent validity 
bridgewood asserts in its that the court erred when it granted summary judgment that neither the becnel patent nor the japanese patent anticipates the claims of the patent.although this is a issue,as is that on patent infringement,we deal with them first because they logically precede damages issues,which are the principally appealed issues.bridgewood contends that the court misconstrued the phrase means for equalizing the fluid flow appearing in claim by requiring that the fluid flow rate,rather than just the volume of fluid,be equalized.based on its erroneously narrow construction of the claimed function,the court,according to bridgewood,included extraneous structure in that corresponding to the means for equalizing limitation.bridgewood asserts that the proper corresponding structure is a fresh fluid tank connected to a fresh fluid tube with a valve,a used fluid tank connected to a used fluid tube,and a source of pressurized air.bridgewood contends that either the becnel or japanese patent discloses all of the minimum corresponding structure,and that the dependent claims recite features that are also disclosed by the becnel or japanese patents.
transclean responds that the court properly interpreted the term flow to mean a rate,not a volume,as the specification discloses that equalization of flow rates is the objective of the invention.transclean further contends that the invention disclosed in the becnel patent does not necessarily equalize flow rates,and that the japanese patent discloses an apparatus that equalizes fluid weights,not flow rates.
we agree with transclean that the claim phrase equalizing the fluid flow refers to a rate,not just a volume.to construe that phrase,we look to the specification for guidance,vitronics conceptronic,and the specification clearly refers to the equalization of flow rates.for example,the patent describes problems that can occur in the prior art when the input flow rate of added fluid does not match the output flow rate of used fluid 
i n the event fluid is allowed to drain faster than the rate of addition of fluid,the pump or torque converter in a transmission is likely to be starved and then will become excessively hot under which conditions a transmission will if permitted to continue in operation.on the other hand,should excessive fluid be added to build up an internal pressure within the transmission,there is a strong likelihood that seals for shafts valves,bearings,or the like or other internal components,within the transmission,may be irreparably damaged with a resulting failure of the transmission under subsequent operating conditions.
patent at,ll.emphasis added.furthermore,the summary of the invention states that the invention solves those problems 
briefly,my invention is comprised of a fluid receiver for used fluid,a source of supply of fresh fluid,and a means for coordinating the introduction of fresh fluid with the draining of used fluid.with this in mind,it then only remains necessary to separate the fluid flow in a line that is external from the transmission so that the used fluid is drained into a suitable fluid container and the new fluid is introduced at the same rate that the used fluid exits.this can be accomplished in a number of ways,some of which will be described in more detail below.
id.at,ll.emphasis added.other passages in the patent echo the same idea,id.at,ll,ll.because the specification is clear as to the meaning of the phrase equalizing the fluid flow,and no other intrinsic evidence suggests a different meaning for the phrase,we affirm the district court construction of that phrase to require equalization of flow rate.
as the parties agree,the phrase means for equalizing fluid flow is a limitation governed by,and the recited function is equalizing fluid flow.to anticipate a claim reciting a limitation,the anticipatory reference must disclose the recited function identically.wenger,coating mach,literal infringement of a claim requires that the accused device have structure for performing the identical function recited in the claim.in this case,neither the becnel nor the japanese patent contains such a disclosure.
the becnel patent is described in the patent as equalizing overall fluid volume,not flow rate.patent at.bridgewood presented testimony from becnel,the inventor,that his invention could be operated in such a manner as to equalize flow rates.however,as the district court found,that manner is not disclosed in the becnel patent itself,nor is it inherent in the operation of becnel invention.summary judgment opinion at becnel was able to read the fluid gauges,and then manually adjust the flow of fresh fluid so as to equalize the fluid flows,but neither his declaration,nor bridgewood patent expert opinion,offer any explanation as to how a person of ordinary skill would read the becnel patent specification,and recognize that this method of flow equalization is necessarily present in the embodiment disclosed in.we conclude,as did the district court,that bridgewood did not raise any genuine issue of material fact regarding anticipation of claim by the becnel patent.accordingly,we affirm the court conclusion that transclean is entitled to summary judgment of as to the becnel patent.
the japanese patent likewise discloses equalization of fluid amount,but not necessarily fluid flow rates.broadly speaking,the japanese patent describes an atf automatic transmission fluid exchanger device,jap.pat,abstract english translation,which,like the invention described in the patent,comprises a supply of fresh fluid,a receptacle for used fluid,and hoses for connection to a transmission fluid circulation system.id.however,the japanese apparatus also includes scales for measuring the weights of the fresh fluid supplied and used fluid removed,as well as a detection means so that the difference between the amount of fluid drained and the amount of fluid supplied is maintained within an indicated range and which automatically balances the amount of fluid drained and fluid supplied within an indicated range.thus,the japanese patent explicitly discloses that fluid weight is equalized,not necessarily fluid flow rate.although it is possible that the detection means could under some circumstances,if the response time for the feedback loop is sufficiently fast effectively equalize the flow rates as well,it is also possible for that not to be the case.because anticipation by inherent disclosure is appropriate only when the reference discloses prior art that must necessarily include the unstated limitation,cont l can monsanto,emphasis added,the japanese patent can not inherently anticipate the claims of the patent.we conclude,as did the district court,that bridgewood did not raise any genuine issue of material fact regarding anticipation of claim by the japanese patent,and we therefore affirm the court conclusion that transclean is entitled to summary judgment of as to the japanese patent.thus,we affirm the court conclusion that the claims of the patent are not invalid under as being anticipated by the becnel or japanese prior art patents.
patent infringement 
bridgewood argues that the court abused its discretion when,as a discovery sanction,it precluded bridgewood from asserting that it did not infringe claims and,and when it denied bridgewood motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of claim.regarding the first point,bridgewood argues that the court impermissibly invoked an extreme discovery sanction without notice to bridgewood,that transclean was not prejudiced by bridgewood lack of response to transclean interrogatory,and that the court avoided its duty to construe the claim and relieved transclean of its burden to prove infringement.transclean responds that it was prejudiced by the lack of discovery and that the sanction was consistent with precedent.
we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion when it granted summary judgment of infringement as a discovery sanction.because the imposition of a discovery sanction is not a matter substantially related to patent law,we apply the law of the regional circuit,in this case the eighth circuit.see midwest,at,at.although the entry of judgment is an extreme sanction in the eighth circuit and elsewhere,givens,at,we are not convinced that the district court abused its discretion.transclean legitimately sought to discover bridgewood grounds for its defense of noninfringement and was entitled to a reply to its interrogatory.when bridgewood chose not to respond before the closing of discovery other than to voice its belief that the patent was invalid and unenforceable,summary judgment opinion at,the court was within its discretion to impose a sanction.the court found clear prejudice to transclean,as it was precluded from conducting discovery on the infringement issues.id.at.to hold that the district court abused its discretion would be to disarm the court of its important power to police its proceedings to ensure transparency and predictability and to discourage mischievous conduct by litigants.it will be a rare case in which we take such an action.moreover,even if a lesser sanction such as exclusion of evidence may have been more closely tailored to the misconduct,see givens,at characterizing evidence exclusion as the normal sanction for failure to comply with a discovery deadline,the practical result would have been the same.transclean motion for summary judgment of infringement presented evidence sufficient to show infringement,and,in light of bridgewood,that evidence was uncontradicted.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment of infringement of claims and of the patent.
as for the second alleged abuse of discretion,denial of bridgewood motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of claim,bridgewood argues that the court misconstrued the phrase exhibiting resilient characteristics to mean returning to an original shape after being deformed or returning to its original position after being compressed.summary judgment opinion at.bridgewood contends that initial deformation of shape is inherent in the meaning of the expression and cites technical dictionary definitions in support of that contention.under the correct construction of that expression,according to bridgewood,the piston in its device does not exhibit resilient characteristics.moreover,bridgewood contends that prosecution history estoppel and the rule bar transclean from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents for that claim limitation because claim,in which it appears,was added during prosecution,whereas the originally submitted claims did not contain that limitation,and because vitiation of the exhibiting resilient characteristics limitation would result.transclean responds that claim requires only that said means exhibit resilient characteristics,not that the means itself be resilient.transclean also cites common dictionary definitions and expert testimony in support of its view that the term resilient does not require initial deformation.moreover,transclean contends that claim itself was never narrowed during prosecution and that bridgewood prosecution history estoppel argument was not raised in the district court and has therefore been waived.
because we affirm the judgment of infringement of claims and,we need not review the court ultimate conclusion regarding infringement of claim.bridgewood has already been held to be an infringer,and infringement of another claim does not increase its liability.see pall micron separations.however,to put to rest any doubts regarding the proper construction of claim,because the patent has not been shown to be invalid and the issue has been fully ventilated by the parties,we will address that issue.we agree with bridgewood that the court misconstrued the term resilient.dictionaries,both general and technical,define the adjective resilient or its noun form resilience as encompassing that which returns to its original shape following a deformation in shape.see,dictionary of scientific and technical terms ed defining the term resilience as the a bility of a strained body,by virtue of high yield strength and low elastic modulus,to recover its size and form following deformation american heritage dictionary ed defining the term resilient as returning to an original shape or position,as after having been compressed.the dissent,as did the district court,focuses on the word or in the preceding definition to support its view that the term resilient encompasses the returning to a position alone,without any shape deformation.we do not think that the use of the word or in that definition can overcome the meaning attributed to the term resilient by the patent disclosure of only a flexible diaphragm dividing a tank into two chambers.see patent,ll.depicting and describing a flexible diaphragm.furthermore,to the extent there is a difference between the common and technical meanings of the terms,the term resilient is used in the patent in a technical context to describe a component of a mechanical apparatus,and a technical dictionary is therefore a better source to inform the meaning of the term to a skilled artisan in this case.moreover,we do not share the dissent view that the phrase exhibiting resilient characteristics describes a function in a limitation.on the contrary,the limitation further defined in claim is the means for equalizing the flow previously set forth in claim.id.at,ll,ll.according to the claim language,the only function performed by that means is equalizing the flow.the phrase exhibiting resilient characteristics is not a second function performed by that means rather,the phrase further defines characteristics of that means.it is therefore,appropriate,indeed mandatory under,to look to the corresponding structure in the specification to ascertain the meaning of the phrase.as already noted,that corresponding structure,a flexible diaphragm,patent,ll,is resilient in the sense that it tends to return to its original shape,not just its original position.we therefore conclude that the phrase exhibiting resilient characteristics in the patent requires initial shape deformation.because the jury finding of infringement of claim was premised on a construction of that phrase at odds with ours,we vacate the judgment of infringement of claim.
patent infringement damages 
the jury awarded three types of damages for patent infringement as a reasonable royalty on bridgewood sales of infringing devices as additional damages necessary to adequately compensate for bridgewood infringement and as a reasonable royalty based upon bridgewood proceeds from the sale of its business to century.damages opinion at.the court reversed the third award,holding that transclean was not entitled to such an award as a matter of law.id.at.as to the first and second,the court granted bridgewood motion for a new trial or remittitur in the amount of,the highest amount,based on the evidence,that the jury could have properly awarded for patent infringement.id.at.transclean apparently accepted the remittitur.
transclean appeals from the court decision concerning the third award only.transclean cites minco,combustion eng g,in support of its argument that,because bridgewood sole source of revenue was an infringing product and bridgewood generated in goodwill from the sale of its business to century,transclean is entitled to recover the value of that goodwill.transclean asserts that to allow bridgewood to retain that windfall would create an incentive for others to infringe a patent and then sell their businesses.
bridgewood responds that this case is distinguishable from minco because that case involved lost profits,not a reasonable royalty,and a reasonable royalty must be based on sales of infringing articles.bridgewood contends that payment for goodwill is not the sale of infringing goods,was attributable to many factors other than the technology of its fluid changing machines,and that transclean did not prove a nexus between the patent infringement and the value of the goodwill.
we agree with bridgewood that minco does not control this case.as indicated,it was a lost profits case,not one based on a reasonable royalty.although minco acknowledged that fashioning an adequate damages award depends on the unique economic circumstances of each case,at,at,we held that the patent owner in that case could not recover damages based on the infringer sale of its business.id.at.more specifically,the patent owner sought lost profits calculated as the difference between the sales price of the infringer business and its expert valuation of the business without the infringing devices.id.at.the patent owner asserted that the purchaser would have purchased its business instead of the infringer,had it not been for the infringement,and the excess sales price thus constituted part of the patent owner lost profits.the district court did not accept that assertion,and we affirmed that decision.id.at.furthermore,we explained that any award based on the infringer sale of its business would be duplicative of the reasonable royalty the infringer had already received based on the infringer sales of infringing goods.id.the district court reasonable royalty award already compensates the patent owner for any goodwill the infringer garnered by infringement.transclean citation of minco as controlling this case is thus unsound it is an example of the unhelpful advocacy that is at times made to this court,in which counsel cites general language from a prior case,rather than its holding.in fact,the holding of minco supports bridgewood position,not transclean.
we must analyze transclean claim for a percentage of bridgewood business sale proceeds as it was asserted,as a claim for a reasonable royalty,not for lost profits.reasonable royalty damages for patent infringement arise from the fact of infringement,and the portion of the sales price consisting of intangible goodwill is not the sale of infringing goods.it is partial compensation for the sale of a business.whether or not proceeds from the sale of a business including tangible assets such as infringing inventory would be compensable as a remedy for patent infringement we are not in a position to say that case is not before us.what is clear is that the portion of a sales price consisting of goodwill,compensation in excess of tangible assets,is not sales of infringing goods that can form the base for determination of a reasonable royalty.no such precedent exists,nor are we prepared to distort the statute to set one.
in addition,as a matter of proof,transclean has not established the amount,if any,of a reasonable royalty on bridgewood sale of its business it is entitled to recover.transclean had the burden of proving the amount of reasonable royalty damages it is entitled to recover.id.the most relevant inquiry in that respect would seem to be the amount of the business value that is attributable to the patent infringement.transclean offered expert testimony that the entire goodwill above and beyond the value of bridgewood tangible assets was attributable to patent infringement because bridgewood was a single product company and that product infringed transclean patent.damages opinion at.however,the district court disagreed,concluding that the opinion testimony was conclusory and belied by bridgewood arguments that bridgewood goodwill was attributable to other factors,customer lists,brand identity,product quality,and pricing.id.at.we perceive no error in the district court analysis or conclusion.moreover,to the extent that transclean argues that the goodwill was ultimately attributable to bridgewood sales of infringing machines,any award of reasonable royalty damages based on goodwill transferred when the business was sold would be a double recovery,as transclean has already been awarded damages that fully compensate it for bridgewood past sales.see minco,at,at the district court reasonable royalty award already compensates the patent owner for any goodwill the infringer garnered by infringement.to the extent that the extra recovery transclean seeks would be duplicative,we see no merit to transclean argument that bridgewood is retaining a windfall that would create an incentive for infringers to sell infringing businesses with impunity.
for the reasons stated above,we conclude that the court did not err when it ruled that,as a matter of law,transclean was not entitled to a reasonable royalty on proceeds from bridgewood sale of its business.
enhanced damages 
the jury found that bridgewood infringement was willful.transclean argued to the jury that it made bridgewood aware of the patent,but that bridgewood did not obtain an opinion of counsel and did not abate its manufacture or sale of the infringing machines.bridgewood argued that the fact that it obtained its own patent on an automatic transmission fluid changing machine demonstrated a good faith belief that it was not an infringer.bridgewood argued that when it received advice from its patent attorney concerning the patentability of its invention over the patent,it received an implicit opinion of noninfringement.although the jury agreed with transclean that bridgewood had willfully infringed the patent,the court,after applying the factors set forth in read portec,listing nine factors,declined to enhance the patent infringement damages.damages opinion at.
transclean contends that the court abused its discretion by not enhancing the damages in light of the jury finding of willfulness.transclean also asserts that the court erroneously assumed that the only way it could enhance the damages was by trebling them,misunderstanding that an enhancement of less than trebling was a permissible option.bridgewood responds that a finding of willful infringement does not mandate enhancement of damages,that the court did not misunderstand the law on enhancement,and that the court properly considered the read factors.
we agree with bridgewood that the court acted within its discretion in not enhancing the damages award.enhancement of damages under involves the determining that the infringer engaged in culpable conduct and the court exercising its discretion to determine whether and to what extent to enhance the damages.jurgens cbk.the jury finding of willfulness satisfies the first step,see,and is also one of the factors the court assesses in performing the second step,see read,at,at.however,there are other factors relevant to the second step.see id.listing as factors deliberate copying infringer investigation and belief of invalidity or litigation conduct infringer size and financial condition closeness of the case duration of the misconduct remedial action by the infringer infringer motivation for harm and concealment.a finding of willful infringement authorizes but does not mandate an award or increased damages.modine allen group.in this case,the court considered the pertinent read factors carefully,damages opinion at,and although we may or may not have reached a different conclusion if we had been in the district court shoes,we wear our own shoes.we review the court analysis for an abuse of discretion,and we are satisfied that such an abuse did not occur.
we also agree with transclean that the court did not erroneously assume that its only options were to treble the patent infringement damages or not enhance the damages at all.the court opinion states,in exercising our discretion to enhance damages,however,we are limited to a trebling of the basic damage award.damages opinion at quoting signtech usa,vutek.we read that statement,as it was intended in signtech,to simply recognize the upper range of the possible enhancement.see signtech,at,at t he district court enjoys discretion to choose whether to award enhanced damages to the claimant and in what amount.this discretion,however is limited to a trebling of the basic damage award.citations omitted emphasis added.elsewhere in the same opinion,the court makes statements recognizing that a range of enhancement is possible.see damages opinion at t he court determines,exercising its sound discretion,whether,and to what extent,to increase the damages award quoting jurgens,at,at emphasis added damages opinion at the paramount determination in deciding to grant enhancement and the amount thereof is quoting read,at,at emphasis added.see also modine,at,at t he fact that the court opinion focuses upon treble damages does not necessarily mean that the judge failed to consider lesser multiples of damages.
attorney fees 
after the trial,transclean filed a motion for attorney fees,and the court granted that motion in part,awarding transclean its attorney fees arising from arguing two issues.first,pursuant to,the court awarded transclean attorney fees for defense of a charge of inequitable conduct asserted by bridgewood.damages opinion at.the court opinion does not address attorney fees under except in relation to the inequitable conduct issue.second,pursuant to minnesota private attorney general statute,the court awarded transclean attorney fees for its successful claim that bridgewood engaged in false advertising by promoting its transmission fluid changing machine as replacing or every drop of transmission fluid.id.however,the court later revoked that award for two reasons transclean had unclean hands by promoting its own service as a total fluid exchange,and transclean did not object to century use of the same advertisements after century had purchased bridgewood and taken a license to the patent from transclean.
transclean now argues that the court abused its discretion by not awarding transclean attorney fees under for its entire patent infringement claim when the jury determined that bridgewood infringement was willful and by not stating its reasons for declining to award attorney fees apart from those related to inequitable conduct.transclean further argues that the court abused its discretion by not ultimately awarding attorney fees under.for its false advertising claim.bridgewood responds that a finding of willful infringement does not mandate a determination that a case is exceptional,as that term is used in,and that not every exceptional case is deserving of an award of attorney fees.bridgewood further responds that the court set forth legitimate reasons for not awarding attorney fees for the false advertising claim and thus acted within its discretion.
with regard to attorney fees for patent infringement,we agree with bridgewood.transclean is correct in stating the general rule that the district court must normally explain why it decides that a case is not exceptional under when a factual finding of willful infringement has been established and,if exceptional,why it decides not to award attorney fees,johnson son,uspq.however,we have recognized an exception to that general rule in cases where the record adequately sets forth grounds for affirming the district court actions.carroll touch,electro mech,citing consol.foseco int l.in this case,the court careful analysis of the read factors regarding enhancement of damages suffices as grounds for affirming the court implicit conclusion that the infringement case was not exceptional within the meaning of.
with regard to attorney fees for false advertising,we agree with bridgewood.transclean claim for attorney fees arising from the false advertising cause of action was based on.the purpose of that statute is to encourage private parties to police unlawful trade practices affecting the public interest.ly nystrom.the court determined that,while transclean cause of action against bridgewood for false advertising was on its face one that qualified for attorney fees under the statute,attorney fees opinion at,transclean own use of advertising that was arguably equivalent in falsity and transclean tolerance of century use of the same advertising when it licensed transclean patent erased any public benefit accruing from the successful action against bridgewood,id.at.the district court reasoning is sound,and we discern no abuse of discretion in its decision not to award transclean attorney fees for its false advertising claim.
trademark infringement 
transclean brought a cause of action for trademark infringement,asserting that bridgewood infringed transclean total fluid exchange and total fluid unregistered trademarks under section a of the lanham act,a,and minnesota law.the court granted bridgewood motion for summary judgment of noninfringement on the ground that there was no genuine issue of material fact relating to transclean adequate usage of the marks in commerce.summary judgment opinion at.transclean argues that a genuine issue of material fact regarding that issue was raised by an affidavit from james viken,transclean ceo and inventor on the patent,stating that transclean had used the marks on its products and documents since.id.at.bridgewood responds that the affidavit is conclusory and does not designate specific facts concerning the marks us
