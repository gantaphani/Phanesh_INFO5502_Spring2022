the opinion filed september,slip,and appearing at wl,is amended as follows 
the caption is changed to reflect the addition of case,the companion case consolidated with.this case number was inadvertently omitted from the opinion as filed.
trek bicycle corporation trek has long used the trademark trek on its bicycles and related products.in recent years,thane international,thane began producing and selling a stationary exercise machine under the orbitrek mark.the question in this case is whether thane has violated the federal trademark laws by its choice of name for its product.
background 
trek,a wisconsin corporation,has manufactured bicycles under the trek mark since.trek also uses the trek label on a variety of bicycle accessories including clothing,hats,packs,wrist watches,bags,video games,toys,computer games,helmets,and gloves.in all,trek identifies over products with the trek mark.trek products are sold through more than independent dealers in locations across the country.surveys published in bicycling magazine in,and,each indicate that,according to the magazine subscribers,trek is the country most popular and most respected bicycle brand.
in,trek was granted a united states trademark for the use of trek on bicycles and bicycle frames.since then,trek has been awarded several other trademarks based on variations of the word trek including trekking in for bicycles trek in for providing support services during charitable bicycle rides trek bmx in for bicycles and bicycle frames and elec trek in for bicycles,bicycle frames and parts.additionally,trek registered trek on may,for exercise equipment,namely stationary exercise cycles.
trek spends between million and million per year on advertising.publications including rolling stone magazine,men journal,outside magazine,spin,playboy,women sport fitness,bicycling magazine,mountain bike,backpacker,and velonews run trek ads.trek estimates that its website attracts million visitors annually.trek other advertising comes through a variety of promotional efforts,including sponsoring athletes to use its equipment.the most prominent athlete trek sponsors is lance armstrong,who has used trek bicycles to capture several tour de france titles.the world press has chronicled armstrong victories,generating considerable publicity for trek.pictures of armstrong with a trek bicycle have appeared in the new york times and on wheaties boxes.when armstrong presented a trek bicycle to president clinton,coverage of that event also made its way into papers across the country.
in,trek entered the stationary exercise machine market by introducing six models of exercise bikes bearing the trek mark.thane maintains that this venture was a failure.three years later,trek sold its trek fitness line to vision fitness,a small company founded by two former trek employees.the transaction included a license allowing vision fitness to use the trek mark for exercise equipment until september.trek claims that some dealers continued to advertise and sell stationary exercise cycles bearing the trek logo through march.
in january,trek began considering another foray into the stationary exercise machine market by preparing a new product evaluation for a new stationary trainer.this stationary trainer would not have pedals,a seat,or handlebars.instead,the device would allow the user to convert her mobile bicycle into a stationary one for indoor use.at the time of the summary judgment motions,trek planned to begin selling these trainers in the summer of.
based in la quinta,california,thane operates in the direct response marketing field.it airs lengthy infomercials on television broadcast and cable stations,encouraging viewers to use the telephone,direct mail,or the internet to purchase products directly from thane.
in,thane developed the orbitrek,characterized as a dual directional elliptical glider stationary exercise machine for indoor use.the orbitrek has rectangular platform pedals large enough to support a person entire foot.the pedals move in an elliptical motion designed to simulate the body natural stride.movable handlebars extend straight up from the orbitrek base and provide upper body exercise.the orbitrek has no seat,because it is meant to be used while standing.
thane began airing its infomercial for the orbitrek in december.the infomercial stated that the orbitrek sells for the unbelievable price of only,but if you c all right now the exciting new orbitrek will be shipped to you immediately for the unheard of low price of only.
thane explains that the trek part of the orbitrek mark had an inspiration entirely independent of trek bicycles and other equipment.thane executive,denise dubarry,was married to an actor who appeared in the original pilot for the television star trek show.dubarry has long watched the star trek television series and attended star trek conventions.by using a word associated with star trek,thane believes it depicts the orbitrek as a,and futuristic product.indeed,thane claims none of its employees had heard of trek bicycles prior to the current dispute.thane did not perform a trademark search for trek before adopting orbitrek as the name for its exercise machine.
iii.proceedings 
thane filed an application with the united states patent and trademark office to register orbitrek for goods described as stationary exercise machines.trek thereupon filed a notice of opposition with the trademark trial and appeal board.on february,thane filed a complaint and demand for jury trial in federal district court,seeking a declaration that it had not violated trademark laws under the lanham act,state common law,or state statutory law.trek responded with a and demand for jury trial its opposition to thane trademark application was suspended pending the outcome of this case.
the parties then filed for summary judgment on all claims.the district court granted thane motion for summary judgment and denied trek,holding that any reasonable juror would conclude that there is no likelihood of confusion between trek bicycle corporation trek mark and thane orbitrek mark.thane next moved for attorney fees,but the district court denied this motion.trek now appeals the district court denial of its summary judgment motion and the district court grant of thane summary judgment motion.thane appeals the district court denial of its motion for attorney fees.
likelihood of confusion 
the federal statute prohibiting trademark infringement requires a trademark holder to prove that the alleged infringer use of a mark is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.a b this requirement directly advances the dual purposes of infringement law ensuring that owners of trademarks can benefit from the goodwill associated with their marks and that consumers can distinguish among competing producers.entrepreneur media,smith,cir quoting park n fly,dollar park and fly,d brookfield communications,west coast entm t,cir quoting qualitex jacobson products,d the question whether an alleged trademark infringer use of a mark creates a likelihood that the consuming public will be confused as to who makes what product is therefore the core element of trademark infringement law.brookfield,at.
applicable legal standards 
we ordinarily rely on an eight factor test,first articulated in amf sleekcraft boats,cir,to help determine if a likelihood of confusion exists the eight factors are the strength of trek mark the similarity of the trek and thane marks the proximity or relatedness of the goods or services thane intent in selecting its mark evidence of actual confusion the marketing channels used the likelihood of expansion into other markets and the degree of care purchasers are likely to exercise.
unless properly used,this long list of factors has the potential to befuddle the inquiry.the list of factors is not a a party wins a majority of the factors is not the point.nor should t he factors be rigidly weighed we do not count beans.dreamwerks prod.group skg studio,cir.some factors are much more helpful than others,and the relative importance of each individual factor will be case specific i t is often possible to reach a conclusion with respect to likelihood of confusion after considering only a subset of the factors.brookfield communications,at.
the nature of the likelihood of confusion inquiry largely shapes the role of district courts addressing motions for summary judgment and our role in reviewing grants and denials of summary judgments.likelihood of confusion is a factual determination.downing abercrombie fitch,cir.therefore,a district court may grant summary judgment and we may uphold a grant of summary judgment only if no genuine issue exists regarding likelihood of confusion.c.we have cautioned that district courts should grant summary judgment motions regarding the likelihood of confusion sparingly,as careful assessment of the pertinent factors that go into determining likelihood of confusion usually requires a full record.clicks billiards sixshooters,cir interstellar starship services,epix,cir 
here,both parties have moved for summary judgment.although the analysis of each motion informs the other,we address each separately.
thane motion 
the grant of summary judgment for thane falters upon consideration of a single sleekcraft factor,evidence of actual confusion.
trek provided evidence that consumers were actually confused by thane use of orbitrek.based on that evidence,a reasonable jury could find a likelihood of confusion.
evidence of actual confusion constitutes persuasive proof that future confusion is likely.clicks billiards,at quoting fuddruckers,doc others,cir.this rule makes good sense.if enough people have been actually confused,then a likelihood that people are confused is established.
this is not to say that evidence of actual confusion will always compel a jury to find likelihood of confusion.in some cases,a jury may properly find actual confusion evidence de minimis and thus unpersuasive as to the ultimate issue entrepreneur media,at.but if a party produces evidence from which a reasonable jury could surmise that an appreciable number of people are confused about the source of the product,then it is entitled to a trial on the likelihood of it will not necessarily prevail at that trial.id.at emphasis in original.
trek did not present direct evidence of actual confusion,such as the testimony of actual customers.it did,however,present extensive survey evidence of actual confusion.survey evidence may establish actual confusion.clicks billiards,at wendt host int l,cir levi strauss blue bell,cir en banc.
after trek dispute with thane began,trek hired david stewart,a professor at the gordon marshall school of business at the university of southern california,to oversee a survey into the likelihood of confusion between the two companies products.the survey consisted of interviews with people over the age of who had purchased either a bicycle or exercise equipment in the last three years or planned to do so in the next year.the respondents were interviewed in shopping malls in eight metropolitan areas across the united states.
three hundred of the respondents were shown pictures of advertisements for trek products and orbitrek products and asked questions about the pictures after analyzing the relevant data,stewart concluded that of the respondents in the survey were confused with respect to the source or association of the orbitrek products based on the similarity of its name logo to the trek name or logo.
thane has criticized the survey methodology.but drawing all justifiable inferences from the survey in trek favor as we must on summary judgment,we must conclude that the survey provides evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that more than one quarter of those who encounter both trek and orbitrek ads will be confused about the origin of the orbitrek exercise machine.because actual confusion is persuasive proof of the likelihood of confusion,a reasonable jury could conclude that a likelihood of confusion exists.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to thane.
trek motion 
with respect to trek motion,the district court determined that no reasonable juror could find that likelihood of confusion exists.although this conclusion exaggerates the weakness of the evidence in trek favor,it is not so far off the mark as to require summary judgment for trek.we turn to two other relevant sleekcraft similarity of the marks and the relatedness of the determine whether the district court properly denied trek motion.brookfield communications,at factors such as similarity of the marks and whether the two companies are direct competitors will always be important.
both trek and orbitrek include the syllable trek,and the syllable is separately capitalized in orbitrek.a reasonable jury might nonetheless conclude that the marks are not similar.this is so even if the jury takes seriously the admonition that s imilarities weigh more heavily than differences.sleekcraft,at.
orbitrek contains the two syllable prefix orbi,while trek does not.so orbitrek has three times as many syllables as trek and twice as many letters.in entrepreneur media we held that a reasonable fact finder could find entrepreneur dissimilar from both entrepreneur illustrated and entrepreneurpr.in particular,we reasoned that entrepreneur illustrated is almost twice as both the eye and entrepreneur,and entrepreneurpr contains two more syllables than entrepreneur.at.moreover,the trek trademark appears with all four letters capitalized,distinguishing it visibly from orbitrek.
in addition,the more closely related the goods are,the more likely consumers will be confused by similar marks.entrepreneur media at.to determine whether the goods are related,we ask whether the consuming public is likely somehow to associate the orbitrek with trek.brookfield communications,at.
trek primarily sells bicycles and bicycle accessories.although a mobile bicycle and the orbitrek machine both provide exercise,a jury could find this relationship insufficient to support a likelihood of confusion between these products.
trek did sell six models of stationary exercise bikes from to.trek sold its fitness equipment line to vision fitness in that company continued to market stationary bikes bearing the trek mark through at least.the parties dispute whether any stationary bikes bearing the trek logo were sold after thane introduced the orbitrek in.trek did,however,submit evidence showing that it planned to sell a device beginning in that would allow a user to convert her bicycle into a stationary bicycle.
taken all together,this evidence concerning the relatedness of trek and thane products is sufficiently balanced that a reasonable juror could conclude either that trek and thane products are related or that they are not.a jury,making all reasonable inferences in thane favor,could conclude that trek foray into the stationary bike market was a failure and thus unimportant to a likelihood of confusion determination,particularly if the jury concluded that trek venture ended entirely before the orbitrek was introduced.also,even if a jury considered trek an active or future producer of stationary bikes,it could reasonably conclude that stationary bikes and elliptical gliders are different enough from each other that consumers would not confuse the orbitrek with trek stationary exercise bikes.as the district court observed,t he orbitrek does not have bicycle style pedals or a seat for someone to sit on as they would if they were riding a bicycle,stationary or otherwise.based on this observation,a reasonable jury could conclude,as the district court did,that the products are not related.
finally,although we conclude above that a reasonable juror could find actual confusion based on trek survey data,that data is not so compelling that a reasonable jury could not credit thane criticisms of the survey evidence and give the evidence of actual confusion little or no credence.
in sum,a reasonable jury could conclude that there is no credible evidence of direct confusion,that trek and orbitrek are not similar,and that the products identified by the marks are not related.if it reached these conclusions,a jury could reasonably determine that there was no likelihood of confusion between the trek and orbitrek marks.therefore,trek motion for summary judgment must fail as did thane.we remand to the district court for trial on trek trademark infringement claim.
ii.dilution 
the federal antidilution statute provides 
the owner of a famous mark shall be entitled,subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court deems reasonable,to an injunction against another person commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name,if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark 
c.the statute goes on to set out factors pertinent in determining whether a mark is distinctive and famous,c a to h,and to define dilution as the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services,regardless of the presence or absence of competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties or likelihood of confusion,mistake or deception.
trademark infringement principles protect both trademark holders and consumers from the consequences of confusion about the source of a product.in contrast,the animating concern of the dilution protection is that the user of the diluting mark appropriates or free rides on the investment made by the trademark holder.playboy enterprises,welles,cir.consistent with this distinction,likelihood of confusion is not an element of a trademark dilution cause of action under either federal law,as the language makes explicit,or california law.see cal.bus.a.
the district court grant of summary judgment to thane on the dilution cause of action was based solely on its premise that there was no likelihood of confusion.that premise could not be determinative of the dilution claim even if true and we conclude above that it is not true in the sense that summary judgment was appropriate on likelihood of confusion.so we must analyze the dilution claim afresh.
the federal trademark dilution act of,stat,is relatively new,and presents formidable problems of interpretation.see generally nabisco,pf brands,cir.further,the implications of a broad application of the federal antidilution statute are troubling,as d ilution causes of action,much more so than infringement and unfair competition laws,tread very close to granting rights in gross in a trademark,avery dennison sumpton,cir,thereby hampering competition and the marketing of new products.
yet,congress obviously perceived an inadequacy in the existing federal trademark laws when it passed the antidilution statute and intended to grant comparatively expansive rights to prevent the use of established marks in some circumscribed circumstances.we may not interpret the statute so narrowly as to compromise the evident intent.we therefore agree with the second circuit that,in considering this new statutory right,courts do better to feel their way from case to case,nabisco,at,rather than ruling in sweeping brush strokes.it is with these cautions in mind that we proceed to consider the dilution issue in this case.
identity of the marks 
we begin from the requirement that for a dilution claim to succeed,the mark used by the alleged diluter must be identical,or nearly identical,to the protected mark.playboy enterprises,at.such a requirement comports with the statutory language,the dilution test derived from that language outlined in panavision int l toeppen,cir and avery dennison,at,and with the statute legislative history and purposes.
the statute establishes that the junior user,to be liable for dilution,must use a mark or trade name after the mark has become famous.c emphasis added.as articulated in panavision and avery dennison,the test for dilution similarly provides that to make out an antidilution cause of action,a plaintiff must show that its mark is famous and the defendant is making commercial use of the mark in commerce.avery dennison,at emphasis added see panavision,at see also mattel,mca records,cir dilution refers to the whittling away of the value of a trademark when it used to identify different products.emphasis added citation omitted.these locutions indicate that the defendant must use essentially the same mark,not just a similar one.concomitantly,this circuit description of the two most common forms of and a defendant to use the plaintiff actual mark,rather than a mark that is merely similar.see panavision,at blurring occurs when a defendant uses a plaintiff trademark to identify the defendant goods and services,and t arnishment occurs when a famous mark is improperly associated with an inferior mark or offensive product or service.
the legislative history,while not definitive on the issue,also suggests that the marks must be identical or close thereto.in explaining the difference between dilution and infringement,the senate report states that the concept of dilution focuses on the investment the owner has made in the mark and on the commercial values and aura of the mark itself,protecting both from those who would appropriate the mark for their own benefit,at,reprinted in,emphases added.the report then lists two hypothetical examples of dilution where a mark such as kodak is used for pianos,or buick is used for aspirin.id.no example is given of the use of marks that are merely similar to the famous mark.
further,a dilution claim alleges a form of appropriation.playboy enterprises,at.appropriation implies the adoption of the mark itself,not the use of a similar mark.as discussed previously,infringement is designed to protect against consumer confusion about the source of a product that may arise,inter alia,because a company uses a similar mark.dilution,on the other hand,protects the distinctiveness of a particular mark whether or not the products compete or consumer confusion exists.because dilution and likelihood of confusion tests are directed at different actions,it does not make sense to import the relatively subjective similarity of the marks test from the likelihood of confusion context into the dilution context.see,trademarks and unfair competition,ed.
in playboy enterprises,we elucidated the identical or nearly identical standard by adopting the eighth circuit expression of the requirement for marks to be nearly identical to one another,they must be similar enough that a significant segment of the target group of customers sees the two marks as essentially the same.at quoting luigino stouffer,cir.other circuits also have adopted more stringent similarity of marks tests in the dilution context than in the infringement context.for example,the second circuit recently stated that the act purpose is to protect famous marks against dilution when a junior user uses the same mark in a way.tcpip holding,haar communications,cir.it has thus adopted the following test 
the marks must be of sufficient similarity so that,in the mind of the consumer,the junior mark will conjure an association with the senior we hold that the marks must be very or substantially similar and that,absent such similarity,there can be no viable claim of dilution.
nabisco,at quoting mead data central,toyota motor sales.cir see also federal express federal espresso,cir quoting nabisco,at the fourth circuit has held that there must be a sufficient similarity between the junior and senior marks to evoke an instinctive mental association of the two by a relevant universe of consumers.ringling bailey combined shows,utah div.of travel development,cir internal quotations omitted.but see eli lilly natural answers,cir using the same similarity test for a dilution claim used for a related infringement claim.
applying the playboy identical or nearly identical standard,we conclude that although trek and orbitrek are not identical to one another,the possibility exists that a reasonable factfinder could find that orbitrek is using a mark nearly identical to trek mark.the orbitrek mark contains the entire trek mark and highlights the trek mark by capitalizing it in the middle of a single word.a reasonable trier of fact could determine that thane use d the trek mark by incorporating the same word into its own mark as a separate,visually identifiable element,and that a significant segment of the consuming public would likely focus on that element as an identifier essentially the same as the trek mark.on the other hand,a reasonable factfinder could decide that examined as a whole,the orbitrek mark is sufficiently dissimilar from the trek mark that the two could be viewed as not essentially the same.after all,trek in orbitrek is conjoined with orbi rather than appearing as a separate word and trek is not all in capital letters.we conclude that the issue of identity can not be decided on a motion for summary judgment.
famousness 
aside from establishing the identity or near identity of the marks,a party alleging dilution must satisfactorily prove that its mark is famous the defendant is making commercial use of the mark in commerce the defendant use began after the plaintiff mark became famous and the defendant use presents a likelihood of dilution of the distinctive value of the mark.avery dennison,at as we conclude that a reasonable factfinder could not find trek famous in any relevant market segment,we need not proceed beyond the first prong of this inquiry.
general principles the federal statute limits protection to the owners of a famous mark.c.to help determin e whether a mark is distinctive and famous,the statute,in keeping with trademark law apparent penchant for flexible tests,lists eight factors a court may consider.c.the only case in this circuit to explicate the famousness requirement,avery dennison,stressed that fame in the dilution context must be very narrow dilution is a cause of action invented and reserved for a select class of marks with such powerful consumer associations that even uses can impinge their value.at.as a result,to meet the famousness element of protection under the dilution statutes a mark must be truly prominent and renowned.id.quoting lund trading aps kohler,cir internal quotations omitted.
this limitation on dilution protection created by the narrow definition of famousness,like the identical or nearly identical requirement already discussed,is critical.antidilution is the most potent form of trademark protection and has the potential of trademarks.id.further,the concept of dilution is more abstract than the concept of trademark infringement,which is anchored by the likelihood of confusion standard absent strict policing of the famousness requirement,neither participants in the commercial nor courts are likely to apply dilution statutes in a predictable fashion.it is one thing to determine whether consumers are likely to transfer associations evoked by a truly famous mark to an unrelated product we can say with some certainty that nearly anyone in the civilized world buying a product titled will associate that product with the soft drink,its packaging,and its advertisements.it is quite another to determine whether a less well known mark will evoke such associations.with respect to less well known marks,inquiries into consumers mindsets become fuzzier,as likely associations become more dependent on individual backgrounds and experiences.
fame in a niche market despite its repeated admonition that only truly prominent and renowned marks deserve protection under c,avery dennison held that marks famous in only a limited geographic area or a specialized market segment can be famous for the purposes of the federal statute.at fame in a localized trading area may meet the famousness requirement as may fame in a specialized market segment when the diluting uses are directed narrowly at the same market segment internal quotations and citations omitted.we are bound by avery dennison to accept and apply the niche fame concept,despite its apparent tension with avery dennison overall message cautioning restraint in applying dilution protections.
niche fame protection is,however,limited.the statute protects a mark only when a mark is famous within a niche market and the alleged diluter uses the mark within that niche.id.
applying that concept here,we conclude,first,that a reasonable could find that trek and thane operate in the same narrow market segment.id.avery dennison indicated that a company providing integrated customer care to telephone and internet customers operates in the same market segment as a company that provides engineering and installation services to the telecommunications industry.id.at citing teletech customer care mgmt.similarly,a factfinder could conclude that stationary exercise bicycle manufacturers and stationary elliptical trainer manufacturers share the same market segment 
a reasonable factfinder could not,however,conclude that mobile bicycles and elliptical orbit machines operate in the same narrow market segment for purposes of the niche fame concept,although both products can be used for exercise.to maintain coherence,the niche fame concept must focus on highly specialized market segments with an identifiable customer base.where those conditions obtain,participants are likely to make associations between marks that the general public will not make.as the market segments in which the senior and junior products operate become less specialized and less unitary,the notion that participants in those diverse markets will necessarily recognize and form mental associations with an established mark becomes increasingly questionable.
in this case,the smallest market segment that bicycles and elliptical orbit machines could be said to share is the sporting goods market.this is a widely diverse market that encompasses everything from football helmets to ice skates.there is no reason why participants in this broad market will have any particular knowledge about products in submarkets in which they do not participate.
although a factfinder could conclude that stationary exercise bicycle manufacturers and stationary elliptical trainer manufacturers share the same market segment,it could not reasonably find that trek is a famous mark in that niche market segment,as opposed to in the market segment frequented by bicycle enthusiasts.one of the eight statutory factors for adjudging famousness is the duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the goods and services with which the mark is used.c b.trek stationary bicycles were sold for a fairly short time.if not extinct at the time orbitrek began selling its elliptical exercise machines,they were at least a threatened species.
any future plans trek may have had to reenter the stationary exercise machine market is not pertinent to the famousness inquiry.the federal statute applies only if the junior use begins after the mark has become famous.c.therefore,any fame trek may acquire for its mark in the future in the stationary exercise machine market could not preclude orbitrek from using its mark in that market.
where famousness is the question,the extent and duration of the use of a mark within a particular market segment will often be dispositive.no matter the degree of distinctiveness,c a,the geographic reach of the mark in the pertinent market segment,c d,the extent to which third parties use similar marks,c g,or the registration status of the mark,c h,a mark that is not widely associated with a particular product within a particular niche market is almost surely not famous in that market.the focus of the antidilution statute is on preventing junior users from appropriating or distorting the goodwill and positive associations that a famous mark has developed over the years.where there has been no successful,development of goodwill with respect to particular markets,asserting fame within that specialized market is simply inconsistent with the purpose of the antidilution protection 
trek,it is true,primarily sells bicycles and bicycle accessories,and the evidence is more than sufficient to allow a trier of fact to find that trek is a famous mark within the narrow market segment devoted to bicycle production and sales.but there is no reason to expect that the typical purchaser of stationary exercise those who buy their exercise machines as a result of seeing television bicycles or products,reads bicycle magazines or watches bicycle competitions on television,any more than anybody else does.that the mark trek is famous with bicycle enthusiasts is therefore of little pertinence in gauging
