as early as,predecessor in interest,north american teletrac nat began developing a based system for tracking fleet vehicles and recovering lost or stolen vehicles.in,nat acquired the necessary frequency licenses from the federal communications commission.in october,began field testing its system on school buses operated by lacoe.in june,one of nat subsidiaries,dmi systems,changed its name to international teletrac systems.also in june,dmi entered into a joint venture arrangement with pacific telesis and adopted the name teletrac.in july,began a comprehensive public relations campaign to market its new service,including distributing press releases and giving interviews to print and electronic media.it also made presentations to prospective customers.the district court found that in april,began making its service available on a commercial basis,and began making its service available to customers in the last quarter of.april was the first time lacoe began using the system on a basis,although it did not begin paying for the service until december,when the system was publicly launched.the record before the district court also included information that,from onward,was developing customers among various vehicle fleet operating enterprises and had agreements with at least twenty four of them.
meanwhile,in,allen chance came up with the idea for a lost and found service using attachable tags with unique serial numbers.finders of lost tagged items would use a toll free telephone number to report their discovery.in june,chance worked with his partner bill gray to design and manufacture the tags.the two brought in another friend,tom nettles,to work with them,coining the name teletrak for their service.is an abbreviation for tom allen bill.
in late summer,obtained a toll free number under the name teletrak lost and found hotline.it also obtained a mail drop and drew up a business plan.in october,an unrelated company,locksmith ledger,included postcard in its own bulk mailing to locksmiths.this post card announced the teletrak world wide toll free lost and found hotline.received responses from the mailing,but made no sales as a result.
in january,chance saw advertisements for teletrac service.he conducted a trademark search and discovered no pending application on file with the united states patent and trademark office pto.filed a service mark application for teletrak lost and found hotline and a trademark application for teletrak claiming first use of the mark on december.it later claimed first use in october,the time of the postcard mailer.
in february,chance purportedly sold a teletrak tag to brian voorheis,a long time friend.chance produced a one page typewritten registration form he prepared for voorheis tag,number,dated february.chance could not state,however,how much voorheis paid for the tag,how he paid for the tag,nor does have any record reflecting payment.voorheis could not recall when he received it,when he paid for it,or how much he paid for it.he also could not recall signing up for the service or ever renewing it.the tag voorheis produced at his deposition was one number different from the number recorded on the registration form.in addition,kirk rudy,another friend of chance,testified that chance gave him two tags in the summer of.he could not recall if they were a gift or he bartered for them.produced no record of a sale to rudy.

like the court of appeals for the federal circuit in the prior appeal of the registration case,the primary issue we deal with here is one of priority of use.to have prevented entry of summary judgment in the district court,chance would have had to come forward with some evidence beyond the mere pleadings to demonstrate a disputed issue of fact that use of the teletrak service mark predated first use.this question is dependent upon several subordinate questions was national post card advertising mailer in a bona fide first use if not,were sales of tags to voorheis and rudy,in february and the summer of respectively,sufficient to establish first use and was the district court correct in holding that first use occurred in april when lacoe began using system on a basis 
a.the definitions of service mark and use in commerce 
under the lanham act,a service mark can be any word,name,symbol,device or any combination thereof used by a person,or which a person has a bona fide intention to use in commerce and applies to register to identify and distinguish the services of one person,including a unique service,from the services of others and to indicate the source of the services,even if that source is unknown.this definition is virtually identical to the definition of trademark,contained in the preceding paragraph of,the only difference between a trademark and a service mark is that a trademark identifies goods while a service mark identifies services.west,arica,cir caesars world,caesar palace.service marks and trademarks are governed by identical standards,west,at,and thus like with trademarks,common law rights are acquired in a service mark by adopting and using the mark in connection with services rendered.hanover star milling metcalf.
the current version of was enacted in when congress passed the trademark law revision act tlra,stat.congress amended the lanham act by redefining the term use in commerce to mean the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade,and not made merely to reserve a mark.the ttab has held that the purpose of this revision was to eliminate token use as a basis for registration,and that the stricter standard contemplates instead commercial use of the type common to the particular industry in question.paramount pictures white,ttab.prior to,in order to qualify for federal registration,the extent of actual use of the mark was irrelevant so long as it amounted to more than a mere sham attempt to conform with statutory requirements.however,effective november,congress changed the statutory definition of use so as to require a greater degree of activity.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,ed footnotes omitted.the revised section now requires a showing that the applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce.this new bona fide intention requirement has been termed entirely consistent with the traditional rules governing common law ownership of trademarks.allard,advanced programming resources,cir.
the federal circuit has held that use in commerce,in the context of a trademark,means a bona fide sale or transportation in commerce which may lawfully be regulated by congress this requirement breaks down into two distinct elements was the transaction upon which the registration application was founded bona fide and if it was bona fide,was it followed by activities proving a continuous effort or intent to use the mark.avakoff pac,citing mccarthy c internal quotation and citations omitted.alternatively,the federal circuit has also held that where a mark has been placed on goods,a single sale or shipment may be sufficient to support an application to register the mark,providing that this shipment or sale has the color of a bona fide transaction and is accompanied or followed by activities which would tend to indicate a continuing effort or intent to continue such use and place the product on the market on a commercial scale within a time demonstrated to be reasonable in the particular trade,george putnam,common law and lanham act require that ownership be accorded to first bona fide user the right to register a mark flows from and follows its adoption and use in trade see also signature guardian,lee,ttab and ttab cases cited therein.however,because token use is not enough,m ere adoption of a mark without bona fide use,in an attempt to reserve it for the future,does not create trademark rights o wnership of a mark requires both appropriation and use in trade and ownership of a mark and the exclusive right to a mark belongs to the one who first uses the mark on goods placed on the market.signature guardian,at,citing united drug theodore rectanus.
in the service mark context,the federal circuit has held that 
a service mark is different from a mark for goods,especially in the manner it is used in commerce.the legally significant use giving rise to rights in a mark for goods is derived from the placing of the mark in some manner on the goods either directly or on their containers or packaging.a service mark,on the other hand,entails use in conjunction with the offering and providing of a service.this makes all the more important the use of the mark in sales or advertising materials of different descriptions.

our own cases are not dissimilar.in new west nym of,cir,a trademark case,we determined that,although mere advertising by itself may not establish priority of use,advertising combined with other activity is sufficient to establish use in commerce.specifically,we held that in deciding a question of first use,a court should examine the totality of the parties activities,id.at,a formulation not dissimilar to the federal circuit jigsaw puzzle analogy.quoting new england duplicating mendes,cir,we stated

we find that the totality of the circumstances test should apply to service mark cases as well.the statutory language supports the conclusion that use in commerce should be similarly defined for service marks as it is for trade marks.for both goods and services,the use in commerce requirement includes an element of actual use,and an element of display.compare definition of use in commerce for goods a mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce on goods is placed in any manner on the goods the goods are sold with that section definition of use in commerce for services on services when it is used or displayed and the services are rendered.in addition,for each type of mark,the tlra amended the definition of use in commerce to eliminate sham uses to reserve a right in a mark.the propriety of applying new west totality approach is further supported by the fact that new west based its formulation on at least one service mark case.see new west,at citing hotel of,at.
