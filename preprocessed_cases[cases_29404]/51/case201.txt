defendant telescan technologies,telescan appeals the district court preliminary injunction enjoining it from using plaintiff paccar paccar trademarks peterbilt and kenworth in any of its internet domain names and metatags.the district court concluded that paccar demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its claims for trademark infringement and trademark dilution under the lanham act,and.as set forth below,the preliminary injunction is affirmed in part and vacated in part and the case remanded for further proceedings.
factual background 
plaintiff paccar is a leading manufacturer of heavy trucks and truck parts under several trademarks,including the peterbilt and kenworth trademarks.peterbilt motors company and kenworth motor truck company,both divisions of paccar,have been manufacturing trucks under their respective names for over sixty years.paccar,which owns numerous trademark registrations for the peterbilt and kenworth trademarks,has invested substantial amounts of money in developing,marketing,and advertising those marks.
in addition to its manufacturing business,paccar administers a used truck locator service on its web site.this service permits consumers to search a database of used peterbilt and kenworth trucks available for sale from peterbilt and kenworth dealers.consumers can search the database using twelve different fields,including model,year,and location.
defendant telescan owns several web sites providing truck locator services.using telescan web site,consumers can search for new and used trucks either by viewing listings by dealer or by searching a database of participating dealers using eleven different search terms,including manufacturer,model,and year.dealers pay a monthly charge to have their listings included in the database.another telescan web site,provides links to telescan web sites,including,and.in addition to using the peterbilt and kenworth trademarks in its domain names telescan displays the marks in the wallpaper underlying the web sites in fonts similar to the distinctive fonts in paccar trademarks,cursive script for peterbilt and block script for kenworth and includes the words peterbilt and kenworth in the sites metatags the and web sites provide links to the database.each web site contains the following disclaimer this web site provides a listing service for name brand products and has no affiliation with any manufacturer whose branded products are listed herein.
by letter dated may,paccar asserted that telescan use of its trademarks peterbilt and kenworth in telescan domain names infringes upon paccar trademark rights and demanded that telescan relinquish ownership of the domain names.in response,telescan acknowledged paccar ownership of the trademarks peterbilt and kenworth but maintained that its use of the marks is a permissible generic fair use.
procedural history 
in,paccar brought an action under the lanham act and state law against telescan in the united states district court for the western district of washington.the case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction over telescan.
subsequently,telescan brought a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,seeking a declaration that its activities do not infringe upon paccar trademarks.telescan also claimed that paccar tortiously interfered with its business relationships relating to its web sites and internet business.paccar counterclaimed,alleging claims for trademark infringement,unfair competition,false designation of origin,and trademark dilution under the lanham act,and a,c common law unfair competition and dilution and violations of the michigan consumer protection act.comp.laws et.the district court realigned the parties and ordered that the caption show paccar as plaintiff and telescan as defendant.
paccar then moved for preliminary injunctive relief under,seeking an order enjoining telescan from using domain names that incorporate paccar trademarks and from using web sites that convey the impression that the sites are affiliated with or sponsored by paccar.paccar also requested that telescan be required to transfer ownership of the domain names containing peterbilt and kenworth to paccar.telescan defended the motion on the grounds that it made a descriptive or fair use of paccar trademarks.
in,the district court granted paccar motion for a preliminary injunction,concluding that paccar demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on its trademark infringement and trademark dilution claims.it enjoined telescan from using its domain names containing peterbilt or kenworth and ordered telescan to transfer registration of those domain names to paccar.in addition,it enjoined telescan from using the trademarks peterbilt or kenworth in any domain name or metatag and from using the trademarks on its web sites in a way such that it is likely to cause confusion on the part of consumers that the web page is associated with paccar,peterbilt or kenworth,including the use of the trademarks as the title or as wallpaper background of a web page.
telescan appealed from the preliminary injunction and moved this court for an order staying the injunction pending appeal.the motion was denied.

when ruling on a motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court must consider and balance four factors whether the movant has a strong likelihood of success on the merits whether the movant would suffer irreparable injury without the injunction whether issuance of the injunction would cause substantial harm to others and whether the public interest would be served by issuance of the injunction.rock roll hall of fame museum,gentile,cir the only factor that telescan challenges on appeal is paccar likelihood of success on the merits of its trademark infringement and dilution claims.
trademark.likelihood of confusion 
paccar alleges that telescan use of the peterbilt and kenworth marks in its domain names infringes on paccar trademark rights in violation of of the lanham act,which provides a cause of action against a person who use s in commerce any reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion.
the touchstone of liability under is whether the defendant use of the disputed mark is likely to cause confusion among consumers regarding the origin of the goods offered by the parties.daddy junky music stores,big daddy family music,cir.in determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists,we examine eight factors strength of the plaintiff mark relatedness of the goods or services similarity of the marks evidence of actual confusion marketing channels used likely degree of purchaser care intent of the defendant in selecting the mark and likelihood of expansion of the product lines.frisch,elby big boy of steubenville,cir.these factors imply no mathematical precision,and a plaintiff need not show that all,or even most,of the factors listed are present in any particular case to be successful.wynn oil thomas,cir.the ultimate question remains whether relevant consumers are likely to believe that the products or services offered by the parties are affiliated in some way.daddy junky music stores,at.
whether there is a likelihood of confusion is a mixed question of fact and law.wynn oil,at.thus,we review for clear error the findings of fact supporting the existence of the likelihood of confusion factors but review de novo the legal question of whether those foundational facts constitute a likelihood of confusion.id.
domain names as source identifiers 
we first address telescan argument,repeated throughout its briefs,that the district court improperly adopted a per se rule that domain names are always source identifying and did not give adequate weight to the eight likelihood of confusion factors.telescan,however,mischaracterizes the district court opinion.the district court did not adopt a per se rule that every domain name identifies the owner or affiliation of the site.instead,the district court joined many other courts in stating the obvious words in many domain names can and do communicate information as to the source or sponsor of the web site.see,people for the ethical treatment of animals doughney,cir the domain name simply copies peta mark,conveying the message that it is related to peta.brookfield communications,at,the domain name is more than a mere address like trademarks,domain names communicate information as to source when a firm uses a competitor trademark in the domain name of its web site,users are likely to be confused as to its source or sponsorship.panavision int l,toeppen,cir we reject the premise that a domain name is nothing more than an address.a significant purpose of a domain name is to identify the entity that owns the web site.cardservice int l,mcgee,aff,cir a domain name is more than a mere internet address.it also identifies the internet site to those who reach it,much like a company name identifies a specific company.in fact,customers who do not know what a company domain name is will often guess that the domain name is the same as the company name or trademark.green prods.independence corn,see also brookfield,at web users often assume,as a rule of thumb,that the domain name of a particular company will be the company name followed by.sometimes,a trademark is better known than the company itself,in which case a web surfer may assume that the domain address will be trademark.com.panavision int l,at a customer who is unsure about a company domain name will often guess that the domain name is also the company name.
telescan argument distracts from the key issue here whether telescan use of the peterbilt and kenworth trademarks in its domain names is likely to cause confusion among consumers regarding the source or sponsorship of the web sites.in making that determination,the district court properly considered each of the eight frisch restaurants factors.
sufficiency of the factual record 
according to telescan,the factual record is insufficient to support a finding of likelihood of success on the merits of paccar trademark infringement claim.citing data concepts,digital consulting,cir,telescan asserts that this court has been quick to reverse a district court injunction in a trademark infringement case on the basis of the record presented.data concepts,however,involved the entry of summary judgment and permanent injunctive relief telescan appeals a preliminary injunction.we have recognized that the district court,upon a motion for preliminary injunction,must make a decision based upon incomplete factual findings and legal research.even so,that decision is generally accorded a great deal of deference on appellate review.blue cross blue shield,at internal quotation marks omitted 
eight likelihood of confusion factors 
strength of paccar marks 
the district court found that peterbilt and kenworth are very strong marks which have been used nationwide to indicate a certain manufacturer of trucks for decades.both marks were derived from a variation of the names of the original owners and fall into the category of fanciful marks.a fanciful mark is a combination of letters or other symbols signifying nothing other than the product or service to which the mark has been assigned,exxon,kodak.little caesar enters.pizza caesar,cir.fanciful marks are the strongest and most distinctive.daddy junky music stores,at.the more distinct a mark,the more likely is the confusion resulting from its infringement,and therefore,the more protection it is due.id.telescan does not dispute that peterbilt and kenworth are strong marks entitled to protection.
ii.relatedness of goods and services 
the district court found that the goods and services provided by paccar and telescan are closely related.we have identified three categories regarding the relatedness of goods and services 
first,if the parties compete directly by offering their goods or services,confusion is likely if the marks are sufficiently similar second,if the goods or services are somewhat related but not competitive,the likelihood of confusion will turn on other factors third,if the goods or services are totally unrelated,confusion is unlikely.
daddy junky music stores,at.this case fits into the first and second categories.first,both telescan and paccar offer a used truck locator database on the internet.second,even if paccar did not offer a used truck locator database,telescan provides services related to paccar new and used peterbilt and kenworth trucks for sale via the internet.telescan does not dispute that its and paccar goods and services are closely related.
iii.similarity of marks 
finding that telescan domain names are very similar to paccar marks,the district court noted that each domain name contains an exact character match to either the peterbilt or kenworth mark,and that the addition of characters following the mark does not eliminate the likelihood of confusion.telescan asserts that the district court engaged in a comparison with no consideration of the likelihood of confusion within the factual context of this case.
when analyzing similarity,courts should examine the pronunciation,appearance,and verbal translation of conflicting marks.daddy junky music stores,at.a comparison is not the test rather,the marks must be viewed in their entirety and in context and a court must determine,in light of what occurs in the marketplace,whether the mark will be confusing to the public when singly presented.data concepts,at.
excluding the generic or common descriptive words following the mark such as trucks and dealers,see inductotherm,cir stating that descriptive letters,syllables,or phrases are not considered in determining whether two marks are similar,each domain name contains an exact character match to either the peterbilt or kenworth mark.in addition,telescan domain names and the marks are pronounced the same.consideration of the marks in the internet context further supports the district court finding that telescan domain names and paccar trademarks are similar.because all domain names appear in the same font and in all lower case letters,telescan domain names such as and have the same appearance as paccar domain names and.
iv.actual confusion 
while conceding that the absence of any evidence showing actual confusion is not dispositive,telescan argues that the district court erred by giving that absence no weight whatsoever.the district court properly noted the absence of actual confusion evidence and applied this court rule that while such evidence is the best evidence of likelihood of confusion,the absence of actual confusion evidence is inconsequential.see data concepts,at t he lack of evidence of actual confusion is not significant unless the circumstances indicated that such evidence should have been available.
marketing channels 
the district court found that both paccar and telescan market their goods and services through the internet,a marketing channel that increases the likelihood of confusion between the two marks.telescan agrees that both parties operate locator services for peterbilt and kenworth trucks over the internet but asserts that there was little record proof regarding the impact of the internet market as opposed to stores.in brookfield,the ninth circuit explained why simultaneous use of the internet as a marketing tool exacerbates the likelihood of confusion 
in the internet context,in particular,entering a web site takes little one click from a linked site or a search engine list thus,web surfers are more likely to be confused as to the ownership of a web site than traditional patrons of a store would be of a store ownership.
brookfield,at.even in the absence of proof regarding internet marketing effect on consumer confusion,the district court finding that using the internet as a marketing channel increases the likelihood of confusion is not clearly erroneous.
telescan also contends that the district court erred in discounting the disclaimer included on its web sites.the district court found that telescan disclaimer does not remedy the confusion caused by the use of paccar trademarks in its domain names.an infringing domain name has the potential to misdirect consumers as they search for web sites associated with the owner of a trademark.a disclaimer disavowing affiliation with the trademark owner read by a consumer after reaching the web site comes too late.this initial interest confusion is recognized as an infringement under the lanham act.see eli lilly natural answers,cir such confusion,which is actionable under the lanham act,occurs when a consumer is lured to a product by its similarity to a known mark,even though the consumer realizes the true identity and origin of the product before consummating a purchase.brookfield,at t he use of another trademark in a manner calculated to capture initial consumer attention,even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of the confusion,may be still an infringement.green prods.at due to the nature of internet use,defendant appropriation of plaintiff s mark as a domain name and home page address can not adequately be remedied by a disclaimer.defendant domain name and home page address are external labels that,on their face,cause confusion among internet users and may cause internet users who seek plaintiff s web site to expend time and energy accessing defendant web site.
vi.customer care 
the district court found that the relevant customer is an average internet user and that the confusion caused by an infringing domain name results because internet users do not undergo a highly sophisticated analysis when searching for domain names.quoting green prods.at.telescan contends that the district court analysis is flawed in two respects.
first,it claims that the district court failed to give any weight to telescan argument that truck buyers are sophisticated purchasers.we have recognized that 
g enerally,in assessing the likelihood of confusion to the public,the standard used by the courts is the typical buyer exercising ordinary caution.however,when a buyer has expertise or is otherwise more sophisticated with respect to the purchase of the services at issue,a higher standard is proper.similarly,when services are expensive or unusual,the buyer can be expected to exercise greater care in her purchases.when services are sold to such buyers,other things being equal,there is less likelihood of confusion.
homeowners group,home mktg.specialists,cir.telescan asserts that the heavy trucks manufactured by paccar are expensive and would be purchased ordinarily by a sophisticated buyer,indicating a lesser likelihood of confusion.
second,telescan contends that even if internet users do not engage in a sophisticated analysis to find a particular site,they learn not to tarry long at sites that do not supply the information they seek.paccar responds that even though an internet user may not tarry long,an infringing domain name leads to initial interest confusion when the user is misdirected to the wrong site.see brookfield,at.initial interest confusion afflicts sophisticated internet users no less than it does unsophisticated users.obh,spotlight magazine,d.
the district court finding regarding customer care in the internet context is not clearly erroneous.in any event,if marks are similar,as they are here,then purchaser care will decrease the likelihood of confusion only minimally.daddy junky music stores,at that is,confusingly similar marks may lead a purchaser who is extremely careful and knowledgeable about the product he is buying to assume nonetheless that the seller is affiliated with or identical to the other party.see also,at being skilled in their own art does not necessarily preclude their mistaking one trademark for another when the marks are as similar as those here in issue,and cover merchandise in the same general field.citation omitted.
vii.telescan intent 
telescan contends that the district court rejected the record evidence that its intent was not to deceive but to insure that its web sites could be readily located by customers and dealers looking for information on peterbilt and kenworth trucks.telescan,however,cites no evidence on this point other than its bald assertions of lack of intent.regardless,t he lack of intent by a defendant is largely irrelevant in determining if consumers likely will be confused as to source.daddy junky music stores,at intent is an issue whose resolution may benefit only the cause of a senior user,not of an alleged infringer.
direct evidence of intentional copying is not necessary to prove intent.id.at.there are two reasons for inferring intent here.first,the use of a contested mark with knowledge of the protected mark at issue can support a finding of intentional copying.id.telescan knew that the peterbilt and kenworth marks were associated with trucks manufactured by paccar and used the marks in its domain names so that dealers and other customers could easily access its web sites to find peterbilt and kenworth trucks.second,the nature of telescan use of the marks on its web sites,such as including the marks in its domain names,repeating the marks in watermarks,and mimicking the distinctive scripts of the marks,indicates an intent to create the impression that the web sites are sponsored by or affiliated with paccar.
viii.expansion into product lines 
the parties agree,as did the district court,that this factor is irrelevant because telescan and paccar already compete in the same field of providing used truck locator services via the internet.
conclusion 
the ninth circuit has held that in the internet context,similarity of the marks,relatedness of the goods or services,and simultaneous use of the internet as a marketing channel are the three most important factors in finding a likelihood of confusion.walt disney,cir citing brookfield,at.here,telescan domain names are very similar to paccar marks.both telescan and paccar offer used truck locator services via the internet.consideration of these three factors,as well as the other five,compels the conclusion that paccar has demonstrated a likelihood of confusion and thus a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its trademark infringement claim.
telescan defenses 
in its defense,telescan uses the terms fair use,nominative fair use,and first sale interchangeably.as these are distinct concepts,we will address them separately.
the fair use defense permits a party use,otherwise than as a mark,of a term which is descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe the goods or services of such party.b.telescan argues that the domain names containing paccar trademarks truthfully identify the trucks available through its web sites and that this use is a descriptive or fair use.
in support of this argument,telescan relies on rock and roll hall of fame and museum,gentile productions,cir.in rock and roll hall of fame,this court vacated a preliminary injunction,in part because the defendant use of the words rock and roll hall of fame in his photograph of the museum might constitute a fair use of the museum mark.the court stated that a critical question would be whether the defendant use was otherwise than as a trade mark.id.at.the answer to that question would essentially turn on whether consumers view the words,rock n roll hall of fame,as a label for the defendant photograph,or as an indicator that the defendant photograph originated with or was sponsored by the museum.as always,the touchstone will be the likelihood of consumer confusion.id.emphasis added 
rock and roll hall of fame supports the district court rejection of telescan fair use defense.a consideration of the eight likelihood of confusion factors leads to the conclusion that telescan use of paccar trademarks in its domain names creates a strong likelihood of confusion regarding the source of the web sites.based on the language from rock and roll hall of fame,such a co
