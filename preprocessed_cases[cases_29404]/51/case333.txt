appellant david lahoti appeals from the district court finding,on remand,that he violated the lanham act,the anticybersquatting consumer protection act acpa,the washington consumer protection act wcpa,and washington common law.the appeal turns in significant part on whether the district court followed this court instructions on remand in finding that respondent vericheck,vericheck mark is suggestive,and thus entitled to trademark protection.we find that the district court did follow our remand instructions and that its resulting findings were not clearly erroneous.
background 
the underlying facts of this case are set out in detail in lahoti vericheck,cir,and will not be repeated here.in that case,we affirmed the district court finding that lahoti acted in bad faith.id.at.we included a detailed discussion of the principles involved in differentiating between suggestive,distinctive and descriptive trademarks.id.at.following that discussion,we held that,w hile the district court perhaps could have relied exclusively on the registration of the arizona mark to determine suggestiveness,it did not do so,but instead improperly required that the mark describe all of vericheck services,examined the mark in the abstract,and concluded that it could not analyze the mark component parts.id.at.accordingly,we vacated the district court judgment and remanded.id.we did not reach the district court conclusions that vericheck established all other elements of its trademark infringement,acpa,and wcpa claims,and that vericheck was entitled to attorneys fees.id.
on remand,the district court considered our opinion and briefing it did not augment the record.in its amended findings of fact and conclusions of law,the district court discussed the principles we articulated,and concluded,again,that the vericheck mark is suggestive.the court further found that the mark is strong and entitled to protection.the court concluded that lahoti had violated the acpa,and found that lahoti use of the mark constituted infringement.the court again held that lahoti violated the wcpa,and that vericheck was entitled to an injunction,the maximum statutory damages,and attorneys fees and costs.
lahoti again appealed.

distinctiveness of the vericheck mark 
the main issue in this appeal is whether the district court properly found that vericheck mark is distinctive vericheck can not prevail on its trademark claims unless its disputed mark is distinctive.lahoti,at.a suggestive mark is inherently distinctive,but a descriptive mark that lacks secondary meaning is not distinctive and is not entitled to trademark protection.id.citing two pesos,taco cabana.on remand,the district court agreed with vericheck that the mark is suggestive,not descriptive.
lahoti argues that the district court repeated the same errors on remand that it made initially,demonstrating a failure to analyze the vericheck mark in its industry context.in the original appeal,we noted three errors.first,the district court seemed to require that,in order to be considered descriptive,the vericheck mark would have to describe the broad array of electronic transaction processing services that vericheck provides.lahoti,at.second,the district court found that the vericheck mark could have described services unrelated to those offered by vericheck,when in fact the mark must be evaluated as if it were seen on the goods or services.id.internal quotation marks omitted.and third,the district court improperly declined lahoti request that the mark be broken down into its component parts.id.we conclude that the district court rectified these errors on remand.
analyzing the case anew on remand,the district court indisputably recited the relevant legal principles that we set out.the district court then went on to find that,w hen viewed in the context of vericheck services,whether in whole or in part,including vericheck check verification services,the vericheck mark does not immediately convey information about the nature of vericheck services.the district court explained that,in reaching its conclusion,it considered the component parts of the vericheck mark as a preliminary step on the way to an ultimate determination of the probable consumer reaction to the composite as a whole.thus,the district court conducted its analysis as instructed.
moreover,the holding that it reached as a result of that analysis was not clearly erroneous.if consumer response requires any sort of multistage reasoning process to identify the characteristic of the product which the mark suggests,then the mark should not be regarded as merely descriptive.louis altman malla pollack,callmann on unfair competition,trademark and monopolies ed.supp.here,for example,consumers must separate veri from check and reason that veri is short for verification services.in addition,similar marks have been found to be suggestive.see,pilot of am,d,holding that magna doodle is only suggestive of children magnetic drawing toy,noting that it requires some imagination to get from magna to magnetic in re shutts,bna,holding that is not merely descriptive of snow removal tool levi strauss josephs sportswear,bna,holding that action slacks is suggestive of pants made of stretchy fabric.
moreover,the district court based its holding that the vericheck mark is distinctive not only on its own analysis of distinctiveness,but also on the pto issuance of a trademark to the arizona company,also for check verification services.in the first appeal,we agree d with the district court that the pto registration of the arizona mark is evidence of the disputed mark distinctiveness,given the strong similarity between the appearance and purposes of the arizona mark and the disputed mark.lahoti,at.we explained that,while a statutory presumption of distinctiveness only applies when the same mark has been registered,courts may also defer to the pto registration of highly similar marks.id.
lahoti argues,however,that the district court erred by failing to consider material changes in fact and law since to the extent that this argument was not foreclosed by our assertion in the first appeal that the district court perhaps could have relied exclusively on the registration of the arizona mark to determine suggestiveness,id.at,it is nonetheless unavailing.lahoti claims that there has been a legal trend in the past years to treat similar marks as descriptive.but three federal trademark registrations that lahoti raises for the first time on,registration verifone,registration and,registration,his argument.if those similar marks were not distinctive,the pto would not have registered them on the principal register.in addition,we noted in the last appeal that the parties did not present any evidence with regard to whether technological changes impact the interpretation of the arizona mark.id.at.finally,the pto has completed its initial examination of vericheck application to register vericheck and has approved it for publication for opposition,indicating that the pto still considers the mark distinctive 
we owe a great deal of deference to the district court trademark classification.the district court initial conclusion was based in part on reasoning that is contrary to federal trademark law.id.at.on remand,it recited the correct law,and it applied that law properly.accordingly,the district court conclusion that the mark is distinctive is affirmed.see also id.at noting only a handful of published opinions in the past forty yea
