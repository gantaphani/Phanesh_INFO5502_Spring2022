plaintiff daimlerchrysler moved for summary judgment on its consumer protection act acpa claim,arguing that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the defendants violated the acpa by their registration of the domain name.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment to the plaintiff.the district court also permanently enjoined the defendants from any further use of the foradodge name,ordered that the domain name be transferred to the plaintiff,and struck the defendants third party claims against the united states in which they alleged that the acpa provided for an unlawful taking in violation of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.the defendants appeal from all of the above holdings and orders of the district court.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
daimlerchrysler manufactures,sells,and services automotive vehicles,service parts,repair parts,and accessories for past and current automotive vehicles.daimlerchrysler also licenses others to make and sell models,replicas,and other items associated with its automobiles.since,daimlerchrysler has employed the dodge mark to identify one or more of its products or services.in addition,the dodge mark has been registered as a trademark since.as early as,daimlerchrysler advertised and used as a toll free telephone number.in september,daimlerchrysler registered the domain name.com with network solutions,and established a website using the domain name.
in late,defendant maydak,who was incarcerated in federal prison at the time,asked defendant michael sussman to register the domain name for him.on december,sussman registered the domain name with network solutions.rather than using his or maydak name as the registrant,sussman listed the registrant as the net.by the defendants own admission,however,there is no such corporate entity rather,the net is an unincorporated association between defendants maydak and sussman.in addition to registering,maydak also registered the domain name.maydak claims that he planned to use the domain name to establish a website that described his dodging services such as asset protection,tax and creditor avoidance,and ways to bypass society general paradigm.
the defendants have not limited their registration of domain names to merely those that potentially interfere with the dodge mark.rather,they have registered dozen of other domain names that are quite similar to various other trademarks,including,and,among others.moreover,the defendants have registered domain names that are substantially similar to various united states governmental institutions,agencies,and departments,including,and,among others.
from at least february,and possibly as early as december,to about october,the defendants pointed the domain name to a website that contained a link to a pornographic website.
i.we first consider whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the plaintiff on its acpa claim.

in,congress passed the acpa as an amendment to the trademark act of lanham act to prohibit cybersquatting.as the district court noted,cybersquatting occurs when a person other than the trademark holder registers the domain name of a well known trademark and then attempts to profit from this by either ransoming the domain name back to the trademark holder or by using the domain name to divert business from the trademark holder to the domain name holder.see sporty farm sportsman market,cir.a trademark owner asserting a claim under the acpa must establish the following it has a valid trademark entitled to protection its mark is distinctive or famous the defendant domain name is identical or confusingly similar to,or in the case of famous marks,dilutive of,the owner mark and the defendant used,registered,or trafficked in the domain name with a bad faith intent to profit.ford motor catalanotte,cir.
because the defendants appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment only on the grounds that the district court erred when it found that the mark qualifies as a protected trademark under the acpa,and the defendants had a bad faith intent to profit when it registered the domain name,we need only consider these two arguments,which implicate the first and fifth elements necessary to establish an acpa claim 
the district court first considered whether plaintiff dodge and marks were entitled to trademark protection.under the lanham act,a trademark is defined as any word,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof used by a person to identify and distinguish his or her goods,including a unique product from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of goods,even if that source is unknown.a trademark need not be registered to be entitled to protection under the acpa.see stores,samara,d two pesos,taco cabana,d.rather,the general principles qualifying a mark for registration under the act are for the most part applicable in determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection.two pesos,at.the provision governing registration under the act requires that registration be granted to any trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others subject to various limited exceptions.stores,at.quoting.
the district court noted that there is no dispute that plaintiff dodge mark is entitled to protection.the dodge mark has been registered since and has been in continuous use since.the district court also noted that the plaintiff registration of the mark entitled it to a presumption that the mark is valid,and that the continuous use of the mark for over five years after registration renders the mark incontestable.see id.at.the district court then considered whether the plaintiff mark,although not registered,is entitled to trademark protection under the acpa.the district court noted the following 
this mark,which incorporates plaintiff incontestable dodge mark,has been used by the plaintiff to distinguish its automobiles for a number of years.as early as,plaintiff advertised and used as a toll free telephone number.plaintiff has also used the.com website since.
the defendants allege that is not entitled to protection as a trademark because the plaintiff merely uses the mark in a telephone number and as a website.unlike companies such as,the defendants contend,the plaintiff does not use its telephone number or website address as a business name or slogan,and thus it should not receive protection as a trademark.
even if there were a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the plaintiff has a valid trademark in,the district court also concluded that the defendants domain name was confusingly similar to the plaintiff distinctive and famous dodge mark.the district court noted that the foradodge domain name simply incorporates plaintiff protected mark into a prepositional phrase.courts generally have held that a domain name that incorporates a trademark is confusingly similar to that mark if consumers might think that the domain name is used,approved,or permitted by the mark holder.ford motor,d,quoting harrods sixty internet domain names,d.moreover,courts have consistently found that slight differences between domain names and registered marks,such as the addition of minor or generic words to the disputed domain names are irrelevant.ford motor,d at internal quotations omitted holding that marks incorporated into the domain name
