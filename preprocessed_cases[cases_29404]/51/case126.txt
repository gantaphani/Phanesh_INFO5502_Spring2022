this trademark infringement case presents several issues regarding the appropriate relief that may be granted under the lanham act,specifically authorizing injunctive relief and authorizing monetary relief.
georgia pacific consumer products lp owns the trademark enmotion,which it uses to brand a dispenser that dispenses paper towels when a motion sensor is triggered by the user.georgia pacific designed its enmotion dispenser to dispense only paper towels that it manufactured.
von drehle corporation,a north carolina corporation that competes with georgia pacific in the sale of paper towels,designed a less expensive paper towel the b paper towel that it sold specifically for use in georgia pacific enmotion towel dispensers.
in response to von drehle practice of selling its b paper towels for stuffing into enmotion towel dispensers,georgia pacific commenced three separate actions against von drehle or its distributors.each action alleged that the stuffing practice constituted contributory trademark infringement of georgia pacific enmotion mark,in violation of the lanham act,a.specifically,in this action,georgia pacific claimed that von drehle knowingly and intentionally manufactured the b paper towel specifically and solely for use in georgia pacific enmotion towel dispensers and that the practice of stuffing enmotion dispensers with the b paper towel was likely to cause confusion and deceive end user customers.in january,a jury agreed that von drehle conduct constituted contributory trademark infringement and,as requested at closing argument,awarded georgia pacific,which represented all of the profits that von drehle earned from the sale of its b paper towels from to the date of trial.after the jury returned its verdict,the district court entered a permanent,nationwide injunction prohibiting von drehle from directly or indirectly infringing georgia pacific trademark rights.in addition,because the court found that von drehle infringement was willful and intentional,it trebled the jury award from to awarded georgia pacific attorneys fees in the amount of and awarded it prejudgment interest in the amount of.finally,the court awarded georgia pacific in court costs.
in a parallel action that georgia pacific commenced in the western district of arkansas against one of von drehle distributors,the district court had,by the time of the trial in this action,already ruled against georgia pacific,concluding that the practice of stuffing von drehle b paper towel into georgia pacific enmotion dispensers did not create a likelihood of confusion,georgia pacific consumer prod.lp myers supply,cv,wl,at.july,and the eighth circuit affirmed,cir holding that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the trademark on a dispenser does not indicate the source of the paper towels inside,and concluding that there was no likelihood of confusion,and thus no trademark infringement.
in the second parallel action,which georgia pacific commenced against one of von drehle distributors in the northern district of ohio,the district court had,by the time of the trial in this action,also ruled against georgia pacific.the court held that the arkansas judgment precluded georgia pacific from relitigating its trademark infringement claim,see georgia pacific consumer prods.lp four u packaging,d,and the sixth circuit affirmed,cir.
on appeal from the remedies award in this case,von drehle challenges the geographical scope of the district court injunction,arguing that the eighth and sixth circuits rulings against georgia pacific render the injunction entered by the district court unduly broad.it also challenges the monetary awards,contending that the district court applied the wrong legal standards for trebling the jury award and for awarding attorneys fees and prejudgment interest.
because we agree with von drehle,we reverse the district court judgment in part and vacate and remand in part,with instructions.as to the injunction,we instruct the district court to narrow it to cover only the geographical area of the fourth circuit.as to the monetary awards,we reverse the treble damages award and instruct the district court to reinstate the jury award of we vacate the award of attorneys fees and remand for application of the appropriate standard and we reverse the award of prejudgment interest.
in,after learning of von drehle practice of stuffing or causing to be stuffed georgia pacific enmotion towel dispensers with von drehle b paper towels,georgia pacific sent von drehle a letter d emand ing that von drehle immediately cease and desist marketing,selling and distributing the towel.von drehle rejected georgiapacific demand,stating that it considered its conduct to be legitimate competition that did not infringe georgia pacific enmotion trademark.
georgia pacific thereafter commenced this action,alleging that von drehle stuffing practices constituted contributory trademark infringement,in violation of the lanham act,a.it alleged that von drehle knowingly and intentionally manufactured or directed the manufacture and sold or directed the sale of finished paper towel rolls designed specifically and solely for use in enmotion dispensers,and that this practice was likely to cause confusion and to deceive end user customers georgia pacific sought injunctive relief,an accounting of von drehle profits,and damages.
the district court granted von drehle motion for summary judgment,concluding that georgia pacific had failed to show that von drehle sale of its b paper towel roll to distributors for use in enmotion dispensers caused consumer confusion.georgia pacific consumer,prods.lp von drehle,d.the court considered the in this context to be those business owners who purchase d paper towel rolls from distributors for the enmotion dispensers installed in their premises,a class of consumers who kn e w exactly from which company they were purchasing the paper towel rolls.id.at.by order dated august,we reversed and remanded,holding that the district court erred in limiting its likelihood of confusion inquiry to distributors who purchased b toweling and their respective customers,such as hotels.georgia pacific consumer,lp von drehle,cir.we pointed out that fourth circuit case law makes room for the factfinder to consider confusion among the public in the inquiry.id.
on remand,von drehle filed a motion seeking judgment as a matter of law,arguing that the decision of the western district of arkansas,which rejected georgia pacific infringement claims,should preclude georgia pacific from advancing those same claims in this case.the district court,however,denied von drehle motion and set the matter for trial,explaining that von drehle had inordinately delayed raising its preclusion argument.
at the trial,georgia pacific presented its case to the jury for contributory trademark infringement and requested injunctive relief and disgorgement of von drehle profits.at closing argument to the jury,counsel for georgia pacific stated 
so what we want is for von drehle to quit doing it,and we want damages.the damages we want and i think from the judge instructions you will find if we prevail we are entitled to this is for them to give up the profits that they made selling paper to put into our trademarked dispenser.and the only number in the record on that is in plaintiff exhibit summarizing von drehle annual gross profits from the sale of b paper towels from through.they made a profit of from the time that they put it on the market in through.and that what we asking you for,the profits,give us the profits that you made trading on our name and our trademark.so i submit to you when you get back there and you go through all these packages,get to the verdict form,the first question is,have we proven trademark infringement yes.the second question is,what are the damages.
emphasis added.just as georgia pacific counsel requested,the jury returned a verdict answering yes to the question whether von drehle infringed georgia pacific trademark and awarding georgia pacific when the cease and desist letter came out jan.because exhibit,to which counsel referred at closing argument,included profit for in the amount of,which was earned before the cease and desist letter was sent,the jury apparently subtracted that sum from the amount requested to arrive at its award of.the jury thus awarded georgia pacific of the profits that it requested for the period beginning with its letter in january and ending in december.
following trial,von drehle renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law based on claim and issue preclusion,and the district court granted it,vacating the jury verdict and entering judgment for von drehle.georgia pacific consumer prods.lp von drehle,d.the court explained 
the question submitted to the jury in this case was whether plaintiff established by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant infringed on plaintiff valid trademark.the jury responded to this question in the affirmative.however,because another court had previously decided this same question in the negative,this court now holds that defendant should be permitted to raise the affirmative defense of claim and issue preclusion and that judgment as a matter of law is appropriate.
id.at citation omitted.on appeal,we again reversed,concluding that von drehle had waived its preclusion defenses and that the district court abused its discretion by allowing von drehle to assert its preclusion defenses months after the substantive basis for those defenses was known to von drehle.georgia pacific consumer,lp von drehle,cir,cert.denied,d.we remanded the case with instructions to reinstate the jury verdict and to consider the other relief that georgia pacific had requested.id.
on remand,the district court granted georgia pacific the injunctive relief it requested and,finding von drehle infringement to have been willful and intentional,trebled the jury verdict,awarded attorneys fees,and awarded prejudgment interest.including court costs,the total monetary award amounted to.
from the judgment entered on july,von drehle filed this appeal,challenging the geographical scope of the injunction and each monetary award except court costs.
as part of the relief granted,the district court entered a permanent,nationwide injunction prohibiting von drehle from interfering directly or indirectly with georgia pacific trademark rights,which,the court stated,included the right of georgia pacific to enforce the use of only their paper towel products in their enmotion dispensers.georgia pacific consumer prods.lp von drehle,cv bo,wl,at july.von drehle contends that the district court should not have issued a nationwide injunction that conflict s with the decisions of other circuits and that undermine s the prerogatives of courts of appeals that have yet to address the relevant legal issues.as noted,both the eighth and the sixth circuits have concluded that georgia pacific may not enforce its enmotion mark to prohibit the practice of stuffing von drehle b paper towels into enmotion towel dispensers.see myers supply,at four u packaging,at.
we review the scope of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.see tuttle arlington cnty.sch,cir.
neither party contends that a district court,as a general matter,lacks authority to issue a nationwide injunction prohibiting trademark infringement.see a see also.soc y for human life,fec,cir nationwide injunctions are appropriate if necessary to afford relief to the prevailing party,abrogation on other grounds recognized in real truth about abortion,fec,cir richmond tenants,kemp,cir holding that a nationwide injunction was appropriately tailored to prevent irreparable injury where the various plaintiffs resided in different parts of the country see also united states amc entm t,cir t he court has the power to enforce the terms of the injunction outside the territorial jurisdiction of the court,including issuing a nationwide injunction.nonetheless,equity requires that injunctions be carefully tailored,especially where,as here,questions of comity are involved.see.soc y,at amc entm t,at principles of comity require that,once a sister circuit has spoken to an issue,that pronouncement is the law of that geographical area id.at courts ordinarily should not award injunctive relief that would cause substantial interference with another court sovereignty.
within the states comprising the eighth and sixth circuits,courts of appeals have held that georgia pacific may not enforce its enmotion mark to prohibit the stuffing of von drehle b paper towels into enmotion towel dispensers.for us to now countenance an injunction that would give georgia pacific the right to enforce its mark in those states would amount to a direct and unseemly affront to those courts.and such an affront would only be exacerbated in light of our earlier ruling,where we refused to recognize their decisions due to von drehle tardiness.in addition,upholding the nationwide injunction would,as a practical matter,create a direct and perhaps irreconcilable conflict as to georgia pacific trademark rights in the eighth and sixth circuits,leaving litigants and others in those states confused.as a matter of comity,therefore,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in extending the injunction to those jurisdictions,and accordingly we will not authorize its enforcement within the eighth and sixth circuits.
the question remains whether we should nonetheless authorize the injunction to operate within those circuits that have not yet had occasion to consider these issues.courts in circuits other than the eighth and sixth now face a significant split of authority regarding the enforceability of georgia pacific enmotion trademark in the context of von drehle stuffing practices.were georgia pacific to commence identical litigation against von drehle or one of its distributors in the first circuit,for example,that court would be faced with the question of whether to follow the fourth circuit on the one hand or the eighth and sixth circuits on the other.because the forum court should be free to resolve this question,comity also requires that we not allow the injunction to extend to the remaining circuits.soc y,at refusing to issue an injunction that would have encroache d on the ability of other circuits to consider an important legal question and impos ed our view of the law on all the other circuits.
georgia pacific challenges this conclusion on two grounds.first,it contends that von drehle waived any challenge to the scope of the injunction because it failed to present the argument to the district court.the record,however,belies this contention.in response to georgia pacific motion for a permanent injunction,von drehle argued to the district court that the judgment against it has created a significant split with the sixth and eighth circuits and that the district court can not and should not enter any injunction which impacts the sixth and eighth circuit decisions.in addition,at the hearing before the district court on the motion,von drehle pointed out that the eighth circuit and the sixth circuit have found that this conduct is not infringement and accordingly maintained that,to the extent the court is going to grant an injunction,the injunction needs to take into account those rulings.finally,it is clear that the district court was fully aware of von drehle argument,as indicated by its remark to georgia pacific attorney during the same hearing that this injunction ca go into ohio and tennessee where you lost.it can only hold water where you won.
second,georgia pacific argues that there is no basis for von drehle claim that the injunction interferes with the myers or four u rulings because n either decision determined the rights of von drehle,which was not a party to either case.but such an argument takes a far too technical view of this case,especially when considering the comity issues involved.even though there was not a precise identity of parties,the fact remains that georgia pacific has been given the right to enforce its trademark against von drehle stuffing practices in the fourth circuit and has been denied that right in the eighth and sixth circuits.
accordingly,for the sake of comity,we require,under the unique circumstances of this case,that the injunction be limited geographically to the states in this circuit.we therefore vacate the injunction granted by the district court and remand with instructions to modify it in accordance with this opinion.
in response to georgia pacific request for treble damages,the district court observed that an award of treble damages is appropriate when there has been a finding of willful or intentional infringement.georgia pacific,wl,at citing larsen terk techs,cir.after noting that von drehle president had testified that von drehle b towels were specifically designed to fit the georgia pacific enmotion dispensers and that he knew that they would be stuffed into enmotion dispensers,the court concluded that von drehle infringement was willful and intentional.relying on larsen,it accordingly trebled the jury award of to.
von drehle contends that the district court erred in applying the willful and intentional standard from larsen because larsen applied to a recovery under b,which requires a court to treble damages for a knowing and intentional use of a counterfeit mark.this case,however,involves a recovery of profits under a,and therefore,von drehle argues,the court is authorized to adjust the jury award only if it deems the recovery to be inadequate or excessive,and then only to compensate the plaintiff,not to punish the defendant.
georgia pacific argues that although larsen interprets b,it is hardly irrelevant in this case because the counterfeiting claims addressed by b provide a close parallel to the claims at issue here.and it contends that whatever the basis of the plaintiff proven injury profits,damages,or both the statute expressly permits the court to award a greater sum.
we agree with von drehle that,by relying on larsen and awarding treble damages for willful and intentional infringement,the district court erroneously conflated a and b.
monetary relief for trademark infringement is provided for in,and each type of monetary award is categorized with particularity and separately addressed.section a,which applies generally to trademark infringement cases and which the parties agree applies in this case,authorizes a plaintiff to recover the defendant profits based simply on proof of the defendant sales the plaintiff damages court costs and in exceptional cases,attorneys fees.the section also sets forth the criteria and standards for awarding each type of recovery.as to a recovery based on the defendant profits,a provides 
in assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove defendant sales only defendant must prove all elements of cost or deduction claimed if the court shall find that the amount of the recovery based on profits is either inadequate or excessive,the court may in its discretion enter judgment for such sum as the court shall find to be just,according to the circumstances of the case.such sum shall constitute compensation and not a penalty.
and as to a recovery based on the plaintiff damages,which the statute distinguishes from an award based on the defendant profits,a provides 
in assessing damages the court may enter judgment,according to the circumstances of the case,for any sum above the amount found as actual damages,not exceeding three times such amount such sum shall constitute compensation and not a penalty.
section b,on the other hand,mandates the award of treble profits or treble damages for a defendant use of a counterfeit mark if the infringement consists of intentionally using a mark or designation,knowing such mark or designation is a counterfeit mark,or providing goods or services using such mark,with the intent that the recipient of the goods or services would put the goods or services to use in committing the violation.b emphasis added.this section also authorizes a court to award prejudgment interest for such a violation.thus,b,by providing for heightened monetary awards,reflects the fact that use of a counterfeit mark is the most blatant and egregious form of passing off.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.
section provides vastly different legal standards,based on the egregiousness of the offense,for determining when a district court can modify an award distinguishing an award for knowingly and intentionally using a counterfeit mark from an award for using a noncounterfeit mark.the district court therefore erred in relying on larsen,a case involving a counterfeit mark,to award treble damages here.
nor can georgia pacific seek to justify the award of treble damages under the plain language of a.under that section,when a plaintiff seeks recovery based on a defendant profits,the court may adjust the jury verdict up or down,but only if it finds the amount of recovery to be either inadequate or excessive,and then only insofar as the adjustment is determined to be just and compensatory,not punitive.accord thompson haynes,by the terms of the statute,damages are to be treated separately from profits.as for damages,the court may award up to three times actual damages,depending on the circumstances of the case.as for profits,however,the court is not authorized to award up to three times the amount proved.for profits,the court is constrained to award the amount proved,subject only to an adjustment,up or down,where the recovery would be otherwise unjust badger meter,grinnell,cir s ection a provides two methods which the district court can utilize separately or in combination to approximate a fair recovery for the plaintiff.the first discretionary method is to award up to three times the damages plaintiff can actually prove the second discretionary method allows the court to award the plaintiff such sum as the court shall find to be just,according to the circumstances of the case,and is premised on the finding that recovery based on defendant profits is either inadequate or excessive alteration in original quoting a.
in this case,georgia pacific requested a recovery consisting only of von drehle profits,and the jury granted that request.as counsel for georgia pacific told the jury,t he damages we want is for them to give up the profits that they made selling knock off paper to put into our trademarked dispenser t hat what we asking you for,the profits,give us the profits that you made trading on our name and our trademarks.indeed,it is uncontroverted that georgia pacific only claim for monetary relief in this case was based on von drehle profits.and,as noted,when a recovery is based on the defendant profits,a gives the district court the limited discretion to increase the award only when and to the extent it deems the award to be inadequate to compensate the plaintiff for the defendant profits.here,there would be no basis for the district court to conclude that the jury award was inadequate to compensate georgia pacific because the jury gave georgia pacific virtually all that it sought.moreover,georgia pacific has never argued that the jury award of profits was inadequate.since enhancement of a profits recovery is the only avenue through which georgia pacific could have obtained additional monetary relief under a,the district court erred in awarding treble damages,which are punitive and are not authorized by a for a recovery based on profits.
georgia pacific argues that von drehle has waived any argument that treble damages were illegally awarded,contending that von drehle did not present the issue to the district court.again,the record belies this contention.in response to georgia pacific request for treble damages,von drehle pointed out to the district court that enhanced damages were not appropriate because t his case was submitted to the jury on georgia pacific request for an award of von drehle profits and georgia pacific had presented no evidence that the verdict amount was insufficient to compensate it,and it referred the court directly to a.while von drehle may not have presented this argument in as detailed a fashion as it has to us on appeal,it nonetheless preserved its point for appeal.
accordingly,we reverse the district court order awarding treble damages and direct the court to enter judgment in the amount awarded by the jury,which constitutes von drehle profits from the sale of its b paper towels from january,through the end of.
the district court also awarded georgia pacific attorneys fees of,finding that von drehle willful and intentional infringement rendered this case exceptional,as that term is used in a.georgia pacific,wl,at.section a provides,the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.emphasis added.the court based its finding on the fact that von drehle specifically designed its b paper towels for use in georgia pacific enmotion dispenser and knew that they would be stuffed in those dispensers.
von drehle contends that this case is not exceptional,as that term is used in a,and that the district court erroneously relied on its purposeful conduct in distributing towels for use in georgia pacific enmotion machines,conflating willful and intentional conduct with willful and intentional infringement.we agree,especially since von drehle reasonably believed that its conduct was lawful.
we have defined the exceptional case for purposes of a as one in which the defendant conduct was malicious,fraudulent,willful or deliberate in nature.retail,freebies publ g,cir quoting peta doughney,cir.but,in this context,the word willful does not mean that the defendant actions were merely volitional,but rather that the defendant acted with the intent to infringe the plaintiff protected mark.see,in re outsidewall tire,d,w illfulness means more than simply that the act of infringement was done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of accident or other innocent reason internal quotation marks and citation omitted vanwyk textile,zimmer mach,willfulness in performing the act does not necessarily mean willfulness in violating the law.willfulness in violating the law may qualify the case as exceptional citation omitted accord badger meter,at we do not agree that intentionally copying a competitor product,even if this is later determined to involve trade dress infringement,by itself constitutes willful infringement.pig stands,hard rock cafe int l,cir noting that the attorneys fees provision in a has been interpreted by courts to require a showing of a high degree of culpability on the part of the infringer.to affirm the district court application of its volitional standard would mean that every lanham act case would qualify as exceptional unless the defendant could show that it unintentionally or mistakenly performed the actions later found to be a violation of the act.
more importantly,after the court had received the parties briefs in this case,the supreme court handed down its decision in octane fitness,llc icon health fitness,d.while octane fitness did not construe a,it did construe a parallel and identical provision in the patent act,which provides,the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.the federal circuit had previously given a narrow interpretation,concluding 
a case may be deemed exceptional when there has been some material inappropriate conduct related to the matter in litigation,such as willful infringement,fraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the patent,misconduct during litigation,vexatious or unjustified litigation,conduct that violates,or like infractions.absent misconduct in conduct of the litigation or in securing the patent,sanctions may be imposed against the patentee only if both the litigation is brought in subjective bad faith,and the litigation is objectively baseless.
brooks furniture,dutailier int l,citation omitted.but the supreme court rejected the federal circuit interpretation of exceptional,describing the federal circuit test as unduly rigid.octane fitness.at.relying on the statute simple text and dictionary definitions of exceptional,the court concluded 
a n exceptional case is simply one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party litigating position considering both the governing law and the facts of the case or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.district courts may determine whether a case is exceptional in the exercise of their discretion,considering the totality of the circumstances.
id.at.the court then pointed the district courts to the same nonexclusive list of factors that it had previously identified as relevant for use in determining whether to award attorneys fees under a similar provision of the copyright act,a list that included frivolousness,motivation,objective unreasonableness both in the factual and legal components of the case and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.id.at quoting fogerty fantasy,d internal quotation marks omitted.
to be sure,the octane fitness court did not interpret the attorneys fees provision of a.but the language of a and is identical,and we conclude that there is no reason not to apply the octane fitness standard when considering the award of attorneys fees under a.see fair wind sailing,dempster,cir while octane fitness directly concerns the scope of a district court discretion to award fees for an exceptional case under of the patent act,the case controls our interpretation of a.not only is identical to a,but congress referenced in passing a.
thus,we conclude that a district court may find a case exceptional and therefore award attorneys fees to the prevailing party under a when it determines,in light of the totality of the circumstances,that there is an unusual discrepancy in the merits of the positions taken by the parties,fair wind sailing,at,based on the party position as either frivolous or objectively unreasonable,see octane fitness.at the party has litigated the case in an unreasonable manner,fair wind sailing,at quoting octane fitness.at or there is otherwise the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deference,octane fitness.at quoting fogerty,at internal quotation marks omitted.
because the district court did not have the benefit of the octane fitness standard when considering whether georgia pacific was entitled to attorneys fees under a,we vacate the court award of attorneys fees and remand the question for further consideration in light of this standard.
finally,the district court awarded georgia pacific prejudgment interest in the amount of,based on its conclusion that this was an exceptional case.georgia pacific,wl,at.
von drehle contends that the district court erred in awarding prejudgment interest because prejudgment interest is not an available remedy under a,and in any event,this is not an exceptional case.
section,authorizing monetary relief for trademark infringement,particularizes in considerable detail the types of monetary relief available for trademark infringement and defines the criteria for awarding each type.it thus authorizes,in specified circumstances,awards of the defendant profits the plaintiff damages court costs attorneys fees treble profits or treble damages prejudgment interest and statutory damages.because congress legislated with great precision in providing when each particular type of monetary relief is available,it is appropriate to conclude that if congress provided for a certain type of monetary relief only in a given specified circumstance,that type of relief is not available in other circumstances.for example,in a,a plaintiff may be awarded the defendant profits based only on proof of the defendant sales,subject to a specific adjustment when necessary to compensate for an inadequate or an excessive award of profits.yet in b,a plaintiff may be awarded three times the defendant profits when the specific criteria of b are satisfied.similarly,as relevant here,b authorizes an award of prejudgment interest in cases involving the knowing and intentional use of a counterfeit mark,but makes no express provision for prejudgment interest in other circumstances.
to be sure,as a general matter,prejudgment interest may be awarded at the district court discretion unless the applicable statute provides otherwise.see quesinberry life ins.of n,cir en banc.but when,as here,a statute provides particularized forms of monetary relief and explicitly authorizes prejudgment interest in some circumstances but not others,we conclude that prejudgment interest is not intended to be awarded except as provided in the statute.see moscow distillery cristall pepsico,wl,at cir,prejudgment interest is available under the lanham act only for counterfeiting citing b.as relevant here,a makes no specific provision for prejudgment interest in cases involving a recovery of a defendant profits,nor does prejudgment interest itself constitute a profit,as that term is generally used.
we recognize that at least one court has authorized prejudgment interest under a in an exceptional case.see am.honda motor two wheel,cir.but we can find no support for its conclusion in the text of the statute.indeed,a employs the exceptional case standard only for an award of attorneys fees,not prejudgment interest.
that said,we do not categorically foreclose an award of prejudgment interest under a as an element of a damages award in a trademark infringement case.to be sure,one loss of the use of a particular sum of money over a period of time causes damage,for which the law generally allows an award of prejudgment interest.see generally monessen sw.ry.morgan,d prejudgment interest is normally designed to make the plaintiff whole and is part of the actual damages sought to be recovered johnson cont l airlines,cir p rejudgment interest is an integral element of compensatory damages.but,in this case,georgia pacific did not undertake to prove its own damages,claiming instead only a disgorgement of von drehle gross profits.
for these reasons,we reverse the district court award of prejudgment interest to georgia pacific.
in sum,we vacate the district court injunction and its award of attorneys fees and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.we reverse its awards of treble damages leaving in place the jury award of profits and prejudgment interest.
it is so ordered.
i agree with the majority except for its unnecessary restriction of the nationwide injunction entered by the district court in response to von drehle corporation unlawful actions in,we affirmed a jury verdict in favor of georgia pacific consumer products,lp on its contributory infringement claim against von drehle,and we remanded the case for further proceedings,including consideration of georgia pacific request for injunctive relief.despite the fact that georgia pacific had by that time lost similar litigation in the eighth and sixth circuits,we rejected von drehle belated attempt to assert claim and issue preclusion as affirmative defenses,and we also found that there were no special circumstances including comity permitting the district court to raise the preclusion defenses sua sponte.on remand,the district court permanently enjoined von drehle from interfering with georgia pacific trademark rights.the parties agree that the scope of the injunction is nationwide.
viewing this appeal under our normal standard of review,the district court did not abuse its broad equitable discretion by entering a nationwide injunction.the majority contrary decision,limiting the scope of the injunction to the states within this circuit,is based on misapplication of the discretionary doctrine of comity fails to accord proper respect to our opinion and runs counter to a fundamental purpose of the lanham act,which is to provide national protection for trademarks used in interstate and foreign commerce.park fly,dollar park and fly,d.the result of the majority opinion is that georgia pacific will be deprived of the complete and effective relief to which it is entitled,and von drehle,relying on that opinion,will believe that it is permitted to continue interfering with georgia pacific trademarks in states.the lanham act authorizes federal courts to issue injunctive relief according to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court may deem reasonable,a,but there is nothing equitable or reasonable about this result,and its peculiarity is,see,united states jaycees philadelphia jaycees,cir protection of infringers is not a purpose of the lanham act.on the contrary,the act objective is the protection of the trademark and the public.
we have previously detailed the history of this and related litigation.see georgia pacific consumer,lp von drehle,cir georgia pacific i georgia pacific consumer,lp von drehle,cir.georgia pacific ii,cert.denied,d.i will highlight certain aspects of this litigation history to better explain my disagreement with the majority decision.
since the early,georgia pacific has manufactured and marketed throughout the country a touchless paper towel dispenser under the enmotion product line.the dispenser is designed for use in the restroom market,and georgia pacific owns several federally registered trademarks associated with the enmotion line.the georgia pacific dispenser was different in size and dimensions from competing dispensers,and georgia pacific developed paper towels that were designed specifically for use in the georgia pacific dispensers.georgia pacific leased its dispensers to distributors.the leases between georgia pacific and its distributors,and the subleases that the distributors were required to enter into with customers such as hotels and restaurants,stipulated that only georgia pacific paper towels were to be used in the dispensers.
in july,georgia pacific filed this lawsuit against von drehle in the eastern district of north carolina asserting several claims for relief,including one for contributory trademark infringement in violation of the gist of the contributory infringement claim is that von drehle,a north carolina corporation with its principal place of business in hickory,north carolina,manufactured and marketed nationally a line of paper towels sometimes referred to as the b paper towels that were designed for use in georgia pacific paper towel dispensers.the von drehle paper towels were inferior in quality to the georgia pacific paper towels,but von drehle and its distributors marketed the von drehle paper towels as a cheaper alternative for use in the georgia pacific dispensers,a practice known in the industry as stuffing.georgia pacific ii,at.
partially due to an erroneous summary judgment ruling in von drehle favor,which we vacated in our georgia pacific i decision,over six years elapsed before georgia pacific was able to present its contributory trademark infringement claim to a jury.during a january trial,the jury found in georgiapacific favor and awarded damages in the amount of,which represent all of the profits that von drehle earned from the sale of its b paper towels from to the date of trial.majority,at.in the damages award,no distinction has ever been made between the profits earned from von drehle sales within or outside the fourth circuit.
initially,georgia pacific victory was.two months after trial,the north carolina district court acting on von drehle motion and sua sponte set aside the jury verdict and granted judgment as a matter of law to von drehle based on grounds of claim and issue preclusion.see georgia pacific consumer prods,lp von drehle,d.the court decision stemmed from the judgments in two related cases filed by georgia pacific against von drehle distributors.in both cases,georgia pacific asserted,among other things,a claim for contributory trademark infringement based on these distributors marketing of the von drehle paper towels for use in georgia pacific dispensers 
georgia pacific filed the first of these cases in september more than three years after it filed this action in the western district of arkansas against myers supply.in july,while the original case against von drehle was pending in the north carolina district court,the arkansas district court conducted a bench trial and ruled against georgia pacific.applying a different legal analysis than the one we set forth in georgia pacific i,see georgia pacific ii,at,the arkansas district court determined that myers supply was aware that its customers were stuffing von drehle paper towels into georgia pacific dispensers,but the stuffing did not create a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of the paper towels and,therefore,did not constitute trademark infringement.the eighth circuit subsequently affirmed the arkansas district court decision.see georgia pacific consumer prods.lp myers supply,cir.
georgia pacific filed the second action in may against four u packaging,in the northern district of ohio.in november,shortly before trial in the north carolina district court,the ohio district court granted summary judgment against georgia pacific,holding that the action was barred by the judgment in the myers supply case.see georgia pacific consumer prods.lp four u packaging,d.in december,while georgia pacific appeal of the north carolina district court decision to grant judgment as a matter of law to von drehle was pending in this court,the sixth circuit affirmed the ohio district court decision.see georgia pacific consumer prods.lp four u packaging,cir.the sixth circuit based its ruling in part on the fact that the north carolina district court had set aside the jury verdict against von drehle and dismissed the case.the sixth circuit explained that a primary goal of issue preclusion is to foster reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions,and it concluded that b ecause judgment in georgia pacific favor was set aside,application of issue preclusion in this case poses no risk of creating inconsistent rulings.id.at quoting montana united states,d.
at the time,the sixth circuit observation about the status of the north carolina district court case was accurate.however,four months after the sixth circuit decision,we held in georgia pacific ii that the north carolina district court erred in setting aside the jury verdict and awarding judgment in favor of von drehle.we first concluded that von drehle waived the preclusion defenses by not asserting them in a timely manner and,therefore,the district court abused its discretion by considering them.as we explained,von drehle counsel had been immediately notified of the arkansas district court decision in myers supply,but von drehle waited approximately days before attempting to amend its answer to assert preclusion as an affirmative defense.
more pertinent to the comity issue on which the majority relies,we also held that the north carolina district court erred by considering the preclusion defenses sua sponte.notably,von drehle specifically argued to us that the district court was empowered to act sua sponte where,as here,all relevant data and legal records are before the court and the demands of comity,continuity in the law,and essential justice mandate judicial invocation of the principles of res judicata.brief of appellee,at cir,emphasis added internal punctuation and citation omitted.further,von drehle argued that i n raising preclusion on its own motion as an independent ground for dismissal,the trial court was protecting not just itself,but also the entire judiciary id.at.
we recognized that sua sponte consideration of a preclusion defense may be appropriate in special circumstances,such as when a court is on notice that it has previously decided the issue in another case and raises the defense to avoid unnecessary judicial waste.georgia pacific ii,at quoting,d.however,despite von drehle invocation of the doctrine of comity and the need to protect the entire judiciary,we found that von drehle had not identified any special circumstance justifying the district court unusual action.georgia pacific ii,at.we explained that this case was particularly for sua sponte consideration of preclusion defenses that were known long before trial,given that the issue of trademark infringement already had been decided by the jury.thus,the district court sua sponte consideration of the preclusion defenses actually wasted judicial resources,rather than sparing them.id.
finally,we also observed that by relying on myers supply as grounds for setting aside the jury verdict,the district court violated the mandate rule because it failed to implement both the letter and spirit of the mandate of georgia pacific georgia pacific ii,at.for all of these reasons,we remanded this case with the specific instruction that the district court reinstate the jury verdict in favor of georgia pacific and consider georgia pacific requests for injunctive and other appropriate relief.id.at.
von drehle petitioned for panel rehearing or rehearing en banc arguing,among other things,that a voiding conflict with sister circuits is especially important,and the panel waiver analysis violates principles of comity,fairness,and justice.pet.for reh g or reh g en banc,at cir,emphasis added.further,von drehle again invoked the demands of comity in seeking to justify the district court sua sponte consideration of the preclusion defenses,and it noted that u nder the panel holding,there will now be years of litigation as georgia pacific invokes the result here and seeks to apply it to new and pending cases,seeking to undo the decisions in myers,four u,and the two courts of appeals that have affirmed those decisions.id.at.von drehle concluded that it is difficult to imagine a result less conducive to judicial efficiency or less respectful of the decisions of coordinate courts that have previously addressed the identical dispute.id.the rehearing petition was denied.von drehle subsequently asserted comity as a ground warranting review in its unsuccessful petition for certiorari review of the georgia pacific ii decision.see pet.for writ of,at july.
on remand to the north carolina district court,the parties briefed and argued whether georgia pacific is entitled to injunctive relief and,if so,what the scope of that relief should be.regarding the scope,von drehle argued among other things that any injunction should be narrowly tailored to protect the legitimate rights of von drehle and its distributors and must account for the rulings of the eighth and sixth circuits and for georgia pacific position that each distributor and each state are different.von drehle response in opp.to georgia pacific renewed mot.for perm,bo,at may.however,despite specifically arguing in the georgia pacific ii appeal and petition for certiorari review that the doctrine of comity factors in this case,von drehle does not appear to have specifically invoked comity as a basis for denying or limiting injunctive relief 
following full briefing and a hearing,the north carolina district court granted georgia pacific motion for injunctive relief.applying the proper legal test,which it gleaned from ebay,mercexchange,llc,d,the court found georgia pacific suffered irreparable injury to its trademark and the reputation of its enmotion brand by von drehle infringing activities,which prevented georgia pacific from controlling the quality of paper towels dispensed from its enmotion dispensers and further confused and deceived customers the jury award is inadequate as it would not prevent von drehle from continu ing to infringe in the future,policing von drehle sales of its paper towels would be onerous,and von drehle has asserted throughout that its actions did not constitute trademark infringement the balance of hardship favors georgia pacific as von drehle activities have been found to have infringed georgia pacific trademarks and von drehle has no equitable interest in perpetrating trademark infringement and the public interest is best served by a permanent injunction that would prevent further trademark infringement.internal punctuation and citations omitted.based on these findings,the court enjoined von drehle from interfering directly or indirectly with georgia pacific trademark rights and specified that any deliberate or purposeful placement of von drehle paper towels in georgia pacific enmotion dispensers shall constitute a violation of this permanent injunction.
