darrell bird,an ohio citizen proceeding pro se,brought this lawsuit alleging various violations of federal copyright and trademark law against,dotster,george decarlo,marshall parsons,and steven vincent.dotster,decarlo,and vincent are citizens of washington,afternic has its headquarters in new york,and parsons resides in california.bird allegations involve the defendants activities in connection with the registration and attempted sale of the internet website.all defendants except parsons filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim.dotster,decarlo,and vincent the dotster defendants also filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.after determining that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the dotster defendants and that bird had failed to state a claim against either afternic or the dotster defendants,the district court granted the motions to dismiss filed by these defendants.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
internet domain names 
this case involves the process of establishing domain names for internet websites.several introductory remarks are necessary to clarify the terms and actors that are relevant to the process.a more detailed explanation of these concepts can be found in cases such as lockheed martin network solutions,cir,avery dennison sumpton,cir,and lockheed martin network solutions.
the creation of an internet website requires the reservation of a location,called an internet protocol ip address,and the computer programming necessary to generate the contents of the site.in order to make using the internet easier,specific domain names are assigned to correspond to the ip addresses.a person who wants to select a domain name must register the name with one of several registrars.these registrars screen the applications to make sure that the desired name is not already being used.in addition,the registrar maintains a directory that links domain names with their corresponding ip addresses.
an internet user who seeks to access a website enters the combination that corresponds to the ip address,and he or she is then routed electronically to the computer that hosts that address.because not every person who establishes a website desires to host the site on his or her own computer,an industry of surrogate hosts has developed,where entities license space on their computers to website operators.a person can thus maintain a website without keeping his or her personal computer constantly connected to the internet.
factual background 
bird has operated a computer software business under the tradename financia,since.in november of,bird obtained formal registration for the tradename financia from the united states patent and trademark office.he later registered a copyright for a manual and computer source code titled financia in february of.financia,owns the internet domain name.bird alleges that as a result of the widespread distribution of his computer software program throughout north america since,and the publication of several national articles about his program,his unique,suggestive,and fanciful trademark is famous.
dotster is a registrar of internet domain names.it operates an internet website at,where individuals and corporations can register an alphanumeric string of characters as an internet domain name.this registration process operates in conjunction with the domain registration of internet assigned names and numbers iann,which is maintained by network solutions,and regulated by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann.dotster is an registrar.in addition to acting as a registrar,dotster allows registrants to park their domain names on its futurehome page.this service is useful for registrants who lack an internet server to which the new domain name can be assigned.
parsons registered the internet domain name by using dotster website on february.he then decided to park his domain name on dotster futurehome page with the address.bird alleges that decarlo and vincent,as either agents or principals of dotster,took an active role in activating parson website and in advertising the site as available for use.
afternic is a company that provides an auction service on its website,for the purchase,sale,and exchange of domain names.it listed on its website on february,the day after parsons registered the domain name.the description of the domain name stated that efinancia means efinance in spanish.in addition,the posting listed fundwizard,a name that bird contends identifies parsons,as the domain name seller.bird alleges that the existence of the auction posting for suggests a rico type of mutually conspired pattern of conduct.
procedural background 
this lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio on may.bird complaint alleges trademark infringement,unfair competition,and trademark dilution,in violation of a,a,and c,respectively.in addition,bird asserts a claim for cybersquatting under the anticybersquatting consumer protection act of acpa,d,as well as for copyright infringement in violation of.
on september,afternic filed a motion to dismiss bird allegations against it pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the dotster defendants followed suit on september,with a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim,pursuant to rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure,respectively.
all parties consented to having the case decided by a magistrate judge pursuant to c.the magistrate judge concluded that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over the dotster defendants and that bird had failed to state a claim against either afternic or the dotster defendants.as a result,the district court granted the motions to dismiss filed by these defendants in an order that was entered on november.
the district court recognized that its order did not resolve bird allegations against parsons,but it nonetheless directed that its judgment of dismissal as to afternic and the dotster defendants be final pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.according to the court,no just cause existed to delay the entry of final judgment as to these defendants because parsons was proceeding pro se and the litigation between bird and parsons may be more protracted.a final judgment was therefore entered on november.this timely appeal followed.

personal jurisdiction over the dotster defendants 
where a federal court subject matter jurisdiction over a case stems from the existence of a federal question,personal jurisdiction over a defendant exists if the defendant is amenable to service of process under the forum state statute and if the exercise of personal jurisdiction would not deny the defendant due process.michigan coalition of radioactive material users,griepentrog,cir internal citations omitted.we have recognized that ohio statute is not coterminous with federal constitutional limits.calphalon rowlette,cir noting that the ohio supreme court has ruled that the ohio statute does not extend to the constitutional limits of the due process clause citing goldstein christiansen,ohio,per curiam.nevertheless,in evaluating whether personal jurisdiction is proper under ohio statute,we have consistently focused on whether there are sufficient minimum contacts between the nonresident defendant and the forum state so as not to offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.id.quoting int l shoe washington.cole mileti,cir addressing the due process concerns rather than inquiring into the propriety of jurisdiction under ohio statute.
bird appears to believe that the language in the various statutes that he alleges the defendants violated confers personal jurisdiction over the dotster defendants,regardless of their contacts with ohio.this belief is erroneous.as explained above,the relevant inquiry requires an analysis of the defendants contacts with the forum state.moreover,bird complaint does not include any facts that support the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the dotster defendants.
the only factual allegations that connect these defendants in any way to ohio appear in bird response to the dotster defendants motion to dismiss and in his appellate brief.after recognizing that the dotster defendants are all residents of the state of washington,bird uses the dotster defendants admission that they have sold about internet registrations to estimate the number of sales that have occurred in ohio.according to bird,of the dotster defendants sales occurred in the united states.he then divides this number equally among the states,which leads him to the conclusion that of these transactions involved an ohio resident.
although this reasoning lacks any direct factual support,we must draw all permissible inferences in favor of bird at this stage of the proceedings,because no evidentiary hearing or discovery has occurred.compuserve,patterson,cir noting that in reviewing a district court dismissal of a complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction without conducting an evidentiary hearing or allowing discovery,this court must consider the pleadings and affidavits in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.we are therefore faced with the question of whether bird allegation that ohio residents have registered domain names with dotster,as well as the presence of dotster website on the internet,constitutes sufficient minimum contacts with ohio such that the exercise of jurisdiction over the dotster defendants does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe,at.
although it is tempting to avoid addressing bird novel theory of personal jurisdiction by assuming,without deciding,that the dotster defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction in ohio,and proceed directly to the substantive claims that bird asserts,the supreme court has recently foreclosed this possibility.steel citizens for a better env t,d rejecting the approach of assuming jurisdiction for the purpose of deciding the merits because t he requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter springs from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the united states and is inflexible and without exception internal quotation marks and brackets omitted see ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d explaining that no unyielding jurisdictional hierarchy exists between subject matter and personal jurisdiction see also in re rationis,of panama,cir noting that consideration of the defendant claim that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over it had to occur before an analysis of the merits of the case in re papandreou,recognizing that personal jurisdiction is a threshold question that must precede the merits.we must therefore decide whether personal jurisdiction exists over the dotster defendants before proceeding to the merits of the case.
personal jurisdiction can be either general or specific,depending upon the nature of the contacts that the defendant has with the forum state.conti pneumatic prods,cir noting that a distinction between general and specific jurisdiction exists for the purpose of the due process analysis.because bird does not indicate whether he contends that the dotster defendants are subject to general or specific jurisdiction,we analyze both possibilities.our discussion focuses on the only contacts that bird has registrations that dotster has presumably undertaken for ohio residents and the existence of dotster website on the internet.
general jurisdiction is proper only where a defendant contacts with the forum state are of such a continuous and systematic nature that the state may exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant even if the action is unrelated to the defendant contacts with the state.third bank in nashville wedge group,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d,the supreme court held that the contacts between the nonresident defendant,helicol,and texas were insufficient to support the exercise of general jurisdiction.id.at.after noting that helicol lacked a place of business and had never been licensed to do business in texas,the court identified four types of contacts between helicol and texas sending its chief executive officer to houston for a session accepting into its new york bank account checks drawn on a houston bank purchasing helicopters,equipment,and training services from bell helicopter located in fort worth for substantial sums and sending personnel to bell facilities in fort worth for training.id.the court explained that the first contact was a event,and the second was of negligible significance.id.regarding the latter two contacts,the court held that mere purchases,even if occurring at regular intervals,are not enough to warrant a state assertion of in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of action not related to those purchase transactions.nor can we conclude that the fact that helicol sent personnel into texas for training in connection with the purchase of helicopters and equipment in that state in any way enhanced the nature of helicol contacts with texas.id.at.
these contacts,the court noted,differed markedly from those that were sufficient to support the exercise of general jurisdiction in perkins benguet consolidated mining company.helicopteros nacionales de colombia,at.in perkins,the president of a nonresident defendant corporation had maintained an office in ohio where he kept company files and held meetings.equally important,the president also carried on correspondence relating to the business,distributed salary checks drawn on two active ohio bank accounts,engaged an ohio bank to act as transfer agent,and supervised policies dealing with the rehabilitation of the corporation properties in the philippines.id.at.
the court analysis in helicopteros nacionales de colombia is directly applicable to the present case.bird has not alleged that dotster has an office in ohio,is licensed to do business there,has an ohio bank account,or directs its business operations from ohio.nor does bird claim that any of the dotster defendants have ever visited ohio.moreover,the allegation that ohio residents registered domain names with dotster fails to establish that dotster has a continuous and systematic presence in ohio.these registrations are similar to the purchases that were held insufficient to establish general jurisdiction in helicopteros nacionales de colombia.
furthermore,the fact that dotster maintains a website that is accessible to anyone over the internet is insufficient to justify general jurisdiction.cybersell,cybersell,cir holding that the maintenance of a passive website that contained advertisements did not even justify the exercise of specific jurisdiction over the defendant,whom the plaintiff conceded was not subject to general jurisdiction.the ability of viewers to register domain names on the website does not alter our conclusion,because the website,in this respect,simply enables dotster to do business with ohio residents,a fact that does not permit general jurisdiction.see bancroft masters,augusta,cir explaining that engaging in commerce with residents of the forum state is not in and of itself the kind of activity that approximates physical presence within the state borders.we also find it significant that,unlike direct marketing,registrants initiate the contact with dotster.bank quality dinette,cir holding that the exercise of general jurisdiction was proper where the defendants retained an independent sales representative in michigan,conducted mail order solicitations of michigan businesses,made over sales totaling over in and,and made at least one sale in michigan each and every month during and.
for these reasons,the dotster defendants are not subject to general jurisdiction in ohio.we must therefore determine whether they are subject to specific jurisdiction,which occurs where a state exercises personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a suit arising out of or related to the defendant contacts with the forum.helicopteros nacionales de colombia,at.
specific jurisdiction over the dotster defendants is permissible only if their contacts with ohio satisfy the test that this court established in southern machine company mohasco industries,cir 
first,the defendant must purposefully avail himself of the privilege of acting in the forum state or causing a consequence in the forum state.second,the cause of action must arise from the defendant activities there.finally,the acts of the defendant or consequences caused by the defendant must have a substantial enough connection with the forum state to make the exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant reasonable.
see calphalon rowlette,cir applying the mohasco factors.
the operation of an internet website can constitute the purposeful availment of the privilege of acting in a forum state under the first mohasco factor if the website is interactive to a degree that reveals specifically intended interaction with residents of the state.neogen neo gen screening,cir.we conclude that by maintaining a website on which ohio residents can register domain names and by allegedly accepting the business of ohio residents,the dotster defendants have satisfied the requirement.id.holding that the defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in michigan by granting its clients passwords to access its services on the website and by welcoming the business of michigan customers on a regular basis.although it is unclear whether registrants who use dotster website do so on a repeated basis,the proffered evidence that dotster regularly chooses to do business with ohio residents is sufficient to constitute purposeful availment.zippo zippo dot com,holding that the defendant decision to conduct business via the internet with pennsylvania residents constituted purposeful availment,noting that the fact that residents initiated the business relationships after visiting the defendant website did not make the contacts fortuitous.
the second requirement under mohasco involves an analysis of whether bird claims arise from the dotster defendants contacts with ohio.if a defendant contacts with the forum state are related to the operative facts of the controversy,then an action will be deemed to have arisen from those contracts.compuserve,patterson,cir.this factor does not require that the cause of action formally arise from defendant contacts with the forum rather,this criterion requires only that the cause of action,of whatever type,have a substantial connection with the defendant activities.third bank in nashville wedge group,cir quoting mohasco,at.
the operative facts in the present case include bird allegation that the dotster defendants committed copyright and trademark law violations by registering parsons domain name.both the dotster defendants contacts with ohio and bird claim of copyright and trademark violations stem from these defendants operation of the dotster website.as a result,the operative facts are at least marginally related to the alleged contacts between the dotster defendants and ohio.in light of the lenient standard that applies when evaluating the arising from criterion,we conclude that bird claims arise from the dotster defendants contacts with ohio.see zippo.at holding that a significant amount of the alleged infringement and dilution,as well as the resulting injury,occurred in pennsylvania.
the final requirement under mohasco is that the exercise of jurisdiction be reasonable in light of the connection that allegedly exists between the dotster defendants and ohio.an inference arises that the third factor is satisfied if the first two requirements are met.compuserve,at noting that if we find,as we do,the first two elements of a prima facie availment and a cause of action arising from the defendant contacts with the forum an inference arises that this third factor is also present.several factors are relevant to the reasonableness inquiry,including the burden on the defendant,the interest of the forum state,the plaintiff interest in obtaining relief,and the interest of other states in securing the most efficient resolution of controversies.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
although the dotster defendants might face a burden in having to defend a lawsuit in ohio,they can not reasonably object to this burden given that dotster has allegedly transacted business with ohio residents.ohio has a legitimate interest in protecting the business interests of its citizens,even though all of bird claims involve federal law.bird has an obvious interest in obtaining relief,and ohio might be the only forum where jurisdiction would exist over all of the defendants.although the state of washington also has an interest in this dispute,because the claim involves its citizens,this interest does not override the other factors suggesting that personal jurisdiction in ohio is reasonable.
for all of the preceding reasons,we conclude that bird has established a prima facie case that the dotster defendants are subject to specific jurisdiction in ohio.the sole remaining question is whether jurisdiction is authorized pursuant to ohio statute,an inquiry that we deferred considering above.pursuant to both ohio statute and its civil rule regarding service of process,courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant whose actions cause tortious injury in this state by an act or omission outside this state if he regularly does or solicits business,or engages in any other persistent course of conduct,or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered in this state.ohio a ohio civ.a estate of poole grosser,ohio app d,explaining that both the statute and the civil rule require a finding that an act or omission outside the state caused tortious injury in ohio,and the defendant regularly conducted activity in ohio.
bird allegations support a finding that the dotster defendants regularly conducted activity in ohio.the dotster defendants acts also allegedly caused tortious injury in ohio,because violations of federal trademark law are analogous to tort cases.panavision int l,toeppen,cir recognizing that the plaintiff allegation that the defendant engaged in trademark infringement,trademark dilution,and unfair competition by intentionally registering the plaintiff registered trademarks as his domain names was akin to a tort case indianapolis colts,metro.baltimore football club,cir holding that personal jurisdiction was appropriate in indiana because trademark infringement resembles a tort claim,and a substantial amount of the injury to the plaintiff was likely to occur in indiana dakota,dakota sportswear,cir explaining that i nfringement of a trademark is a tort.
moreover,because a plaintiff whose trademark has been violated potentially suffers economic harm as a result of the defendant actions,the injury occurs both in places where the plaintiff does business and in the state where its primary office is located.panavision int l,at noting that the defendants trademark violations had the effect of injuring panavision in california where panavision has its principal place of business and where the movie and television industry is centered zippo.at concluding that because the plaintiff was a pennsylvania corporation,a substantial amount of the injury from the alleged wrongdoing is likely to occur in pennsylvania.
for these reasons,we conclude that ohio statute authorizes personal jurisdiction over the dotster defendants.our previous discussion also demonstrates that because bird has established a prima facie case for the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over these defendants,subjecting them to personal jurisdiction in ohio does not violate the due process clause.both prerequisites for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the dotster defendants are therefore satisfied.as a result,we conclude that the district court erred in granting the dotster defendants motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.
allegations of trademark infringement,unfair competition,and trademark dilution 
turning now to the merits of bird substantive claims,both afternic and the dotster defendants argue that because they did not use bird trademark,they can not be liable for either trademark infringement or unfair competition.they also contend that bird can not state a claim for trademark dilution against them because they did not engage in the commercial use in commerce of bird trademark.
trademark infringement and unfair competition 
generally speaking,the key question in cases where a plaintiff alleges trademark infringement and unfair competition is whether the defendant actions create a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of the parties goods or services.daddy junky music stores,big daddy family music,cir the touchstone of liability under is whether the defendant use of the disputed mark is likely to cause confusion among consumers regarding the origin of the goods offered by the parties.champions golf club,v.the champions golf club,cir explaining that the central inquiry in claims of trademark infringement and unfair competition is whether the defendant use of the plaintiff mark is likely to cause confusion.
trademark infringement,for example,occurs if a person,acting without the permission of a trademark owner,use s in commerce any reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive a.similarly,a person engages in unfair competition if he or she,on or in connection with any goods or services,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact in a manner that is likely to cause confusion a a.
as these statutes indicate,a claim of unfair competition,unlike a claim of trademark infringement,does not require that a defendant use the plaintiff trademark.bird allegations,however,relate to the defendants alleged use of his trademark,rather than any other actions that might have misled the public.in the present case,therefore,bird claims of trademark infringement and unfair competition fail unless the defendants actually used bird trademark in a prohibited manner.holiday inns,reservation,cir explaining that the analysis is not necessary in the absence of the defendant use of a protected mark,of some deceptively similar variant of that mark,or of a false or misleading representation.
this court has not had the occasion to address whether companies that operate as internet registrars or that provide an internet auction site for registered domain names,which dotster and alternic respectively do,can be liable for infringement or unfair competition if a third party registers and seeks to sell a domain name that allegedly violates the rights of a trademark owner.two decisions from the united states district court for the central district of california,however,have concluded that registrars do not use trademarks for the purpose of a and a in such a situation.academy of motion picture arts sciences network solutions,holding that the academy failed to establish the likelihood of success on the merits necessary to secure a preliminary injunction where it alleged that the defendant registered domain names that infringed on the academy trademarks,because the defendant did not engage in the commercial use of the academy registered marks as required under a and a lockheed martin network solutions,reaching the same conclusion on a motion for summary judgment in a case with nearly identical facts,explaining that something more than the registration of the name is required before the use of a domain name is infringing,aff,cir.
in lockheed martin,the district court noted that d omain names present a special problem under the lanham act because they are used for both a technical purpose,to designate a set of computers on the internet,and for trademark purposes,to identify an internet user who offers goods or services on the internet.when a domain name is used only to indicate an address on the internet,the domain name is not functioning as a trademark.lockheed martin.at internal citation omitted.the court proceeded to explain that by accepting registrations,network solutions,nsi was not using the registered trademark in connection with the sale,distribution or advertising of goods and services.nsi merely uses domain names to designate host computers on the internet.this is the type of purely nominative function that is not prohibited by trademark law.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we agree with this analysis.
moreover,as the lockheed martin court noted,a useful analogy exists between domain names and vanity telephone numbers.id.at.these telephone numbers consist of easy to remember words,where each letter represents a number on the telephone keypad.vanity numbers are entitled to protection under the lanham act,but infringement does not occur where a confusingly similar telephone number is used if the alleged infringer makes no attempt to promote its number.holiday inns,at holding that although holiday inns owns trademark rights in its vanity number,the defendants did not violate those rights by using a telephone number that corresponded to zero liday.
like domain names,telephone numbers can be used not only for the purpose of identification,in which case infringement might occur,but also to direct a telephone signal to the proper endpoint.a registrar that grants a particular domain name to a registrant simply grants it an address.in this sense,the registrar,which resembles a telephone company that assigns a telephone number,is one step removed from the defendants in holiday inns.the fact that the registrant can then use its domain name to infringe on the rights of a registered trademark owner does not subject the registrar to liability for trademark infringement or unfair competition.
similar reasoning applies to afternic,which,according to bird complaint,functions as an auction site for domain names on the internet.the possibility that its customers might buy or sell infringing domain names does not alter the fact that afternic does not use those names.moreover,even a domain name that could be used to violate a registered trademark does not necessarily do so.juno online,juno lighting,dismissing the unfair competition claim brought against a lighting company that registered the domain name.com,because the plaintiff did not allege that the defendant took any actions other than registering the name.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that bird has failed to state a claim of infringement or of unfair competition against either afternic or the dotster defendants.the district court thus did not err in dismissing bird infringement and unfair competition
