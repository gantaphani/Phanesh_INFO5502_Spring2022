aef says that the district court in denying attorney fees abused its discretion because it failed to adequately articulate its reasons.in israel city of barberton.lexis,at cir,unpublished,this court held that i n order to review a discretionary decision to deny attorney fees,some understanding of the trial court reasons is necessary.absent a statement of reasons,no meaningful review can be made.the district court in israel denied a motion for attorney fees by a marginal denial with no hearing or statement of reasons and the case was remanded so that the district court could give its reasons for the denial.id.at.in morscott,city of cleveland,cir,this court held that a district court marginal entry that completely fails to set forth any reason for the denial is an abuse of discretion because it is impossible to determine on appeal whether the district court was aware that it had the discretion to award attorney fees.

having handled the case over the course of four years,the district court was in the best position to determine whether the circumstances of the case and conduct of el warranted an award of attorney fees.the district court addressed the parties arguments and applied the correct legal standard.further,the record relied on by the district court is available for review on appeal.the adequacy of a district court statement is determined by this court ability to understand its reasoning,not by the number of sentences it uses.the district court order was sufficient to allow meaningful review under the
