this appeal presents a dispute between two hamburger restaurant chains operating under similar versions of the name whataburger,a trademark.appellant whataburger,of corpus christi,texas texas wab,a texas corporation with whataburger franchises throughout the southern united states and mexico,holds the exclusive right to use the registered trademark.appellee of virginia,virginia operates its restaurants solely in virginia.texas wab appeals the district court order denying its motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment sua sponte to virginia on the basis that texas wab was barred by the equitable doctrines of laches and acquiescence from enforcing in virginia its exclusive right to use the whataburger mark.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court order to the extent it concludes that texas wab is the rightful owner of the mark in virginia,but we reverse the entry of judgment against texas wab and in favor of virginia.
on september,harmon dobson,founder of the whataburger restaurant chain in texas,was issued a certificate of registration,reg,for the word mark whataburger in connection with hamburgers.through a series of assignments,ownership of the registered mark was acquired by whatapartnership,lp.in,whatapartnership and texas wab entered into a licensing agreement that granted texas wab the exclusive right to use and control the whataburger mark.texas wab maintains franchises in texas,arkansas,arizona,florida,louisiana,mississippi,new mexico,oklahoma and mexico.neither texas wab nor any of its predecessors in interest have ever opened or operated a whataburger restaurant in virginia.
virginia claims that jack branch,its founder and owner,opened a restaurant using the name in newport news,virginia,prior to august,and therefore prior to the issuance of the certificate of registration now held by texas wab branch moved to richmond in,where he opened another restaurant,at which point his brother paul became the proprietor of the newport news location.from until,branch opened several additional restaurants in various virginia locations,including richmond,petersburg,chester,and colonial heights.virginia was not incorporated until prior to that time,it was operated essentially as a sole proprietorship.the newport news proprietorship was incorporated in as a business entity separate from virginia 
virginia and texas wab first became aware of each other in.a representative of texas wab was traveling in virginia and,noticing the sign,stopped in one of the restaurants and mentioned the possibility of the branches running the restaurant as a franchise of texas wab.the record contains a june,letter to paul branch from george garrison,an officer of texas wab,referring to the meeting and indicating that texas wab held the name whataburger as a registered trademark.garrison suggested that texas wab might be willing to license virginia to use its trademark,but noted that not all of the locations operated by the branch brothers in virginia met the standards maintained by texas wab.the letter made clear that texas wab expected virginia to change its name unless the parties reached a licensing agreement.the record contains a second letter,dated july,from sam main,general manager for texas wab,suggesting that he meet with paul branch the following week in richmond to discuss the issues raised in the garrison letter.
the record does not reflect any further contact between these businesses until,more than thirty years later.by that time,texas wab had expanded significantly,having opened more than whataburger restaurants across the southern united states and mexico.in a letter dated january,an attorney representing texas wab indicated that virginia use of the name might be an infringement of texas wab registered trademark however,the letter allowed for the possibility that one of the branch brothers had been granted the right to use the mark at some point in the past 
it has come to our client attention that you operate restaurants in newport news and colonial heights under the name.under ordinary circumstances,your use of this name would constitute a direct infringement of whataburger,superior trademark rights in and to the whataburger name.our client believes,however,that you may be using the name pursuant to an agreement made by and between you or your predecessor in interest and our client founder,harmon dobson,or perhaps another entity.if our client belief is correct,your continued use of the name within your immediate marketing area perhaps would not be deemed an actionable infringement of our client rights.
the letter closed with a request for copies of any documents that purport to grant rights in the name to you or to your predecessor in interest by dobson or anyone else associated with texas wab.
in an effort to settle the issue of whether it could continue using the name,virginia filed this declaratory judgment action,see a west,seeking an order declaring that virginia is the rightful owner of the trademark or trade name in the state of virginia and therefore enjoys the right to the exclusive use of the trademark in the market areas of richmond,virginia chester,virginia petersburg,virginia newport news,virginia and colonial heights,virginia.virginia also sought a corollary pronouncement from the district court that it was not guilty of federal trademark infringement.the factual allegations supporting these claims were as follows that virginia used the mark prior to the date of texas wab registration that virginia was unaware of any superior right to the mark and therefore used the mark in good faith and that,in any event,texas wab waived any right or claim it has or may have had to the use of the name within the confines of the state of virginia because of virginia long usage of the name.
texas wab asserted a counterclaim,seeking a declaration that it,by virtue of its exclusive licensing agreement with whatapartnership,is the rightful owner of the trademark or trade name in the commonwealth of virginia and is entitled to the exclusive use of the trademark within the commonwealth of virginia.texas wab,which has never done business in virginia,did not allege in its counterclaim that virginia had infringed on its trademark.consequently,it sought neither to enjoin virginia from using the name nor to recover damages for such use.because both parties sought a declaration regarding exclusive ownership of the trademark in virginia,texas wab moved for summary judgment on both the complaint and counterclaim.virginia made no for summary judgment.
the district court assumed for analytical purposes that,under the lanham act,texas wab registered mark had acquired incontestable status,see west supp,which serves as conclusive evidence of the validity of the registered mark,of the registrant ownership of the mark,and of the registrant exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce.b west supp virginia does not dispute that the mark has attained incontestable status however,that does not settle the issue of which party has priority in virginia.although the name suggests otherwise,an incontestable registration is subject to a laundry list of statutory affirmative defenses.see b west supp.the district court considered two of these defenses.
first,the district court considered whether virginia could take advantage of what has been deemed a limited area exception to the exclusive usage rights flowing from an incontestable mark.see b west see generally thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed hereinafter mccarthy discussing the limited area defense under b.under section b,it is possible for an alleged infringer to establish the right to use within a limited geographical area the owner registered trademark if the alleged infringer adopted the mark prior to the date of registration did so without knowledge of the registrant prior use and used the mark continuously since that time.the user superior right to use the mark under b is limited,however,to the area in which such continuous prior use is proved.b.the district court rejected this limited statutory prior user defense as an option for virginia based on the court finding that virginia offered insufficient evidence that it used the mark prior to the september,date of registration.see of,whataburger,of corpus christi,texas,d.thus,the district court entered a judgment order declaring that texas wab is the rightful owner of the trademark whataburger.id.at.virginia has not appealed this or any other portion of the order.as a result,the court conclusion that virginia did not establish the defense under b resolves the issue of which party has priority in the whataburger trademark in virginia,confirming that texas wab enjoys the exclusive right to use its mark in virginia 
the remaining question considered by the district court was whether texas wab could enforce its ownership rights in virginia against virginia.under the lanham act,the owner of a registered mark may not be able to enjoin an infringing use of its mark where equitable principles,including laches,estoppel,and acquiescence,prohibit him from doing so.b west supp.the district court concluded sua sponte that texas wab was barred by laches from enforcing,in virginia at least,its exclusive right to use and control the mark.see,d at.the court based its conclusion on the fact that texas wab had been aware of virginia operations and use of the name since but unreasonably failed to follow up on its original contact for more than years.moreover,the district court reasoned that permitting texas wab to enforce its trademark rights after this lengthy delay would severely prejudice virginia,which continued to invest in its business and build goodwill and customer loyalty in virginia under the name.
similarly,the district court concluded that the doctrine of acquiescence precluded texas wab from protecting its registered trademark in virginia because a company representative visited a virginia establishment,attempted to interest the owner in a franchise,offered advice for the improvement of the business,and failed to follow up on any requests that virginia change its name.id.at.even though the district court concluded that texas wab is the rightful owner of the trademark whataburger,it denied texas wab summary judgment motion because the equitable defenses as set forth in b bar texas wab from asserting this right and obtaining an injunction against virginia barring use of the mark,in the state of virginia.id.furthermore,the district court granted summary judgment sua sponte in favor of virginia.
texas wab appeals,arguing that the district court erroneously relied upon the doctrines of laches and acquiescence because it is undisputed that there has yet to be an infringing use of the mark by virginia,a prerequisite for the application of either laches or acquiescence.texas wab further contends that the court was obligated to award it summary judgment as a result of its finding that texas wab is the rightful owner of the mark,which virginia does not appeal.for the reasons that follow,we agree with texas wab 
the primary obstacle to the application of laches here is that there was never any infringing use of the mark by virginia to which texas wab was required to respond estoppel by laches generally applies in a trademark infringement action to preclude relief for an owner of a mark who has unreasonably slept on his rights.see brittingham jenkins,cir.c ourts may apply the doctrine of estoppel by laches to deny relief to a plaintiff who,though having knowledge of an infringement,has,to the detriment of the defendant,unreasonably delayed in seeking redress.sara lee,cir emphasis added.thus,a court consideration of laches in the trademark context should encompass at least these questions whether the owner of the mark knew of the infringing use whether the owner delay in challenging the infringement of the mark was inexcusable or unreasonable and whether the infringing user was unduly prejudiced by the owner delay.brittingham,at.because the lanham act does not include a limitations period,courts use the doctrine of laches to address the inequities created by a trademark owner who,despite having a colorable infringement claim,allows a competitor to develop its products around the mark and expand its business,only then to lower the litigation boom.see hot wax,turtle wax,cir affirming district court application of laches where plaintiff permitted defendant advertising and the development of its products to go unchecked and sat idly by and chose not to challenge defendant use of the mark with respect to its products mccarthy at laches is a good defense if plaintiff long failure to exercise its legal rights has caused defendant to rely to its detriment by building up a valuable business around its trademark.
the district court determined that the first requirement for applying laches was met by the fact that texas wab knew about virginia no later than,and therefore learned of the infringement years ago,d at.texas wab points out that it did not assert a counterclaim for infringement because it did not have,and never has had,an actionable infringement claim against virginia.texas wab questions how it could have unreasonably delayed in asserting a right or claim that it has never had the ability to assert.kason,component hardware group,cir fundamental to laches is inexcusable delay in asserting a right or claim.indeed,the key question,for purposes of estoppel by laches,is not simply whether there has been some delay,but whether that delay was unreasonable.see sara lee,at brittingham,at.logic dictates that unreasonable delay does not include any period of time before the owner is able to pursue a claim for,a trademark owner could be punished for not bringing a claim he had no right to bring.for this reason,we have recognized that laches assumes the existence of an infringement for an extended period prior to the commencement of litigation.see sara lee,at.
thus,regardless of when the trademark owner initially discovers the use of a similar mark,action against the infringing user is not necessary until,in light of the circumstances,the right to protection ha s clearly ripened.see mccarthy at o ne can not be guilty of laches until his right ripens into one entitled to protection.for only then can his torpor be deemed inexcusable.internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.instead of focusing on when the trademark owner first knew that another party was using its mark,the court should be trying to determine the time at which the use became infringing and the time at which the owner should have known it t o the extent that a plaintiff prior knowledge may give rise to the defense of estoppel by laches,such knowledge must be of a,infringing use of a mark.sara lee,at see brittingham,at explaining that,in determining whether laches applies,a court should ordinarily consider whether the owner of the mark knew of the infringing use emphasis added.accordingly,unreasonable delay begins at the time at which the trademark owner knows or should know she has a provable claim for infringement.kason,at see kellogg exxon,cir implicit in a finding of laches is the presumption that an underlying claim for infringement existed at the time at which we begin to measure the plaintiff delay.the owner mere knowledge that he might have an infringement claim at some future date is not sufficient to trigger the period of unreasonable delay required for estoppel by laches.see profitness phys.therapy ctr.orthopedic sports phys.therapy,cir a plaintiff should not be obligated to sue until its right to protection has ripened such that plaintiff knew or should have known,not simply that defendant was using the potentially offending mark,but that plaintiff had a provable infringement claim against defendant.
the district court,therefore,mistakenly measured the period of delay from texas wab first knowledge of virginia use of the mark without considering whether such use of the mark was an infringing use that required action by texas wab.mere use of a mark that is similar or even identical to a registered trademark does not a fortiori establish infringement.the keystone of infringement is the likelihood of confusion.sara lee,at internal quotation marks omitted see a and b west supp infring
