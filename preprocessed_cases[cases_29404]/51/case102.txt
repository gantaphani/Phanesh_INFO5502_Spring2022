this appeal requires us to decide whether a showing of willful infringement is a prerequisite to an accounting of a trademark infringer profits for a violation of section a of the lanham act.we hold that wilfulness is an important equitable factor but not a prerequisite to such an award,noting that our contrary position in securacomm consulting securacom,cir,has been superseded by a amendment to the lanham act.we further affirm the district court resolution of several other damages issues,with a single exception explained below.
factual background and procedural history 
joseph renosky was a member of the board of directors of banjo buddies,banjo buddies or bbi from february until may.banjo buddies principal product during that time was an extremely successful fishing lure called the banjo minnow,which renosky helped develop.
the banjo minnow was principally advertised via infomercial broadcast,and was also sold in sporting goods catalogs and sporting goods stores.tristar products,obtained exclusive rights to advertise and sell the banjo minnow through all forms of direct response marketing,print media,and retail distribution.bbi received of tristar net profits in return.renosky agreed to provide the manufactured banjo minnow lure kit through his corporation,renosky lures,to both tristar and bbi at per kit renosky received additional shares of bbi stock in exchange for producing the banjo minnow kits at a fair price.renosky also executed a agreement in favor of bbi in exchange for more bbi stock.the banjo minnow sold very well for a little over a year,from through,but then sales dwindled considerably.bbi introduced several derivative banjo minnow products in,but none approached the success of the original.
during the banjo minnow early success in,renosky presented an idea to the bbi board for a new and improved banjo minnow called the bionic minnow the board took no formal action on the proposal,and a month later renosky advised one of bbi directors that he would develop the new lure independently.at least two board members urged renosky against this course of action,but renosky could not be swayed.he immediately began developing the bionic minnow through renosky lures and ultimately marketed the new lure via infomercial and other means beginning in february.
after renosky failed to comply with a cease and desist letter,bbi brought suit in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania in april.bbi alleged that renosky violated section a of the lanham act,a,by developing and marketing the bionic minnow in such a way that customers would believe the bionic minnow was a banjo buddies product.bbi also alleged that renosky conduct breached the contract and renosky fiduciary duties as an officer of banjo buddies 
the district court denied for partial summary judgment and held a bench trial in may.in its findings of fact and conclusions of law issued in november,the court found that renosky was liable for false designation of origin under a of the lanham act the court further found that renosky breached his fiduciary duty of loyalty to banjo buddies by pursuing a corporate bionic minnow fully disclosing his actions to the board or forcing the board to accept or reject the project.the court also found that renosky breached the agreement by independently developing the bionic minnow.finally,the court found that renosky breached his fiduciary duty of good faith and fair dealing by overcharging bbi for the banjo minnow kits.
the district court concluded that renosky should be forced to disgorge the net profits of the bionic minnow project under section a of the lanham act,a,which provides for such accountings as an equitable remedy for lanham act violations.the district court also concluded that the damages arising from renosky usurpation of a corporate opportunity,breach of the contract,and overcharging for the banjo minnow lure kits were too speculative to support any monetary award.
accordingly,the district court ordered renosky to pay to banjo buddies the net profits earned by the bionic minnow project,and to produce verified financial records attesting to this amount.renosky never produced these records,despite numerous delays and court orders.renosky did ultimately retain an independent financial analysis the alpern report,which the district court accepted for purposes of establishing the total sales of the bionic minnow through november.however,the court rejected that report conclusion that the bionic minnow project suffered a net loss.accordingly,the court calculated renosky profits by multiplying the total sales figure by,based on testimony from renosky business manager that renosky lures products typically earn a bottom line of between.the court also determined that renosky should be forced to disgorge all of the distributions based on gross sales made to him as a shareholder in the bionic minnow project.the court entered judgment in march against renosky in the amount of.
banjo buddies moved to alter or amend the district court judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e,arguing that the court erred by holding that the damages arising from renosky overcharges for the banjo minnow lure kits were too speculative to support a monetary award.the district court denied this motion in march.
renosky and bbi both appeal the district court judgment.renosky asserts that the district court should not have ordered an accounting of profits because renosky did not intentionally or willfully confuse or deceive customers.renosky alternatively argues that the district court calculation of those profits was clearly erroneous.banjo buddies,contending that the district court erred by refusing to award damages for renosky overcharges rather than make a reasonable estimate of damages based on the available evidence.
ii.jurisdiction and standards of review 
the district court had federal question jurisdiction over banjo buddies lanham act claim,supplemental jurisdiction over the parties state law claims,and diversity jurisdiction over all claims owing to the complete diversity of the parties.we have appellate jurisdiction to review the district court final judgment.
we review the district court factual findings under a clearly erroneous standard,but exercise plenary review over the district court interpretation of legal questions and its application of the law to the facts.castrol pennzoil,cir.we further review the district court award of equitable remedies under section a of the lanham act under an abuse of discretion standard.gucci america,daffy,cir.
iii.discussion 
willfulness is a factor,not a prerequisite.
renosky argues that the district court erred by awarding profits from the bionic minnow project to banjo buddies under section a of the lanham act because renosky violation of section a of that statute was not willful or intentional.renosky relies on securacomm consulting,securacom,cir,in which this court held that a plaintiff must prove that an infringer acted willfully before the infringer profits are recoverable under a of the lanham act.id.at citing george basch blue coral,cir.the district court findings related to the issue of renosky intent are ambiguous and possibly contradictory however,we need not decide whether the district court found or should have found that renosky acted willfully,because we conclude that securacomm s willfulness requirement has been superseded by statute and that,based on all the relevant equitable factors,the district court did not abuse its discretion by ordering an accounting of renosky profits.
securacomm s rule was the dominant view when securacomm was issued in january.see,quick technologies,sage group plc,cir collecting cases,including securacomm george basch,at restatement third of unfair competition thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.in august,however,congress amended.prior to the amendment,that section provided as follows 
when a violation of any right of the registrant of a mark registered in the patent and trademark office,or a violation under section a a,shall have been established the plaintiff shall be entitled,subject to the principles of equity,to recover defendant profits,any damages sustained by the plaintiff,and the costs of the action.
see securacomm,at quoting former a.the amendment replaced or a violation under section a with a violation under section a,or a willful violation under section c,see,b,stat,emphasis added.the plain language of the amendment indicates that congress intended to condition monetary awards for c violations,but not a violations,on a showing of willfulness 
we presume congress was aware that most courts had consistently required a showing of willfulness prior to disgorgement of an infringer profits in lanham act cases,despite the absence of the word willful in the statutory text prior to.see scheidemann ins,cir w e must presume that congress is aware of existing judicial interpretations of statutes.by adding this word to the statute in,but limiting it to c violations,congress effectively superseded the willfulness requirement as applied to a.see russello,d where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.quoting united states wong kim bo,cir.
this conclusion is supported by quick technologies,at,the only other appellate decision to reach the issue.the fifth circuit in quick technologies considered the effect of the amendment and held that,based on earlier decisions of that court as well as the plain language of a,willful infringement was not a prerequisite to an accounting of the infringer profits.id.the court noted the wealth of contrary authority,including securacomm,but pointed out that all of those cases preceded the statutory change.id.at.the quick technologies court reaffirmed the approach elaborated in prior fifth circuit cases,including pebble beach tour i limited,cir,explaining that the infringer intent was an not in evaluating whether equity supports disgorging the infringer profits.quick,at.these factors include,but are not limited to whether the defendant had the intent to confuse or deceive,whether sales have been diverted,the adequacy of other remedies,any unreasonable delay by the plaintiff in asserting his rights,the public interest in making the misconduct unprofitable,and whether it is a case of palming off.id.internal citations omitted.
in gucci america,daffy,cir,the panel majority noted that the amendment might affect the continued validity of securacomm s willfulness requirement.id.at noting that statutory language and legislative history of the amendment suggests that willfulness is a prerequisite in a trademark dilution cause of action,not an infringement action.the majority determined it did not need to decide the issue,however,reasoning that even under the quick technologies approach,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order an accounting of the infringer profits.id.at accordingly,even after the amendments to the lanham act and any impact it may have had on our holding in securacomm,we nevertheless conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion given the equities here,including daffy good faith.
for the reasons explained above,we now hold that securacomm has been superceded by the amendment.relying on the quick technologies approach endorsed in gucci america,we further conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by ordering an accounting of renosky profits.apart from his contention that his violation was not willful,renosky does not argue that the district court abused its discretion.accordingly,our consideration of the equities here will be brief.because the district court findings concerning renosky intent are difficult to reconcile,see supra note,we will assume that factor is neutral.nonetheless,all of the other quick technologies factors support an award of profits here.
it is likely that renosky conduct diverted sales from banjo buddies.see quick,at factor two.the district court found that renosky marketing for the bionic minnow was confusingly similar to that of the banjo minnow,noting numerous material similarities in the infomercials used to market each product.the court also found that the two lure kits were nearly identical and were packaged identically.the court further found that the markets for the two products were either the same or substantially overlap ping.the district court observations concerning the close similarities of the products as well as their packaging and marketing schemes also strongly support the conclusion that renosky was palming off the bionic minnow as a banjo buddies product.see id.factor six.the public has an interest in discouraging this type of behavior,as it interferes with the consumer ability to make informed purchasing decisions.see id.factor five.
next,there are no other adequate remedies.see id.factor three.the district court rejected banjo buddies estimation of its damages for both the lanham act claims and the state law claims as too speculative.if renosky profits are not assessed,banjo buddies will be wholly uncompensated for renosky infringing actions.finally,banjo buddies did not delay in bringing suit to stop renosky infringing actions.see id.factor four.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to order an accounting of renosky profits.
b.the district court estimation of profits.
the remaining issues in renosky appeal concern the district court calculation of the amount of profits to be awarded.we first hold that the district court did not clearly err by rejecting renosky contention that he suffered a net loss on the bionic minnow project,and did not abuse its discretion by using an alternative method to estimate renosky profits.see tamko roofing products,ideal roofing,cir calculation of profits under section a is left to the trial court discretion,and will not be disturbed unless it rests on clearly erroneous findings of fact,incorrect legal standards,or a meaningful error in judgment.
section a provides that i n assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove defendant sales only defendant must prove all elements of cost or deduction claimed.a see also caesars world,venus lounge,cir.the district court accepted the alpern report figure for total sales of the bionic minnow through november.thus,banjo buddies burden of proof was satisfied by renosky accountant financial report.
however,the district court held that renosky failed to satisfy his burden of proof regarding costs and deductions.the district court rejected the alpern report conclusion that renosky suffered a loss of for several reasons,most of which renosky makes no attempt to refute on appeal.first,the court observed that the alpern report summary of direct expenses associated with the bionic minnow almost five million sorely lacking in detail,lumping costs into six broad categories with no explanation of what specific expenses those categories represented renosky appears to argue that the district court improperly rejected the direct expense summary because the preparers of the alpern report were unable to confirm expenses associated with pacific media,a vendor representing no more than two percent of the direct expenses associated with the bionic minnow.this argument is a red herring.the court rejected the summary in spite of the preparers success in obtaining corroboration from most major vendors,not because of its failure to obtain corroboration from one.
renosky fails to address the district court remaining reasons for rejecting the alpern report analysis of costs associated with the bionic minnow project.most important,renosky makes no attempt to explain why he twice failed to produce verified financial records supporting his claimed costs and deductions as ordered by the court the court also observed several unexplained discrepancies between the alpern report summary of direct expenses and other evidence in the record.next,the court rejected the alpern report conclusion that shared expenses associated with the bionic minnow project were.the court explained that the alpern report did not show how each
