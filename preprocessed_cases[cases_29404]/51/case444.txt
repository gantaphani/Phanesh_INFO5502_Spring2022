background 
isa,a corporation engaged in the production of note cards,greetings cards,posters,and prints,was founded in.for most of these products,isa has used a perforated border design that evokes the functional perforation of an older postage stamp.see,exhs.q,s.in october,isa filed an application with the united states patent and trademark office seeking to register the perforated border design as a trademark and,in,was granted registration for that mark for use on printed note cards and greeting cards.for the purposes of the summary judgment motion from which the order now before us arises,the parties have stipulated that the mark is incontestable 
almost from its inception,isa was a licensee of the postal service.between and there were a series of license agreements between the parties.in each case,the postal service licensed use of its stamp designs which were further specified to include a ll united states postage stamps to which the postal service owns the copyright.see,exh.at,exh.at.stamp images were transmitted to licensees in the form of transparencies,each marked as copyright protected and depicting the entire stamp including any perforated edges.see,at licensing transparency of girl scouts stamp see also,exh.c at.the postal service retained right of approval over all licensed products,exh.at,exh.at.

in the late,the postal service retail division began offering its own line of stamp art cards.most of these cards included the perforated border of the original stamp as part of the stamp image.see,exhs.sylvester and tweety,love,snoopy.the postal service has also occasionally licensed or produced cards incorporating the art depicted in its stamps without any perforated border,exh.r elvis,holly,pansy,two versions of midnight angel.most cards have included the stamp value designation and the usa as they appeared on the stamp,but some of the cards that incorporate only the art and not the entire stamp image have not included those elements.id.pansy,two versions of midnight angel.the postal service choice about whether to depict stamp images or some other form of the underlying stamp art has often reflected the extent of its ownership interest in the stamp image.see,exh.c at,exh.d at.in the case of stamp designs,in which the copyright interest in the underlying artwork is held by another,the postal service has often been limited to reproducing the entire stamp image with all its constituent usa,the price,and any it is not licensed to reproduce the underlying art alone,exh.c at,exh.d at.
since the postal service adopted for its stamps,postal service cards incorporating the images of stamps have depicted the stamps with their new serpentine perforated borders,exhs,exh.p love,snoopy,puppy,kwanzaa,hanukkah.postal service cards include an easily visible imprint of its familiar eagle trademark on the back,generally accompanied by information about the history of the stamp or stamp art depicted on the card and another smaller image of the entire stamp,exhs.p,r.there is no record evidence that the postal service has created any card that adds a perforated border to the image of one of the few stamps it has produced without any perforations.
in september,isa sued the postal service alleging unlawful infringement of its perforated border mark with respect to those postal service cards depicting the entire image of a stamp.the postal service moved for summary judgment,asserting that it did not use the mark its use of the perforated border in depicting images of its stamps fell within the exception provided by law isa had abandoned the mark and damages were precluded based on actual notice.the district court found that the postal service had used the disputed border,but that it had used it other than as a mark,in a descriptive manner,and in good faith,and granted summary judgment in favor of the postal service on the basis of fair use at.on appeal,isa disputes the grant of summary judgment arguing only that the district court erred in finding no genuine issue of material fact as to the postal service good faith in using the border.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.siemens power transmission distribution,norfolk,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.once the moving party has properly supported its motion for summary judgment,the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d quotations and emphasis omitted.if the movant bears the burden of proof on an issue,because,as a defendant,it is asserting an affirmative defense,it must establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to any element of that defense.see martin alamo community college,cir.

as for the first element,the parties have stipulated that isa mark is incontestable.as to the second,the district court found that the postal service stamp art products did incorporate a perforated border similar to isa mark.accordingly,the question became whether or not the postal service use of the border could be defended as a fair use of the mark.because the postal service moved for summary judgment on the ground that it could be so defended,it had the burden to establish that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to any element of the defense.see martin,at.
