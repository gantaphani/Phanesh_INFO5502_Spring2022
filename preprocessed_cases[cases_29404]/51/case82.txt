star industries appeals from a judgment for,entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york harold baer,judge,on january,after a bench trial,dismissing its federal claims under the lanham act,and pendent state law claims under general business law and new york common law.star also appeals from the district court order entered march,denying its motion to reopen the trial record and to amend the findings of fact and conclusions of law.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background 
star industries,star produces alcoholic beverages including,of particular relevance to this appeal,the georgi brand of vodkas.georgi vodka is sold primarily in new york state,and is one of the top selling vodkas in the new york metropolitan area.it is generally cheaper than the leading nationally distributed vodkas.bacardi and bacardi collectively bacardi produce,import,and distribute bacardi brand rums.bacardi is the largest selling brand of hard liquor in the united states,is one of the leading producers of beers and malt beverages in the united states.in and bacardi entered into an exclusive trademark licensing agreement under which produces malt beverages bearing the bacardi logo.
in june,inspired by the success of flavored vodkas introduced by leading international companies such as stolichnaya,star president decided to develop an georgi vodka.a new label was designed,consisting of the traditional georgi label,which contains a coat of arms and a logo consisting of stylized capital letters spelling georgi on a white background,together with three new elements an orange slice,the words orange flavored,and a large elliptical letter o appearing below the georgi logo and surrounding all of the other elements.the o was rendered as a vertical oval,with the outline of the o slightly wider along the sides about one quarter inch thick and narrowing at the top and bottom about one eighth inch thick the outline of the o is colored orange and decorated with two thin gold lines,one bordering the inside and one bordering the outside of the outline.star was apparently the first company to distribute an alcoholic beverage packaged in a bottle bearing a large elliptical orange letter 
star hope was that,just as consumers of stolichnaya vodka had begun referring to the vodka as stoli o,consumers would come to refer to georgi vodka as georgi accordingly,star applied in to register georgi o as a word trademark with the patent and trademark office pto.reasoning that consumers viewing the georgi o label were likely to perceive the word georgi as separate from the o design,and not as constituting a composite phrase,the pto rejected star application.between and star promoted its new vodka,although it is unclear how vigorously,and it apparently had little success.sales volume remained low even in new york state,and practically nil elsewhere.no evidence in the record suggests that georgi vodka has ever been commonly referred to by consumers as georgi 
in bacardi began to develop an rum,which it ultimately introduced nationally in under the name bacardi bacardi line of flavored rums originated in with bacardi limon.unlike bacardi other flavored rums,however,bacardi o was produced and marketed bearing a distinct label consisting of the bacardi logo and bat symbol above a large elliptical letter o against a clear background.this bacardi o design was developed by a new york design firm,whose president and creative director supervised the design of the new label and claimed not to have had any awareness of the georgi o design until after the instant lawsuit was filed.like the georgi o,the bacardi o was decorated with gold bordering,was colored in orange,and spanned most of the height of the bottle.its appearance differed in certain respects from the georgi o design,including lesser elongation,greater thickness,variable shading,and the use of a brighter variety of orange.star presented some evidence at trial suggesting that bacardi local sales representatives and regional managers were aware of georgi product and its appearance prior to the development of the bacardi o design,but no evidence of such awareness by those involved in the development of the new o design.
in march launched a new version of its bacardi silver malt beverage,under the name bacardi silver o.this product also contained the bacardi o design on the label.under new york state law,malt beverages and hard liquors may not be sold in the same stores,malt beverages being sold primarily in grocery stores while hard liquors are sold in liquor stores.
in support of its contention that consumers and tradespeople were confused by the similar labels on bacardi and georgi beverages,star presented the following evidence at trial the testimony of a star vice president that she once overheard someone standing outside a dunkin donuts casually comment to a friend that georgi vodka was a bacardi product the testimony of an employee of star distributor that he himself had assumed on first seeing the bacardi label that bacardi must have obtained star permission to use its o design,and that he once had a conversation with a liquor store owner about the potential for consumers to be confused by the similar labels and the testimony of a star employee that he once saw a consumer at a liquor store select a bottle of bacardi o in the belief that it was georgi vodka.star presented no consumer surveys or studies,while bacardi and each proffered a survey suggesting that there was no consumer confusion.
after sending a cease and desist letter to bacardi in september,star filed the instant lawsuit in may,amending its complaint to add as a defendant in may.in june star applied with the pto to register its o design a bench trial was held in the district court in july and august of.at closing argument on august,the district court inquired as to the status of star pto application,which remained pending.the district court rejected star claims in their entirety by order dated december,holding star o design not protectable as a trademark,and holding in the alternative that,assuming the georgi o design was a protectable trademark,such trademark was not infringed because star product was not likely to be confused with bacardi despite the similar o designs.judgment was entered for on all claims on january.on february,the pto approved star application to register its o design.on february,star moved in the district court to reopen the trial record to include evidence of the pto decision,seeking new conclusions of law that the design was protectable as a trademark and that there was a likelihood of confusion.the district court denied star motion by order dated march.star filed notices of appeal from the judgment on february,and from the denial of its motion to reopen on april.star asks this court to enter a permanent injunction and remand for calculation of damages,or in the alternative to remand for reconsideration after supplementing the record with evidence of the pto decision.
we conclude that the district court erred in holding star o design not protectable as a trademark.we therefore need not consider whether the district court erred in denying star motion to reopen the trial record.however,as we agree with the district court that star has not established a likelihood of confusion with bacardi product,we affirm the district court judgment for appellees.
discussion 
t o succeed in a lanham act suit for trademark infringement,a plaintiff has two obstacles to overcome the plaintiff must prove that its mark is entitled to protection and,even more important,that the defendant use of its own mark will likely cause confusion with plaintiff mark.gruner jahr usa publ g meredith,cir.we discuss these two elements of trademark infringement in turn.
protectability as a trademark 
at the time of judgment,star o design had not yet been approved for registration as a trademark by the pto.an unregistered mark is entitled to protection under the lanham act if it would qualify for registration as a trademark.see courtenay communications hall,cir.to qualify for registration a mark must be sufficiently distinctive to distinguish the registrant goods from those of others.see id.such distinctiveness may be demonstrated in either of two ways.the mark may be inherently distinctive if its intrinsic nature serves to identify its particular source.alternatively,even if not inherently distinctive,the mark may be distinctive by virtue of having acquired a secondary meaning in the minds of consumers.see two pesos,taco cabana,d hall,at.
on appeal,star does not purport to rely on a secondary meaning acquired by its o design,relying instead on inherent distinctiveness.common basic shapes or letters are,as a matter of law,not inherently distinctive.see seabrook foods,foods,implying that common basic shape or design is not inherently distinctive permatex california tube,stating that common basic shapes used as vehicles for the display of word or letter marks are not inherently distinctive.however,stylized shapes or letters may qualify,provided the design is not commonplace but rather unique or unusual in the relevant market.see,id.holding swirly circle design protectable the guiding principle in distinguishing protectable from unprotectable marks is that no one enterprise may be allowed to attain a monopoly on designs that its competitors must be able to use in order to effectively communicate information regarding their products to consumers.see restatement third of unfair competition cmts.b d virgin enters.nawab,cir explaining that a merchant who sells pencils labeled pencil and seeks to exclude other merchants from using that word is seeking an advantage the trademark law does not intend to offer.to grant such exclusivity would deprive the consuming public of the useful market information it receives where every seller of pencils is free to call them pencils.trademark protection of a sufficiently stylized version of a common shape or letter will not hamper effective competition because competitors remain free to use nonstylized forms or their own alternative stylizations of the same shape or letter to communicate information about their products.
a design used in conjunction with other marks is separately protectable in its own right if it creates a separate and distinct impression from the impression created by the other marks.this will be true if either the mark is itself inherently distinctive,see,in re servotronics,holding stylized letter s separately protectable from word in which it appeared in re roddenbery,holding combination of gold circle and colored rectangle,utilized as background to applicant advertisement for sour pickles,registrable separately from foreground elements,or if the consuming public has come to associate the separate mark in itself with the particular product,vesting it with its own distinct secondary meaning,see restatement third of unfair competition cmt.
the district court held star o design not protectable on two grounds.first,the court held that the mark was not protectable separately from the other material appearing on the georgi o label on the ground that there was a lack of evidence that it produced a separate impression among consumers.second,the court held that the mark was not protectable because it was not inherently distinctive and star had not demonstrated secondary meaning.a district court findings that a mark is not protectable as inherently distinctive is a finding of fact that we generally review for clear error.see squibb,cir.however,where the district court base d its findings upon a mistaken impression of applicable legal principles,we are not bound by the clearly erroneous standard.inwood,ives,d.
the district court erred when it described the star o as a basic geometric shape or letter,and therefore rejected inherent distinctiveness and required a showing of secondary meaning.the star o is not a common basic shape or letter,and the district court holding to the contrary was premised on a misunderstanding of this trademark law concept.unshaded linear representations of common shapes or letters are referred to as basic.they are not protectable as inherently distinctive,because to protect them as trademarks would be to deprive competitors of fundamental communicative devices essential to the dissemination of information to consumers.however,stylized letters or shapes are not basic,and are protectable when original within the relevant market.see hall,at distinguishing case of mark consisting of word displayed with distinctive typeface,color,and other design elements,which was protectable,from cases holding generic words not protectable compare roddenbery,at holding design consisting of colored circle attached to differently colored rectangle protectable as inherently distinctive with in re hillerich bradsby,noting that applicant conceded that unshaded line oval was not inherently distinctive.star o is sufficiently stylized to be inherently distinctive and therefore protectable as a trademark.it is stylized with respect to shading,border,and thickness,and each of these design elements distinguishes it from the simple or basic shapes and letters that have been held unprotectable.
the star o design had sufficient shape and color stylization to render it slightly more than a simply linear representation of an ellipse or the letter it was,furthermore,a unique design in the alcoholic beverage industry at the time it was introduced.this suffices to establish its inherent distinctiveness and thus its protectability.furthermore,the star o design is protectable separately from the other design elements on the georgi vodka label precisely because the o design is itself inherently distinctive.see in re brach sons,roddenbery,at.however,the extent of stylization was marginal at best.the outline of the o,though not uniform,is ordinary in its slightly varying width,and the interior and exterior borders are also ordinary.the result is a thin or weak mark,which will be entitled to only limited protection.see libman vining,cir.
ii.likelihood of confusion 
to prevail in a trademark infringement action under the lanham act,a plaintiff must prove,in addition to protectability of the mark,a probability of confusion,not a mere possibility,affecting numerous ordinary prudent purchasers.gruner jahr,at.likelihood of confusion includes confusion of any kind,including confusion as to source,sponsorship,affiliation,connection,or identification.guinness united distillers vintners,citing mcdonald mcbagel.in order to be confused,a consumer need not believe that the owner of the mark actually produced the item and placed it on the market.the public belief that the mark owner sponsored or otherwise approved the use of the trademark satisfies the confusion requirement.dallas cowboys cheerleaders,pussycat cinema,cir internal citations omitted.
star asserts not that consumers were likely to be confused into believing that its product was bacardi rum or that bacardi o or bacardi silver o was georgi vodka,but rather,that consumers were likely to be confused into believing that there was an affiliation,sponsorship,or other connection between the companies products.the district court analysis did not distinguish confusion as to identification or source from the kind of confusion relied on by star,as to affiliation,sponsorship,or connection.thus the district court held incorrectly that confusion was impossible as to bacardi silver o because it was not sold in the same stores as georgi vodka.the district court also relied excessively on its observation that no sober consumer would purchase rum labeled bacardi believing it to be vodka labeled georgi,despite the presence of similar orange ovals on both labels.the district court analysis misses the point of an affiliation confusion claim if star o design is,as we have held above,inherently distinctive and therefore a unique and recognizable identifier of georgi product,then the inclusion of a similar design on another company product may lead consumers to infer a relationship between the new product and star.
to determine whether there is a likelihood of confusion,we apply the polaroid balancing test introduced by judge friendly in polaroid polarad electronics,cir.the district court resolution of each separate factor is treated as a finding of fact which we review for clear error,while its balancing of the factors is treated as a matter of law subject to de novo review.see gruner jahr,at.our analysis is not mechanical,but rather,focuses on the ultimate question of whether,looking at the products in their totality,consumers are likely to be confused.see nora beverages,perrier group of,cir.the eight factors are strength of the trademark similarity of the marks proximity of the products and their competitiveness with one another evidence that the senior user may bridge the gap by developing a product for sale in the market of the alleged infringer product evidence of actual consumer confusion evidence that the imitative mark was adopted in bad faith respective quality of the products and sophistication of consumers in the relevant market.we discuss these factors in turn.
a.the polaroid factors 
the district court did not explicitly discuss the strength factor of the polaroid test,and so there appears to be no finding of fact on this issue to which we must defer.the strength of a mark is determined by its tendency to uniquely identify the source of the product.this tendency is strong to the extent that the mark is distinctive,either inherently or by virtue of having acquired secondary meaning.see savin savin group,cir.determination of strength therefore begins with inquiry as to whether the mark has the inherent distinctiveness that would entitle it to protection in the absence of secondary meaning.marks are classified,in ascending order of strength,as generic descriptive suggestive or arbitrary or fanciful.tcpip holding haar communications,cir.generic marks are those consisting of words identifying the relevant category of goods or services.they are not at all distinctive and thus are not protectable under any circumstances.id.descriptive marks are those consisting of words identifying qualities of the product.they are not inherently distinctive,but are protectable provided they have acquired secondary meaning,which we sometimes refer to as acquired distinctiveness.id.at.suggestive marks and arbitrary or fanciful marks are each inherently distinctive.id.suggestive marks are those that are not directly descriptive,but do suggest a quality or qualities of the product,through the use of imagination,thought and perception,time,petersen publ g,cir quoting stix,united merchants and.arbitrary or fanciful marks are ones that do not communicate any information about the product either directly or by suggestion.see generally abercrombie fitch hunting world,cir discussing scale of inherent distinctiveness.
among marks relying solely on inherent distinctiveness for their protectability,arbitrary or fanciful ones are the strongest.see virgin,at explaining that only marks that can be considered clearly strong based exclusively on inherent distinctiveness are those that are arbitrary or fanciful.in the absence of any showing of secondary meaning,suggestive marks are at best moderately strong.see patsy brand,realty,cir explaining that suggestive words,when rendered in sufficiently stylized script,may be strong even in absence of showing of secondary meaning lang retirement living publ g,cir explaining that suggestiveness is not necessarily dispositive of the issue of the strength of the mark,and that presence or absence of secondary meaning is relevant factor in determining suggestive mark quality and therefore its strength accord sports,prime hospitality,cir.
once a mark has been classified,the second step in determining strength is to consider its degree of distinctiveness,an inquiry that concerns both the inherent inventiveness of the mark itself and the amount of usage of the term as a mark,especially in the market in question.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,at see playtex,cir explaining that term wet ones was suggestive,not descriptive,because the term wet ones,without more,does not itself conjure up the image of a towelette.star mark is suggestive,but just barely.the o requires some thought to identify it as the first letter of orange,but,with an orange slice depicted on the label,the degree of thought is minimal.moreover,first letters to suggest descriptive words are near the bottom of the range of suggestive marks,if includable at all.compare,stroh brewery,cir holding suggestive of low alcohol beer,with heileman brewing,cir holding descriptive of low alcohol beer.furthermore,the stylizing characteristics of the mark that achieve its placement in the suggestive category are minimal.finally,star has made no showing of secondary meaning.thus,although the inherent distinctiveness of star mark invests it with some strength,see,patsy,at,all of the relevant factors combine to indicate that the mark is weak.
similarity 
the district court found that the marks lacked similarity.this holding was not clearly erroneous.the court reasoned that while the two o marks appear very similar when viewed in isolation,this similarity is tempered by the fact that the respective packaging is very different the significance of the similarity of the o designs is undercut by the dissimilarity of the products respective labels as a whole.in assessing similarity,courts look to the overall impression created by the logos and the context in which they are found and consider the totality of factors that could cause confusion among prospective purchasers.gruner jahr,at accord estee lauder,gap,cir see also king research,shulton,cir finding similarity factor weighed against finding likelihood of confusion despite similarity of marks themselves because packaging was very dissimilar.bacardi label displays the bacardi o design alone against a clear background,whereas georgi label displays the star o alongside a number of other elements and against a white background.furthermore,each label prominently displays the brand stylized bacardi logo and bat symbol on the bacardi o label,and the stylized georgi logo on the georgi o label.in light of these differences,it can not be said that the similarity factor clearly favors star,and the district court finding that it favored bacardi was not clear error.
competitive proximity 
georgi o and bacardi o are in moderate competitive proximity with one another.while the district court did not clearly state a finding that this factor favored star,it did state that georgi o vodka and bacardi o rum and malt beverage may be in competitive proximity.star,bacardi,wl,at.while this seems to imply a finding that the proximity factor favored star,appellees see it differently,see appellees br.at,and rely on the facts,found by the district court,that rum and vodka are distinct products typically displayed in separate areas of liquor stores,and that malt beverages and vodka are never sold in the same stores in new york.while the district court did find these facts,they do not require a finding that the respective products were not in competitive proximity,and the district court did not expressly state that they required such a legal conclusion.the district court did seem to imply that the fact that malt beverages and hard liquors are not sold in the same stores in new york requires that the proximity factor be held to favor as a matter of law.however,this would be erroneous under patsy,which held products to be in competitive proximity despite the fact that they were never sold in the same stores,where t he products appeal ed to the same consumers,and sale locations we re geographically close,and consumers who visited stores selling the one product we re reasonably likely to visit nearby retail stores where the other was sold,creating the opportunity for confusion.at.similarly,were we to read the district court as making a factual determination that georgi vodka and bacardi rum were not in competitive proximity,we would find that holding to be clearly erroneous,for those two products are sold in the same precise locations,frequented by the same precise consumers.
appellees contend that georgi is a third tier brand of cheap vodka that can not be considered to be in competitive proximity with bacardi premium rum products.the district court made no finding of fact
