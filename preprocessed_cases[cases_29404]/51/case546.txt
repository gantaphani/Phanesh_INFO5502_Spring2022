discussion 
under d of the lanham act,the pto may refuse to register a trademark if it so resembles a previously registered mark as to be likely,when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant,to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.d.we review a determination of likelihood of confusion as a question of law based on findings of relevant underlying facts.specialty brands,coffee bean,uspq.although we review the board ultimate legal conclusion de novo,in re int l flavors fragrances,we review the board underlying findings of fact under the substantial evidence standard.on line careline am.online.thus,we ask whether a reasonable person might find that the evidentiary record supports the board conclusion.id.at,at.when reviewing for substantial evidence,we take the entire record into account,including evidence that detracts from an agency finding as well as evidence that justifies it.id.at,at.the possibility that inconsistent conclusions may be drawn from the same record does not render a board finding unsupported by substantial evidence.in re gartside.
we determine likelihood of confusion by focusing on the question whether the purchasing public would mistakenly assume that the applicant goods originate from the same source as,or are associated with,the goods in the cited registrations.paula payne prods.johnson publ g,uspq,ccpa.we make that determination on a basis,on line careline,at,at,aided by the application of the factors set out in in re dupont denemours,uspq ccpa.those factors are 
the similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance,sound,connotation,and commercial impression.
the similarity or dissimilarity and nature of the goods described in an application or registration or in connection with which a prior mark is in use.
the similarity or dissimilarity of established,trade channels.
the conditions under which and buyers to whom sales are made,impulse careful,sophisticated purchasing.
the fame of the prior mark 
the number and nature of similar marks in use on similar goods.
the nature and extent of any actual confusion.
the length of time during and the conditions under which there has been concurrent use without evidence of actual confusion.
the variety of goods on which a mark is or is not used 
the market interface between the applicant and the owner of a prior mark 
the extent to which applicant has a right to exclude others from use of its mark on its goods.
the extent of potential confusion 
any other established fact probative of the effect of use.
id.at,uspq at.not all of the dupont factors may be relevant or of equal weight in a given case,and any one of the factors may control a particular case,in re dixie.
both the examining attorney and the board applied the relevant dupont factors to the facts of the present case.with regard to the first factor,they found that one of stroh registered marks,reg,is identical to majestic mark.they also found that a second registration,reg,is almost identical to majestic mark,but for the use of stylized lettering in the former.as pointed out by the examining attorney,because the drawing for majestic mark is in typed format and hence can potentially be represented in any manner,that stylized lettering does not provide a significant difference between the marks.we have previously held that,when word marks are identical but neither suggestive nor descriptive of the goods associated with them,the first dupont factor weighs heavily against the applicant,in re martin famous pastry shoppe,uspq,and even when goods or services are not competitive or intrinsically related,the use of identical marks can lead to the assumption that there is a common source,in re shell oil.
the board found that,if marketed under the identical mark,consumers would be likely to believe that malt liquor and tequila emanate from,or are sponsored or endorsed by,the same entity.majestic argues against the board finding,asserting that malt liquor and tequila are unrelated.first,majestic argues,malt liquor is a brewed product,whereas tequila is distilled.secondly,the pto evidence of a relationship between malt liquor and tequila consists only of articles demonstrating that malt liquor and tequila are occasionally found in some of the same places and articles relating to anheuser busch tequiza,a beer.
the pto responds,and we agree,that malt liquor and tequila are similar by virtue of the fact that both are alcoholic beverages that are marketed in many of the same channels of trade to many of the same consumers.although the pto apparently found no evidence of any manufacturer who both brews malt liquor and distills tequila,majestic has not shown that the pto lack of evidence in that regard is relevant.unless consumers are aware of the fact,if it is one,that no brewer also manufactures distilled spirits,that fact is not dispositive.the dupont factors require us to consider only trade channels,which may be,but are by no means necessarily,synonymous with manufacturing channels.in this case,majestic has not demonstrated that consumers distinguish alcoholic beverages by manufacturer rather than brand name.because substantial evidence supports the board conclusions that malt liquor and tequila are similar goods and are sold in many of the same established and trade channels,we conclude that the second and third dupont factors,respectively,weigh against majestic,as well as the first.
the fourth dupont factor seems to us to be a close question.on th
