trademark law 
the panel affirmed the district court summary judgment in favor of google,in an action under the lanham act,seeking cancellation of the google trademark on the ground that it is generic.
the panel held that a claim of genericness or genericide,where the public appropriates a trademark and uses it as a generic name for particular types of goods or services irrespective of its source,must be made with regard to a particular type of good or service.the district court thus correctly focused on internet search engines rather than the act of searching the internet.the panel also held that verb use of the word google to mean search the internet,as opposed to adjective use,did not automatically constitute generic use.the panel affirmed the district court conclusion that the plaintiffs evidence was insufficient to establish that the primary significance of the word google to the relevant public was as a generic name for internet search engines,rather than as a mark identifying the google search engine in particular.
concurring,judge watford wrote that he joined the court opinion with the caveat that the panel need not decide whether evidence of a trademark indiscriminate verb use could ever tell a jury anything about whether the public primarily thinks of the mark as the generic name for a type of good or service.
tallman,circuit judge 
between february,and march,chris gillespie used a domain name registrar to acquire domain names that included the word google.each of these domain names paired the word google with some other term identifying a specific brand,person,or product for example,googlebarackobama.net,and.
google,google objected to these registrations and promptly filed a complaint with the national arbitration forum naf,which has authority to decide certain domain name disputes under the registrar terms of use.google argued that the registrations violate the uniform domain name dispute resolution policy,which is included in the registrar terms of use,and amount to domain name infringement,colloquially known as cybersquatting.specifically,google argued that the domain names are confusingly similar to the google trademark and were registered in bad faith.the naf agreed,and transferred the domain names to google on may.
shortly thereafter,david elliott filed,and gillespie later joined an action in the arizona district court.elliott petitioned for cancellation of the google trademark under the lanham act,which allows cancellation of a registered trademark if it is primarily understood as a generic name for the goods or services,or a portion thereof,for which it is registered.elliott petitioned for cancellation on the ground that the word google is primarily understood as a generic term universally used to describe the act of internet searching.
on september,the parties filed for summary judgment on the issue of genericness.elliott requested summary judgment because it is an indisputable fact that a majority of the relevant public uses the word google as a verb,by saying i googled it,and verb use constitutes generic use as a matter of law.google maintained that verb use does not automatically constitute generic use,and that elliott failed to create even a triable issue of fact as to whether the google trademark is generic.specifically,google argued that elliott failed to present sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that the relevant public primarily understands the word google as a generic name for internet search engines.the district court agreed with google and its framing of the relevant inquiry,and granted summary judgment in its favor.
elliott raises two arguments on appeal.first,he argues that the district court misapplied the primary significance test and failed to recognize the importance of verb use.second,he argues that the district court impermissibly weighed the evidence when it granted summary judgment for google.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo and ask,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to elliott,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.kp permanent,lasting impression i,cir.citing clicks billiards,sixshooters,cir.for the reasons described below,we reject both of elliott arguments and affirm summary judgment for google.
we recognize four categories of terms with regard to potential trademark protection generic,descriptive,suggestive,and arbitrary or fanciful terms.filipino yellow pages,asian journal publ ns,cir.quoting surgicenters of,med.dental surgeries,cir.this case involves the first and fourth categories,which lie at opposite ends of the spectrum with regard to protectability.at one extreme,generic terms are common descriptive names which identify only the type of good of which the particular product or service is a species.park n fly,dollar park fly,cir,rev on other grounds.generic terms are not protectable because they do not identify the source of a product.id.at the other extreme,arbitrary or fanciful marks employ words and phrases with no commonly understood connection to the product.jl beverage jim beam brands,cir.arbitrary or fanciful marks are automatically entitled to protection because they naturally serve to identify a particular source of a product.kp permanent,at alterations omitted quoting two pesos,taco cabana.
over time,the holder of a valid trademark may become a victim of genericide.freecycle network,oey,cir.quoting thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.hereinafter mccarthy.genericide occurs when the public appropriates a trademark and uses it as a generic name for particular types of goods or services irrespective of its source.for example,aspirin,cellophane,and thermos were once protectable as arbitrary or fanciful marks because they were primarily understood as identifying the source of certain goods.but the public appropriated those marks and now primarily understands aspirin,cellophane,and thermos as generic names for those same goods.see bayer united drug,dupont cellophane waxed prods,cir.thermos aladdin,cir.the original holders of the aspirin,cellophane,and thermos marks are thus victims of genericide.
the question in any case alleging genericide is whether a trademark has taken the fateful step along the path to genericness.ty softbelly,cir.the mere fact that the public sometimes uses a trademark as the name for a unique product does not immediately render the mark generic.see.instead,a trademark only becomes generic when the primary significance of the registered mark to the relevant public is as the name for a particular type of good or service irrespective of its source.id.
we have often described this as a test.see yellow cab of sacramento yellow cab of elk grove,cir.quoting filipino yellow pages,at.if the relevant public primarily understands a mark as describing who a particular good or service is,or where it comes from,then the mark is still valid.but if the relevant public primarily understands a mark as describing what the particular good or service is,then the mark has become generic.in sum,we ask whether the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is now the product and not the producer.kellogg biscuit.
on appeal,elliott claims that he has presented sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the google trademark is generic,and that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment for google.first,he argues that the district court erred because it misapplied the primary significance test and failed to recognize the importance of verb use.specifically,he argues that the district court erroneously framed the inquiry as whether the primary significance of the word google to the relevant public is as a generic name for internet search engines,or as a mark identifying the google search engine in particular.instead,elliott argues that the court should have framed the inquiry as whether the relevant public primarily uses the word google as a verb.
we conclude that elliott proposed inquiry is fundamentally flawed for two reasons.first,elliott fails to recognize that a claim of genericide must always relate to a particular type of good or service.second,he erroneously assumes that verb use automatically constitutes generic use.for similar reasons,we conclude that the district court did not err in its formulation of the relevant inquiry under the primary significance test.
first,we take this opportunity to clarify that a claim of genericide or genericness must be made with regard to a particular type of good or service.we have not yet had occasion to articulate this requirement because parties usually present their claims in this manner sua sponte.see,kp permanent,at claiming that micro colors is generic for micropigmentation services filipino yellow pages,at claiming that filipino yellow pages is generic for telephone directories targeted at the community park n fly,at claiming that park n fly is generic for airport parking lots.but here,elliott claims that the word google has become a generic name for the act of searching the internet,and argues that the district court erred when it focused on internet search engines.we reject elliott criticism and conclude that the district court properly recognized the necessary and inherent link between a claim of genericide and a particular type of good or service.
this requirement is clear from the text of the lanham act,which allows a party to apply for cancellation of a trademark when it becomes the generic name for the goods or services for which it is registered.emphasis added.the lanham act further provides that i f the registered mark becomes the generic name for less than all of the goods or services for which it is registered,a petition to cancel the registration for only those goods or services may be filed.id.emphasis added.finally,the lanham act specifies that the relevant question under the primary significance test is whether the registered mark has become the generic name of certain goods or services.id.emphasis added.in this way,the lanham act plainly requires that a claim of genericide relate to a particular type of good or service.
we also note that such a requirement is necessary to maintain the viability of arbitrary marks as a protectable trademark category.by definition,an arbitrary mark is an existing word that is used to identify the source of a good with which the word otherwise has no logical connection.see jl beverage,at.if there were no requirement that a claim of genericide relate to a particular type of good,then a mark like ivory,which is arbitrary as applied to soap,could be cancelled outright because it is generic when used to describe a product made from the tusks of elephants.abercrombie fitch hunting world,cir.this is not how trademark law operates trademark law recognizes that a term may be unprotectable with regard to one type of good,and protectable with regard to another type of good.in this way,the very existence of arbitrary marks as a valid trademark category supports our conclusion that a claim of genericide must relate to a particular type of good or service.
second,elliott alternative inquiry fails because verb use does not automatically constitute generic use.elliott claims that a word can only be used in a trademark sense when it is used as an adjective.he supports this claim by comparing the definitions of adjectives and trademarks,noting that both adjectives and trademarks serve descriptive functions.
once again,elliott semantic argument contradicts fundamental principles underlying the protectability of trademarks.when congress amended the lanham act to specify that the primary significance test applies to claims of genericide,it specifically acknowledged that a speaker might use a trademark as the name for a product,as a noun,and yet use the mark with a particular source in mind,as a trademark.it further explained that 
a trademark can serve a dual function that of naming a product while at the same time indicating its source.admittedly,if a product is unique,it is more likely that the trademark adopted and used to identify that product will be used as if it were the identifying name of that product.but this is not conclusive of whether the mark is generic.
at.in this way,congress has instructed us that a speaker might use a trademark as a noun and still use the term in a trademark sense.
moreover,we have already implicitly rejected elliott theory that only adjective use constitutes trademark use.in overland,cir,the company sued a local restaurant for trademark infringement because its servers regularly and surreptitiously replaced customer orders for a coke with a beverage.id.at.the restaurant defended on the basis of genericide,arguing that the coke trademark had become a generic name for all cola beverages.id.at.to support its claim,the restaurant presented employee affidavits stating that the employees believed that customers who ordered a coke were using the term in a generic sense.id.we rejected these affidavits because they were not based on personal knowledge.more significant to the issue at hand,we also noted that the mere fact that customers ordered a coke,used the mark as a noun,failed to show what customers were thinking,or whether they had a particular source in mind.id.at.
if elliott were correct that a trademark can only perform its function when it is used as an adjective,then we would not have cited a need for evidence regarding the customers inner thought processes.instead,the fact that the customers used the trademark as a noun and asked for a coke would prove that they had no particular source in mind.in this way,we have implicitly rejected elliott theory that a trademark can only serve a function when it is used as an adjective.
for these reasons,the district court correctly rejected elliott theory that verb use automatically constitutes generic use moreover,the district court aptly coined the terms discriminate verb and indiscriminate verb in order to evaluate elliott proffered examples of verb use and determine whether they were also examples of generic use.although novel,these terms properly frame the relevant inquiry as whether a speaker has a particular source in mind.we have already acknowledged that a customer might use the noun coke in an indiscriminate sense,with no particular cola beverage in mind or in a discriminate sense,with a beverage in mind.in the same way,we now recognize that an internet user might use the verb google in an indiscriminate sense,with no particular search engine in mind or in a discriminate sense,with the google search engine in mind.
because a claim of genericide must relate to a particular type of good or service and because verb use does not necessarily constitute generic use,the district court did not err when it refused to frame its inquiry as whether the relevant public primarily uses the word google as a verb.moreover,the district court correctly framed its inquiry as whether the primary significance of the word google to the relevant public is as a generic name for internet search engines or as a mark identifying the google search engine in particular.we therefore evaluate elliott claim of genericide and the sufficiency of his proffered evidence under the proper inquiry.
elliott next argues that the district court must have impermissibly weighed the evidence when it granted summary judgment for google in light of the sheer quantity of evidence that elliott produced to support his claim of genericide.see jesinger.fed.credit union,cir.noting that a court must not weigh the evidence at summary judgment.we disagree.instead,we conclude that elliott admissible evidence is largely inapposite to the relevant inquiry under the primary significance test because elliott ignores the fact that a claim of genericide must relate to a particular type of good or service.
a party applying for cancellation of a registered trademark bears the burden of proving genericide by a preponderance of the evidence,mills fun,cir.moreover,the holder of a registered trademark benefits from a presumption of validity and has met its initial burden of demonstrating the lack of a genuine issue of material fact regarding genericide,at.therefore,in light of the relevant inquiry under the primary significance test,elliott was required to identify sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that the primary significance of the word google to the relevant public is as a name for internet search engines generally and not as a mark identifying the google search engine in particular.
at summary judgment,the district court assumed that a majority of the public uses the verb google to refer to the act of searching on the internet without regard to the search engine used.in other words,it assumed that a majority of the public uses the verb google in a generic and indiscriminate sense.the district court then concluded that this fact,on its own,can not support a jury finding of genericide under the primary significance test.we agree.
as explained above,a claim of genericide must relate to a particular type of good.even if we assume that the public uses the verb google in a generic and indiscriminate sense,this tells us nothing about how the public primarily understands the word itself,irrespective of its grammatical function,with regard to internet search engines.as explained below,we also agree that elliott admissible evidence only supports the favorable but insufficient inference already drawn by the district court that a majority of the public uses the verb google in a generic sense.standing in isolation this fact is insufficient to support a jury finding of genericide.the district court therefore properly granted summary judgment for google.
we begin with elliott three consumer surveys.consumer surveys may be used to support a claim of genericide so long as they are conducted according to accepted principles.stuhlbarg int l sales john brush,cir.here,the district court properly excluded two of elliott consumer surveys because they were not conducted according to accepted principles.specifically,these surveys were designed and conducted by elliott counsel,who is not qualified to design or interpret surveys.see federal judicial center,reference manual on scientific evidence ed.explaining that valid survey design typically requires graduate training or professional experience in survey research 
the district court properly considered only elliott third survey,which was conducted by james berger a qualified survey expert.elliott third survey is a thermos survey,which generally puts the respondent in an imaginary situation and asks how the respondent would ask for the type of good for which the trademark is alleged to be generic.mccarthy citing am.thermos prods.aladdin,supp,aff,cir.here,berger asked respondents if you were going to ask a friend to search for something on the internet,what word or phrase would you use to tell what you want to do over half of the respondents answered this question by using the word google as a verb.
although verb use does not automatically constitute generic use,the district court allowed berger to rely on the third survey to offer his expert opinion that a majority of the public uses the word google as a generic and indiscriminate verb to mean search on the internet.in this way,elliott admissible consumer survey evidence goes no further than supporting the favorable inference already drawn by the district court 
we next consider elliott examples of alleged generic use by the media and by consumers.documented examples of generic use might support a claim of genericide if they reveal a prevailing public consensus regarding the primary significance of a registered trademark.see mccarthy explaining that generic use by the media is a strong indication of the general public perception quoting murphy door bed interior sleep,cir.however,if the parties offer competing examples of both generic and trademark use,this source of evidence is typically insufficient to prove genericide.see id.
initially,we note that elliott admissible examples are only examples of verb use.to repeat,verb use does not automatically constitute generic use.for instance,elliott purports to offer an example of generic use by,a popular rap music artist.but we will not assume that is using the word google in a generic sense simply because he tells listeners to google his name,bottlez,on revolver rca records.without further evidence regarding inner thought process,we can not tell whether he is using google in a discriminate or indiscriminate sense.in this way,many of elliott admissible examples do not even support the favorable inference that a majority of the relevant public uses the verb google in a generic sense.
elliott also attempted to offer clear examples of indiscriminate verb use by the media and by consumers.for example,in response to google motion for summary judgment,he produced a transcript from an episode of a german television show in which a character claims to have googled at wikipedia.elliott also produced examples in which the media uses phrases like googled on ebay,googled on facebook,and googled on pinterest.finally,elliott produced evidence suggesting that certain consumers claimed that they accessed a website by googling it,even though those consumers actually accessed the website through a search engine.
the district court properly excluded these examples of indiscriminate verb use because they were not disclosed during discovery and because elliott failed to show that his delay was substantially justified or harmless.fed.civ.c see also yeti by molly,deckers outdoor,cir.w e give particularly wide latitude to the district court discretion to issue discovery sanctions.moreover,even if these examples had been timely disclosed,they are largely irrelevant because they only support the favorable inference already drawn by the district court.
we next consider elliott proffered expert testimony.each of elliott experts,including berger,patrick farrell,and allan metcalf,opine that the word google is used in a generic sense when it is used as a verb on its face,this testimony simply supports the favorable inference already drawn by the district court.
next,we consider elliott proffered dictionary evidence.see mccarthy noting that dictionary definitions are sometimes persuasive in determining public usage.elliott does not present any examples where google is defined as a generic name for internet search engines.instead,elliott presents secondary definitions where google is defined as a verb.see,google,last visited,defining google primarily as a trademark but secondarily as a verb meaning to search for something on the internet using a search engine google,ogle last visited,defining google primarily as the brand name of a leading internet search engine but secondarily as a verb meaning to search the internet for information about something.once again,elliott proffered dictionary evidence only supports the favorable inference already drawn by the district court 
next,we consider elliott claim that google has used its own trademark in a generic sense.generic use of a mark by the holder of that mark can support a finding of genericide.see mccarthy.however,elliott has not presented an example of generic use by google.instead,elliott has presented an email from google cofounder larry page,which encourages recipients to h ave fun and keep googling once again,elliott relies on an example of verb use.elliott has not shown,nor is it likely that he could show,that the cofounder of google had no particular search engine in mind when he told recipients of the google friends newsletter to keep googling.
finally,we consider elliott claim that there is no efficient alternative for the word google as a name for the act of searching the internet regardless of the search engine used.once again,a claim of genericide must relate to a particular type of good or service.in order to show that there is no efficient alternative for the word google as a generic term,elliott must show that there is no way to describe internet search engines without calling them googles.because not a single competitor calls its search engine a google,and because members of the consuming public recognize and refer to different internet search engines,elliott has not shown that there is no available substitute for the word google as a generic term.compar
