software,software is the owner of,a federally registered trademark that is used in conjunction with business management and interactive media application goods and services for the film and music industry.madacy entertainment,handleman company,and sfx entertainment collectively,madacy began using entertainment as a trademark for their new record label venture.following failed licensing negotiations between the parties,software filed suit against madacy in early.a week after software filed its suit against madacy,madacy began phasing out the use of its entertainment mark.
software argued that madacy use of the entertainment mark infringed software trademark and would cause a likelihood of confusion.specifically,software complaint alleged madacy had committed federal trademark infringement,false designation and description of origin,and trademark dilution state trademark dilution,injury to business reputation,and unfair trade practices and common law trademark infringement,passing off,and unfair competition.
on january,the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of madacy.the district court ruled that no rational trier of fact could find a likelihood of forward confusion among either general consumers or music industry members or a likelihood of reverse confusion among music industry members.
a jury trial commenced on may.the only issue that went to the jury was whether there was a likelihood of reverse confusion among general consumers,consumers who were not members of the music industry.in other words,the jury was asked to decide whether general consumers would mistakenly believe that they were purchasing madacy products when in fact,they were purchasing software products.
three days later,the jury returned a verdict in favor of madacy,finding that it was not liable for reverse trademark confusion among general consumers.the district court entered judgment in favor of madacy.
software timely filed its amended notice of appeal.it now challenges the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of madacy the district court denial of software motion for reconsideration of partial summary judgment the district court entry of judgment as a matter of law for sfx entertainment the district court evidentiary rulings on motions in limine the district court jury instructions and special verdict form and the district court decision to bifurcate the trial by first presenting the liability claim to the jury.software also asks for attorneys fees under the lanham act.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
ii.facts and procedural history 
in,metabolic music,adopted as a brand and trade name.metabolic music later amended its corporate name to software.on august,metabolic music submitted a trademark application to the united states patent and trademark office uspto for federal registration of its word mark.approximately fourteen months later,the uspto granted registration number for the trademark and entered the mark on the principal register.the mark is now deemed incontestable by the uspto pursuant to 
software trademark application stated that the mark would be used in conjunction with 
computer software featuring business management applications for the film and music industries and interactive multimedia applications for entertainment,education and information,in the nature of artists performances and biographical information from the film and music industries and instructions and information playing musical instruments.
software primarily developed and licensed database software used for processing and managing data of major record companies musical works.software two database programs are called the record label management system rlms and the music publisher management system mpms software licensed these databases to several record companies.
using these database programs,software also provided music content administration services.these administration services include processing of record labels album catalogs,song catalogs,artist and band rosters,and sales information briefing of recording artist and producer contracts and generating royalty statements and reports.
in addition to providing database products and music content administration services to major record companies,a small portion of software is devoted to music production.particularly,software sells a small line of interactive music on,floppy media,and cds.these interactive music products bear the,interactive,or music marks and are offered for sale on software internet website and at the website.
madacy,the alleged infringer,is a recording and distribution company that specializes in collections of recorded music.generally,madacy licenses the music it distributes from other companies,such as bmg music.
in,madacy created a new division named entertainment.the new division would use entertainment as the trademark for its cds featuring a line of music tied to local professional sports teams.madacy filed an trademark application with the uspto for its entertainment mark in august 
on december,software sent cease and desist letters to madacy chief executive officer and to sfx entertainment chairman,demanding that the companies stop using software senior and federally registered trademark following receipt of these letters,a representative from madacy approached software with an offer to enter a licensing agreement for the trademark.
while licensing negotiations were underway between madacy and software,madacy ran a advertising supplement in the february,edition of billboard magazine.the supplement promoted madacy twentieth anniversary,and the launch of madacy new entertainment branded record label venture.a of the supplement was devoted to an ad bearing madacy entertainment logo.
as a result of this advertising supplement,software commenced the present suit against madacy on march.nearly a week later,madacy began phasing out its entertainment mark.
in its suit against madacy,software alleged that madacy use of the entertainment mark infringed software federally registered trademark and would cause a likelihood of confusion.specifically,software claimed in its complaint that by using the entertainment mark,madacy had committed trademark infringement in violation of false designation and description of origin in violation of a trademark dilution in violation of c state trademark dilution and injury to business reputation in violation of california business and professions code section state unfair trade practices in violation of california business and professions code section and common law trademark infringement,passing off,and unfair competition.
the case was assigned to judge lourdes baird in the central district of california.on january,judge baird granted partial summary judgment in favor of madacy.judge baird ruled that there was no triable issue of likelihood of forward confusion among general consumers and music industry members,or of likelihood of reverse confusion among music industry members.the district court ruling was based,in part,on software,viacom,d.
approximately three weeks after the district court granted partial summary judgment against software,we reversed the viacom decision by a memorandum disposition.see software,viacom.cir,mem.following our remand of viacom on may,the case was randomly reassigned to judge howard matz.because both the current case and the viacom case involved the alleged infringement of the mark,the current case was reassigned from judge baird to judge matz on may.
nearly a year before the jury trial commenced,software filed with judge matz a motion for reconsideration of judge baird january,partial summary judgment order.the basis of software motion for reconsideration was that the ninth circuit unpublished memorandum disposition in viacom constituted new law that warranted reversal of judge baird order.judge matz ruled that viacom was not an intervening change in ninth circuit law and denied software motion for reconsideration on july.
judge matz later ruled on numerous motions in limine,and a jury trial commenced on may.the trial was restricted to the remaining issue of reverse confusion whether general consumers who were not music industry members would mistakenly believe that they were purchasing madacy products while in fact they were purchasing software products.
before the case was submitted to the jury,sfx entertainment one of madacy moved for judgment as a matter of law,arguing that sfx entertainment was not directly involved with the alleged trademark infringement.the district court agreed and granted sfx entertainment judgment as a matter of law on may.
a day later,the jury returned a special verdict finding madacy not liable.the district court entered judgment against software on may,and software timely filed its amended notice of appeal on june.
iii.analysis 
software now appeals the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of madacy the district court denial of software motion for reconsideration of partial summary judgment the district court entry of judgment as a matter of law for sfx entertainment the district court evidentiary rulings on certain motions in limine the district court decision to bifurcate the trial and the district court jury instructions and special verdict form.furthermore,software seeks attorneys fees under the lanham act.as discussed below,we affirm because the district court did not err in determining there was no likelihood of confusion between the marks.in addition,the district court acted within its discretion in managing the trial and any errors were harmless.
a.the district court grant of partial summary judgment 
this case deals with two distinct claims in the trademark infringement context forward confusion and reverse confusion.surfvivor media,survivor,cir.forward confusion occurs when consumers mistakenly associate a junior user mark with that of a senior mark.dreamwerks prod.group,skg studio,cir.reverse confusion cases,however,involve consumers dealing with a senior believing all the while that they are doing business with a junior user.see surfvivor media,at.
both reverse and forward confusion cases require the plaintiff to demonstrate a likelihood of confusion among consumers.therefore,to survive summary judgment on its forward confusion claim in this case,software must raise a material question of fact whether the general public and the music industry members thought that software was the source of madacy cds.furthermore,to withstand summary judgment on its reverse confusion claim,software must demonstrate that a question of material fact remains whether music industry members believed that madacy was the source of software goods.
the test of trademark infringement under state,federal,and common law is whether there will be a likelihood of confusion see cleary news,cir.to determine whether there is a likelihood of confusion between the parties allegedly related goods and services,we consider the following eight sleekcraft factors strength of the mark proximity of the goods similarity of the marks evidence of actual confusion marketing channels used type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser defendant intent in selecting the mark and likelihood of expansion of the product lines.see amf sleekcraft boats,cir.
some sleekcraft factors are much more important than others,and the relative importance of each individual factor will be case specific.brookfield,at.in essence,t he test for likelihood of confusion is whether a reasonably prudent consumer in the marketplace is likely to be confused as to the origin of the good or service bearing one of the marks.dreamwerks prod.group,at.
the district court did not analyze each sleekcraft factor separately.instead,the district court discussed each factor in the context of the facts that are marshaled by each side.the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of madacy.the court ruled as a matter of law that there was no likelihood of forward confusion among either general consumers or music industry members,and that there was no likelihood of reverse confusion among music industry members.
we review summary judgments de novo.see clicks billiards,sixshooters,cir.as we now explain,an analysis of the sleekcraft factors supports the conclusion of the district court that there was no triable issue of the likelihood of confusion.
strength of mark 
trademarks are categorized as generic,descriptive,suggestive,and arbitrary or fanciful.see two pesos,taco cabana,d.a generic mark is the least distinctive,and an arbitrary or fanciful mark is the most distinctive.see,walt disney,cir.the more distinctive a mark,the greater its conceptual strength in other words,a mark conceptual strength is proportional to the mark distinctiveness.
in analyzing the first sleekcraft factor,the district court was presented with evidence that software first used the mark in commerce in january,registered the mark with the uspto in,and devoted resources to maintaining the mark.and up to late,software had scant sales of its cd products and devoted a meager investment of in direct advertising for these products.
the district court,when it conducted its sleekcraft analysis,relied heavily on software scant sales of,at most,cds,and its meager advertising expenditures for its cd products.on the basis of software scant sales and meager advertising expenditures,the court concluded that even though the fanciful mark was conceptually strong,no reasonable trier of fact could find for software on the issue of likelihood of forward confusion as to the general public.software argues that,by considering its scant sales and meager advertising expenditures,the district court erroneously required that software fanciful mark acquire a secondary meaning.we disagree.
a mark overall strength is relative and can not be determined by mechanistically assessing its conceptual or commercial strengths.our court has previously recognized that a suggestive or descriptive mark,which is conceptually weak,can have its overall strength as a mark bolstered by its commercial success.see,entrepreneur media,smith,cir recognizing that an otherwise inherently weak mark may be strengthened by such factors as extensive advertising,length of exclusive use,public recognition citation and internal quotation marks omitted,at stating that goto tremendous success strengthened its otherwise suggestive mark brookfield,at noting that placement within the conceptual distinctiveness spectrum is not the only determinant of a mark strength,as advertising expenditures can transform a suggestive mark into a strong mark where,for example,that mark has achieved actual marketplace recognition internal citation omitted sleekcraft,at stating that a suggestive mark may be strengthened by advertising otherwise the weak mark is entitled to a restricted range of protection.but we have never held that an arbitrary or fanciful mark,a conceptually strong mark can have its overall strength diminished by feeble commercial success.we decline to do so today.rather,we hold that a lack of commercial strength can not diminish the overall strength of a conceptually strong mark so as to render it undeserving of protection.otherwise,a mark which is conceptually strong may never have the opportunity to blossom into its full commercial potential through effective marketing.
that being said,we conclude that the first sleekcraft factor weighs in software favor,and that the district court properly considered the overall strength of the mark.indeed,the district court acknowledged that software mark was fanciful,and incontestable the district court then weighed the remaining sleekcraft factors based on the overall strength of the mark,and the court focused on the ultimate question posed by the sleekcraft analysis the likelihood of confusion as to the source of the product.
ii.proximity of goods 
when dealing with the second sleekcraft factor,the courts assess whether the goods are related or complementary.sleekcraft,at.where the goods are related or complementary,the danger of confusion is heightened.see id.it is undisputed that software distributes a line of products that includes audio cds and has a website that provides audio content for downloading.at a minimum,both software and madacy distributed music and cds.therefore this sleekcraft factor weighs in software favor,but only slightly because the genres of the music cds are very significantly different see sleekcraft,at noting that goods are proximate if the goods are similar in use and function.thus,the district court did not err in ruling that this factor,if it can support plaintiff case at all,does so very slightly.
iii.similarity of marks 
the similarity of marks has always been considered a critical question in the analysis.see,at.similarity of marks is assessed in terms of their sight,sound,and meaning.official airline guides,goss,cir citations omitted.moreover,the trademark is not judged by an examination of its parts,but rather the validity and distinctiveness of a composite trademark is determined by viewing the trademark as a whole,as it appears in the marketplace.id.
software stresses that madacy entertainment mark was identical to its mark in both sight and sound.madacy,on the other hand,argues that the two marks are not sufficiently similar because the in madacy entertainment mark is highly stylized and conjoined with the entertainment,lacks the oval which appears around software mark,and is used in connection with other more distinctive marks like the lakers or the nba.
the district court compared the marks and took into account the similarity of the sight,sound,and meaning of the two marks.after considering the addition of entertainment by madacy,the use of the mark interactive in addition to on software cds,the use of other marks in addition to entertainment on madacy cds,and the fanciful nature of software mark,the district court ruled that the third sleekcraft factor weighed only very slightly in software favor.this ruling was not erroneous.the district court considered the marks in their entirety and as they appear ed in the marketplace.alpha,alpha steel tube shapes,cir see also lindy pen.bic pen,cir the two marks viewed in isolation are indeed identical,but their similarity must be considered in light of the way the marks are encountered in the marketplace and the circumstances surrounding the purchase of the products.
iv.evidence of actual confusion 
evidence that use of the two marks has already led to confusion is persuasive proof that future confusion is likely.sleekcraft,at.as evidence of actual confusion,software attempted to offer a likelihood of confusion survey in its opposition to madacy summary judgment motion.the district court,as discussed below,properly excluded software survey.
software now attempts to offer evidence of actual confusion among one of its previous customers allegedly caused by madacy use of the mark.specifically,software contends that patricia weymss,a record label executive formerly employed by an software licensee,informed software that she saw an ad in which madacy was using the entertainment mark.
in the lower court proceedings,however,software did not discuss weymss deposition testimony.the deposition transcripts were merely attached as an exhibit to madacy summary judgment motion and as an exhibit to a declaration filed by software in opposition to madacy summary judgment motion.in its opposition to madacy summary judgment motion,software failed to raise the issue or argue that weymss was confused by madacy use of the entertainment mark.thus,software can not offer this evidence on appeal.see harkins amusement,cinema,cir stating that only those items referred to in parties partial summary judgment memoranda in trial court could be considered on appeal and that the panel analysis was limited to the factual assertions raised in the district court papers.
even if we consider weymss testimony,the evidence fails to show actual confusion see sleekcraft,at noting that courts have often discounted such evidence because it was unclear or insubstantial.at best,the evidence demonstrates that weymss was reminded of software when she saw madacy advertisement bearing the entertainment mark.for example,weymss testified i saw the advertisement.i saw.i remembered software president.i had spoken to him in months.i said,oh,i should give him a call and say hi.absent additional evidence,weymss testimony was not enough to demonstrate actual confusion.see cohn petsmart,cir noting that while enquiry evidence is admissible and relevant,standing alone with no other evidence it is insufficient proof of actual confusion.citation omitted.therefore,the fourth sleekcraft factor weighs in madacy favor.
marketing channels used 
convergent marketing channels increase the likelihood of confusion,cir.the district court ruled that the fifth sleekcraft factor weighed,at best,only very slightly in software favor.the district court determined that there was no significant overlap in advertising markets.the court concluded that the only overlap between madacy and software goods occurred on the website,where the music cds of both companies could potentially have been purchased.
software takes issue with the district court conclusion and argues that madacy uses the same marketing channels because madacy also launched its entertainment branded record label during a music industry trade show because both software mark and madacy entertainment mark had been advertised in similar magazines and because both software and madacy had established a music industry presence in los angeles,new york,miami,and nashville.software,however,fails to discuss important distinctions in the marketing channels used.software promoted its products in specialty music industry publications,whereas madacy did not promote its entertainment cds in these publications.furthermore,software argues that both marks were launched at the same trade show.however,even though madacy launched its entertainment record label at the same trade show,it did so nearly a decade after software launched its products.
next,even though both software and madacy offered their cds for sale over the internet in general,and on in particular,software failed to provide evidence of sales attributable to software website.finally,unlike madacy music albums,software products were not sold in retail outlets.in light of these differences,we conclude that the district court erred,although harmlessly,in ruling that this factor slightly favored software.our weighing of the factor tilts strongly toward madacy,and weighs heavily in the ultimate assessment that there was no triable issue of the likelihood of confusion.
vi.type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser 
the type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the consumer is the sixth sleekcraft factor to be considered.in this case,software offers two discrete types of products,each with a distinct group of purchasers.
the first type includes record label and music management administration database programs including the rlms and mpms programs.the primary audience for the record label and music management administration database software products comprises music industry professionals.
the purchasers of the record label and music management databases and associated services are highly sophisticated members of the music industry.regardless of any trademark,they would be well informed about the nature of a database program and its producer before making a purchasing decision.thus,the possibility that these members of the music industry would be confused about the record label and music management products and services is almost nil.
the second type includes musical works offered on audio cds and interactive,for example.of the copies of the musical works distributed by software,cds at most were purchased by consumers at large.the remaining copies were distributed to various people and not directly sold by software.
in contrast to those purchasing the record label and music management databases,the purchasers of the musical works audio cds,for example are less sophisticated.even though more than half of the copies of software musical works were distributed to people in the music industry,copies of the musical works were sold to consumers at large.e quity will protect even the uncommonly naive against deception from unfair competition.stork,sahati,cir.thus,likelihood of confusion of the casual consumer and the discerning buyer must be considered.oriental foods,chun king sales,cir.
the district court,in performing its sleekcraft analysis,properly considered both the general consumers and the music industry members.the district court concluded that the sixth sleekcraft factor weighed in madacy favor.this conclusion was not erroneous because software failed to demonstrate that a reasonable jury could find for software on the possibility of confusion among the casual consumer confusion would be even less likely among the discerning music industry members.
vii.defendant intent in selecting the mark 
it is settled that a party claiming trademark infringement need not demonstrate that the alleged infringer intended to deceive consumers.gallo winery gallo cattle,cir.when the alleged infringer knowingly adopts a mark similar to another,we must presume that the public will be deceived.see sleekcraft,at.
software presented evidence that madacy was aware of software mark.specifically,software demonstrated that madacy conducted a trademark search for record label uses prior to the launch of its entertainment mark which uncovered software mark.software claims that this is proof of madacy wrongful intent.software overstates madacy ill intentions.in fact,as a result of the search,madacy attorney believed that madacy could carve out a mark,even with the existence of software mark.
the district court ruled that even though madacy exercised questionable judgment in proceeding with the entertainment mark in the face of the mark,software failed to present evidence that would justify a trier of fact in concluding that madacy,with years of experience in the music industry and the ability to produce almost cds in less time than software could sell cds,had any intention of capitalizing on software trademark.we agree and hold that the district court did not err in concluding that the seventh sleekcraft intent factor also leans towards madacy favor.
viii.likelihood of expansion of the product lines 
software claims that because it began to broaden marketing of its interactive content on the internet,the eighth sleekcraft factor should weigh in its favor.however,there is a need for a strong possibility of expansion into competing markets for this factor to weigh in favor of a finding of infringement.gallo,at emphasis added.software sold no more than cds over a period.this undermines software claims that there was a strong possibility of it expanding into competing was doubtful that software would expand into general retail distribution of audio cds.thus,this sleekcraft factor also favors madacy.
to prevail on the ultimate question toward which the sleekcraft analysis is likelihood of confusion of software must show sufficient evidence to permit a rational trier of fact to find that confusion is probable,not merely possible.murray cnbc,cir.software failed to make such a showing.in sum,madacy use of the mark was not likely to confuse an appreciable number of people as to the source of the product.entrepreneur media,at emphasis added.therefore,we hold that the district court did not err in its weighing of the sleekcraft factors and in reaching the overall conclusion that software had failed to raise a triable issue as to a likelihood of confusion 
b.the district court denial of software motion for reconsideration 
we review a district court denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion.see kona,estate of bishop,cir.
software contends that judge matz erred in denying its motion for reconsideration of judge baird order granting partial summary judgment in favor of madacy.according to software,judge baird order was based on software,viacom,which was subsequently reversed in an unpublished decision.software argues that because our unpublished memorandum disposition reversing viacom constituted new law,judge matz should have reconsidered judge baird order granting partial summary judgment in favor of madacy.
contrary to software contentions,the order granting partial summary judgment against software relied on the viacom decision only for the narrow proposition that the recognition of software trademark in the software field was not likely to spill over into the musical cd field.moreover,judge baird accepted that there was some theoretical relationship between the two fields.software,however,failed to present evidence to create the inference that there was an actual marketing relationship,one that might be reflected in sales,business opportunities,or recognition.emphasis in original.
because judge baird reasoning and legal conclusions for granting partial summary judgment in favor of madacy were supported by other case law,her minimal reliance on the later reversed viacom decision was irrelevant.thus,judge matz properly ruled that the unpublished memorandum disposition for viacom was not binding precedent,see ninth circuit rule a stating that unpublished dispositions of the circuit are not binding precedent except under relevant exceptions,and did not err in denying software motion for reconsideration.
judgment as a matter of law for sfx entertainment 
a district court grant of a motion for judgment as a matter of law is reviewed de novo.see horphag research pellegrini,cir.in reviewing a judgment as a matter of law,the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of that party.id.
before the case was submitted to the jury,sfx entertainment alleged that it was not directly involved with the trademark infringement.the district court agreed and granted judgment as a matter of law in sfx entertainment favor.
this ruling was proper.software did not present any evidence that sfx entertainment was involved in the production,manufacturing,marketing,sale,or distribution of entertainment products.there was no evidence that sfx entertainment,the parent company,was liable for the actions of alphabet city,its subsidiary.the district court therefore did not err in granting sfx entertainment judgment as a matter of law because a reasonable jury would not find any liability for sfx entertainment.
d.the district court evidentiary rulings 
software also challenges many of the district court evidentiary rulings.software contends that the district court erred by excluding a likelihood of confusion survey conducted on behalf of software excluding evidence of madacy common manufacture of allegedly related products excluding evidence of software successful enforcement of its trademark and admitting evidence of potential infringers of the mark.
a district court evidentiary rulings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see city of long beach standard oil,cir.prejudice must be shown to warrant a reversal.see id.as explained below,the district court did not abuse its discretion in any of the evidentiary rulings of which software presently complains.
exclusion of software likelihood of confusion survey 
admissibility of a survey is a threshold question that must be resolved by a judge.see clicks billiards,at treatment of surveys is a process.first,is the survey admissible that is,is there a proper foundation for admissibility,and is it relevant and conducted according to accepted principles this threshold question may be determined by the judge.internal citations omitted.surveys in trademark cases are to be admitted as long as they are conducted according to accepted principles.prudential ins.gibraltar fin,cir.
software survey was twice excluded by the district court because it was not created or conducted in a manner that complied with appropriate standards.the survey was excluded for the first time by judge baird when the court granted partial summary judgment against software.the survey was excluded a second time by judge matz when the court ruled on evidentiary matters.
both district judges properly rejected the software survey because the survey creator did not qualify as an expert on designing or analyzing consumer surveys.moreover,software failed to show that the survey was conducted in accordance with generally accepted survey principl
