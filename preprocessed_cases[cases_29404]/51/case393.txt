in its appeal,the idaho potato commission ipc challenges the district court ruling that a provision in its certification mark licensing agreement with g t terminal packaging g t is unenforceable.g t appeals several damages awards to ipc for breach of contract and violation of the lanham act,as well as an award of attorney fees and costs.we have jurisdiction over these appeals pursuant to.
agreeing with the second circuit in idaho potato commission m m produce farm sales,cir m m iii,cert.denied,d,we hold that the provision in ipc licensing agreement is unenforceable.we also affirm the district court and damages awards to ipc.we reverse,however,the contract damages award to ipc,and vacate the award of attorney fees and costs to ipc and remand those matters to the district court for reconsideration in light of our limited reversal.
facts and procedural background 
ipc is a agency of the state of idaho formed for the purpose of promoting idaho potatoes.see hapco farms,idaho potato comm n,cir.ipc finances its promotional work in part by licensing several certification marks for idaho potatoes including idaho and grown in idaho.g t is a wholesale distributor of potatoes.beginning in,g t entered into a series of licenses with ipc to use ipc certification marks.the most recent of these licenses expired on september.this license contained provisions in which g t recognized the validity of ipc marks and agreed not to challenge ipc rights in the marks while the license was in effect or after its expiration.
in february,ipc filed this action in the united states district court for the district of idaho against g ipc alleged that g t had breached its licensing agreement and infringed ipc certification marks by,inter alia,failing to keep adequate records and using unlicensed potato repackers.in july,g t filed a complaint in intervention in three consolidated cases involving ipc and potato wholesalers in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.g t complaint in intervention alleged that ipc certification marks were unenforceable and subject to cancellation under the lanham act.the new york district court stayed further proceedings in ipc idaho case against g t pending resolution of the issues raised in g t complaint.the new york court eventually dismissed g t claims,concluding that the eleventh amendment shielded ipc from suit m m ii,d at.
after dismissal of g t new york action,this idaho case was reactivated in march.ipc added a breach of contract claim based on g t new york complaint,alleging that g t had violated the clause in its license and seeking to recover ipc costs in defending the suit.the idaho district court granted partial summary judgment for ipc,concluding that g t had breached the licensing agreement as a matter of law.it denied summary judgment on the issue of damages,however,determining that an issue of fact remained as to the amount ipc spent defending against g t claims.in april,the remaining issues in the case proceeded to trial.
on july,after trial but before the district court rendered judgment,the second circuit issued a decision holding the provision of ipc license agreement unenforceable.m m iii,at.based on m m iii,g t moved for reconsideration of the district court ruling that g t new york complaint breached the provision of its licensing agreement.the district court granted g t motion,and elected to follow m m iii.it thus vacated its previous grant of summary judgment to ipc on that issue.
in october,the district court awarded ipc as a result of g t violation of an ipc rule requiring that idaho potato packaging identify the variety of potatoes contained therein as a result of g t failure to preserve all of its records of sales and purchases of idaho potatoes in violation of its licensing agreement statutory damages of for g t violation of the lanham act by purchasing bags with ipc certification mark on them and using them to package potatoes after g t license to use the mark had expired and ipc costs.ipc later requested an award of attorney fees pursuant to the license agreement and g t made a motion to amend the court findings and conclusions and to alter or amend the judgment.the court denied g t motion and awarded ipc percent of its requested attorney fees.
ipc challenges the district court ruling that the provision in its licensing agreement is unenforceable.g t contests the propriety of each of the court damages awards and its award of ipc attorney fees and costs.
ipc provision 
ipc asks us to disagree with m m iii and hold the provision in its licensing agreement enforceable.g t argues that issue preclusion bars ipc from litigating the issue in this court and that,in the event we reach the merits of the dispute,we should adopt the second circuit approach.
issue preclusion 
g t relies on the doctrine of issue preclusion,or collateral estoppel,to argue that m m iii bars ipc from relitigating the issue of whether the provision is enforceable 
issue preclusion can apply only if m m iii gave ipc a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue the issue was actually litigated in m m iii ipc lost on the issue as a result of a final judgment in m m iii and ipc was a party or in privity with a party in m m iii.united states internal revenue serv.palmer in re palmer,cir.the parties appear to agree that these elements are met.
nonetheless,ipc argues that because it is a state agency it is not subject to issue preclusion on issues of law.in united states mendoza,d,the supreme court held that nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel did not apply against the federal government so as to preclude relitigation of the issues in that case.despite the supreme court previous approval of the use of nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel by private litigants,mendoza recognized that the government differs from private litigants in the geographic breadth of its litigation and in the nature of the issues it pursues.id.at.government litigation frequently involves legal questions of substantial public importance indeed,because the proscriptions of the united states constitution are so generally directed at governmental action,many constitutional questions can arise only in the context of litigation to which the government is a party.it noted that 
a rule allowing nonmutual collateral estoppel against the government in such cases would substantially thwart the development of important questions of law by freezing the first final decision rendered on a particular legal issue.allowing only one final adjudication would deprive this court of the benefit it receives from permitting several courts of appeals to explore a difficult question before this court grants certiorari.indeed,if nonmutual estoppel were routinely applied against the government,this court would have to revise its practice of waiting for a conflict to develop before granting the government petitions for certiorari.
id.at.citations omitted.
mendoza rationale applies with equal force to g t attempt to assert nonmutual defensive collateral estoppel against ipc a state agency.see coeur tribe of idaho hammond,cir relying on mendoza reasoning to conclude,under idaho state law preclusion principles,that nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel did not preclude a state agency from relitigating a legal issue that had previously been determined against the agency by a state court hercules carriers,claimant state of,cir applying mendoza to hold that nonmutual defensive collateral estoppel did not operate against a state government.we therefore hold that issue preclusion does not prevent ipc from challenging the district court determination that the clause of ipc licensing agreement is unenforceable.because g t can not collaterally estop ipc from relitigating the issue,we go on to assess the validity of ipc provision.
in m m iii,the second circuit held that m m produce farm sales m m could challenge the validity of ipc certification mark for idaho potatoes in spite of a provision in a licensing agreement between the two.at.m m former licensing agreement contained a provision,like the one in g t license,in which m m recognized the validity of ipc certification marks and promised not to challenge the marks during the license term or after its expiration.see id.at.m m sought to challenge the validity of the certification marks nonetheless,arguing that the provision was unenforceable because it violated the public policy underlying the lanham act.id.the second circuit applied the balancing test articulated by the supreme court in lear,adkins,d,to determine that the provision should not be enforced.see m m iii,at.
lear involved a dispute between a patent holder and a licensee who sought to challenge the validity of the patent based upon which it had agreed to pay royalties.at.the court held that licensee estoppel did not preclude the licensee challenge,overruling a previous decision holding that a licensee operating under a license agreement generally could not simultaneously challenge the validity of the underlying patent.id.at.see also automatic radio hazeltine research.the court reasoned that 
surely the equities of the licensor do not weigh very heavily when they are balanced against the important public interest in permitting full and free competition in the use of ideas which are in reality a part of the public domain.licensees may often be the only individuals with enough economic incentive to challenge the patentability of an inventor discovery.if they are muzzled,the public may continually be required to pay tribute to monopolists without need or justification.we think it plain that the technical requirements of contract doctrine must give way before the demands of the public interest in the typical situation involving the negotiation of a license after a patent has issued.
lear,at.the court also refused to enforce a provision of the parties license agreement that would have required the licensee to pay royalties until a court held the patent invalid.id.at.it noted that 
the parties contract,however,is no more controlling on this issue than is the state doctrine of estoppel,which is also rooted in contract principles.the decisive question is whether overriding federal policies would be significantly frustrated if licensees could be required to pay royalties during the time they are challenging patent validity in the courts.
id.at.the lear court thus balanced the policies underlying state contract law against those animating federal patent law in placing limits on the parties contractual obligations.
in m m iii,the second circuit noted that courts had frequently applied the lear balancing test to trademark licensing contracts.at.it went on to observe that courts have generally precluded licensee challenges to trademarks after weighing the public interest in trademarks against contract principles.id.citing mws wire,cal.fine wire,cir,and beer nuts,king nut,cir.it concluded that the trademark cases were not controlling in the certification mark context,however,because the two types of marks serve different public interests.id.at.
trademarks protect the public from confusion by accurately indicating the source of a product.they preserve a producer good will in order that the purchasing public may not be enticed into buying a product when it wants b product.id.quoting t t cross,cir.trademark owners have a monopoly over their marks,which they can license as they see fit as long as such licensing does not cause public confusion.id.a certification mark,on the other hand,is a mark used by someone other than its owner to signify that a product or service has a certain characteristic.mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.mccarthy.the certification mark owner is required to license the mark to anyone who meets the certification criteria.m m iii,at citing mccarthy.
the m m iii court observed that the distinction between certification marks and trademarks reflects different underlying public interests.while certification marks resemble trademarks in that they attempt to prevent consumer confusion by communicating information regarding a product characteristics,certification marks also have another purpose.id.m m iii reasoned that certification marks protect a further public interest in free and open competition among producers and distributors of the certified product.id.this is achieved by protecting certification mark licensees from the certification mark owner influence in an attempt to ensure the broadest possible competition in the market for certified goods.id.citing,which allows cancellation of a certification mark when the owner produces or markets goods to which the mark is applied permits use of the mark for purposes other than to certify or discriminately refuses to certify one who maintains the standards the mark signifies.the court viewed this public interest as akin to the public interest in the full and free use of ideas in the public domain embodied in the patent laws.id.at quoting lear,at.
the second circuit held that ipc could not enforce the provision against m m because the public injury that would result outweighed the general interest in enforcing written contracts.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court first observed that the provision restricted licensees in a way unrelated to controlling the quality of the certified product.id.this restriction inured to the benefit of ipc in contravention of its duty not to interfere with a free market for idaho potatoes.id.next,the court noted that parties having at some point entered into an ipc licensing agreement might be the only ones with sufficient economic incentive to challenge any of ipc conduct that arguably compromised its neutrality as a certification mark holder.id.finally,the court looked to the public interest underlying the merits of m m challenges.id.it reasoned that m m specific allegations regarding violations of ipc duties as a mark holder implicated the public interest in creating a free market for idaho potatoes unaffected by ipc potentially conflicting economic interests.id.
ipc makes three primary contentions in arguing that we should disapprove the district court reliance on m m iii.first,it argues that the policy underlying certification marks mirrors that of trademarks and that m m iii therefore erred in treating certification marks differently.next,it contends that m m iii improperly imported into its analysis patent law principles inconsistent with the policies underlying the lanham act.finally,ipc points out that a large number of certification mark holders share its concerns regarding m m iii holding.
certification marks versus trademarks 
ipc argues that the only certification mark policy reflected in the lanham act is that underlying avoidance of public confusion.in its view,m m iii should have therefore enforced the provision as courts have done in the trademark context.
certification marks,however,differ from trademarks in a number of significant ways.see mccarthy a certification mark is a special creature created for a purpose uniquely different from that of an ordinary trademark or service mark.certification marks are subject to cancellation if the owner produces or markets goods on which the mark appears,permits use of the mark for purposes other than to certify,or discriminately refuses to certify the goods of one who meets the standards the mark denotes.the mark holder duty to license all who qualify makes certification a form of limited compulsory licensing.mccarthy.
the lanham act makes clear that certification marks serve other public interests in addition to the prevention of public confusion.its certification mark cancellation provisions illustrate the legislative intent to protect a further public interest in free and open competition among producers and distributors of the certified product.m m iii,at.by requiring certification mark holders to license all individuals who meet the certification criteria,the lanham act ensures that the market will include as many participants as can produce conforming goods.by preventing mark holders from becoming market participants,it removes incentives for mark holders to engage in conduct.the lanham act cancellation provisions thus appear designed to promote free competition in the market for certified products we therefore agree with m m iii assessment of the policy concerns underlying the lanham act certification mark regime.
we also find persuasive m m iii conclusions regarding the relative weight of the pertinent public interests.in m m iii,as in this case,ipc sought to enforce a provision against a former licensee.allowing it to do so would enable it to prevent anyone who had ever held an ipc license from challenging its conduct as a certification mark owner.this would likely leave ipc conduct unchecked by precluding challenges by the only individuals with enough economic incentive to bring them see m m iii,at p arties that have entered into a licensee relationship with the ipc may often be the only individuals with enough economic incentive to challenge the ipc licensing scheme,and thus the only individuals with enough economic incentive to force the ipc to conform to the law.citing lear,at.as m m iii concluded,the public interest in ensuring free competition in the market for certified goods outweighs ipc interest in enforcing a contractual provision that would prevent all current and former licensees from challenging its conduct as a certification mark holder.
m m iii use of patent law principles 
ipc devotes much of its argument to asserting that m m iii improperly weighed the public interest underlying patents instead of one underlying certification marks.while m m iii analogized the public interest underlying certification marks to that underlying patents,it went on to analyze certification mark policies rooted in the lanham act certification mark provisions.see at.we thus reject ipc contention that m m iii improperly considered the patent law policy goals articulated in lear instead of those underlying certification mark law.
ipc also contends that m m iii should not have applied the lear balancing test at all.it acknowledges,however,that other courts have balanced the public interests in trademark cases involving clauses.see m m iii,at citing mws wire,at visa int l serv.bankcard holders of,cir t t,at beer nuts,at.because ipc offers no persuasive reason for why it is improper to use lear balancing in lanham act cases,we adopt m m iii approach.
m m iii potential adverse effects for certification mark holders 
finally,ipc summarizes the arguments of certification mark holders who filed a joint amici curiae brief in support of ipc petition for a writ of certiorari in m m iii.the amici arguments restate many of ipc concerns,with emphasis placed on the increased cost of enforcement m m iii will cause for and governmental certification mark holders.while it may be true that infringement actions will now cost more because licensees and former licensees will often challenge the validity of the mark in question,the amici arguments fail to address or give any weight to the countervailing public policy concern.allowing certification mark holders to preclude challenges by all individuals who hold or have held a license would remove what appears to be the principal mechanism for ensuring that mark holders abide by their statutory duties.
we agree with the district court that m m iii appropriately balanced the relevant public policies in holding provisions in certification mark licenses unenforceable.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not err in declining to enforce the provision against g 
ii.damages,attorney fees,and costs 
the district court initially awarded ipc in nominal damages because g t had violated its license by failing to comply with ipc variety labeling rule as a result of g t breach of its license by failing to preserve all of its records of idaho potato sales and purchases statutory damages of for g t violation of the lanham act by purchasing and using bags with ipc certification mark on them after g t license to use the mark had expired and ipc costs.it later went on to deny g t motion for reconsideration and to award ipc percent of the amount of attorney fees it requested.
g t challenges all of these awards.first,it argues that the award constitutes an improper civil penalty under idaho code.it goes on to contest the award as unsupported by the record.it then challenges the award as based on an erroneous conclusion that ipc was entitled to statutory damages.finally,it contends that the district court improperly awarded ipc attorney fees and costs.
g t appeals from the district court findings of fact and conclusions of law and from its denial of g t federal rule of civil procedure b and e motion to amend the court findings and conclusions and to alter or amend the judgment.we review for abuse of discretion the denial of g t motion.see smith pac.props.dev,cir.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.watkins ameripride,cir.
nominal damages award for ipc rule violation 
as part of its licensing agreement with ipc,g t agreed to comply with ipc rules in general and specifically with its variety labeling rule.the district court found that g t failed to comply with the variety labeling rule.it went on to hold that g t violations were minor and that ipc should therefore recover from g g t does not dispute that it violated its license by failing to include variety labeling on its packaging.
g t argues,however,that the district court erred by imposing a civil penalty as a result of the variety labeling violations.this award,it contends,contravenes idaho code,which creates civil penalties for violating ipc rules or licensing agreements.in g t view,because requires ipc to provide notice and opportunity for a hearing before ipc assesses civil penalties,it also requires ipc to exhaust its administrative remedies by giving such notice and opportunity before seeking to recover in court for rule violations.see idaho code.
as a preliminary matter,does not by its terms require ipc to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit.section provides that ipc or its duly authorized agent may assess civil penalties of not more than for each offense against any person who violates an ipc rule or licensing agreement.section states that no civil penalty may be assessed unless the person charged was given notice and opportunity for a hearing and that ipc may enforce in district court penalties it is unable to collect administratively.subsection goes on to state that n othing contained in this section shall be deemed to preclude the commission from pursuing any other civil or criminal remedies available to it as provided by law.
the pertinent question is whether authorizes a court,as opposed to ipc,to impose the civil penalties.as g t points out,the statute specifically provides for ipc to assess civil penalties but makes no mention of a court doing so.see idaho code.section thus does not explicitly empower a court to impose the civil penalties it creates.ipc points to no pertinent authority suggesting that it implicitly does so,and we have found none.we therefore conclude that if civil penalties are to be assessed under,ipc must assess them in administrative proceedings and then enforce them in district court if necessary.the award by the district court therefore can not be a civil penalty.
the award can,however,constitute nominal damages for breach of contract.despite the fact that ipc sought civil penalties under,the district court did not indicate reliance on in imposing the damages award.we thus conclude that the award can be viewed as nominal damages and we affirm the award on that basis 
damages award for failing to preserve records 
the district court awarded ipc for g t breach of its license by failing to preserve all of its records of idaho potato sales and purchases.the court found the breach to be relatively serious because of ipc resulting discovery problems and the attendant discovery disputes involving the court.it did not explain how or why it chose the figure.
g t argues that the lack of record evidence of damage to ipc resulting from the breach renders the an improper contract damages award.it also argues that the award is improper as beyond the scope of the relief sought by ipc.ipc counters that we can uphold the award as a discovery sanction or as a civil penalty under idaho code,implicitly concedin
