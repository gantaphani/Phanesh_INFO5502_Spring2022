in this trademark dilution by tarnishment case,brought under the trademark dilution revision act of the question is whether the plaintiff,an international lingerie company that uses the trade name designation victoria secret has a valid suit for injunctive relief against the use of the name victor little secret or victor secret by the defendants,a small retail store in a mall in elizabethtown,kentucky,that sells assorted merchandise,including sex toys and other sexually oriented products.the district court issued the injunction.since then the shop has been operating under the name of cathy little secret.the district court concluded that even though the two parties do not compete in the same market,the victor little secret it is sex and tends to reduce the positive associations and the selling power of the victoria secret mark.the question is whether the plaintiff case meets the definitions and standards for dilution by tarnishment set out in the new act which amended the old act,the federal trademark dilution act of 
the new act was expressly intended to overrule the supreme court interpretation of the old act in this very same case,moseley.secret catalog,rev g cir,aff g.the supreme court reversed a panel of this court that had affirmed an injunction against victor little secret issued by the district court.on remand to the district court from the supreme court after the reversal,no new evidence was introduced,and the district court reconsidered the case based on the same evidence but used the new language in the new act which overrules the supreme court in this case.we will first brief the supreme court opinion and the reasons congress overruled the supreme court in this case.we will then outline our understanding of the new standards for measuring trademark dilution by tarnishment and apply them to this case.we conclude that the new act creates a kind of rebuttable presumption,or at least a very strong inference,that a new mark used to sell sex related products is likely to tarnish a famous mark if there is a clear semantic association between the two.that presumption has not been rebutted in this case.
i.the supreme court opinion and the new act 
the supreme court explained that this case started when an army colonel at fort knox saw an ad for victor secret in a weekly publication.it advertised that the small store in elizabethtown sold adult videos and novelties and lingerie there was no likelihood of confusion between the two businesses or the two marks,but the army colonel was offended because the business was semantically associating itself with victoria secret.the court explained that the concepts of dilution by blurring and dilution by tarnishment originated with an article in the harvard law review,frank schechter,rational basis of trademark protection,harv,and that the history and meaning of the concepts were further well explained in restatement third of unfair competition,section.the restatement section referred to by the supreme court explains this new intellectual property tort and contains in a comprehensive statement of liability without proof of confusion dilution and tarnishment.tarnishment,as distinguished from dilution by blurring was the only claim before the supreme court and is the only claim before us in this new appeal.we quote at length the relevant restatement explanation of tarnishment in the footnote below 
after reviewing a number of secondary sources other than the harvard law review article and the restatement,including state statutes on dilution and a fourth circuit case,the supreme court held that actual harm rather than merely the likelihood of tarnishment is necessary and stated its conclusion as follows 
noting that consumer surveys and other means of demonstrating actual dilution are expensive and often unreliable,respondents victoria secret and their amici argue that evidence of an actual lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services,may be difficult to obtain.it may well be,however,that direct evidence of dilution such as consumer surveys will not be necessary if actual dilution can reliably be proved through circumstantial obvious case is one where the junior and senior marks are identical.whatever difficulties of proof may be entailed,they are not an acceptable reason for dispensing with proof of an essential element of a statutory violation.the evidence in the present record is not sufficient to support the summary judgment on the dilution count.the judgment is therefore reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
at emphasis added.
thus,the court held that actual harm rather than merely a likelihood of harm must be shown by victoria secret in order to prevail and that this means that victoria secret carries the burden of proving an actual lessening of the capacity of the victoria secret mark to identify and distinguish goods or services sold in victoria secret stores or advertised in its catalogs.id.in the new law congress rejected the court view that a simple likelihood of an association in the consumer mind of the victoria secret mark with the videos and toys of victor secret is insufficient for liability.
the house judiciary committee report states the purpose of the new legislation as follows 
the moseley standard creates an undue burden for trademark holders who contest diluting uses and should be revised.
the new language in the legislation provides specifically that the standard for proving a dilution claim is likelihood of dilution and that both dilution by blurring and dilution by tarnishment are actionable.
emphasis added.cong.news,cong d sess,vol.the relevant language of the new act designed to carry out this purpose is recited and underlined in footnote,supra.the drafters of the committee report also called special attention to the burden of proof or persuasion placed on trademark holders by the supreme court opinion in moseley,suggesting a possible modification in the burden of proof.the question for us then is whether victor little secret with its association with lewd sexual toys creates a likelihood of dilution by tarnishment of victoria secret mark.
ii.application of statutory standard 
the specific question in this case is whether,without consumer surveys or polls or other evidence,a semantic association is equivalent to a mental association of a junior mark like victor little secret with a famous mark like victoria secret that constitutes dilution by tarnishment when the junior mark is used to sell sexual toys,videos and similar pornographic products.there appears to be a clearly emerging consensus in the case law,aided by the language of of the restatement of trademarks,quoted in footnote,supra,that the creation of an association between a famous mark and lewd or bawdy sexual activity disparages and defiles the famous mark and reduces the commercial value of its selling power.this consensus stems from an economic prediction about consumer taste and how the predicted reaction of conventional consumers in our culture will affect the economic value of the famous mark.
there have been at least eight federal cases in six jurisdictions that conclude that a famous mark is tarnished when its mark is semantically associated with a new mark that is used to sell products.we find no exceptions in the case law that allow such a new mark associated with sex to stand.see pfizer sachs,d,defendants display at an adult entertainment exhibition of two models riding a missile and distributing condoms would likely harm the reputation of pfizer trademark,friendfinder,no.c jsw mej,wl,at,defendants use of pottery barn mark on their websites likely to tarnish by associating those marks for children and teenager furnishings kraft foods holdings,helm,d,pornographic website use of velveeda tarnishes velveeta trademark victoria cyber secret.v secret catalogue,d,defendants internet trade names likely to tarnish famous mark when websites will be used for entertainment of a lascivious nature suitable only for adults mattell,internet dimensions,linking barbie with pornography will adversely color the public impressions of barbie polo ralph lauren schuman,defendants use of the polo club or polo executive retreat as an adult entertainment club tarnished polo trademark pillsbury milky way,defendant variation of the pillsbury doughboy tarnished plaintiff mark dallas cowboys cheerleaders,pussycat cinema,pornographic depiction of a dallas cowboys cheerleader in an adult film tarnished the professional mark of the dallas cowboys.
the phrase likely to cause dilution used in the new statute see footnote significantly changes the meaning of the law from causes actual harm under the preexisting law.the word likely or likelihood means probably,webster third new international dictionary black law dictionary.it is important to note also that the committee report quoted above seeks to reduce the burden of evidentiary production on the trademark holder.the problem,the developing case law,and the restatement third of trademarks in particularly subsection g should now be interpreted,we think,to create a kind of rebuttable presumption,or at least a very strong inference,that a new mark used to sell products is likely to tarnish a famous mark if there is a clear semantic association between the two.this res ipsa effect is not conclusive but places on the owner of the new mark the burden of coming forward with evidence that there is no likelihood or probability of tarnishment.the evidence could be in the form of expert testimony or surveys or polls or customer testimony.
in the present case,the moseleys have had two opportunities in the district court to offer evidence that there is no real probability of tarnishment and have not done so.they did not offer at oral argument any suggestion that they could make such a showing or wanted the case remanded for that purpose.the fact that congress was dissatisfied with the moseley result and the moseley standard of liability,as well as apparently the moseley burden of proof,supports the view of victoria secret that the present the eyes of the legislative a likelihood of tarnishment.without evidence to the contrary or a persuasive defensive theory that rebuts the presumption,the defendants have given us no basis to reverse the judgment of the district court.we do not find sufficient the defendants arguments that they should have the right to use victor moseley first name and that the effect of the association is de minimis.the moseleys do not have a right to use the word secret in their mark.they use it only to make the association with the victoria secret mark.we agree that the tarnishing effect of the moseley mark on the senior mark is somewhat speculative,but we have no evidence to overcome the strong inference created by the case law,the restatement,and congressional dissatisfaction with the burden of proof used in this case in the supreme court.the new law seems designed to protect trademarks from any unfavorable sexual associations.thus,any new mark with a lewd or sexual association raises a strong inference of tarnishment.the inference must be overcome by evidence that rebuts the probability that some consumers will find the new mark both offensive and harmful to the reputation and the favorable symbolism of the famous mark.
our dissenting colleague,in relying on the supreme court treatment of the proof in this example,the long quotation from the supreme court concerning the legal effect of the to concede what seems obvious congress overruled the supreme court view of the burden of proof.as quoted above,it said,the moseley standard creates an undue burden for trademark holders who contest diluting uses it seems clear that the new act demonstrates that congress intended that a court should reach a different result in this case if the facts remain the same.we do not necessarily disagree with our dissenting colleague that the policy followed by the supreme court in such cases may be better.we simply believe that the will of congress is to the contrary with regard to the proof in this case and with regard to the method of allocating the burden of proof.
iii.other issues 
the defendants also contend that the new act should not be applied to them in this case because the law of the case doctrine means that the supreme court opinion in their favor remains in effect,the new act is not retroactive,and the plaintiff claim does not fit within the language of the act found in c which reads as follows 
additional remedies 
in an action brought under this subsection,the owner of the famous mark shall be entitled to injunctive relief as set forth in section of this title.describing requirements in addition to normal injunctions under c to obtain injunctions in various kinds of trademark disputes.the owner of the famous mark shall also be entitled to the remedies set forth in sections a and of this title,describing remedies for attorneys fees,treble damages,not applicable here.subject to the discretion of the court and the principles of equity if 
a the mark or trade name that is likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment was first used in commerce by the person against whom the injunction is sought after october,and 
b in a claim arising under this subsection 
i by reason of dilution by blurring,the person against whom the injunction is sought willfully intended to trade on the recognition of the famous mark or 
ii by reason of dilution by tarnishment,the person against whom the injunction is sought willfully intended to harm the reputation of the famous mark.
defendants claim somehow that the new act is only applicable to claims brought under this subsection and that the plaintiff claims were brought for use of a trade name used before,not after october,and hence in violation of subsection a.
law of the case law of the case doctrine has no application here to the prospective relief sought because while the case was pending a controlling authority congress changed the law,see united states moored,cir a subsequent contrary view of the law by the controlling authority in a pending case justifies disregarding the law of the case doctrine.
statutes are not necessarily retroactive and may be applied to pending cases where prospective relief is sought for ongoing conduct when the intervening statute authorizes or affects the propriety of prospective relief,application of the new provision is not retroactive.landgraft film.
applicability of c.the defendants reliance on this subsection of the new act is misplaced.this subsection of the new act refers to additional remedies,not set out in the injunctive relief section of c,the first section of the new act quoted in footnote above which provides for an injunction at anytime after the owner mark has become famous and the junior mark that is likely to cause dilution is used.the new act intervened and required a reconsideration of the case on the merits.we have now fully considered the case on the merits,as well as the defendants other defenses and conclude that the district court did not err in its decision in favor of the plaintiff,victoria secret.
accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
concurrence 
i fully concur in the majority opinion with the exception of one small quibble.i would not use the term rebuttable presumption to describe the inference that a new mark used to sell products is likely to tarnish a famous mark if there is a clear semantic association between the two.practically speaking,what the inference is called makes little difference.i agree with the majority opinion that the inference is a strong one and that,to counter it,some evidence that there is no likelihood or probability of tarnishment is required.but because we are endeavoring to interpret a new law and because the legislative history is not explicit on the point of modification of the burden of proof,i think it best to end our analysis by characterizing the inference as an inference.
because i believe that victoria secret has failed to produce sufficient evidence to show that the moseleys use of the name victor little secret is likely to tarnish the victoria secret mark,i would reverse the judgment of the district court and must respectfully dissent.
under the trademark dilution revision act of tdra,victoria secret is entitled to injunctive relief if the moseleys use of victor little secret as the name of their novelty is likely to cause dilution by tarnishment of the victoria secret mark.c.d ilution by tarnishment is defined as an association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that harms the reputation of the famous mark.id.c c.thus,under the terms of the statute,to determine whether the victoria secret mark is likely to be tarnished by the moseleys use,this court must inquire as to both the association between the two marks and the harm that the association causes to the senior mark.
because i agree that there is a clear association between the two marks,the determinative inquiry in this case is whether that association is likely to harm victoria secret reputation.see id.c c that harms the reputation of the famous mark.contrary to the majority conclusion,however,given the record before the panel,i would hold that victoria secret has failed to meet its burden to show that the moseleys use of victor little secret is likely to dilute victoria secret mark 
victoria secret evidence of tarnishment includes nothing more than the following an affidavit from army colonel john baker stating that he was offended by the defendants use of victoria secret trademark to promote unwholesome,tawdry merchandise,such as adult novelties and gifts,and that since his wife and daughter shop at victoria secret,he was further dismayed by the defendants effort to associate itself with,trade off on the image of,and in fact denigrate a store frequented by members of his family,record on appeal roa at baker aff.and a statement from one of victoria secret corporate officers that victoria secret strives to maintain an image that is sexy and playful and one that avoid s sexually explicit or graphic imagery.id.at kriss aff.
reviewing baker affidavit,i believe that it is plain that baker made a mental association between victor little secret and victoria secret.moseley secret catalogue,see also roa at baker aff.it is also clear that baker held a negative impression of victor little secret.see moseley,at see also roa at baker aff.but despite the clear negative association of this one individual when confronted with victor little secret,victoria secret has presented no evidence that baker,or anyone else,distaste or dislike of victor little secret is likely to taint their positive opinion or perception of victoria secret.yet evidence that the junior mark is likely to undermine or alter the positive associations of the senior,evidence that the junior mark is likely to harm the reputation of the senior precisely the showing required under the plain language of c c to prove dilution by tarnishment.as the second circuit recently noted in starbucks wolfe borough coffee,cir 
that a consumer may associate a junior mark with a famous mark says little of whether the consumer views the junior mark as harming the reputation of the famous mark.the more relevant question,for purposes of tarnishment,would have been how a hypothetical coffee with a name would affect the positive impressions about the coffee sold by starbucks.
starbucks,at see also thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.hereinafter mccarthy on trademarks discussing tarnishment claims as being premised on the notion that positive associations of the senior mark will be displaced or degraded by the negative associations of the junior mark restatement third of unfair competition cmt.g to prove a case of tarnishment,the prior user must demonstrate that the subsequent use is likely to undermine or damage the positive associations evoked by the mark.in fact,when reviewing the exact same evidentiary record,the supreme court explicitly noted that victoria secret offer of proof included no evidence that victor little secret affected baker positive impressions of victoria secret 
the record in this case establishes that an army officer did make the mental association with victoria secret,but it also shows that he did not therefore form any different impression of the store that his wife and daughter had patronized.there is a complete absence of evidence of any lessening of the capacity of the victoria secret mark to identify and distinguish goods or services sold in victoria secret stores or advertised in its catalogs.the officer was offended by the ad,but it did not change his conception of victoria secret.his offense was directed entirely at the moseleys,not at victoria secret.moreover,the expert retained by respondents had nothing to say about the impact of the moseleys name on the strength of victoria secret mark.
moseley,at emphases added 
in short,victoria secret has presented no probative evidence that anyone is likely to think less of victoria secret as a result of victor little secret and can not therefore prevail on its claim of dilution by tarnishment.see hormel foods.jim henson,cir absent any showing that henson use of a puppet named will create negative associations with the spam mark,there is little likelihood of dilution.instead of developing a record on remand that contains at least some evidence that victoria secret reputation is likely to suffer because of the negative response that victor little secret engendered,the record before the panel indicates only that a single individual thinks poorly of victor little secret.see moseley,at.on this record,it is simply no more probable that victoria secret will suffer reputational harm as a result of the moseleys use of victor little secret than it is probable that those who are offended by victor little secret will limit their negative impressions to the moseleys and refrain from projecting those negative associations upon victoria secret.baker affidavit does nothing to contradict this conclusion,and given the absence of any indication that his or his family opinion of victoria secret changed following the moseleys use of victor little secret,his affidavit may,in fact,provide evidence that individuals are likely to confine their distaste to the moseleys.see id.the officer was offended by the ad,but it did not change his conception of victoria secret.his offense was directed entirely at the moseleys,not at victoria secret.
certainly,it is possible that the moseleys use of victor little secret to sell material and other novelties could reflect poorly on the victoria secret mark and could cause victoria secret to suffer damage to its sexy and playful reputation,but the evidentiary standard set forth in the statute is one of likelihood not mere possibility.likelihood is based on probable consequence and amounts to more than simple speculation as to what might possibly happen.see mccarthy on trademarks indicating that likelihood in the dilution part of the lanham act has the same meaning as it does in the traditional infringement sections of the lanham act as synonymous with probability see also parks laface records,cir a likelihood means a probability rather than a possibility of confusion.yet,as the majority notes,on the instant record,the tarnishing effect of the moseley mark on the senior mark is nothing more than speculative.op.at.
despite the absence of evidence,the majority is willing to assume that victoria secret has met its burden to prove the essential element of harm to reputation based on the fact that numerous cases from other jurisdictions conclude,without much inquiry,that a famous mark is tarnished when its mark is semantically associated with a new mark that is used to sell products.id.at.i do not agree.although it is true that courts have concluded that a finding of tarnishment is likely when a mark likeness is placed in the context of sexual activity,obscenity,or illegal activity,hormel foods,at,a court can not ignore the showing of reputational harm that the statute requires 
even assuming that victor little secret is plainly unwholesome when compared to victoria secret and that this case is completely analogous to those cases on which the majority relies,i still maintain that it is improper simply to assume likelihood of harm to the reputation of a senior mark when
