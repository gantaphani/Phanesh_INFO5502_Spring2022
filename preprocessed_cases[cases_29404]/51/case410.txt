cantine leonardo da vinci soc.coop.cantine,an entity of italy,is a wine producer located in vinci,italy.cantine has sold wine products bearing the leonardo da vinci tradename since it selected this name and mark based on the name of its home city,vinci.cantine began selling its leonardo da vinci wine to importers in the united states in.since,however,tyfield importers,tyfield has been the exclusive united states importer and distributor of cantine wine products bearing the leonardo da vinci mark.during the first eighteen months after tyfield became cantine exclusive importer,cantine sold approximately cases of wine products bearing the leonardo da vinci mark to tyfield.during this same period,tyfield spent between and advertising and promoting cantine products,advertising in usa today,and such specialty magazines as the wine spectator,wine and spirits,and southern beverage journal.
cantine learned of barcamerica registration of the leonardo da vinci mark in or about,in the course of prosecuting its first trademark application in the united states.cantine investigated barcamerica use of the mark and concluded that barcamerica was no longer selling any wine products bearing the leonardo da vinci mark and had long since abandoned the mark.as a result,in may,cantine commenced a proceeding in the pto seeking cancellation of barcamerica registration for the mark based on abandonment.barcamerica responded by filing the instant action on january,and thereafter moved to suspend the proceeding in the pto.the pto granted barcamerica motion and suspended the cancellation proceeding.
although barca has been aware of cantine use of the leonardo da vinci mark since approximately barcamerica initiated the instant action only after tyfield and cantine commenced the proceeding in the pto.a month after barcamerica filed the instant action,it moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining tyfield and cantine from any further use of the mark.the district court denied the motion,finding,among other things,that there is a serious question as to whether barcamerica will be able to demonstrate a bona fide use of the leonardo da vinci mark in the ordinary course of trade and overcome the claim of abandonment.barcamerica int l trust tyfield importers,no,at cal.filed,damrell.
thereafter,tyfield and cantine moved for summary judgment on various grounds.the district court granted the motion,concluding that barcamerica abandoned the mark through naked licensing.the court further found that,in any event,the suit was barred by laches because barcamerica knew several years before filing suit that tyfield and cantine were using the mark in connection with the sale of wine.this timely appeal followed.
before addressing the merits of this case,we must first deal with a preliminary issue raised by tyfield and cantine.by motion,tyfield and cantine ask us to strike various of barcamerica excerpts of record,and also the portions of barcamerica opening brief which rely on those excerpts they also request sanctions.the documents objected to can be roughly separated into three categories portions of depositions exhibits to depositions and other documents,not part of depositions.
as tyfield and cantine correctly observe,the record on appeal consists of the original papers and exhibits filed in the district court.fed.a see also cir.consequently,p apers not filed with the district court or admitted into evidence by that court are not part of the record on appeal.kirshner uniden of,cir.with respect to categories and more specifically,while portions of these depositions and exhibits were filed appended to the motion for summary judgment and the barcamerica opposition thereby brought to the court portions and exhibits objected to were not.thus,these documents,which were not filed with the district court,are not properly part of the record before us.see henn geographic,cir parties who designate and file parts of a deposition for a district judge consideration must be aware that the remainder of the deposition is not in the record on appeal.
barcamerica raises several unavailing arguments in opposition to the motion to strike.barcamerica relies primarily upon federal rule of civil procedure a,which provides that i f only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party,an adverse party may require the offeror to introduce any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced,and any party may introduce any other parts.while this is true,it has nothing to do with determining what is in the record on admits that these other parts were not,in fact,filed.barcamerica also relies on various federal rules of evidence,most notably rule,which provides that w hen a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party,an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.again,this rule is irrelevant to the question of what is in the record on appeal it only indicates that barcamerica could have required the introduction of other parts of statements or writings at th e time when tyfield and cantine introduced parts of the statements or writing,before the district court.barcamerica did not do so.
at oral argument,barcamerica asserted that even if documents in category were not part of the record on appeal,at least those in categories and are because the depositions from which they were extracted were lodged with the district court.this contention is a novel one,and appears attributable to the unique nature of the eastern district of california local rules.in many district courts,only those portions of depositions relie
