in this appeal,petroliam nasional berhad petronas requests that we read a cause of action for contributory cybersquatting into the anticybersquatting consumer protection act acpa or act.d.because we conclude that neither the plain text nor the purpose of the acpa provide support for such a cause of action,we hold that there is none.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.

in,a third party registered the domain names and through a registrar other than godaddy.in,the owner of those names transferred its registration service to godaddy.the registrant used godaddy domain name forwarding service to direct the disputed domain names to the adult web site,which was hosted on a web server maintained by a third party,and which had been associated with the disputed domain names,using the previous registrar.
in late,a petronas subsidiary responsible for ferreting out potential trademark infringement contacted godaddy and requested that it take action against the website associated with the domain name.officials from the malaysian and governments also contacted godaddy regarding the domain name.godaddy investigated the issue,but took no action with respect to the alleged cybersquatting because it did not host the site and it was prevented by the uniform domain name dispute resolution policy udrp from participating in trademark disputes regarding domain name ownership

discussion 
the lanham act,et,passed in,codified the then existing common law of trademarks,which in turn was based on the tort of unfair competition.see moseley secret catalogue,traditional trademark infringement law is a part of the broader law of unfair competition that has its sources in english common law,and was largely codified in the trademark act of lanham act.internal citations omitted.due primarily to the common law origins of trademark infringement,courts have concluded that the lanham act created a cause of action for secondary liability.see,inwood,ives,i f a manufacturer or distributor intentionally induces another to infringe a trademark,or if it continues to supply its product to one whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in trademark infringement,the manufacturer or distributor is contributorially responsible for any harm done as a result of the deceit.
in,congress passed the acpa,which amended the lanham act by adding two new causes of action aimed at cybersquatting consolidated appropriations act,div.b,a,stat,a.under the acpa,a person may be civilly liable if that person has a bad faith intent to profit from that mark and registers,traffics in,or uses a protected domain name.d a.congress also created an in rem action to facilitate recovery of domain names by their rightful owners.d a.petronas contends that the acpa also provides a cause of action for contributory cybersquatting because congress intended to incorporate common law principles of secondary liability into the act by legislating against the backdrop of the common law of trademark infringement,and by placing the acpa within the lanham act.we disagree.
our first obligation in determining whether the acpa includes a contributory cybersquatting claim is to examine the plain text of the statute.see hawaii office of hawaiian affairs.established common law principles can be inferred into a cause of action where circumstances suggest that congress intended those principles to apply.compare,meyer holley,w hen congress creates a tort action,it legislates against the legal background of ordinary vicarious liability rules and consequently intends its legislation to incorporate those rules.with cent.bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,w hen congress enacts a statute under which a person may sue and recover damages from a private defendant for the defendant violation of some statutory norm,there is no general presumption that the plaintiff may also sue aiders and abettors.
we hold that the acpa does not include a cause of action for contributory cybersquatting because the text of the act does not apply to the conduct that would be actionable under such a theory congress did not intend to implicitly include common law doctrines applicable to trademark infringement because the acpa created a new cause of action that is distinct from traditional trademark remedies and allowing suits against registrars for contributory cybersquatting would not advance the goals of the statute.
i.the plain text of the acpa does not provide a cause of action for contributory cybersquatting 
the preeminent canon of statutory interpretation requires us to presume that the legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bedroc,llc united states,quoting.bank germain.we thus begin our analysis with the text of the acpa.
the acpa imposes civil liability for cybersquatting on persons that register,traffic in,or use a domain name with the bad faith intent to profit from that protected mark.d a.the plain language of the statute thus prohibits the act of cybersquatting,but limits when a person can be considered to be a cybersquatter.id.the statute makes no express provision for secondary liability.id.extending liability to registrars or other third parties who are not cybersquatters,but whose actions may have the effect of aiding such cybersquatting,would expand the range of conduct prohibited by the statute from a bad faith intent to cybersquat on a trademark to the mere maintenance of a domain name by a registrar,with or without a bad faith intent to profit.this cuts against finding a cause of action for contributory cybersquatting.see cent.bank,at we can not amend the statute to create liability for acts that are not themselves prohibited within the meaning of the statute.
furthermore,congress knew how to impose secondary liability when it chose to do so.id.at.congress chose not to impose secondary liability under the acpa,despite the fact that the availability of such remedies under traditional trademark liability should have increased the salience of that issue.see.ives,at.
petronas argues that the liability limiting language in section d iii indicates that congress intended d a to create a cause of action for secondary liability.section d iii provides that a domain name registrar,a domain name registry,or other domain name registration authority shall not be liable for damages under this section for the registration or maintenance of a domain
