this appeal presents the conundrum of what to do when a district court order purports both to grant a motion to dismiss and to transfer the action to a different district.based on clear evidence of the district judge intent,we hold that the order should be construed as a transfer order and that,therefore,immediate appellate review of the underlying findings is unavailable.
background 
on december,subsalve usa corporation subsalve,a rhode island company,instituted a civil action in the united states district court for the district of rhode island.the complaint named as defendants watson manufacturing,a florida corporation,and lynden cox,a watson functionary residing in florida.subsalve statements of claim sounded in trademark and copyright infringement,unfair competition,and cybersquatting.
the defendants moved to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction.see.b.the district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge.see b b.after conducting an evidentiary hearing,the magistrate judge concluded that the defendants contacts with the forum state were too attenuated to sustain an assertion of personal jurisdiction.in an apparent effort to ameliorate the terminal effect of this jurisdictional defect,the magistrate judge the motion to dismiss and transferring the action to the northern district of florida 
in due course,the district judge overrode subsalve objections to the magistrate judge recommendation.see subsalve usa watson,d.his rescript stated explicitly that he adopted the magistrate judge ultimate conclusions the court lacks personal jurisdiction over both watson and cox,and this matter should be transferred to the northern district of florida.id.at.in the penultimate paragraph,labeled transfer,the district judge observed that the arguments opposing transfer were unpersuasive.id.at.he added the decision to transfer rests within the court discretion this court agrees with the analysis of magistrate lovegreen as well as his recommendation to transfer this matter.id.the district judge made no similar mention of the recommended granting of the motion to dismiss.
notwithstanding these clear indicia of his intention to transfer the action,the district judge issued the following order for the foregoing reasons,defendants motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is granted.this matter shall be transferred to the northern district of florida.id.this order is contradictory on its face after all,the order purports both to terminate the action by dismissal and to continue it by transfer in another district.as we explain below,this deviated from the usual procedure under,quoted supra note.
the statute authorizes the transfer of an action whenever the court finds that it lacks jurisdiction and that a transfer is consistent with the interest of justice.this language furnishes a court that lacks jurisdiction over an action with a choice between transfer and dismissal.see britell united states,cir.that choice is subject to a rebuttable presumption in favor of the transfer alternative.see id.at.a dismissed action is a nullity,so a court desirous of effectuating a transfer under section should not dismiss the action but,rather,after making a finding that it lacks jurisdiction,should order transfer based on that finding.see,id.at capital bank int l citigroup,d,enter.stowell,d.
here,the district court failure to follow the usual praxis sparked a firestorm of activity.after receiving notification of the transfer,the clerk in the northern district of florida opened a docket on october.five days later,the clerk in the district of rhode island entered a judgment that read in its entirety 
judgment is hereby entered in favor of defendants,watson manufacturing,and lynden cox against plaintiff,subsalve usa corporation pursuant to this court decision and order entered on september,granting defendants motion to dismiss.this matter shall be transferred to the northern district of florida.emphasis omitted.
on october,the clerk physically transferred the case file to the northern district of florida.
seizing upon the district court awkward locution,subsalve filed a notice of appeal on october.it asserted that the september order effected a final dismissal of the action on the merits and,thus,was immediately appealable.see.realizing what had happened,the district judge,acting sua sponte,purposed to issue a corrective order.that order,which invoked.a,vacated the october judgment.the next day,subsalve appeal was docketed in this court.see fed.a.
ii.analysis 
although the parties are in agreement as to the historical facts,they vouchsafe markedly different interpretations of where the case now stands.subsalve argues that the september order was a final order of dismissal,immediately appealable,which should be reversed because the district court did,in fact,have in personam jurisdiction over the parties sued.the defendants counter that the september order was an interlocutory transfer order,not immediately appealable,and that we lack appellate jurisdiction to consider the existence vel non of personal jurisdiction at this juncture.
to wend our way through this labyrinth,we begin with the order itself.we then consider what,at this point in time,lies within the compass of our appellate jurisdiction.
a.the september order.
the threshold question in this case is whether the september order effectuated a dismissal or a transfer of the action.because this preliminary inquiry bears on the permissible scope of our review,we have jurisdiction to undertake it.see usm gkn fasteners,cir see also lane united states,cir.put simply,we have jurisdiction to determine the existence and extent of our own jurisdiction.
a trial court conversation with an appellate court proceeds primarily through its decrees.see berkovitz home box office,cir advance fin.isla rica sales,cir.consequently,the september order itself is the most likely source of enlightenment in our quest to understand its nature.berkovitz,at.
subsalve emphasizes that the first clause of the september order purports to grant the defendants motion to dismiss and argues,on this basis,that the order must be read as a final order of dismissal.under its construction,everything that follows the first the statement purporting to transfer the be ignored because the dismissal put an end to the case and left nothing upon which the district court could continue to act.
the defendants take a more holistic view.they say that the order should be read in its entirety and in light of the district judge statements both contemporaneous and subsequent.so read,they assert,the order must be construed as a transfer order.under their construction,the no jurisdiction finding is important,but the order of dismissal itself must be disregarded as an imprecise lapsus linguae,as it were.on balance,we find the defendants position more persuasive.
there are times when courts must be practical.gibbs buck.declining to order useless remand when the district court had attempted,albeit belatedly,to correct its own error and had thereby made clear what a remand would yield jusino zayas,cir refusing to force the parties round and round the mulberry bush for no better reason than ceremonial punctiliousness.subsalve invites us,in effect,to ignore the reality of events and to accord decretory significance to the sequencing of the september order.we decline the invitation to put on blinders and take so struthious a view.the reality is that the two contradictory clauses were written as part of a single order that order,on its face,was internally inconsistent and the judge could not have intended that both commands be obeyed.given the facts,we fail to see how grammatical happenstance which,in this instance,gives full meaning to one clause while emasculating the other provides a principled basis for resolving the inconsistency.we think,rather,that court orders,like statutes,should be read as a whole.see united states,cir explaining that,in general,a ll words and provisions of statutes should be given effect and constructions that would render words or phrases meaningless,redundant,or superfluous should be avoided.
this leaves us with an order which,fairly read,directs two incompatible results.ordinarily,an appellate court confronted with an internally inconsistent order would vacate the offending order and return the case to the authoring court for clarification.see,united states rodr√≠guez,cir united states davis,cir.an appellate tribunal,however,should not mechanically resort to this remedy when doing so would accomplish nothing more than the undue prolongation of the litigation.see,gibbs,at.aoude mobil oil,cir.
this is such a case.the record of the proceedings below dispels any uncertainty as to the district judge intent in issuing the september order.in his memorandum decision,the judge twice emphasized that he was adopting the magistrate judge recommendation to transfer the action.see subsalve,d at.in contrast,he eschewed any mention of the recommendation to grant the motion to dismiss.to cinch matters,the judge,upon realizing the scrivener error that had crept into the september order,immediately undertook to clarify the matter by vacating the judgment of dismissal.his november order left no doubt but that his intent,all along,was to effectuate a to dismiss the action 
in an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning,subsalve asserts,without any citation to relevant authority,that the district judge intent has no bearing on whether the order dismissed or transferred the action.this assertion comprises more cry than wool.the case law makes pellucid that the dispositive consideration in interpreting a least where neither construction of the order does more violence to its language than the the issuing judge intent.see tootle sec y of navy,construing,in line with the district court clear inten t,an order that dismissed and transferred the action advance,at construing ambiguous order as one for summary judgment where the district court plainly considered itself to be granting summary judgment see also united states schaefer brewing,d holding that a pronouncement amounts to a final judgment where it clearly evidences the judge intention that it shall be his final act in the case united states higginson,cir similar.
subsalve also suggests that the decision in tootle secretary of the navy dictates a conclusion that the dismissal clause trumps the transfer clause.this suggestion lacks merit.
in tootle,as here,the district judge issued an order that purported both to dismiss and to transfer the action.see at.but that order,unlike the order in this case,explicitly stated that it was final and appealable.see id.given this unmistakable indicium of the district court primary intent,the court of appeals held that the order effectuated a dismissal rather than a transfer,reasoning that,having dismissed the action and set the stage for an immediate appeal,the trial court was without authority to transfer it.id.at.taking a narrow view of this quoted language,subsalve posits that tootle creates a general rule that an order purporting both to dismiss and to transfer an action is a final order of dismissal,simpliciter.
this is pie in the sky.it simply is not the case,as subsalve would have it,that the tootle court aspired to fashion a universal rule to the effect that an inconsistent order of the type at issue here must be read as a final order of dismissal.rather,the court relied on the discernible intent of the district judge,interpreting the order as a final order of dismissal because the district court clearly intended to grant the motion to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction.id.emphasis supplied.so viewed,the tootle court approach to deciphering an internally inconsistent order is in perfect harmony with the course that we chart today.
so too the decision in hollyanne tft.although hollyanne held that an order purporting to both dismiss and transfer an action effected a dismissal,the hollyanne court ruled on an opaque record that contained no evidence of the district court intent.see id.at.when the district court order is unilluminating,the appellate court must fend for itself.hoyos,cir.here,unlike in hollyanne,the record presents unmistakable signs of the district court abiding intent.that distinction is critically important.
appellate jurisdiction.
having concluded that the september order should be construed as effectuating a transfer of the action as opposed to a dismissal,we turn next to the question of whether we have jurisdiction to review the substance of that order.although the issue is one of first impression in this circuit,every court of appeals to have confronted it has concluded that section transfer orders are not immediately appealable.see,in re carefirst of,cir brinar williamson,cir fdic mcglamery,cir ukiah adventist hosp.ftc,alimenta usa,lyng,cir this outcome comports with the general rule of nonappealability referable to transfer orders entered under other statutes.see,codex milgo,cir noting that immediate appellate review of transfer orders entered under a is ordinarily unavailable.
this rule makes sense.in the ordinary course,our jurisdiction extends only to appeals from final decisions of the district courts.a district court decision is final if it ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.catlin united states.the entry of a section transfer order does not satisfy this standard it does not terminate the litigation on the merits but,rather,ensures its continuation in a different forum see in re carefirst,at ukiah adventist,at.
to say more would be to paint the lily.like our sister circuits,we can envision no warrant for treating section transfer orders differently from other transfer orders with respect to the availability of interim appellate review.consequently,we hold that a section transfer order is not immediately appealable.this means that,in this case current procedural posture,we lack jurisdiction to review subsalve claim that the district court erred in concluding that it could not exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendants.
iii.conclusion 
we need go no further for the foregoing reasons,we hold that the september order effected a transfer of the action under and that,therefore,the substance of the order is not immediately reviewable.accordingly,we dismiss the remainder of subsalve appeal,without prejudice,for want of appellate jurisdiction.
so ordered.
the statute that the magistrate judge invoked provides in pertinent part whenever a civil action is filed in a federal court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction,the court shall,if it is in the interest of justice,transfer such action to any other such court in which the action could have been brought at the time it was filed,and the action shall proceed as if it had been filed in the court to which it is transferred.
subsalve argues that the november order can not figure into the decisional calculus because the district court lacked power to act after all,subsalve had previously filed a notice of appeal and.a,under which the district judge purported to act,only authorizes district courts to correct clerical errors in orders and judgments.but the order that the judge drafted on november provides a valuable window into his intent with respect to the internally inconsistent september order.thus,even if it is a legal matter on which we take no are entitled to weigh the statements therein as part of our inquiry into whether a remand would serve any useful purpose.see,jusino,at concluding,based on a district court granting of a motion for reconsideration at a time when the court lacked jurisdiction,that remand was unnecessary.
an earlier fourth circuit case,gower lehman,cir,concluded that a district court order transferring a case to the claims court now the court of federal claims was immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.see id.at.but that decision rests in material part on a nuance in the jurisdiction of the claims court.see id.at.in all events,gower has been limited effectively to its facts by subsequent fourth circuit case law.see in re carefirst,at see also mcglamery,at taking a similar view of gower.
to be sure,the finality principle admits of certain limited exceptions,some statutory and some.see puert
