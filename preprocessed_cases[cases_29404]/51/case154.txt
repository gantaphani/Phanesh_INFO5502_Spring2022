america online,aol commenced this action against at t corporation at t for at t alleged infringements of three trademarks that aol claims in connection with its internet services buddy list,you have mail,and im.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of at t with respect to each mark,concluding that,as a matter of law,the alleged marks are generic and can not be enforced as the exclusive property of aol.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the question whether buddy list is a valid mark raises disputed issues of material fact and therefore can not be resolved on summary judgment.with respect to the two other claimed marks,we affirm for the reasons given herein.
founded in,aol is now the world largest internet service provider,claiming more than million members who pay a monthly fee for its services.these services include the facility to transmit and receive electronic mail and a means to establish communication chat through instant messaging.
in connection with its chat service,aol uses buddy list and im to describe features of the service.the buddy list enables the subscriber to create a list of identified screen names employed by other users with whom the subscriber wishes to communicate and displays which of those users is currently using the aol service.if a buddy is identified by the buddy list as online,the subscriber may then click a button labeled im,which are the initials of instant messaging,and initiate a chat session with the subscriber so identified on the buddy list.aol has used buddy list and im since at least.it has promoted these terms extensively,and it asserts now that it has a proprietary interest in them.in addition,with respect to buddy list,aol obtained a certificate of registration on june,from the patent and trademark office,indicating that the mark has been registered on the principal register and that aol has used the mark as a service mark since august.
also,in connection with its service,aol advises its subscribers that they have received by displaying the words you have mail,by playing a recording that announces,you got mail,and by depicting an icon of a traditional mailbox with the red flag raised.aol contends that it has used these marks to describe its service since,that it has promoted them extensively,and that it now has a proprietary interest in them.
at t,a competing internet service provider,uses marks or phrases similar to those claimed by aol in connection with its service to subscribers.it uses the terms buddy list,you have mail,and i m here.
in december,aol commenced this action,seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against at t to prohibit it from using marks similar to those asserted by aol.in its complaint,it alleged that at t use of similar marks violated the trademark dilution provisions of the lanham act,c,and infringes aol marks in violation of.in addition,it demanded an accounting of at t profits,damages,punitive damages,attorneys fees,and costs.in its answer,at t contended,among other things,that aol asserted marks were common,generic terms for the,instant messaging,communication,and related services.it filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that aol marks are not valid trademarks and requesting an order directing the patent and trademark office to cancel the registration for buddy list.
the district court denied preliminary injunctive relief and,following discovery,granted at t summary judgment on the ground that all three of the claimed marks were generic and therefore incapable of functioning as trademarks.the court also directed that a copy of its order be sent to the commissioner of patents and trademarks in order to effect the cancellation of the buddy list mark.the district court rested its decision on evidence in the record obtained from sources,including internet dictionaries,published users guides to both the internet and to aol services,use of the alleged marks by competitors,and use by aol of the alleged marks in a manner suggesting their generic character.although aol proffered survey evidence in support of its contention that the marks you have mail and buddy list were protected trademarks,the court considered the survey evidence irrelevant because it had concluded that the marks were generic and that words used generically can not become trademarks by association.
aol contentions on appeal break down into two general arguments.first,it argues that the district court erred when it concluded that buddy list is generic,despite the fact that it is a federally registered trademark.it asserts that because the trademark office is an expert agency to whom congress has delegated power to administer the lanham act,its decision to register buddy list should be accorded deference under the doctrine of chevron natural resources defense council,d.second,aol contends that the district court,in concluding that the marks are generic,failed to apply the primary significance test correctly insofar as the court focused on usage of the mark in published sources rather than on the perceptions of the relevant consuming public,which were evidenced by aol surveys.
ii.buddy list 
aol principal argument for the validity of buddy list as a suggestive mark rests on the significance of its having obtained a certificate of registration from the patent and trademark office pto.it argues that the district court erred in failing to give deference to the expert decision of the pto to register the mark without requiring evidence of secondary meaning.
to address this argument,we must first recognize the statutory background against which a certificate of registration issues.when the commissioner of patents and trademarks,in furtherance of an application of a registrant,lists a mark on the principal register,he issues a certificate of registration which provides the registrant with prima facie evidence of the validity of the mark and its registration the registrant ownership and the registrant exclusive right to use the mark on or in connection with the goods and services specified in the certificate of registration.see b.and the commissioner does not register a mark unless it meets the requirements established by statute.see.with a certificate of registration,therefore,the registrant obtains prima facie evidence that its mark is not generic in the eyes of the relevant public,see,and that its mark is not merely descriptive,but at a minimum is descriptive and has obtained secondary meaning,see e.the commissioner need not require evidence of secondary meaning if the mark is inherently distinctive by being suggestive,arbitrary,or fanciful.see pto,dep t of commerce,trademark manual of examining procedure,at ed.see also pizzeria uno temple,cir classifying marks into four broad categories of ascending strength or distinctiveness generic,descriptive,suggestive,and arbitrary or fanciful.
aol argues that the district court erred in failing to accord deference to this administrative proceeding before the pto by which the commissioner issued a certificate of registration,thus indicating that it owns a valid suggestive mark in buddy list.aol maintains 
the pto ruling is agency action undertaken with special expertise within the scope of its delegated authority under the lanham act.as such,its determination is entitled to substantial deference.see,chevron natural resources defense council,d.
the district court acknowledged that buddy list has been treated in a suggestive manner according to some evidence.but it found that the only reasonable conclusion which could be drawn from the evidence points to generic usage.of particular importance to the court was the fact that virtually every third party which has used the phrase,including so many of aol competitors,use it as a generic phrase.at t argues further on appeal that aol received the maximum benefit of the registration afforded by law.it maintains that the benefit accorded by aol registration of buddy list was not sufficient in light of the overwhelming evidence presented by at t.at t compelling and overwhelming evidence of genericism amply supports the district court ruling that no reasonable jury could find buddy list anything other than generic.
chevron,on which aol relies so heavily,directs a court,when reviewing an agency interpretation of a statute,to engage in a process.first,it must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.only if the statutory language is silent or ambiguous with respect to the question posed does the court then proceed to the second determine whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.thus,chevron deference is a tool of statutory construction whereby courts are instructed to defer to the reasonable interpretations of expert agencies charged by congress to fill any gap left,implicitly or explicitly,in the statutes they administer.id.at.
in this case,however,aol is not asking the court to defer to the pto interpretation of a particular provision of the lanham act,nor is it asking us to defer to a pto regulation that arguably controls the outcome of this case.instead,aol is arguing for the application of chevron deference to what amounts to a decision of the buddy list is a suggestive trademark and therefore is entitled to protection under the lanham act.aol argument that courts should defer to an agency decision,therefore,would not appear to be governed by chevron,which relates to statutory interpretation,but rather by principles governing administrative adjudications of mixed questions of law and fact.we would expect aol to have argued,therefore,that the pto decision to register buddy list ought not be reversed if supported by substantial evidence.see generally e.
this course of argument,however,is foreclosed by the express terms of the lanham act,which vest ultimate adjudication of trademark disputes in federal courts.thus,trademark holders who allege infringement may sue infringers in federal court and obtain either monetary damages,equitable relief,or both.see generally.more revealing,congress expressly vested in federal courts the power to determine the right to registration,order the cancelation of registrations,in whole or in part,restore canceled registrations,and otherwise rectify the register with respect to the registrations of any party to the action.moreover,congress left no doubt that the pto decisions regarding registrations fall under the supervision of federal courts,as it declared that such judicial orders shall be certified by the court to the commissioner,who shall make appropriate entry upon the records of the patent and trademark office,and shall be controlled thereby.id.finally,congress plainly stated the limited deference that a certificate of registration provides it must be received into evidence but then only serves as prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark.see b,a.in none of these provisions conferring on federal courts the power to adjudicate rights under the lanham act does congress instruct the courts to review registration decisions of the pto under a deferential standard.to the contrary,congress has directly spoken on this issue,specifying a more limited standard the agency action is prima facie evidence of specified facts,and no more.
although we have observed that a district court should not freely substitute its opinion for that of the pto,see rfe,spm,cir,this observation was not made because the pto was entitled to deference,but rather because its decision to register a mark,without requiring evidence of secondary meaning,was powerful evidence that the registered mark is suggestive and not merely descriptive,id.emphasis added see also petro stopping ctrs.james river petroleum,cir holding that the pto determination is only prima facie evidence that the mark is suggestive,and,for that reason,may be rebutted.
accordingly,we conclude that in deciding whether buddy list was generic,the district court had no obligation to afford deference to the decision of the pto.rather,it was required to receive the certification of registration for buddy list into evidence and treat that certificate as prima facie evidence of the validity of the,in this case,as prima facie evidence that it was suggestive.
while the district court acted appropriately in this case in receiving the certificate of registration of buddy list as prima facie evidence that the mark was suggestive,it thereafter erred in ignoring that evidence.the prima facie evidence provided by the certificate of registration was in this case sufficient to establish a question of material fact that could not be resolved on summary judgment.as the committee note to federal rule of evidence dealing with presumptions states,a presumption does not vanish upon the introduction of contradicting evidence instead it is merely deemed sufficient evidence of the fact presumed,to be considered by the jury or other finder of fact.although evidence rebutting the presumption may neutralize the presumption,that the burden of proof on the fact giving rise to the presumption has been met without rebutting does not eliminate from the case the evidence itself that gave rise to the presumption.reeves sanderson plumbing,d.thus,through the certificate of registration,the commissioner introduces his opinion that the application of the registrant was sufficient to demonstrate a valid mark.
but in addition to the evidence provided by the certificate of registration,the district court observed that the record contained other evidence that buddy listr has been treated in a suggestive manner,and the court itself recognized that this other evidence tend ed to create a factual dispute.it found this evidence insignificant,however,because the evidence of genericness was overwhelming,and it determined that a reasonable jury could only conclude that buddy list was generic.in so weighing the evidence,however,the court violated a basic principle of rule in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,a court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.
because we conclude that the validity of buddy list can not be determined on summary judgment in the context of the record evidence presented in this case,we vacate the district court rulings on buddy list,including its order directing the commissioner to cancel the certificate of registration,and remand for further proceedings.
iii.you have mail 
the district court concluded that the alleged mark you have mail functions primarily to inform aol subscribers that they have,which the court found is also known as mail.the court concluded that when the common word or phrase is used as a mark for its ordinary meaning,the mark is generic.accordingly,it ruled that aol could not enforce you have mail as a trademark.
aol argues that there is no evidence in the record that you have mail is primarily perceived by consumers as the common name of a service,as would meet the test of genericness stated in sara lee,cir,and glover ampak,cir.it also contends that the district court erred in disregarding survey evidence that indicates that you have mail is associated with aol.finally,aol argues that the lanham act does not exclude common phrases from the scope of principle that it contends the district court misunderstood.
aol has not registered you have mail with the pto,and therefore it must carry the burden of establishing the validity and its ownership of the mark as part of its larger burden in a trademark infringement action.that burden is to prove that it has a valid,protectable trademark and that the defendant is infringing its mark by creating confusion,or a likelihood thereof,by causing mistake,or by deceiving as to the attributes of its mark.see,petro stopping,at.we agree with the district court that aol did not meet this burden.
first,the record establishes,without contradiction,that you have mail has been used to inform computer users since the,a decade before aol came into existence,that they have electronic mail in their electronic mailboxes.at t has noted,for example,that the unix operating system,one of the most widely used in the computer industry,has,since before aol was formed,displayed the phrase you have mail or you have new mail whenever a user has received electronic mail.in the context of electronic communications across networked computers,the phrase you have mail has been used for the common,ordinary purpose of informing users of the arrival of electronic mail in their electronic mailboxes.in addition,books describing how a computer user is informed that he has on unix similarly reveal the functional nature of the phrase.for example,the following explanations for the presence of mail are described with you have mail.
when you first log into the system,it will inform you if you have any mail,someone has sent you mail.the system will appear as follows unix you have mail.richard gauthier,using the unix system.
accessing your mail immediately upon logging in,should you have mail,you will see a message indicating you have mail.peter birns et,unix for people.
when you log in your system,you are told whether you have electronic mail waiting for you.if there is mail waiting,you see a line like the following you have mail.kevin reichard,unix the basics ed.
furthermore,other companies that provide services have used you have mail,or derivations thereof,to notify their subscribers of the arrival of messages.prodigy communications has used the spoken phrase,you have new mail,since in connection with its online service.prodigy has also used,but no longer uses,the phrase you have mail in the notification feature of its internet service.netcom,an internet service provider,uses you have mail to inform users that they have.qualcomm has used you have new mail since the late in its eudora pro and eudora light programs to notify users of new.banyan beyond mail program,offered for systems,provides the notice you have new mail whenever a user receives transmitted internally or from the internet,a provider,uses you have new mail to notify users when they have and you have no new mail to inform them that they have no new mail.internet relay chat,a software program used by the internet relay network,has used you have new mail to announce the presence of messages when its users log in.
it is significant in the context of this usage that aol has never registered you have mail,nor has it attempted to enforce it as a mark prior to this action.
second,in addition to the long and uninterrupted use by others of you have mail,aol own use of you have mail has been inconsistent with its claim that the phrase is a trademark.rather than describing a service that aol indicating that it is describing such a simply uses you have mail when the subscriber in fact has mail in the electronic mailbox.once the user opens the new message,the phrase you have mail disappears from the user screen.moreover,if the subscriber does not have mail when he logs on,the screen does not display you have mail.aol use of the phrase,conditioned on whether mail is present,does not describe aol service,but rather simply informs subscribers,employing common words to express their commonly used meaning,of the ordinary fact that they have new electronic mail in their mailboxes.
this functional manner in which aol uses you have mail is consistent with a public perception of the phrase as describing whether or not mail is in an electronic mailbox,rather than as describing a service associated with aol.for example,america online for dummies tm states,you have two ways to see your new mail.one is pretty obvious the obvious one is the big picture button of a hand holding up some letters,emblazoned with a subtle notation you have mail.i have seen obvious before and it looked a lot like this.john kaufeld,america online for dummies tm.similarly,in sam teach yourself,america online in hours,the reader is told,you know when you sign on if you have mail.bob temple,sam teach yourself america onliner in hours.the text explains,america online announces when you got mail by saying you got mail id.
indeed,aol itself has made no claim that you have mail has been used to indicate anything but the information that the subscriber has mail.even in its complaint,it asserts little more,alleging that it has used you have mail in connection with its automatic notification services for aol service members.the scope of this asserted give notice of mail to no broader than the words common meaning.
we agree with the district court that when words are used in a context that suggests only their common meaning,they are generic and may not be appropriated as exclusive property.generally mccarthy on trademark unfair competition ed hereinafter mccarthy noting that common words may be used as trademarks when used in an arbitrary,rather than familiar context.but a debate over whether a word or phrase is being used in a context that communicates merely its common meaning can quickly become as metaphysical as the study of language itself.at the basic level,we can conclude that when a fruit merchant sells fruit as apples or blackberries,he should never be able to exclude competitors from similarly using the words apple or blackberries to sell their fruit.but if the common word apple or blackberry is used by a computer merchant in selling computers,we conclude that the usage,not the word,is so uncommon and therefore distinctive,that the computer merchant should be entitled to exclude other competitors from using apple or blackberry in the sale of its computers.while this example readily demonstrates the principle,its application can become difficult when words or phrases are used in a context close to their common meaning.and because our dynamic economy,characterized by extensive creativity and inventiveness,produces new products and services for which no words of description have previously existed,entrepreneurs and the public are engaged in a continual tug of war over naming these new products and wishing to gain some exclusive rights to the names of their inventions and the public wishing merely to have a convenient term by which to refer to the new product or service to facilitate communication.the words internet,pixel,chip,software,byte,or might well have become marks distinguishing one entrepreneur product or service from all other electronic networks,screen density aspects,transistorized components,sets of computer commands,groups of digital information,or electronic communications.yet,because of pervasive use,these terms have become generic.and even when created words for new products have become strong marks,the public pervasive use of these marks sometimes creates a real risk that their distinctiveness will disappear,a process professor mccarthy terms genericide,as occurred with earlier trademarks such as thermos,aspirin,cellophane,and escalator.
the task of distinguishing words or phrases functioning as trademarks from words or phrases in the linguistic commons begins with the development of an understanding of the common meaning of words and their common usage and then proceeds to a determination of whether the trademark falls within this heartland of meaning and usage.the farther a mark falls from the heartland of common meaning and usage,the more distinctive the mark can become.at one level,this determination of word meaning and usage can be a question of law,but at another,it becomes a factual question as to what the relevant public perceives.the dichotomy between the legal question and the factual question is similar to that which exists in construing meaning and usage are unambiguous,the court construes the contract,but when they are ambiguous,the factual question must be resolved by the factfinder.
when a word or phrase does not fall within the heartland of common meaning and usage,but is nevertheless close,its distinctiveness is strengthened by the entrepreneur use.thus,words or phrases that are not directly descriptive of a company,product,or service,but rather suggest,through operation of the consumer imagination,the company,product or service,can become trademarks.see pizzeria uno,at.similarly,slogans used without any direct context can,through use,become marks because with such a generalized application,they are not used in the context of their common meaning,but rather suggestively.witness just do it,see nike,just did it,cir assuming,without deciding that nike has a trademark in this phrase,an
