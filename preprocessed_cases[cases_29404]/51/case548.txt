under the trademark amendments act of b,a,and the federal trademark dilution act of,c,the owner of a famous mark can oppose the registration of a diluting mark without establishing likelihood of confusion.this case presents the question whether such an opposition can be maintained when the applicant mark was used in a limited geographic area before the opposer mark became famous.this case also requires us to decide whether an opposition under a can be based on claims of trademark dilution under state dilution statutes.we conclude that the owner of a famous mark can not oppose registration based on dilution where its mark did not achieve fame prior to the applicant prior use in a limited geographic area,and that a trademark holder can not oppose registration based on claims of dilution under state law.we therefore affirm the decision of the united states patent and trademark office,trademark trial and appeal board the board dismissing the opposition with prejudice.
background 
this case requires us to construe for the first time the federal trademark dilution act of,c,ftda,which creates a federal cause of action for trademark dilution,and a related provision,the trademark amendments act of,pub,stat.codified in scattered sections of,which,inter alia,requires the board to consider dilution under the ftda as a ground for opposition to trademark registration.
the ftda provides a federal cause of action for owners of famous trademarks,allowing them to enjoin diluting uses,and in some cases,to recover monetary damages.the act provides 
t he owner of a famous mark shall be entitled,subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court deems reasonable,to an injunction against another person commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name,if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark,and to obtain such other relief as is provided in this subsection.
c emphasis added thus,in order to secure relief,the owner of a famous mark must establish that the allegedly diluting use began after the mark ha d become famous.the act provides a list of factors that a court is to consider in determining whether a mark is famous and,therefore,qualifies for protection under the statute 
in determining whether a mark is distinctive and famous,a court may consider factors such as,but not limited to 
a the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark 
b the duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the goods or services with which the mark is used 
c the duration and extent of advertising and publicity of the mark 
d the geographical extent of the trading area in which the mark is used 
e the channels of trade for the goods or services with which the mark is used 
f the degree of recognition of the mark in the trading areas and channels of trade used by the mark owner and the person against whom the injunction is sought 
g the nature and extent of use of the same or similar marks by third parties and 
h whether the mark was registered under the act of march,or the act of february,or on the principal register.
in,congress amended the lanham act to add dilution under section c as a ground for opposition to federal trademark registration.see trademark amendments act of,b,stat.the opposition statute now provides,in pertinent part,a ny person who believes that he would be damaged by the registration of a mark upon the principal register,including as a result of dilution under section c of this title,may file an opposition in the patent and trademark office.a emphasis added.
the allegedly diluting use in this case began in,when the appellee the applicant for registration,advantage,advantage,produced a television commercial for its service that used the phrase we even pick you up.the commercial was broadcast in the san antonio,texas,area approximately times between and.from august,to april,the commercial was broadcast an additional times in arkansas,louisiana,new mexico,and texas.
the appellant the party opposing registration,enterprise enterprise,did not begin using the phrases pick the company that picks you up and pick enterprise,we pick you up in national advertising until,after advantage prior use in san antonio,texas.on january,enterprise obtained federal registration for the mark pick enterprise,we pick you up,trademark reg.on january,for the mark pick the company that picks you up,trademark reg.and on august,for the mark we pick you up,trademark reg,as service marks in connection with the rental and leasing of vehicles.
on june,advantage filed suit against enterprise in the united states district court for the western district of texas alleging unfair competition in violation of a and under the common law of texas and seeking cancellation of enterprise mark under.enterprise,inter alia,counterclaimed for unfair competition under state and federal law and for trademark dilution under federal and state law.
while the case was pending in the district court,on may,advantage filed for federal registration of its mark,we even pick you up,as a service mark in connection with the rental and leasing of vehicles.trademark application ser.on august,enterprise filed an opposition to advantage application,alleging that it would be damaged by the registration of advantage mark,because advantage mark caused dilution of enterprise mark under the ftda.the board suspended the opposition proceedings on september,pending resolution of the civil action before the district court.
on may,the parties agreed to the entry of a partial consent judgment in the district court civil action.the parties agreed to the entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law to the effect that the use by advantage of we even pick you up in connection with its business was not likely to cause consumer confusion with enterprise.advantage,enterprise,no.a,slip op.at.may,partial consent judgment.the consent judgment disposed of all claims asserted by advantage and of all counterclaims asserted by enterprise,except its claims for trademark dilution.id.at.the consent judgment also made clear,however,that enterprise dilution claims were unaffected.id.at.
on october,after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment against enterprise on the dilution claims.the court held that enterprise was not entitled to relief,because the slogan at issue is not sufficiently famous or distinctive to receive protection under the ftda.advantage,enterprise,no a,slip op.at.the district court concluded that fame was an element of enterprise claims under the state dilution statutes on which enterprise relied as well.id.at.therefore,the district court held,enterprise could not recover for dilution under federal or state law.
on appeal,the fifth circuit upheld the district court determination that enterprise marks were insufficiently famous to win relief under the ftda or under the arkansas and new mexico statutes.advantage,enterprise,cir.however,the fifth circuit held that the district court erred in its conclusion that lack of fame barred recovery under the louisiana and texas statutes,because both those statutes require only distinctiveness,not fame.id.the court,therefore,affirmed the judgment for advantage on enterprise claim under the ftda and the statutes of arkansas and new mexico,but remanded for a determination of whether the mark was sufficiently distinctive to state a claim under the texas or louisiana dilution statutes.id.
following the fifth circuit litigation,the board dismissed enterprise opposition.enterprise advantage,wl ttab.the board held that enterprise claim of dilution under the ftda was barred by res judicata,because the district court and the fifth circuit had already decided that enterprise mark was not famous.while enterprise argued that its mark had achieved fame in the period after the admission of evidence on fame in the district court in,the board held that a party seeking to invoke dilution as a ground for cancellation must establish that its mark became famous prior to applicant first use of the mark.id.at citation omitted.unless enterprise can establish that its mark was famous prior to advantage in the can not prevail.id.the board found that a s noted in the fifth circuit opinion,applicant has used the mark since at least as early as,making the question of whether opposer mark has achieved fame since the earlier trial irrelevant.id.at.
the board also rejected enterprise argument that we must consider the respective rights of the parties in each geographical area in which they do business,based on its conclusion that b y policy,the board will consider geographic limitations only in the context of a concurrent use proceeding,c and we see nothing in the ftda or the trademark amendments act of which would support a different result.id.at.
finally,the board denied enterprise motion to amend its opposition to include claims of dilution under state statutes.after analyzing the language and the legislative history of the ftda and of the trademark amendments act of,the board concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to entertain grounds for opposition based on state dilution statutes.id.at.
enterprise timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a and a b.
discussion 
trademark infringement law originated in the english common law of unfair competition.moseley secret catalogue,d.trademarks traditionally were not considered property,like patents or copyrights.in,the supreme court held,t here is no such thing as property in a except as a right appurtenant to an established business or trade in connection with which the mark is employed.the law of is but a part of the broader law of unfair competition united drug theodore rectanus.the court further described the fundamental error of supposing that a right is a right in gross or at large,like a statutory copyright or a patent for an invention,to either of which,in truth,it has little or no analogy.id.instead,trademark law began as both protection against unfair competition and a form of consumer protection against deception.david welkowitz,trademark dilution federal,state,and international law.
thus,trademark law,both in the infringement and registration context,traditionally has been concerned with protecting consumers from being misled by the use of confusingly similar marks on goods originating from different producers,and with protecting a trademark owner good will against the sale of another product as his.prestonettes,coty.see also moseley.at qualitex jacobson prods,d united drug,at.mclean fleming.jerome gilson et,trademark protection practice,at to.this traditional view defined trademark law as prohibiting only those uses that convey a false impression to the public mind,and are of a character to mislead and deceive the ordinary purchaser in the exercise of ordinary care and caution in such matters.mclean,at,see also welkowitz,supra,at traditional trademark infringement protects mark owners and consumers from uses of the same or similar marks that cause confusion among potential consumers.emphasis in original.
when congress codified the common law on trademarks and unified the existing federal trademark statutes in the trademark act of,pub,stat.codified as amended in scattered portions of the lanham act,it reflected this traditional view of the nature of trademark protection and its limits 
are merely a convenient way of distinguishing the goods of one trader from those of another.by furnishing a means of identification,they perpetuate good will,and enable purchasers,by recognizing the marks,to buy again the goods which have pleased them before the public is thus assured of identity,and is given an opportunity to choose between competing articles.to protect,marks which permit the goods of different makers to be distinguished from each other,is to promote competition and is sound public policy.
the protection which is accorded is security against misrepresentation as to the origin of goods,by suppressing imitations which are calculated to mislead buyers into the belief that the goods of one maker are those of another.
at internal citation omitted see also gilson,supra,b.hence,the lanham act prohibits the federal registration of a mark which so resembles a mark registered in the patent office or a mark or trade name previously used in the united states by another and not abandoned,as to be likely,when applied to the goods of the applicant,to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.d.
because the primary evil to be prevented by the lanham act is the likelihood of consumer confusion,and not the protection of exclusive,gross rights in intellectual property,the lanham act also allows for the concurrent federal registration of marks for use in different geographic areas,so long as such use does not cause likelihood of consumer confusion.the act provides 
if the director determines that confusion,mistake,or deception is not likely to result from the continued use by more than one person of the same or similar marks under conditions and limitations as to the mode or place of use of the marks or the goods on or in connection with which such marks are used,concurrent registrations may be issued to such persons when they have become entitled to use such marks as a result of their concurrent lawful use in commerce 
d.concurrent use registrations can be obtained in concurrent use proceedings before the board,or by order of the district court in a civil action.our predecessor court defined the standards for the grant of concurrent use registrations and also articulated the complex rules for determining the geographic scope of each party right to the trademark,according to priority of use,priority of registration,and agreements between the parties,in the decision in re beatrice foods,uspq,
the cause of action for trademark dilution,unlike traditional trademark infringement law,is a relatively recent theory of relief.as the supreme court recently noted,u nlike traditional infringement law,the prohibitions against trademark dilution are not the product of development,and are not motivated by an interest in protecting consumers.moseley.at.rather,dilution law is intended to protect a mark owner from dilution of the mark value and uniqueness.see also ringling bailey combined shows,utah div.of travel,cir.the first dilution statute was adopted by massachusetts in,providing a cause of action for dilution notwithstanding the absence of competition between the parties or the absence of confusion as to the source of goods or services.laws ch.some state statutes provide dilution protection only for famous marks.see,ann.stat.ann.other states appear not to require a showing that a mark is famous.see.ann.west.bus.ann.vernon.
in congress passed the ftda.the legislation was the result of a desire to bring uniformity and nationwide scope to the law of trademark dilution,by creating a federal civil remedy for trademark dilution 
presently,the nature and extent of the remedies against trademark dilution varies from state to state and,therefore,can provide unpredictable and inadequate results for the trademark owner.the federal remedy provided in against trademark dilution will bring uniformity and consistency to the protection of famous marks 
at.the house judiciary committee stated that t he purpose of is to protect famous trademarks from subsequent uses that blur the distinctiveness of the mark or tarnish or disparage it,even in the absence of likelihood of confusion.id.at.as examples of famous marks,the committee mentioned dupont,buick,and kodak,and stated that t he geographic fame of the mark must extend throughout a substantial portion of the id.at.
in addition to creating a federal dilution remedy,the act sought to achieve uniformity by providing that the ownership by a person of a federal registration shall be a complete bar to an action against that person,with respect to that mark,that is brought by another person under the common law or a statute of a state and that seeks to prevent dilution of the distinctiveness of a mark.c.this provision was intended to further the intent of the lanham act to protect registered marks used in such commerce from interference by state,or territorial legislation,at quoting.
the ftda,while providing a civil remedy for trademark dilution,did not by its ter
