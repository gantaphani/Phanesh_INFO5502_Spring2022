the claims alleged in this trademark infringement case surfaced during the litigation of a contract action between custom manufacturing and engineering,custom and midway services,midway in florida state court.custom had agreed to design for midway a water meter reading system to be installed in residential complexes,but midway had cancelled the contract on the ground that custom had breached it and hired automated engineering corporation aec,mdco,mdco,ntu electronics,ntu,and engineers to finish the job.custom sued for damages,and midway counterclaimed,alleging breach of contract.
during the discovery phase of that lawsuit,custom learned that the water meter reading system that had been installed had used printed circuit boards that had been modified from the design it had created,but retained a printed legend containing custom trade name.armed with this discovery,custom brought this lawsuit,claiming trademark infringement against midway,aec,mdco,and ntu,and tortious interference with a business relationship against aec and the engineers involved in modifying the circuit boards.
on considering the defendants motions for summary judgment,the district court found that custom had failed to establish the likelihood that the purchasing public would be confused by the presence of custom trade name on the circuit boards and therefore dismissed custom trademark infringement claim.as for custom tortious interference claim,the district court dismissed the claim as meritless and imposed sanctions on custom counsel under federal rule of civil procedure.we find no error in the district court grants of summary judgment or an abuse of discretion in a discovery ruling custom challenges,and therefore affirm the district court judgment in all respects.
the relevant facts are presented in part i of this opinion.part ii summarizes custom claims and the procedural background of this appeal.part iii analyzes the substance of custom arguments and concludes that they are without merit.
founded in,custom is a technology company that provides research and development,engineering,software,and manufacturing services to the government and industrial markets.midway is a contractor of plumbing,electrical,submetering,and air conditioning services.aec and mdco are contract electronic manufacturers,and ntu is a manufacturer of printed circuit boards 
midway wished to market a system that could remotely read the water meters installed in each unit of residential complexes such as apartment buildings.in early,midway contracted with custom to design and manufacture such a system.custom designed a system that used radio waves to gather and transmit water usage data,and consisted of four components meter transmitters,transceivers,repeaters,and collectors.each of these components was to contain a by printed circuit board.custom,in turn,contracted with ntu to manufacture and supply these circuit boards,and also contracted with mdco to assist with affixing components on the circuit boards and assembling other system parts custom specified that the circuit boards manufactured by ntu were to contain a legend with custom trade name.appearing in small,plain font in the upper corner of each circuit board were the words mfg by custom manufacturing and engineering,for midway services,each of the circuit boards was fully encased in an opaque plastic housing unit.midway marketed the system to owners and managers of apartment buildings in several states.
although the system prototype had functioned properly,in the fall of midway reported to custom that the system was malfunctioning.unsurprisingly,the parties disagree as to the reason midway believes that the fault lay in the design of the transceiver component,while custom chalks up the problem to midway improper installation of the system.in early,with custom knowledge,midway retained judd sheets to evaluate the system and diagnose the problem.sheets professed unfamiliarity with the system and requested permission to consult with genium,genium and its president,james stosic.together,sheets and stosic determined that there were flaws in the design of the transceiver component and recommended that it be redesigned.because sheets and stosic were too busy to create a modified design themselves,they referred midway to two other engineers,james baughman and randy bell,to do the job.sheets and stosic met with baughman and bell to discuss their recommendations.sheets involvement with the entire matter lasted less than a month,while stosic involvement was approximately half that time.
to the extent possible,baughman and bell sought to incorporate the components of the original system in the modified design.they decided to redesign the original transceiver component so that it would function only as a receiver.meanwhile,the relationship between midway and custom soured as a result of custom alleged inability to adhere to the delivery schedule,causing midway to begin looking for a new supply source.in april,midway issued a purchase order to aec for the component parts of the original system.aec,in turn,contacted ntu to manufacture the circuit boards for the components.because ntu would not provide circuit boards to aec using custom tools and test fixtures,midway sent ntu the necessary information to construct the circuit boards.although the record is unclear as to what process of manufacture was used,ntu apparently duplicated all of the markings on the original circuit boards,including the legend containing custom trade name.
on june,midway sent a letter to custom that terminated the contract and instructed custom to stop all work.later that month,midway learned that mdco had previously supplied some components as a contract manufacturer for custom.midway contracted directly with mdco to supply transmitters,which were constructed using circuit boards manufactured by ntu.none of the defendants noticed that the circuit boards that ntu supplied to aec and or in the legend with custom trade name.by july,baughman and bell completed their redesign of the new receiver component.this new receiver used a new circuit board that was not manufactured by ntu and did not contain the legend.
in,custom sued midway in florida state court for breach of contract.midway countersued.discovery in that action unearthed the use of custom trade name on the circuit boards supplied to aec and mdco,and this litigation ensued.
on december,custom brought suit in the united states district court for the middle district of florida against the defendants in this appeal and against sheets,stosic,and genium.count of custom complaint alleged unfair competition in violation of section a of the lanham act,et count alleged violation of the florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act fdutpa.stat.et finally,count alleged that aec,stosic,genium,and sheets tortiously interfered with a business relationship in violation of florida law.
the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants with respect to counts and.the court also granted summary judgment in favor of aec,sheets,stosic,and genium on count,and imposed sanctions on custom counsel pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.custom timely appealed the judgment on counts and only,and the district court order denying custom motion to compel discovery relating to midway customers.

count of custom complaint alleged a claim pursuant to section of the lanham act,codified as.section a of the lanham act creates a federal cause of action for unfair competition in interstate commerce,and forbids unfair trade practices involving infringement of trademarks,even in the absence of federal trademark registration.of florida kpb,cir per curiam unlike the general prohibition against unauthorized copying that exists in patent and copyright law,see bunn aaa replacement parts,cir the patent and copyright laws exist to prevent copies from being produced at all,without the consent of the registered holder.the touchstone of liability in a trademark infringement action is not simply whether there is unauthorized use of a protected mark,but whether such use is likely to cause consumer confusion.see id.at outright copying is often a civilizing rather than a cannibalizing folkway.the world would be a duller place without the originators,but it would not work without the copyists whatever the legal competitive rights one might have to copy and to sell the works originated by another,the copyist,if state law so requires,can not palm off his copied goods as the genuine goods of the originator,to the deceit of the purchasing public.see also sales assocs.daroff sons,cir noting that the federal remedy against trademark infringement is not plenary,and is only available when the plaintiff can show a likelihood of confusion,mistake or deception arising in the market as a result of defendant use of the mark registered to plaintiff.

the district court discussion of count eschewed analysis of the first element concerning the validity of custom mark and proceeded directly to the second element,the likelihood of confusion.the court entered summary judgment for the defendants based on its determination that the fatal weakness in custom claim is that there is no evidence of any likelihood of confusion,which is an essential element.custom eng g,midway,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.may,
custom argues that the district court misapplied the seven factors articulated in frehling enterprises.indeed,the district court made no mention of these factors at all.while a more systematic approach would have aided our review of such a inquiry,we find that analysis of the factors here is ultimately unnecessary to affirm the district court ruling.
because the bottom line is the likelihood of consumer confusion,application of the frehling factors entails more than the mechanistic summation of the number of factors on each side it involves an evaluation of the overall balance.see frehling,at see also jellibeans,skating clubs of georgia,cir we note that the district court should not determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists by merely computing whether a majority of the subsidiary facts indicates that such a likelihood exists.rather,the district court must evaluate the weight to be accorded the individual subsidiary facts and then make its ultimate fact decision.we have consistently held,for example,that t he type of mark and evidence of actual confusion are the most weighty of considerations,herbal health,cir per curiam.moreover,while these seven subsidiary findings typically inform a court determination of the likelihood of confusion,a court must also take into account the unique facts of each case.as the sixth circuit has observed 
these factors imply no mathematical precision,but are simply a guide to help determine whether confusion is likely.they are also interrelated in effect.each case presents its own complex set of circumstances and not all of these factors may be particularly helpful in any given case the ultimate question remains whether relevant consumers are likely to believe that the products or services offered by the parties are affiliated in some way.

this case does not resemble the paradigmatic passing off case.the goods on which custom mark was affixed were subcomponents manufactured for use in a product that was marketed to apartment complex owners and managers,not to custom customers.no more of the circuit boards bearing custom trade name were made after july baughman and bell had completed their redesign of the transceiver an unknown number of components containing the putatively offending circuit boards have subsequently been replaced.thus,the question in this case involves the likelihood of confusion in the,whether custom or midway potential customers are likely to be confused as to the origin of the extant circuit boards.see united states torkington,cir noting that under the likely to confuse test of,the relevant audience is the purchasing public,which includes both those who are potential direct purchasers of the allegedly counterfeit goods and potential purchasers of the trademark holder products who encounter allegedly counterfeit goods in a example,in a direct purchaser possession.
custom trade name can not be viewed without first removing the opaque plastic housing units that completely cover the circuit boards in question.moreover,the particular circuit boards in question correspond only to the components in the system that were originally designated as transceivers.transceivers are located in two places the attic of the building to receive messages from the apartment transmitters and send this data to the repeater boxes or collector boxes or the outside of the building to receive messages from repeater boxes and relay the signal to an adjacent building.because the system utilizes radio transmission,the transceivers are normally mounted as high as possible in attics,roofs,and exterior walls to reduce transmission interferences.we therefore find that it is unlikely that the apartment owners and managers to whom midway sold the water meter reading systems would remove these covers and examine the circuit boards contained therein.
custom argues that persons other than apartment owners and managers are likely to be confused by the circuit boards.specifically,they contend that repair technicians would believe that the circuit boards were manufactured by custom,as would fire marshals or other officials who might view the water meter reading system in the event of a fire.this argument does not cut the mustard.in the first place,neither repair technicians nor fire marshals can properly be regarded as the actual or custom or midway second,even if such pers
