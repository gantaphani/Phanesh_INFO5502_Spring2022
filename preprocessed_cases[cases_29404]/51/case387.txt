this is the latest round in a protracted trademark dispute between jerry famous deli jerry deli and constantino papanicolaou,the proprietor of roxy famous deli roxy deli.both famous delis are los restaurants featuring a new theme that includes an extensive menu of fare,broadway show posters,celebrity photos,and stage lighting fixtures.
in this appeal,we affirm the district court finding of civil contempt against papanicolaou for violation of a stipulated injunction governing trademark use.we vacate and remand the disgorgement of profits sanction because the record does not provide a rationale for rejecting papanicolaou challenges to the auditor calculations.
background 
jerry deli opened in under the name jerry famous deli,thirteen years before roxy famous deli began operations in the thousand oaks area.jerry deli staked out a distinct trade dress featuring new york fare and decor.jerry deli now boasts several los angeles area locations,all of which share a red and white color scheme with green accents,broadway playbills displayed as the predominant interior decoration,lighting fixtures,and large display counters.the jerry deli restaurants all use the same extensive menu and offer takeout and catering services.since it first opened,jerry deli has traded under a circular mark with the word jerry appearing in an arch on the top,centered over the word famous,which in turn lies in a straight line above the word deli.all three words appear in a style known as broadway font.
shortly after papanicolaou opened roxy famous deli in,jerry deli sued for trademark infringement.when that action settled in,papanicolaou agreed to change the logo of roxy deli,modify the menu,and refrain from future infringement of jerry deli intellectual property rights.in,jerry deli sued again,claiming continued trademark violations.this action led to another settlement and the entry of a stipulated permanent injunction.
two years later,jerry deli filed a motion alleging violation of the injunction and seeking a contempt ruling against papanicolaou.the district court granted jerry deli motion,issued an order finding papanicolaou in contempt,and ordered disgorgement of profits and an award of attorney fees.the court granted the request for an accounting of papanicolaou profits,but did not initially award jerry deli attorney fees because of its failure to provide an adequately detailed accounting.after additional briefing,the court later awarded jerry deli the bulk of its requested attorney fees.
in response to the disgorgement order,papanicolaou submitted a profits accounting,which was rejected by the district court as unreliable,primarily because it was unaudited.the district court then directed the parties to stipulate to an independent auditor or submit nominations for an auditor to be chosen by the court.because they were unable to reach agreement,the court appointed the auditor proposed by jerry deli.after the auditor appointment,the parties continued to disagree about the scope of the audit.they resolved their deadlock by stipulating that the auditor would forego the audit originally ordered by the court and instead perform a special investigation of roxy deli profits during the relevant time.
the auditor completed this task approximately four months later,issuing a report dated april,that concluded that the profits for roxy deli amounted to for.on may,jerry deli filed a notice of filing of the report,requesting the court to adopt its findings and award treble damages and attorney fees.papanicolaou filed an objection to the auditor calculations on may,and requested a hearing to air his complaints.in his opposition,he stated that he intended to file additional documentation.
on july,jerry deli filed an ex parte application requesting the court to issue a determination based on the auditor report.papanicolaou filed an opposition on august,again requesting a hearing,and suggesting that in the alternative the court order his opposition brief filed by august.on august,without a formal hearing,the court ordered papanicolaou to pay jerry deli,the auditor profits figure adjusted to discount the profits earned prior to the injunction order in.
papanicolaou then moved to vacate or amend the court disgorgement and attorney fees orders,arguing that the disgorgement order was issued without affording him due process,and that both orders were either void or in need of amendment because the attorney fees order was based in part on the disgorgement order.the court denied the motion and papanicolaou appealed.
i.the contempt order 
the district court contempt order found papanicolaou in violation of three provisions of the stipulated permanent injunction.papanicolaou challenges all three findings.giving due deference to the district court determination,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion,nor were its findings in clear error.see sec hickey,cir,amended by cir we review a district court contempt order for abuse of discretion in re dyer,cir we review the underlying findings of fact for clear error.we affirm the contempt order.
overall trade dress 
we consider first the district court finding that papanicolaou violated a provision of the injunction designed to protect the cumulative impression conveyed by certain aspects of jerry deli trade dress.the injunction order prohibited papanicolaou from using in combination the following elements 
broadway lettering in its logo,service mark,advertising,promotions,souvenirs,or,or catering menus 
the colors red and white with green accents as predominant in its advertising,promotions,souvenirs,or restaurant decor 
broadway show posters as a predominant feature of its restaurant decor 
stage or movie style lighting fixtures in its restaurant decor.
in its contempt order,the district court found that papanicolaou had persisted in using all of the above four elements in a manner likely to create consumer confusion.
considering all the evidence in the record,the district court did not clearly err in finding that broadway lettering appears prominently in defendant logo,service mark,advertising and menus the colors red and white with green accents appear predominantly in defendant advertising or promotions and defendant use of broadway show posters and stage or movie style lighting fixtures as predominant features of its restaurant decor violates elements and of the relevant paragraph of the injunction.
notwithstanding his assertion that the district court findings were based on no evidence,papanicolaou apparently fails to understand that we may not replace the district court factual findings with our own unless we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.see easley cromartie,d.instead,the theme of his argument seems to be that he can not be found in contempt of the injunction because he took steps to comply and did not engage in a shell game to test its boundaries.
specifically,papanicolaou does not challenge the presence of broadway lettering in his restaurant materials.neither does he contest his continued use of the restricted colors and the broadway show posters.he argues,however,that neither of these features was predominant because the entire color scheme of the restaurant had changed to earthtones and the posters were but a natural advertisement.both of these arguments miss the point even if we agreed,we would still have to affirm.
with respect to the colors,the injunction limited their use as a predominant feature in roxy deli advertising,promotions,souvenirs,or restaurant decor.the district court found them predominant in the menu and outdoor sign for roxy that is,its advertising and promotions.papanicolaou,however,claims only that the colors were not predominant in the restaurant decor.because the injunction limited the use of the colors in advertising,promotions,or restaurant decor not advertising,promotions,and restaurant decor papanicolaou argument simply misses its mark.his attack with respect to the broadway show posters suffers from the same affliction.the injunction restricts roxy use of the posters as a predominant feature of its restaurant decor it makes no exception
