appellant swatch ag brings this action seeking reversal of the district court order denying its opposition to appellee beehive wholesale,llc trademark application and dismissing its related claims for federal,state,and common law trademark infringement,trademark dilution,and unfair competition.swatch appeals on the ground that the district court underlying factual findings that there is no likelihood of confusion between swatch and beehive marks and that beehive mark is not merely descriptive are clearly erroneous.for the reasons that follow we affirm.
swatch is a swiss corporation that produces watches,clocks,jewelry,and various materials for watch collectors.it is the owner of three registrations for the mark and for materials bearing that mark.beehive is a louisiana company engaged in wholesale and retail sales of a variety of products including watches and watch parts.
beehive produces and sells watch bands and faces under the mark swap.the defining feature of these watch parts is that they are interchangeable.a purchaser of beehive watch components is able to affix any swap watch face to most or all swap watchbands.swatch brand watches,which are typically sold at a higher price point,do not include interchangeable components.
on july,beehive applied to the patent and trademark office pto to register its mark,swap,for use on its w atch faces,ribbon watch bands,slide pendants,and beaded watch bands.beehive application was preliminarily granted and published for on december.on april,swatch filed a notice of opposition to beehive application on three grounds priority of swatch mark and likelihood of confusion mere descriptiveness of beehive mark and dilution of swatch by beehive use of swap.swatch primarily argued that the similarity of beehive swap mark to its swatch mark in combination with the similar character of their products was likely to result in confusion among consumers as to the origin of the goods.it also argued that swap is too generic to be registered.the parties submitted evidence concerning their products,sales,revenue,and advertising,as well as deposition testimony regarding beehive selection of the swap mark.the opposition was heard and dismissed on all counts by the trademark trial and appeal board ttab.
swatch then filed a civil action in the eastern district of virginia seeking the cancelation of beehive registration under b.swatch added new claims for trademark infringement and federal unfair competition under the lanham act,a trademark dilution under the trademark dilution act,c state trademark infringement under and common law unfair competition.it also submitted documentary evidence not presented to the ttab including facts relevant to the swap variant,the parties channels of distribution,and swatch claim.the parties agreed to forgo live testimony and have the matter decided solely on the written record.the district court,upon consideration of the materials before it,affirmed the ttab,holding that its determinations were supported by substantial evidence.it also found facts based on evidence not presented to the ttab pursuant to its authority under b.the district court concluded,on the basis of these combined findings,that there was no likelihood of confusion between the two marks and no likelihood that swap would dilute swatch.it dismissed swatch infringement and unfair competition claims as a matter of law.it also concluded that beehive mark is registrable because it is not merely descriptive.this appeal followed.
on appeal,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.likelihood of confusion is an inherently factual issue,and we review district court determinations regarding it under a clearly erroneous standard.petro shopping,james river petroleum,cir.the strength of a mark and whether it is capable of being registered are also questions of fact that we review for clear error.pizzeria uno temple,cir.we have yet to provide definitive guidance as to how dilution claims should be reviewed because the trademark dilution revision act,c tdra is a recent enactment.however,likelihood of dilution,like likelihood of confusion,is a inquiry,so the appropriate standard of review is clear error.louis vuitton malletier haute diggity dog,llc,cir reciting multifactor factual tests for determining the likelihood of dilution,including proving the fame of the plaintiff mark and the likelihood that an association between two marks will impair the distinctiveness of the plaintiff mark 
section b of title of the united states code permits a party in a trademark suit to initiate a civil action in the place of an appeal of the ttab determination to the federal circuit.b.a brief description of the procedural features of b is helpful to our analysis.
in a b action,the district court reviews the record de novo and acts as the finder of fact.durox duron paint,cir.the district court has authority independent of the pto to grant or cancel registrations and to decide any related matters such as infringement and unfair competition claims.b.the district court must admit the pto record if a party so moves,and if admitted,the record shall have the same effect as if originally taken and produced in the suit.id.at b.whether or not the record is admitted,the parties have an unrestricted right to submit further evidence as long as it is admissible under the federal rules of evidence and civil procedure.see also kappos hyatt,interpreting b patent parallel.
kappos is the primary case interpreting the patent and trademark civil action statutes.in kappos,the pto argued that in a proceeding where new evidence is admitted,the district court should defer to its findings,and should overturn the pto factual findings only if the new evidence clearly establishes that the agency erred.the supreme court rejected the pto premise that a suit creates a special proceeding that is distinct from a typical civil suit filed in federal district court,id.at,and adopted the federal circuit position that where new evidence is presented to the district court on a disputed fact question,a de novo finding will be necessary to take such evidence into account together with the evidence before the board.id.at quoting fregeau mossinghoff.it held that the district court does not act as the reviewing court envisioned by the apa,because the court must determine,among other things,how the new evidence comports with the existing administrative record,and as a logical matter it can only make this determination de novo because it is the first tribunal to hear the evidence.id.at.
kappos also explicitly defines the only situation where consideration of the ttab decision is permitted.the court adopted the federal circuit rule that the district court may,in its discretion,consider the proceedings before and findings of the patent office in deciding what weight to afford an applicant evidence.id.at quoting hyatt kappos,in sum,where new evidence is submitted,de novo review of the entire record is required because the district court can not meaningfully defer to the pto factual findings if the pto considered a different set of facts.id.
we are constrained to conclude that the standard of review articulated by the district court is erroneous.its statement that in a b proceeding it sits in a dual capacity and applies a unique standard of review,acting in part as an appellate body,is in tension with the statute and directly conflicts with the requirements of kappos.swatch,beehive wholesale,d.
however,it is not clear from the record that the district court did in fact improperly defer to the factual findings of the ttab,and remand is therefore unnecessary.as an initial matter,the district court properly reviewed swatch claim entirely de novo because the ttab did not address it on the merits.swatch,d at.the district court also decided swatch trademark infringement and unfair competition claims,which were not before the ttab,de novo.although the district court stated that it would apply an impermissible hybrid review to its likelihood of confusion and analyses,there are more than sufficient facts recited in its opinion to support its findings.
the district court affirmed the ttab finding that swap is not merely descriptive and found on a de novo review of newly submitted evidence that swap was suggestive and not merely descriptive.although the district court stated that it was deferring to the ttab findings on the administrative record,it also stated that it undertook de novo review of the swap registerability to account for new evidence,as required by the statute.id.at.while it is not clear exactly what standard of review the district court applied,it appears that it made sufficient factual findings of its own to justify a holding that swap is in fact suggestive and not descriptive.
because of the nature of the inquiry,the district court possible failure to reexamine all of the evidence de novo does not have a substantial effect on its analysis.marks are divided into four categories of distinctiveness.george,llc imagination entertainment,cir.the second and third categories,suggestive and descriptive marks,are at issue here.suggestive marks are inherently distinctive.id.they do not describe a product features but merely suggest them,and are therefore entitled to trademark protection.id.a descriptive mark define s a particular characteristic of the product in a way that does not require any exercise of the imagination.id.it is thus not entitled to protection unless it has acquired a secondary meaning.id.
the question before the district court was whether swap is merely descriptive of a feature of beehive products,specifically the interchangeability of its watch parts.while we have recognized that it is often difficult to categorize suggestive versus descriptive marks,it is nevertheless an objective factual matter to be decided by the trier of fact based on the meaning of a mark and the attributes of the accompanying product.because the central distinction is whether or not the mark imparts information about the goods directly,it is difficult to see what evidence outside of the mark and the attributes of the product could be of assistance to the court 
for this reason,we find that even if the district court considered only the newly adduced evidence de novo,it found facts sufficient to support its finding that swap is not merely descriptive.the district court found,based on the new advertisements swatch submitted,that swap was suggestive because merely showing the mark and the product together would be insufficient to convey its attributes.while a merely descriptive mark could be used in this manner,e xplaining the function of beehive product requires a further leap.swatch,d at.the court found that individuals,even retail professionals familiar with the products had to exercise some imagination to connect swap with the function of beehive watches,as evidenced by diagrams on beehive advertisements that not only add arrows but adorn swap with the word it id.
we find no error in these determinations,and swatch arguments on this point are unavailing.aside from its conclusory assertions that swap describes the interchangeability feature of beehive watches,swatch primarily argues that the district court erred by failing to credit admissions by beehive executives that swap is descriptive.for purposes of this analysis the district court treatment of these statements does not matter.as noted above,descriptiveness is an objective determination that the district court makes on the basis of the meaning of a mark and the features of any associated products.for this reason,the opinion of a witness,particularly a lay witness,that a mark is descriptive rather than suggestive can be of no assistance.
the district court found that there was no likelihood of confusion between swatch and swap.swatch argues on appeal that the district court erred because swap is so similar to swatch that customers are likely to be confused about the origin of beehive products.although the district court did improperly review ttab determinations for substantial evidence in some instances,because it was presented with different evidence and applied a test with different factors from the ttab the court made sufficient de novo determinations to support its finding.
to demonstrate a likelihood of confusion,swatch must prove both that it has a valid and protectable mark,an element that beehive concedes in this case,and that beehive use of swap creates a likelihood of confusion.petro shopping,at.likelihood of confusion is an inherently factual issue.id.at.
a likelihood of confusion exists between two marks if the defendant actual practice is likely to produce confusion in the minds of consumers about the origin of the goods or services in question.carefirst of maryland,first care,cir quoting kp permanent make up,lasting impression i.to determine if there is a likelihood of confusion between two marks,we consider nine and factors 
the strength or distinctiveness of the plaintiff mark as actually used in the marketplace the similarity of the two marks to consumers the similarity of the goods or services that the marks identify the similarity of the facilities used by the markholders the similarity of advertising used by the markholders the defendant intent actual confusion the quality of the defendant product and the sophistication of the consuming public.
george,at.these nine factors serve as a guide rather than a rigid formula for infringement they are not all of equal importance and not all factors are relevant in every case.id 
the parties agree on appeal that the first and third factors weigh in favor of swatch.the district court found,however,that the other factors weigh heavily against a likelihood of confusion.
first,the district court determined under the second factor that swatch and swap are not confusingly similar.the court stated that it agree d with the ttab that the marks themselves were dissimilar in sight,sound,and meaning and that the ttab finding was therefore supported by substantial evidence,implying impermissible deference.swatch,d at.however,in a practical sense,the district court could not have concluded that the ttab finding was supported by substantial evidence without performing a de novo review.it is clear from both the ttab and the district court opinions that the only relevant evidence for this finding was the marks themselves and dictionary definitions of the words they contain the district court clearly considered the marks themselves and the dictionary definitions,which appear in its opinion.although the district court said it agreed with the ttab,given the nature of the question before it there was little need for deference.it would be apparent to an average consumer that swatch and swap look different when written sound different when spoken and have completely different meanings in common usage.
swatch argues that the district court erred because it should have focused on swa as the dominant portion of both marks.we compare whole words,not parts,see sara lee kayser roth,cir,and generally use the phrase dominant portion to refer to the words in multiword marks,see lone star steakhouse saloon,alpha of virginia,cir identifying lone star as the dominant portion of the lone star steakhouse saloon and lone star grill marks.therefore the district court correctly considered the similarities between swap and swatch as whole words and did not err in finding that the stylized marks are dissimilar 
moreover,the district court explicitly determined de novo that the marks were dissimilar as they generally appear in commerce.swatch,supp at.the appearance of the mark in commerce is the relevant inquiry under our precedent.anheuser busch,l l wings,holding that to determine if the use of a mark creates a likelihood of confusion with a protected trademark we must examine the allegedly infringing use in the context in which it is seen by the ordinary consumer.
the district court correctly noted that accompaniments to marks and the manner in which they are presented in connection with goods can significantly reduce the likelihood of confusion between similar marks.see carefirst,at.it found that swatch almost exclusively appears accompanied by a swiss flag both on products and in advertisements,while swap is gene
