the district court initially denied von drehle request to amend its pleadings to assert the preclusion defenses,finding that the request was untimely and was prejudicial to georgia pacific.the matter proceeded to a jury trial,resulting in a verdict in georgia pacific favor.thereafter,the district court issued an order vacating the jury verdict and awarding judgment in von drehle favor,relying on the preclusion defenses arising from the arkansas case that the district court earlier had rejected.georgia pacific consumer prods.lp von drehle,d.georgia pacific appeals from the district court judgment in favor of von drehle.
upon our review,we hold that the district court erred in vacating the jury verdict and in awarding judgment in von drehle favor.we reach this decision because von drehle waived the preclusion defenses by failing to assert them in a timely manner and the district court erred in alternatively considering the preclusion defenses sua sponte.accordingly,we vacate the district court award of judgment in von drehle favor,and we remand the case to the district court with instructions to reinstate the jury verdict in favor of georgia pacific.
the facts underlying this dispute are discussed in detail in our previous adjudication of this case.see at.georgia pacific is a manufacturer of numerous commercial products,including paper towels and dispensers designed for use in the home and in business retail and hospitality settings.in the early,georgia pacific manufactured and began marketing a touchless paper towel dispenser the gp dispenser under the enmotion product line.the gp dispenser was different in size and dimensions from competing dispensers,and georgia pacific developed paper towels with a feel the gp paper towels,which were designed specifically for use in the gp dispensers.the leases for the dispensers between georgia pacific and its distributors,and the subleases that the distributors were required to enter into with customers such as hotels and restaurants,both stipulated that only the gp paper towels were to be used in the gp dispensers.id.at.
soon after the gp dispensers entered the marketplace,von drehle,a smaller competitor of georgia pacific,developed a line of paper towels the von drehle paper towels that were designed for use in the gp dispensers.the von drehle paper towels were inferior in quality to the gp paper towels,but von drehle and its distributors marketed the von drehle paper towels as a cheaper alternative for use in the gp dispensers,a practice known in the industry as stuffing.id.at.
in july,georgia pacific filed a complaint against von drehle in the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina,alleging,among other things,contributory trademark infringement in violation of section of the lanham act,during the pendency of this litigation with von drehle,georgia pacific filed separate complaints in several other federal district courts against various distributors of von drehle paper towels,including a complaint in the western district of arkansas the arkansas court filed in september against myers supply,the myers case a complaint in the northern district of ohio filed in may against four u packaging,the four u case and a complaint,also filed in may,in the southern district of ohio against superior janitor supply,the superior case.in these complaints,georgia pacific raised,among other claims,a claim for contributory trademark infringement based on these distributors acts of marketing and selling the von drehle paper towels for use in the gp dispensers.
in march,the district court in the present case denied georgia pacific and von drehle for summary judgment.in april,however,the district court held a hearing during which the court informed the parties that it was reconsidering,sua sponte,von drehle motion for summary judgment.on august,the court entered an order granting summary judgment in von drehle favor on the contributory trademark infringement claim.d.
in its summary judgment decision,the district court concluded that georgia pacific failed to adduce sufficient facts to allow a jury to find that von drehle sale of its paper towels for use in the gp dispensers caused consumer confusion regarding the identity of the towel manufacturer.id.at.the court also found that georgia pacific incorrectly focused on the actual users of the towels in the gp dispensers as the relevant class of persons in the likelihood of confusion analysis.id.at.the court held that,instead,the relevant class of consumers in such an analysis was the business owners who purchased the paper towels for use by their patrons.id.
on appeal,in an opinion issued on august,we vacated the district court award of summary judgment in favor of von drehle on the contributory trademark infringement claim,and remanded the matter for further proceedings consistent with our decision.we concluded that the district court erred in limiting its likelihood of confusion inquiry to distributors who purchased the von drehle paper towels and their respective customers,and that the likelihood of confusion inquiry could take into account confusion among the public,such as restroom users.id.at.we further concluded that georgia pacific proffered sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find a likelihood of confusion among restroom visitors as to the source of the paper toweling being dispensed from the gp dispensers when such dispensers are stuffed with the von drehle paper towels.id.at.accordingly,we held that georgia pacific had satisfied its burden at the summary judgment stage to allow a jury to make the ultimate determination whether von drehle was liable for contributory trademark infringement id.at.
on november,more than three months after we issued our opinion vacating the district court summary judgment order,and more than two months after our mandate was issued von drehle sought for the first time to amend its answer to assert the affirmative defenses of claim preclusion and issue preclusion the defenses were based on the purported preclusive effect of the myers judgment entered in july.see georgia pacific consumer prod.lp myers supply,cv,wl.july,the myers decision or the myers judgment,aff,cir.the district court in myers found in the defendant distributor favor,concluding that georgia pacific failed to demonstrate that the defendant distributor stuffing of the von drehle paper towels in the gp dispensers created a likelihood of confusion wl,at.notably,von drehle trial counsel in the present matter attended the myers bench trial,and immediately thereafter was made aware of the arkansas court judgment.
in total,more than days elapsed between the arkansas court decision in myers and von drehle initial attempt in the district court to assert the preclusion defenses based on the myers holding.as noted above,the district court in the present case initially denied von drehle motion to amend its answer and affirmative defenses on the basis that the motion was untimely in that initial order in march,the district court noted that the arkansas decision in myers was issued months before the filing of von drehle motion to amend,and that von drehle had not raised the preclusion defenses in the earlier appeal before this court.the district court further stated in the order that 
von drehle has unduly delayed in amending its answer.although von drehle was not a party to the arkansas case,two of von drehle attorneys attended the trial and knew about the court decision.up until now,von drehle has never requested that this c ourt,or the fourth circuit,stay or dismiss this case for issue or claim preclusion.to the contrary,von drehle continued to pursue its counterclaim up to the fourth circuit for a year after the arkansas decision.similarly,von drehle has had months to clarify its other defenses in the wake of the myers decision.von drehle has provided no justifiable reason for its delay,and its argument that no significant time has passed is unpersuasive.
alternatively,these amendments would prejudice gp.in the months between the arkansas decision and von drehle motion,gp has expended considerable time,energy,and resources litigating this case.this matter is finally ready for trial.all this effort,not to mention the efforts of this court and that of the fourth circuit,could have been avoided if von drehle had amended its defenses to include claim and issue preclusion back in.von drehle can not now be rewarded after it wasted the time and money of gp and the justice system.for the same reasons,von drehle can not now clarify its defenses based on the arkansas decision in myers.
emphasis added citations and internal quotation marks omitted.von drehle later filed a motion asking that the district court reconsider its decision,which the court also denied.
in november,about two months before the scheduled trial date,von drehle again filed a motion to amend its answer to include the preclusion defenses,and a motion for summary judgment based on those defenses.von drehle asserted that consideration of the preclusion defenses was proper because the northern district of ohio in the four u case had issued a decision four days earlier,holding that georgia pacific claims against that defendant distributor were precluded based on the myers judgment see georgia pacific consumer prods.lp four u packaging,d the four u decision.the district court did not rule on von drehle motions before trial.

von drehle filed a motion renewing its request for judgment as a matter of law,and an additional motion seeking to supplement its answer to include the preclusion defenses.in a reversal of its previous orders addressing the same issue,the district court allowed von drehle to assert claim preclusion and issue preclusion as affirmative defenses,and entered judgment as a matter of law in von drehle favor based on those defenses,thereby vacating the judgment in favor of georgia pacific.d at.
in a memorandum opinion accompanying its final judgment order,the district court stated that it agreed to consider the preclusion defenses because von drehle timely brought the four u decision to the court attention.d at.the district court stated that,in the alternative,it would consider the preclusion defenses sua sponte.id.
comparing the issues then before the district court with the issues decided by the arkansas court in myers,the district court held that georgia pacific claims were barred under both the doctrine of claim preclusion and the doctrine of issue preclusion.d at.although the district court made passing mention of the four u decision,the court substantive analysis focused on the judgment in the myers case and whether that case precluded georgia pacific claims in the present matter.see d at t he court finds that a preclusion defense based on the earlier judgment entered in the western district of arkansas,which was affirmed by the eighth circuit court of appeals and held to be preclusive in the northern district of ohio,is justified.emphasis added.after the district court entered judgment in von drehle favor,georgia pacific timely filed a notice of appeal.
georgia pacific argues that von drehle waived the preclusion defenses by failing to assert them in a timely manner,and that the district court abused its discretion by considering those defenses.we review a district court decision to grant or deny a party leave to amend its pleadings under an standard.edwards city of goldsboro,cir see also laber harvey,cir en banc.among other circumstances,a district court abuses its discretion when it acts in an arbitrary manner or relies on an erroneous principle of law.united states nicholson,cir.

instead,von drehle allowed three significant periods in the litigation to conclude before first seeking to assert the preclusion defenses.these three periods included the days that elapsed between the myers decision and the district court award of summary judgment in august the period that this court retained jurisdiction over this matter in the initial appeal,during which von drehle could have argued that the myers decision provided an alternative basis for affirmance of the district court summary judgment decision and the period that elapsed between the issuance of our opinion vacating the district court judgment and the motion filed by von drehle in november seeking leave to amend its pleadings.
as the district court duly noted in its initial ruling in march,von drehle request was untimely because von drehle counsel had immediate knowledge of the myers decision von drehle failed to provide a valid reason for its delay von drehle inaction caused georgia pacific to expend considerable time,energy,and resources litigating this matter and after several years of litigation in the district court and this court,the case was ready for trial.despite this ruling,after the jury verdict,the district court repudiated these earlier findings by granting judgment in von drehle favor based
