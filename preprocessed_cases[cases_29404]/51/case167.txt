luv n care,luv n care,a louisiana corporation,appeals the dismissal of its suit against,and several related entities collectively,citizens of colorado,for lack of personal jurisdiction.we reverse and remand.
luv n care is an international corporation based in monroe,louisiana,that specializes in the design,manufacture,and sale of a variety of infant care products.is a small colorado corporation that holds the patent on a plastic bottle with a freezable core,for use by both athletes and children.the design of the straw cap of bottle allegedly bears resemblance to a bottle cap produced by luv n care 
has sold of its patented bottles to and a few other vendors.although resells the product at its retail locations,does not ship the product directly to stores but,instead,trucks or carriers assigned by transport the bottles from dock in colorado springs to one of distribution centers nationwide.
the vendor agreement that gives the right to purchase and retail these bottles indicates that assumes ownership of the bottles when they are loaded in colorado springs.the agreement also mentions several possible distribution centers,but none in louisiana.transported copies of the bottle,or approximately shipments,with total revenue to of,to its distribution center in opelousas,louisiana.
received and filled purchase orders from via an electronic data interchange edi system,which contains information regarding the price,quantity,and destination of each shipment.once an order is filled,the edi system automatically sends to an electronic invoice that contains the letterhead of an entity and the destination address.
the record contains several invoices with a send to location of the distribution center in opelousas.alleges that it had no knowledge of the destination of the products until it printed out information from the edi system in response to a discovery request in this litigation.it appears that eventually some of bottles reached stores in louisiana,repackaged under the trade name.
it is undisputed that has no employees or agent for service of process in louisiana and conducts no direct sales or marketing there.rather,its only contact with louisiana is its sales of items to.
luv n care sued for copyright infringement,et,and trademark dilution and unfair competition under the lanham act,a a and b.moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b and for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue.
the magistrate judge issued a recommendation that the suit be dismissed because s imply placing a product in the stream of commerce is not sufficient to create personal jurisdiction even if it were foreseeable that the product might end up in louisiana.because the magistrate judge found the jurisdictional issue dispositive,he did not reach the venue issue.the district court adopted the recommendation.
we review de novo a district court determination that it lacks personal jurisdiction over a defendant.adams unione mediterranea di sicurta,cir.where a defendant challenges personal jurisdiction,the party seeking to invoke the power of the court bears the burden of proving that jurisdiction exists.wyatt kaplan,cir.the plaintiff need not,however,establish jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie showing suffices.id.this court must resolve all undisputed facts submitted by the plaintiff,as well as all facts contested in the affidavits,in favor of jurisdiction.id.
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment guarantees that no federal court may assume jurisdiction in personam of a defendant unless the defendant has meaningful contacts,ties,or relations with the forum state.int l shoe washington.jurisdiction may be general or specific.where a defendant has continuous and systematic general business contacts with the forum state,helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d,the court may exercise general jurisdiction over any action brought against that defendant.id.at.where contacts are less pervasive,the court may still exercise specific jurisdiction in a suit arising out of or related to the defendant contacts with the forum.id.at.this case presents only the question of specific jurisdiction.
a federal court may satisfy the constitutional requirements for specific jurisdiction by a showing that the defendant has minimum contacts with the forum state such that imposing a judgment would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe,at.in nuovo pignone storman asia,cir,we consolidated the personal jurisdiction inquiry into a convenient analysis whether the defendant purposely directed its activities toward the forum state or purposely availed itself of the privileges of conducting activities there whether the plaintiff cause of action arises out of or results from the defendant contacts and whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is fair and reasonable.id.at citing burger king rudzewicz,d.the forum state may create,and this court would be bound to apply,additional jurisdictional restrictions by statute,adams,at,but louisiana statute extends jurisdiction to the constitutional limit.b,so the two inquiries in this case fold into one.
to determine whether has minimum contacts with louisiana,we must identify some act whereby it purposely avail ed itself of the privilege of conducting activities there,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.the defendant conduct must show that it reasonably anticipates being haled into court in louisiana.world wide volkswagen woodson,d.likewise,a defendant may permissibly alter its behavior in certain ways to avoid being subject to suit.id.
the district court erred in holding that placing a product into the stream of commerce,at least where the defendant knows the product will ultimately reach the forum state,does not rise to the level of purposeful availment.this court has consistently held that mere foreseeability or awareness is a constitutionally sufficient basis for personal jurisdiction if the defendant product made its way into the forum state while still in the stream of commerce.we adopted this position in an effort faithfully to interpret world wide volkswagen,at,which holds that a state does not offend due process by exercising jurisdiction over an entity that delivers its products into the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum state.
where a defendant knowingly benefits from the availability of a particular state market for its products,it is only fitting that the defendant be amenable to suit in that state we have,therefore,declined to follow the suggestion of the plurality in asahi,at,that some additional action on the part of the defendant,beyond foreseeability,is necessary to convert the mere act of placing the product into the stream into an act purposefully directed toward the forum state.applying this circuit more relaxed mere foreseeability test to the facts of this case,we conclude that contacts with louisiana are sufficient to withstand constitutional scrutiny.
maintains that had complete control over the ultimate destination of its goods once they left the warehouse in colorado springs and that could even make a decision to the goods to other distribution centers not listed on the invoices.a unilateral decision to take a chattel to a distant state does not suffice to confer jurisdiction.world wide volkswagen,at.this case,though,does not present facts to the effect that a buyer transported goods intended for louisiana to a distribution center in a state.rather,in and filled approximately purchase orders for items bound for louisiana and sent invoices to confirming the same.
claims that its employees had no actual knowledge of the intended destination of its goods until it consulted the edi system in preparation for this litigation.this claim is implausible and could not defeat jurisdiction even if true.it is eminently foreseeable that products would reach the market indicated on the company invoices.in fact,derived substantial revenue about of its total distribution from its sale of thousands of units bound for opelousas although businesses should be able to take advantage of the increased efficiencies made possible by the electronic processing of purchase orders,they can not then claim ignorance of the contents of those orders once their products inevitably reach the intended market 
finally,argues that it has structured its primary conduct to avoid jurisdiction by including in the vendor agreement a condition that transfers ownership from to at the time that receives its shipments in colorado springs.jurisdiction,however,does not depend on the technicalities of when title passes rather,jurisdiction may attach both to manufacturers who supply their own delivery systems and to those that make use of the distribution systems of third parties.oswalt,at 
in the interest of promoting that degree of predictability to the legal system that allows potential defendants to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit,world wide volkswagen,at,we conclude that a term does not prevent a court from exercising personal jurisdiction over a defendant where other factors,such as the quantity and regularity of shipments,suggest that jurisdiction is proper this reasoning is supported by authority that states that the primary purpose of a term is to allocate the risk of damage to goods between buyer and seller accordingly,purposely availed itself of the benefit of the louisiana market for its bottle,thereby establishing minimum contacts with the forum state 
it is not enough to satisfy due process that has some minimum contacts with louisiana.rather,the underlying cause of action must arise out of the defendant contacts with the forum state luv n care alleges that the presence of products in louisiana infringed on luv n care copyright.
t his court has been reluctant to extend the principle outside the context of products liability cases,including cases involving contract or copyright.nuovo pignone,at.this is because contracting parties have more flexibility to tailor their relationship in view of jurisdictional considerations than do the manufacturer and consumer in a typical products liability case.id.nevertheless,we have found jurisdiction where the same public policy concerns that justify use of the principle in the products liability context are present.id.
in nuovo pignone,the defendant fagioli,an italian shipper,allegedly damaged plaintiff cargo with a defective onboard shipping crane while docking and unloading at a louisiana port.we found jurisdiction even though fagioli,like,employed intermediaries at the point of injury,the unloading dock.we further opined that fagioli should have considered the possible damage that a defective crane aboard its vessel would cause in the forum state.similarly,should have known,when it availed itself of the louisiana market for infant care products,that it could face potential liability from competitors with items 
the closest analogue to the present case is ham la cienega music,cir,in which we denied jurisdiction because there was a highly attenuated relationship between defendant contact with the forum state and plaintiff declaratory judgment action for copyright infringement.ham,at.in ham,however,the allegedly infringing song was different from the one that had been distributed through the stream of commerce to the forum state.the court suggested the result might be different if the song distributed in texas and the allegedly infringing song were one and the same.id.at.
luv n care claims infringement from the same bottle that traveled through the stream of commerce from colorado to louisiana.this connection between the allegedly infringing product and the forum state is sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction 
it remains for us to inquire whether the exercise of jurisdiction would offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.international shoe,at.when a plaintiff makes its prima facie case that the defendant has minimum contacts with the forum state,the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to show that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.nuovo pignone,at.in conducting the fairness inquiry,we examine the burden on the nonresident defendant,the forum state interests,the plaintiff interest in securing relief,the interest of the interstate judicial system in the efficient administration of justice,and the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental social policies.felch transportes sa de cv,cir.
relies primarily on the third and fourth elements,arguing that luv n care has not named,the retailer,nor royal king,the alleged manufacturer of the bottle top,as the more natural defendants.nor can the district court grant full injunctive relief where remains free to sell,and royal king remains free to produce,the infringing cap.therefore,portrays this action as an effort by luv n care,a major manufacturer,to intimidate a small competitor into exiting the market.
if luv n care suit is indeed frivolous,the district court presumably will deal with that deficiency.but,where a product allegedly causes economic injury in louisiana,it is in the interest of that state to have its courts mediate the dispute.furthermore,it is not unreasonable to ask to defend in louisiana,where the company avails itself of the benefit of that state market for thousands of iterations of its product.the forum state louisiana and the plaintiff luv n care,which is organized under louisiana law and based there obviously have some legitimate interest in litigating this matter in louisiana,where there has been regular distribution of a number of the allegedly offending products therefore,traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice do not require that this suit be dismissed for want of personal jurisdiction 
the judgment of dismissal is reversed,and this matter is remanded for further proceedings 
i concur in the majority opinion because i recognize that fifth circuit precedent binds us to follow the stream of commerce approach in personal jurisdiction cases however,i write separately for two reasons to note that if it were not for that precedent,i would certainly vote to decide this case under the approach announced by justice in asahi metal industry superior court,d,and to highlight how this case contributes to the circuit split created by asahi,a split i urge the supreme court to resolve.
in my opinion,justice theory is the more constitutionally defensible of the two theories of minimum contacts to emerge from asahi.the principle of minimum contacts is a principle that effectively limits a state exercise of jurisdiction over nonresident defendants.jurists have long recognized that the laws of one state have no operation outside of its territory,except so far as is allowed by comity and that no tribunal established by it can extend its process beyond that territory so as to subject either persons or property to its decisions.pennoyer neff,otto.thus,the minimum contacts test was developed over time to define the necessary contact a nonresident defendant must have with a state before the defendant can be subjected to suit there.asahi is the last in a long line of supreme court cases to define the contours of that test,and it left the test in a state of complete disarray.only three justices joined the portion of justice plurality opinion that embraced the approach to minimum contacts of the five remaining justices,three justices joined justice brennan in a concurrence that embraced the stream of commerce approach and justice stevens wrote his own concurrence embracing neither.it is the stream of commerce approach that the fifth circuit follows and that i criticize here although i recognize its binding effect.the stream of commerce,or mere foreseeability,approach requires only that a nonresident defendant place its product in the stream of commerce with the expectation that the product will reach the forum state.nuovo pignone,spa storman asia,cir.as judge niemeyer of the fourth circuit eloquently stated in lesnick hollingsworth vose,cir,to permit a state to assert jurisdiction over any person in the country whose product is sold in the state simply because a person must ex
