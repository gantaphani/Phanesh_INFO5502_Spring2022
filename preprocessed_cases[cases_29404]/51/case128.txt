this appeal raises numerous issues arising out of the grant of summary judgment to newport news holdings corporation nnhc on its claims against virtual city vision and its owner van james bond tran collectively,vcv under the anticybersquatting consumer protection act acpa.in addition to challenging summary judgment,vcv argues that the magistrate judge erred in refusing to recuse himself and in improperly finding personal jurisdiction over tran vcv further contends that the district court abused its discretion in precluding vcv from filing a counterclaim,and in its various rulings on damages,fees and costs,and sanctions.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
the number of issues raised on appeal necessitates a lengthy recitation of the facts and procedural history.we begin with the factual background.
nnhc is a women clothing and accessories company that has been in existence for over twenty years.it owns five federally registered trademarks for the mark newport news.these trademarks cover the sale of women clothing and accessories and the offering of these items for sale through catalogs and the internet.the trademarks also cover the domain name.com,which nnhc purchased in november.nnhc attempted to acquire the domain name as well,but vcv had already purchased that domain name in october.nnhc began offering its goods for sale over the internet in using the.com domain name.
vcv,an alabama corporation,owns at least domain names that incorporate the names of geographic locations,which initially focused on newport news,virginia,is one such example.vcv original intent was to create websites where residents of,and visitors to,these cities could find information and advertising related to th e cities.j.internal quotations omitted.
vcv organization is skeletal.tran is its president,sole employee,and the only participating member of its board of directors.he operates the business from his home.
nnhc and vcv first clashed in a private dispute resolution forum.in,nnhc brought a complaint against vcv under the uniform domain name dispute resolution policy of the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann nnhc alleged that vcv website was confusingly similar to nnhc family of registered trademarks for the mark newport news that any rights vcv has in the domain name in contention are illegitimate and that vcv registered this domain name in bad faith.
the icann panel rejected nnhc arguments and dismissed its complaint.in doing so,it found that,although the mark and the domain name are identical,visitors to nnhc branded web site,who seek out the latest women clothing and home fashions would clearly not be confused when seeing a home page of another web site,bearing an identical mark,that explicitly provides city information with no connection whatsoever to women and home fashions.the panel further held that vcv website provided bona fide service offerings,which included disseminat ing city information in an effort to increase tourism and other visitor traffic to the city.significantly,with respect to nnhc claim of bad faith,the panel noted that given the total absence of competition between the businesses of nnhc and vcv vcv did not register the contested domain name in an effort to cause any likelihood of confusion.
between and,remained relatively unchanged.it continued to provide information about the city of newport news and link visitors to local businesses,such as hotels,movie theaters,real estate companies,and entertainment venues.in,the website began running occasional advertisements for women clothing 
in the summer of,nnhc made an offer to purchase the domain name,which vcv rejected.vcv responded that it would sell the domain name for a amount,or,in the alternative,sell nnhc goods on its website for a commission.j.
a substantive evolution in the vcv website began in the fall of.the site shifted from a city focus,similar to that of vcv other locality sites,to one emphasizing women fashions.by february of,the homepage was dominated by advertisements for women apparel 
at about the same time,the management of the site changed as well.tran began managing the website personally,taking control away from local matters,the company that ran vcv locality sites.the changes to the website were lucrative.tran would later testify that most of vcv revenue during that time came from the website instead of the locality sites,either individually or in total.
on february,nnhc filed its complaint with the district court,alleging trademark infringement under,federal false advertising and unfair competition under a,copyright infringement under,and state law claims of common law trademark infringement,unfair competition,and unjust enrichment.the parties agreed to have the matter handled by a federal magistrate judge.
while discovery was underway in september,the magistrate judge informed the parties that counsel for nnhc had served on the advisory panel that voted to reappoint him.both because his only action in the case to that point had been to issue a scheduling order,and because the reappointment committee had concluded its work,he opined that he was not obligated to recuse himself under the code of conduct for united states judges.he nevertheless asked the parties whether they wanted to seek his recusal and promised to give full consideration to any such request.on september,both parties indicated that they would not seek recusal.vcv counsel specifically stated that he was satisfied that the magistrate judge could preside.
shortly thereafter,counsel for nnhc mentioned that he and the magistrate judge had previously practiced at the same law firm and had worked on cases together.vcv counsel did not raise the issue of recusal during that discussion or the subsequent pretrial conference.
in october,nnhc informed vcv that it intended to file an amended complaint.vcv responded that it would file a counterclaim based on evidence obtained through discovery.on november,after obtaining leave from the court,nnhc filed its amended complaint adding a claim for violation of the acpa and removing its copyright infringement claim.on november,vcv answered the amended complaint but did not raise any counterclaims.on november,the parties filed for summary judgment,with vcv moving for summary judgment on all of nnhc claims and nnhc moving for partial summary judgment as to the acpa claim.on january,vcv filed its counterclaim.the court informed vcv that,under the federal rules of civil procedure,vcv was required to request leave from the court to amend its answer to include a counterclaim.vcv sought leave to file its counterclaim on january.
on february,the magistrate judge issued an order granting summary judgment to nnhc on its acpa claim pertaining to the domain name.because nnhc had not moved for summary judgment on its other claims,those claims remained set for trial scheduled to begin on february.during a telephone conference that same day,vcv moved for the magistrate judge recusal for the first time.
the magistrate judge vacated the february trial date and established a briefing schedule to consider the recusal motion.on march,the magistrate judge held a hearing both on vcv motion for recusal and its motion for leave to file a counterclaim he denied both.
on june,vcv sought reconsideration of its recusal motion,which the magistrate judge denied on july.the following day,the court issued a final order awarding vcv costs on nnhc abandoned copyright infringement claim but denying its motion for attorney fees on that claim.the final order also awarded nnhc statutory damages and attorney fees on its acpa claim and imposed sanctions on vcv counsel vcv timely appealed.
vcv asserts numerous issues on appeal the magistrate judge failure to recuse the court assertion of personal jurisdiction over tran its grant of summary judgment to nnhc on the acpa claim its denial of vcv request to file a counterclaim its award of statutory damages and attorney fees to nnhc and sanctions against vcv counsel and its finding that vcv was not the prevailing party for purposes of an award of attorney fees on nnhc abandoned copyright infringement claim.we address each argument in turn.
vcv challenges the denial of its motion for recusal under and the denial of its motion for reconsideration seeking recusal.we review for abuse of discretion.united states mitchell,cir.
section a states any justice,judge,or magistrate judge of the united states shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.as we have noted,t imeliness is an essential element of a recusal motion to prevent inefficiency and delay,motions to recuse must be filed at the first opportunity after discovery of the facts tending to prove disqualification.united states whorley,cir first alteration in original internal quotations omitted see also united states owens,cir noting that timeliness is a judicially implied element of.vcv recusal argument is predicated on two facts that the magistrate judge and nnhc counsel once worked at the same law firm and collaborated on cases and that nnhc counsel participated in the committee that reappointed the magistrate judge.
vcv learned of opposing counsel participation on the reappointment committee no later than september,and expressly declined to move for recusal when the court held a phone conference on the issue the next day.in fact,vcv affirmatively communicated its satisfaction with the magistrate judge continuing to preside.vcv learned of the law firm relationship on november,but did not raise the issue during the scheduling conference that took place that same day.in fact,it did not move for recusal until february,the day the court issued a partial summary judgment ruling in favor of nnhc.by way of explanation,vcv asserts only that e lucidation of the relevant facts took time.appellants br.at.we are not persuaded.
vcv had an opportunity to raise the issue almost immediately after becoming aware of the facts of which it now complains,and it chose not to do so.instead,it waited several months,until the very day the magistrate judge granted summary judgment to nnhc on its acpa claims.the timing of vcv motion smacks of gamesmanship.allowing such belated and seemingly tactical recusal motions would permit a party to gather evidence of a judge possible bias and then wait and see if the proceedings went his way before using the information to seek recusal.sine local int l of teamsters,cir.the magistrate judge denial of the motion for recusal is therefore justified on timeliness grounds alone.id.at finding lack of timeliness to be an alternative ground for affirming the denial of a motion to recuse.
furthermore,vcv allegations regarding recusal lack merit.the issue of nnhc counsel involvement on the reappointment committee is addressed in an advisory opinion on the code of conduct for united states judges,which provides that after reappointment the magistrate judge is not required to recuse or to notify the parties and attorneys in the proceeding that a member of the panel is appearing as counsel.citing committee on codes of conduct,advisory opinion recusal due to appointment or reappointment of a magistrate judge.
as to the law firm relationship between counsel and the magistrate judge,the objective standard asks whether the judge impartiality might be questioned by a reasonable,observer who assesses all the facts and circumstances.united states detemple,cir internal quotations omitted.the law firm relationship in question ended more than ten years before the instant action began,and vcv does not seem to dispute the fact that the magistrate judge had little personal contact with counsel in the intervening years.under these circumstances,the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that the circumstances would not cause a reasonable observer to question his impartiality 
vcv also claims that the district court failed to make findings that would justify exercising personal jurisdiction over tran and holding him personally liable for vcv actions.we review the district court legal findings de novo and the facts underlying its determination for clear error.mylan,akzo,cir.
contrary to vcv contention,the district court made sufficient findings to establish personal jurisdiction as part of its analysis regarding piercing of the corporate veil between tran and vcv.as the fifth circuit has noted 
f ederal courts have consistently acknowledged that it is compatible with due process for a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over an individual that would not ordinarily be subject to personal jurisdiction in that court when the individual is an alter ego of a corporation that would be subject to personal jurisdiction in that court.

under virginia law,a court may pierce the corporate veil to find that an individual is the alter ego of a corporation where it finds i a unity of interest and ownership between the individual and the corporation,and ii that the individual used the corporation to evade a personal obligation,to perpetrate fraud or a crime,to commit an injustice,or to gain an unfair advantage.trust,first flight,cir internal quotations omitted.here the district court found that such veil piercing was appropriate because 
vcv had no separate identity from tran tran is the president of vcv,tran is the sole employee of vcv,and tran is the only participating member of vcv board of directors additionally,tran admits that vcv business is conducted out of his home and tran is the only board member invited to,and present at,meetings of the vcv board of directors it is tran,and tran alone,who is responsible for the decisions and actions of vcv and it would present a manifest injustice if tran were now allowed to hide behind a corporate veil to avoid personal liability for his actions.there is a unity of interest and ownership between tran and vcv,and tran controlled and used vcv to commit an injustice.
the court clearly found both a unity of interest and an intent by tran to commit an injustice using vcv.trust,at.accordingly,the district court found sufficient facts to pierce the corporate veil and,consequently,to exercise its jurisdiction over tran.

to establish an acpa violation,nnhc was required to prove that vcv had a bad faith intent to profit from using the domain name,and that the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to,or dilutive of,the distinctive and famous newport news mark.people for the ethical treatment of animals peta doughney,cir citing d a.
vcv argues in particular that the district court erred in finding that vcv acted in bad faith,and that it mistakenly rejected vcv defenses of laches and acquiescence we address each contention in turn.
we first consider the issue of bad faith.the acpa directs courts to consider several factors in making a determination of bad faith.these include whether the defendant has a bona fide noncommercial or fair use of the mark in a site accessible under the domain name and whether the defendant intended to divert customers away from the trademark holder by creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source,sponsorship,affiliation,or endorsement of the site.d b i.courts are not limited to consideration of these factors.instead,t he acpa allows a court to view the totality of the circumstances in making the bad faith determination.virtual works,volkswagen of,cir.
vcv challenges the district court finding of bad faith in several respects.it attacks the court determination that vcv did not provide legitimate services that would constitute a fair use of the domain name.vcv also asserts that the evidence does not support a finding that it intended to create a likelihood of confusion.finally,it challenges the court reliance on the icann ruling as evidence that vcv knew it was acting unlawfully when it changed its website.
vcv claims that,contrary to the district court conclusion,its website offered a legitimate service by providing information about the city of newport news.
the acpa permits a registered trademark to be used by someone other than the mark owner if it is a use,otherwise than as a mark,of a term or device which is descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe the goods or services of such party,or their geographic origin.b.the district court found that this provision did not apply here because o n vcv website,newport news is no longer used to describe vcv goods or services,or their geographic origin,because the site is dedicated primarily to women fashion.vcv disputes this characterization,contending to the contrary that its website offered the legitimate service of providing information about the city of newport news.we disagree.
the record conclusively shows that in making changes to its website in,vcv shifted its focus away from the legitimate service of providing information related to the city of newport news and became instead a website devoted primarily to women fashion.most of the items on its homepage,as well as those most prominently placed,related to women attire.not only was the site dominated by advertisements for apparel,it also contained dozens of links to shopping websites.the website references to the city of newport news became minor in comparison to the content.vcv can not escape the consequences of its deliberate metamorphosis.vcv would apparently have us hold that as long as it provided any information about the city of newport news,it continued to provide a bona fide service.such a formalistic approach would allow a cybersquatter seeking to profit from another company trademark to avoid liability by ensuring that it provides some minimal amount of information about a legitimate subject.it would also undermine the purpose of the acpa,which seeks to prevent the and abusive registration of distinctive marks as internet domain names with the intent to profit from the goodwill associated with such marks,excelentisimo ayuntamiento de barcelona,cir quoting,at.
as we have noted,in analyzing bad faith,we view the totality of the circumstances.virtual works,at.here,even drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of vcv,the record is clear that after november,vcv was no longer in the business of providing information about the city of newport news.the contrast between the website and vcv other locality websites,which were dominated by links and advertisements for businesses and activities in those cities,is stark.unlike those websites,went from being a website about a city that happened to have some apparel advertisements to a website about women apparel that happened to include minimal references to the city of newport news.the district court correctly held that,once vcv largely abandoned its city information service,it ceased to have a right to use the name of newport news to describe such service 
vcv argues that the district court failed to properly analyze whether there was a likelihood of confusion between nnhc website and vcv website.its argument,however,mischaracterizes the nature of an acpa claim.the standard under the acpa is not whether there is a likelihood of confusion between the two websites but rather whether the allegedly offending website creat es a likelihood of confusion as to the source,sponsorship,affiliation,or endorsement of the site.d b v.the acpa provides for liability without regard to the goods or services of the parties.id.d a.
vcv argues that,under our precedent in lamparello falwell,cir,we must determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists by examin ing the allegedly infringing use in the context in which it is seen by the ordinary consumer.id.at alteration in original.however,the court in lamparello made that statement in the context of trademark infringement,not the acpa.see id.as the eighth circuit court has noted,t he inquiry under the acpa is narrower than the traditional multifactor likelihood of confusion test for trademark infringement.coca cola purdy,cir see also light,lights club,cir t he likelihood of confusion test of trademark infringement is more comprehensive than the identical or confusingly similar requirement of acpa,as it requires considering factors beyond the facial similarity of the two marks.internal quotations omitted.the question under the acpa is whether the domain names which the defendant registered are identical or confusingly similar to a plaintiff mark.coca cola,at.here vcv domain name was identical to nnhc mark.
vcv further alleges that its disclaimer,we are newport news,virginia,which appeared near the top of the new version of the website,eliminated any likelihood of confusion.again,vcv misinterprets the applicable law.for acpa purposes,t he fact that confusion about a website source or sponsorship could be resolved by visiting the website is not relevant to whether the domain name itself is identical or confusingly similar to a plaintiff mark.see also virtual works,at finding that the domain name was confusingly similar to the volkswagen vw mark for purposes of the acpa,even though the domain name was being used as an internet service provider website peta,at finding likelihood of confusion under the acpa where the domain name was identical to the trademark at issue,even though the website content ma de it clear that it was not related to the mark holder.given that vcv domain name was identical to nnhc mark,we find that the district court correctly held that vcv created a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the site.
vcv argues that the district court erred in finding that the icann decision was further proof of vcv bad faith in making the november changes to its website.it asserts that,because the icann decision did not prohibit any of the changes made by vcv,vcv awareness of the decision does not support a finding that it made the changes in bad faith.
vcv argument misses the mark here as well.what the court deemed most significant was that the icann decision found vcv use proper precisely because its business of providing city information was unrelated to nnhc clothing business.the icann decision found that vcv was not in competition with nnhc precisely because of their disparate business models.indeed,in holding that there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of vcv,the icann relied on the total absence of competition between the businesses of nnhc and vcv.emphasis added.the fact that,in the face of this cautionary language,vcv later purposefully transformed its website into one that competed with nnhc by advertising women apparel is a legitimate factor within the totality of the circumstances supporting the district court finding of bad faith 
vcv next asserts that the district court mistakenly rejected its defense of laches.vcv argues that laches applied because nnhc did not bring a claim in,when,under vcv view,the allegedly infirming use the ads for women clothing actually commenced.appellants br.at.
preliminarily,we note that vcv points to no case in this or other circuits that has ever applied the laches defense in the acpa context.nor are we aware of any.however,even assuming,without deciding,that the doctrine of laches is applicable to acpa claims,it would not bar relief here.in the trademark context,courts may apply the doctrine of estoppel by laches to deny relief to a plaintiff who,though having knowledge of an infringement,has,to the detriment of the defendant,unreasonably delayed in seeking redress.sara lee kayser roth,cir.we have explained that regardless of when the trademark owner initially discovers the use of a similar mark,action against the infringing user is not necessary until,in light of the circumstances,the right to protection has clearly ripened.what a burger of,whataburger,of corpus christi,cir.in other words,the plaintiff must be aware of the facts giving rise to infringement.
an acpa claim,as we have noted,requires a bad faith intent to profit from using the domain name.peta,at.here,as the icann panel decision found,before the changes in the website nnhc had no reason to believe that vcv use of the domain name would support a finding of bad faith.even when vcv started to place a few apparel ads on its otherwise website in,vcv bad faith was not obvious,as vcv was still providing a legitimate service and not competing with nnhc.it was not until november,when vcv essentially abandoned its legitimate purpose of providing information in favor of a website focused on women fashions,that it became clear that nnhc had a viable acpa claim.accordingly,nnhc decision to bring its acpa claim in november,a year after the relevant changes in vcv website occurred,did not constitute an unreasonable delay that would support a finding of laches.
vcv also asserts that nnhc acpa claim should have been completely barred by nnhc acquiescence.appellants br.at.again,vcv cites no support for the proposition that this defense applies in the acpa context.however,once again assuming,without deciding,that it does,it is nevertheless inapplicable to the facts here.
in the trademark infringement context we have stated that a n infringement action may be barred by the doctrine of estoppel by acquiescence where the owner of the trademark,by conveying to the defendant through affirmative word or deed,expressly or impliedly consents to the infringement.sara lee,at.vcv argues that nnhc impliedly consented to the infringement by knowingly and deliberately plac ing paid ads on the vcv website in february.appellants br.at.however,as discussed above,vcv use of the domain name did not become a clear infringement until november,when vcv transformed its website into one focused on women fashion.therefore nnhc advertisements in february can not establish its acquiescence to vcv later infringing conduct,and we agree with the district court that nnhc acpa claim was not barred on that ground.
vcv next argues that the court erred in denying it permission to file counterclaims.in determining whether a defendant should be permitted to file a new counterclaim after it has filed its responsive pleading,rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure,which permits amendment of the pleadings to add an omitted counterclaim,is interpreted together with rule a on amendment of pleadings,which provides that leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires.lone star steakhouse saloon alpha of,cir alteration in original.we have further pointed out that a motion to amend may be denied when it has been unduly delayed and when allowing the motion would prejudice the nonmovant.id.at.leave to amend by filing a counterclaim may also be denied based on bad faith or futility of the amendment.foman davis.we review a district court ruling in this regard for abuse of discretion.lone star,at.
in october,vcv informed nnhc that vcv would seek leave to file a counterclaim based upon evidence obtained through discovery.on november,after obtaining leave from the court,nnhc filed an amended complaint adding a new claim for violation of the acpa.on november,vcv filed an answer to the amended complaint,but that answer did not raise any counterclaims.
vcv filed its counterclaim,without leave from the court,on january,one month before the trial date of february.the counterclaim included allegations of conspiracy and fraud by nnhc.the court informed vcv that leave from the court was required to file a counterclaim.vcv sought leave on january.the motion was not fully briefed until january,two weeks before the scheduled trial date.on february,the district court issued an opinion granting in part nnhc motion for summary judgment on its cybersquatting claim.the court ultimately denied vcv motion for leave to file its counterclaim on march,finding that it was prejudicial and unduly delayed in bad faith 
whether an amendment is prejudicial will often be determined by the nature of the amendment and its timing t he further the case progressed before judgment was entered,the more likely it is that the amendment will prejudice the defendant or that a court will find bad faith on the plaintiff part.laber harvey,cir.here,the court finding of prejudice was based on the fact that the counterclaim was filed at the eleventh hour before the trial date and contained six claims that had never before been raised and if allowed,would substantially change the nature and scope of the trial.the counterclaim included counts for intentional interference with contract,tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,fraud,constructive fraud,civil conspiracy between nnhc and spiegel,and intentional infliction of emotional harm.the district court found that discovery in the case had closed and the introduction of six new claims,particularly a claim of fraud,may introduce new factual issues that were not heretofore addressed by counsel.indeed,several of vcv assertions,such as its claim that nnhc and spiegel entered into an unlawful agreement and conspiracy with each other to wrongfully take,would likely have required further discovery.
a district court has the discretion to deny leave to amend to add a counterclaim based upon a balancing of the equities,including whether additional discovery would be required.barnes group,c c products,cir.the fact that allowing the counterclaim would probably have necessitated additional discovery supports our conclusion that the district court finding of prejudice was not an abuse of discretion.
we note as well that vcv appeared to have no valid reason for its belated request.vcv first informed nnhc of the possibility of the counterclaim in october.indeed,vcv now concedes that,by october,it suspected the grounds for the claim.however,vcv argues that it did not seek to file the counterclaim at that point because until vcv actually received nnhc financial records in late december,and had them interpreted by an expert,vcv lacked sufficient legal foundation to file the counterclaim.appellants br.at.
this explanation rings hollow because none of the counts in the counterclaim relied primarily on allegations regarding nnhc financial records.each of the claims was based on the theory that vcv was fairly and lawfully using the domain name and nnhc was unlawfully interfering with its right to do so in an attempt to obtain the domain name free of charge.none of the counts directly mention any wrongdoing related to nnhc financial documents.in fact,the financial data that nnhc disclosed to vcv in december,which allegedly triggered the counterclaim,is only mentioned in the background facts.thus,vcv assertion that it was justified in waiting until december to file the claim is unsupported by the record.
we have upheld a district court denial of leave to file a counterclaim in substantially similar circumstances.in lone star steakhouse,the defendant in a trademark infringement suit sought leave,in the last days of discovery,to add a counterclaim alleging that the plaintiff had committed fraud.see at.the defendant based its claim on information that,according to the district court,it possessed approximately three months before requesting leave to file the counterclaim.the district court refused to inject the defense of fraud,because it considered the motion unduly delayed and reasoned that the amendment would have seriously prejudiced plaintiffs and placed them at risk of further infringement because the amendment would have delayed the resolution of the case.id.at.in affirming the decision of the district court,we found that the record did not support the defendant contention that it delayed its counterclaim because it needed to conduct further investigation.id.
we also held that the amendment would have substantially prejudiced plaintiffs and would have significantly changed the nature of the litigation because i nserting the defense of fraud in the case on the last day of discovery would have raised new issues,which were not involved in the case during the discovery and were not the subject of plaintiff discovery and trial preparation.id.under the similar circumstances presented here,we hold that,given vcv undue delay and the prejudice to nnhc,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying vcv motion for leave to file a counterclaim.
vcv argues that its conduct did not merit an award of attorney fees under the lanham act.the act states that t he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.a.we review a decision to award attorneys fees under for abuse of discretion and the district court underlying finding as to whether the case is exceptional for clear error.scott fetzer house of vacuums,cir see also williams metro.life ins,cir.
we have noted that the legislative history of the lanham act shows that fees were intended to be provided in cases involving d eliberate and flagrant infringement.scotch whisky ass.majestic distilling,cir quoting legislative history.here,the district court found that vcv conduct was exceptional precisely because its actions in transforming the virtual city website into a women fashion website after being made aware by the icann decision of the rights that nnhc had in the newport news mark were clearly willful and deliberate.significantly,vcv advances no factual basis for finding to the contrary.neither during the proceedings below nor in response to repeated questioning at oral argument on appeal was vcv able to provide a legitimate justification for its decision to shift its website focus to women clothing,particularly in the face of the icann panel implicit suggestion that to do so courted the risk of a finding of bad faith.on these facts,we can not say that the court clearly erred in finding that vcv infringement was exceptional or abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees.
vcv also challenges the district court grant of statutory damages of under d,which provides that the plaintiff may elect,at any time before final judgment is rendered by the trial court,to recover,instead of actual damages and profits,an award of statutory damages in the amount of not less than and not more than per domain name,as the court considers just.vcv claims the damages awarded here were excessive.while we review for clear error any factual finding that would determine the appropriate level of statutory damages,we would review an award of those damages within the statutory range for abuse of discretion.lyons,morris costumes,inc,cir.
in deciding whether the court damages were excessive,we must first determine the nature and purpose of such damages.our analysis of acpa statutory damages is guided,in part,by their similarity to statutory damages under the federal copyright act,a a similarity noted by other circuit courts.see,luke cataract laser,sanderson,cir t he statutory damages provision in the acpa,d,is similar to the statutory damages provision in copyright law.gallo winery spider webs,cir.both statutory damages provisions have similar structures and language.see c t he copyright owner may elect,at any time before final judgment is rendered,to recover,instead of actual damages and profits,an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action in a sum of not less than or more than as the court considers just.also,like the copyright act,the acpa reflects a congressional intent to deter offenders.see luke,at.based on this goal of deterrence,the supreme court has found that the statutory damages provision of the copyright act does not merely compel restitution of profit and reparation for injury but also is designed to discourage wrongful conduct.gallo winery,at quoting woolworth contemporary arts.in light of the similarities in the language of these two statutory provisions and congress intent to deter cyberpiracy,other circuits have interpreted the acpa statutory damages provision to contain a similar deterrence element.luke,at citing gallo winery,at footnote omitted.we find such interpretations persuasive.because these damages serve as a sanction to deter wrongful conduct,a district court may properly weigh the seriousness of the conduct in determining the amount of the award.
here the district court found that damages at the high end of the statutory range were proper because vcv conduct was exceptional and egregious.ja.vcv asserts that the damages award was unjust for reasons that both mirror its laches and acquiescence arguments and fail for reasons similar to those already set forth.vcv claims that it advertised women clothes for over two years before nnhc brought its claim,and that during that time,nnhc profited from advertising with vcv and had discussions with vcv about its website in which no infringement was mentioned.however,as noted above,the district court made clear throughout its opinion that vcv wrongdoing did not crystallize until its transformation of the website into a women fashion website in november in direct contradiction to a written icann arbitration opinion.it is this conduct that the court found exceptional and egregious for purposes of statutory sanctions.vcv arguments about why its conduct may not have been egregious prior to november are irrelevant.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that vcv attempt to profit from nnhc mark by creating a website focused on women fashion was sufficiently egregious to merit the statutory damages award.
vcv challenges the district court entry of in sanctions against vcv attorneys under.we review the decision to award sanctions for abuse of discretion,chaudhry gallerizzo,cir,and the factual findings underpinning that decision for clear error,see ohio river valley envtl,green valley coal,cir see also tenkku normandy bank,cir reviewing for abuse of discretion an award of sanctions and for clear error the related factual findings.however,before reviewing the court decision,we must first decide whether the issue is properly before us.
nnhc argues that vcv waived the issue because its attorneys are not listed as appellants in the notice of appeal.indeed,federal rule of appellate procedure c a requires that the notice of appeal specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice.rule c makes clear,however,that a n appeal must not be dismissed for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.under rule c,we have held that a notice of appeal that covers only an order for sanctions against an attorney is not rendered invalid for failure to name the attorney as an appellant.miltier downes,cir.we noted that where the only appealable judgment from the district court is the order imposing sanctions against counsel and only one party,plaintiff counsel,is entitled to bring the appeal t he circumstances present no risk of ambiguity or confusion.id.
applying rule c to the facts before us,we find that vcv notice of appeal is far from a model of clarity.although the notice lists the final order as one of the orders appealed,the final order contains a number of rulings,several of which were not appealed.vcv has thereby created the risk of ambiguity or confusion against which we have cautioned.id.tellingly,vcv does not address the issue of sanctions in its reply brief,or argue that the deficient notice of appeal is saved by its clear intent under rule c.
