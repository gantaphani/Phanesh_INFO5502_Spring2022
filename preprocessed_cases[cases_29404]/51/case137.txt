we are asked in this case to decide the relationship between the lanham act,et,and section of the subsequently enacted science,state,justice,commerce,and related agencies appropriations act of,which prohibits the use of federal funds to register,issue,transfer,or enforce any trademark of the phrase the last best place.the district court deemed invalid,and thus a legal nullity,on the grounds that it contradicted but did not constitute an implied repeal or suspension of the lanham act.in essence,the district court held that implied repeals through appropriations riders,though constitutional,are so disfavored as to be disallowed.as a result,the district court further declared that the united states patent and trademark office uspto had committed clear error by complying with.
however,in this case,it is the district court that erred.congress has the power to amend substantive legislation through appropriations riders if it does so very clearly.it did so here in a duly enacted appropriations act with clarity and specificity.we can not strike down such an act unless unconstitutional.we certainly can not declare invalid for contravening a previously enacted piece of legislation.
a montana writer,william kittredge,coined the phrase the last best place in as a title to his anthology of montana poetry and prose.like a fishing line cast a thousand miles out,the phrase became part of the montana culture.local businesses and the montana state government used it.but at first,no one trademarked it.
between and,last best beef,a nevada business,filed eight applications with the uspto for federal trademark registration of the phrase the last best place in connection with a variety of different products and services.these included cookware,clothing,food products,jewelry,home items,and travel,hotel,and restaurant services all this activity generated considerable opposition within montana.
on november,the president signed into law the science,state,justice,commerce,and related agencies appropriations act of.see,stat.appropriations act.section of the appropriations act,which applies to the uspto,provides notwithstanding any other provision of this act,no funds appropriated under this act shall be used to register,issue,transfer,or enforce any trademark of the phrase the last best place.section has been extended through a series of continuing resolutions,the most recent of which extends the restriction through november.see res,cong.
when the president signed the appropriations act into law,last best beef eight trademark applications were in various stages of consideration with the uspto.first,the uspto had issued notices of approvals of trademark registration,pending proof of use of the trademark in four of the trademark applications,but it had not yet registered those trademarks.see d.second,oppositions by the state of montana to two of the the grounds that the phrase the last best place is primarily a geographically descriptive term that identifies the state of montana and is thus not entitled to registration under the lanham act,see e were pending before the trademark trial and applications board ttab.finally,on the same day the president signed into law,but before the uspto became aware of the legislation,the uspto had issued certificates of registration for the two remaining trademarks.
upon learning about,the uspto in january cancelled the four notices of allowance,suspended all action pertaining to the applications covered by the notices of allowance,suspended proceedings regarding the two applications being opposed by the state of montana before the ttab,and cancelled the two registrations it had issued and returned those applications to pending status.
in february,last best beef filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of columbia,which later transferred the case to the eastern district of virginia.in addition to several constitutional claims last best beef contended that improperly circumvented the lanham act,and,therefore,the actions the uspto took under in january of were unlawful.as such,last best beef requested an injunction requiring the uspto to reinstate the cancelled registrations and notices of allowance.
the district court granted summary judgment for last best beef,declaring that was invalid legislation insofar as it improperly circumvent ed the lanham act.specifically,of the lanham act states that n o trademark shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature although sets forth a number of exceptions to this rule the district court found that none applied to the phrase the last best place.thus,according to the district court,circumvented the lanham act by insisting that any trademark for the phrase last best place be refused registration.
specifically,the district court concluded that did not explicitly or implicitly suspend provisions of the lanham act with respect to the phrase last best place.while the district court recognized that an irreconcilable conflict between two statutes is sufficient to express congressional intent to impliedly repeal an earlier statute,the district court deemed the conflict between and insufficient to demonstrate manifest congressional intent to suspend numerous,interdependent provisions of the lanham act with respect to one phrase the district court found particularly troublesome because appropriations measures are not the appropriate vehicles for the amendment of general laws.in so concluding,the district court emphasized that it was not inclined to open the door to a litany of whimsical exceptions to the lanham act like those that riddle the tax code,as doing so would destabilize businesses and turn the trademark procedures into a statute full of holes and exceptions.according to the district court,since did not conflict with enough to repeal it,but conflicted with it too much to be enforced,must be invalid.
finally,the district court stated that nothing in authorized the uspto to cancel pending trademark applications or to suspend either the notices of allowance or the ttab proceedings,and thus ordered the uspto to reinstate the previously issued trademarks,the suspended notices of allowance,and the suspended ttab proceedings.having resolved the case on statutory grounds,the district court found it unnecessary to reach last best beef constitutional arguments.
the uspto now appeals.
last best beef contends,in agreement with the district court,that can not constitute an implied repeal or suspension of because fails to state that it is amending either the lanham act or trademark law,and indeed makes no mention of the lanham act at all.thus,last best beef contends,fails the requirement set forth in tennessee valley authority hill,d tva,namely that congressional intent to effectuate an implied repeal must be unambiguous.last best beef further argues that appropriations bills are not appropriate vehicles for the passage or amendment of substantive law.see andrus sierra club,d the distinction between appropriations and substantive legislation is maintained to enable the appropriations committees to concentrate on financial issues and to prevent them from trespassing on substantive legislation.internal quotations omitted.
in support of these arguments,last best beef relies heavily upon the supreme court decision in tva,in which the court held that the endangered species act esa prohibited the tennessee valley authority tva from putting into operation the tellico dam,despite the fact that congress had,after the enactment of the esa,continued to make appropriations to the tva,some of which were earmarked for the tellico dam project.at.in so holding,the court made clear that repeals by implication are not favored,and therefore,the intention of the legislature to repeal must be clear and manifest.id.at.quoting posadas city bank.moreover,the doctrine disfavoring repeals by implication applies with full vigor when the subsequent legislation is an appropriations measure.tva,at.emphasis in original quoting committee for nuclear responsibility seaborg.
