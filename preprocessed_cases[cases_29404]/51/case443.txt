welding services,appeals from the district court entry of summary judgment against it on its claim that welding technologies,its general manager,terry forman,and its vice president,robert henson,infringed welding services service marks in violation of the lanham act,a.welding services contends that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the companies service marks are confusingly similar,whether there has been actual confusion about which company was designated by welding technologies marks,and whether welding technologies intended to infringe on welding services marks.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
welding services and welding technologies are rival companies providing services for maintaining equipment used in heavy industry.since welding services has been using the wsi,and since february,it has been using a stylized logo consisting of the initials wsi,surrounded by a circle,as shown in the margin.
welding technologies was founded in.in may,a group of former welding services employees bought welding technologies from the original owners.the individual defendants terry forman and robert henson are former employees of welding services who moved to welding technologies when welding technologies was created in,the original owners had a sister company,orbital tool technologies,a machining business.the owners hired an advertising company,fetelli,to design twin logos for the two companies.the logos for both companies showed the company initials with an orange rotational symbol intended to convey the rotational movement of orbital tool machining equipment.the welding technologies logo is shown in the margin.
welding services brought this suit alleging federal trademark infringement on its abbreviation and stylized logo under section of the lanham act,a a,as well as state law causes of action for unfair competition,false and deceptive trade practices,misappropriation of trade secrets,tortious interference with business relations,and other related theories.welding services and welding technologies made for summary judgment on the lanham act claim,and welding technologies also moved for summary judgment on the state deceptive trade practices and unfair competition claims.the district court granted summary judgment to welding technologies on the only federal claim and on the state law claims for unfair competition and deceptive trade practices.the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims and so dismissed those claims.
on appeal,welding services argument focuses on its federal lanham act claim.it argues that the district court erred in holding that welding services had not adduced a genuine question of material fact as to whether welding technologies use of wti and the logo above created a likelihood of confusion.welding technologies,on the other hand,argues that the district court should have held that welding services has not shown that the abbreviation wsi was entitled to trademark protection.

to make a claim for infringement of its service marks,welding services must show that its service marks were entitled to protection and that welding technologies abbreviated name and logo were identical to those marks or so similar that they were likely to confuse consumers.a int l stamp art,postal,cir per curiam.
the district court considered the issue of whether welding services marks were protected,but declined to enter summary judgment against welding services on that ground because the court was concerned that there was some evidence that the marks had acquired secondary meaning although as to the abbreviation mark,the court holding is ambiguous and may be read to mean that the abbreviation was not protected.on appeal,welding technologies argues that the abbreviation wsi is not protectable because it is generic.
at the outset,we observe that at the time of the district court decision,welding services had not successfully registered either the abbreviation wsi or the stylized logo.its application to register welding services had been refused by the patent and trademark office examining attorney on the ground that the proposed mark was merely descriptive or generic as applied to the welding services identified.its application to register wsi was refused on the ground that the mark was confusingly similar to a prior registered wsi mark used to sell highly related services.in its reply brief before this court,welding services first advised us that after the date of the district court decision,the abbreviation and logo had been accepted by the patent and trademark office for registration.further,at oral argument,welding services counsel advised us that it had successfully registered the abbreviation wsi and the stylized logo.we ordinarily do not review materials outside the record on appeal as designated by fed.a,although we have the equitable power to do so if it is in the interest of justice.see schwartz millon air,cir.however,welding services has neglected to address before this court the ramifications that registration would have on allocation of the burden of proof on the issues of protectability and strength of the marks nor has welding services moved to reopen the district court proceedings to enlarge the record.in light of these omissions and of the fact that welding services as plaintiff filed this case and also filed a summary judgment motion before the registration was complete,we conclude that justice does not require us to deviate from the ordinary rule that the appeal is decided on the record before us.see star,bacardi,cir where mark not registered until after district court entered judgment and district court declined to reopen the trial record to include new evidence of registration,court considered protectability without reference to registration,cert.denied,d.
