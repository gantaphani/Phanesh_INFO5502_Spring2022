the owner of barney,the famous purple dinosaur who speaks in a distinctive baritone,seeks,through this action for injunctive relief and damages,to end the marketing of three costumes that children allegedly believe are in fact barney.the district court recognized the plaintiff intellectual property rights in the barney character but denied their enforcement against a costume rental company because the first act of infringement occurred outside of the statute of limitations period the claims were in any event barred by laches and confusion as to one of the costumes existed only among young children and not among the adults who rented the costume.after considering the district court comprehensive rulings,we affirm in part,reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand.our reasons follow.
background 
lyons partnership,lyons,a texas limited partnership,owns all of the intellectual property rights to the character barney,the tyrannosaurus rex with a green chest and stomach,friendly mien,green spots on its back,and yellow toeballs.barney is readily recognizable to young children,who repeatedly parrot his song,i love you,often testing the patience of nearby adults.lyons predecessor developed barney as a plush stuffed animal in,and in connection with that process,it prepared three featuring the character.
on april,barney made his debut on the public broadcasting system,and,lyons claims,the result was absolutely unprecedented.barney became hugely popular with children almost instantly.at an early appearance of barney at a mall in dallas,texas,promoters expected a few hundred people to appear to see him.instead,people started lining up before the mall opened,and by the time barney arrived,had formed a line that extended for one and a half miles.now,the barney and friends show is viewed weekly by million children,and over million copies of videos have been sold.the barney and friends show enjoys the number one nielsen rating for shows directed at young children.adults rarely watch the program except with their children.
the live appearance of the barney character,who is played by adults in costume,is completely controlled by lyons,and lyons does not license barney costumes because of its inability to police the behavior of those who might appear in the costume.it claims that it would be unable to prevent barneys from behaving in a decidedly manner and tarnishing his wholesome reputation.zack van eyck,take a deep breath barney has hit the big screen,deseret news today,at describing the satirical treatment of barney by such notables as charles barkley and the famous chicken.accordingly,every person who wears the are trained by a single choreographer how to be barney.moreover,barney live voice is provided by only one person.lyons not only refuses to license barney costumes,but also has waged a legal campaign against retailers that have distributed allegedly infringing costumes.see brooke masters,protecting barney image from bogus beasts.post,at.lyons does,however,license the barney image on toys,books,clothing,and the like.
to protect its intellectual property,lyons has registered approximately trademarks and obtained hundreds of copyrights with respect to the name barney and the character depiction.
on may,lyons commenced this action against morris costumes,philip morris,and amy morris smith,alleging and trademark infringement,as well as a state law violation.morris costumes is a north carolina corporation,operating a retail establishment in charlotte,north carolina.philip morris and his wife amy morris smith are the principal stockholders of the corporation and are alleged in the complaint to have participated in the infringing conduct.the complaint,as amended,alleges that the defendants rented three different forms of costume to the public,each of which looked like barney and therefore violated lyons proprietary interests in barney the ndc costume,a purple dinosaur costume manufactured by national discount costume company and sold to morris costumes for rental or resale hillary the purple hippopotamus,an ndc costume that morris costumes altered and duffy the dragon,a purple reptilian costume manufactured by alinco costumes.the complaint requested that the court grant lyons injunctive relief,statutory damages,compensatory damages,treble damages,punitive damages,attorneys fees,and other proper relief.
after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims.in a detailed opinion,in which the court made separately numbered findings of fact and conclusions of law,the court concluded that the ndc and hillary costumes infringed lyons copyrights and trademarks.the court,however,denied lyons a remedy because it found that the claims with respect to the ndc and hillary costumes were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations and by the doctrine of laches.the court held that the lapse between the time when lyons first became aware of morris acts of infringement and the commencement date of the lawsuit was inexcusable.on the claims relating to the duffy the dragon costume,the court found that the evidence was inadequate to show that duffy was substantially similar to or likely to cause confusion with the barney character.in reaching this conclusion,the court disregarded as hearsay the accounts of adults about children who believed that duffy was in fact barney and over newspaper articles evidencing actual confusion between duffy and barney.on lyons state law unfair trade practices claim,the court again found in favor of the defendants because the infringing activities were not undertaken with the intent that the public would be deceived as to the true origin of the costumes.finally,the court found that the action against amy morris smith was in bad faith because of her minimal involvement and the untimeliness of claims against her,and,on that basis,ordered lyons to pay her attorneys fees.
from the judgment entered for the defendants,lyons noticed this appeal.
ii.ndc and hillary costumes 
on lyons claims relating to morris costumes rentals of the ndc and hillary costumes,the court found that the defendants infringed both lyons copyrights and trademarks,though it also found that the infringements were not willful.the court refused,however,to provide lyons with any remedy because it determined that lyons claims were barred by both the applicable statutes of limitations and laches.the court also concluded that,in any event,lyons did not prove that the infringement was willful and that injunctive relief was no longer necessary because morris costumes was no longer renting the infringing costumes.lyons challenges each of these rulings,and we address them in order.
the limitations period for bringing copyright infringement claims is three years after the claim accrues.see b hotaling church of jesus christ of saints,cir.and a claim accrues when one has knowledge of a violation or is chargeable with such knowledge.hotaling,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
while the lanham act itself does not provide an express period of limitations for filing a trademark infringement claim,courts generally assume that congress intended that courts borrow a limitations period for a federal action at law from an analogous state law.see reed united transp.union,d wilson garcia,d holmberg armbrecht.kason,component hardware group,cir.in this case,the district court borrowed the statute of limitations provided in the north carolina unfair trade practices act,a provision that the parties agree is appropriately analogous.
in applying these statutes of limitations,the district court found that lyons had knowledge of defendants actions regarding ndc in april,more than four years before it filed the above encaptioned matter.lyons filed its complaint in this case on may.because this span exceeded the three and statutes of limitations for copyright and trademark claims,the court held that the statutes of limitations barred all of lyons claims involving the ndc and hillary costumes.
although morris costumes liability for at least some of the alleged acts of infringement appears to have been shielded by the statute of limitations,the district court ruled that this fact barred even claims based on infringing activity shown to have occurred within the limitations period.in doing so,it assumed that morris costumes actions regarding ndc and hillary comprise one act of infringement.this assumption,however,is contrary to our holding in hotaling,at,in which we made clear that each sale or rental should be considered separately under an infringement analysis.we held that a party does not waive the right to sue for copyright infringements that accrue within three years of filing by not asserting related claims that accrued beyond three years.id.at.this well established rule recognizes that the statute of limitations does not shield the defendant from liability for wrongful acts actually committed during the limitations period,and its rationale applies equally to trademark infringement claims brought under the lanham act.
thus,although the district court was correct to hold that lyons could not recover for claims that accrued outside the limitations period s,hotaling,at,it erred to the extent that it dismissed lyons claims that were premised upon acts that occurred within the applicable periods.because the parties agree that numerous rentals occurred within the relevant limitations periods,we reverse the district court ruling that all claims based on the ndc and hillary costumes were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.
in its brief on appeal,morris costumes does not make a serious attempt to defend the district court statute of limitations analysis.instead,it relies most heavily on its alternative theory that lyons claims were barred by laches because the delay between lyons initial contact with morris and its filing of the lawsuit was unreasonable,inexcusable,and prejudicial.lyons responds with the argument that the district court misapplied the standards governing the laches doctrine.see generally aukerman chaides constr,setting out one statement of the standards see also potter instrument storage tech,cir noting that invocation of laches is within the sound discretion of the district court and will be reversed only if clearly erroneous.
while we agree with lyons that the district court erred as a matter of law when it found that laches barred lyons claims,both legal and equitable,we do so for more fundamental reasons.first,laches is a doctrine that applies only in equity to bar equitable actions,not at law to bar legal actions.second,we note that,in any event,in connection with the copyright claims,separation of powers principles dictate that an equitable timeliness rule adopted by courts can not bar claims that are brought within the legislatively prescribed statute of limitations.finally,even in equity under the lanham act,laches does not bar a claim for prospective injunctive relief.
the doctrine of laches is based on the maxim that equity aids the vigilant,not those who sleep on their rights see ivani contracting city of new york,cir.laches may be applied by a court to bar a suit in equity that has been brought so long after the cause of action accrued that the court finds that bringing the action is unreasonable and unjust.see id.the fuzziness of these equitable principles and the softness of their application,see weinberger,d holmberg,at.frankfurter,equity eschews mechanical rules it depends on flexibility,while maybe apropos for the apparently soft and fuzzy barney,nonetheless provide no defense of laches for his actions at law.see county of oneida oneida indian nation,d a pplication of the equitable defense of laches in an action at law would be novel indeed united states mack.cardozo,laches within the term of the statute of limitations is no defense at law ivani contracting,at ashley boyle famous corned beef,cir.and the fact that federal rules of civil procedure and merged law and equity for procedural,for example,provides that t here shall be one form of action to be known as civil action does not alter the substantive rights inherent in law and equity.see commercial bank parsons,cir noting that despite the rules merger of law and equity as to form,the substantive difference in federal judicial power between law and equity remains embedded in federal law.
moreover,because laches is a judicially created doctrine,whereas statutes of limitations are legislative enactments,it has been observed that i n deference to the doctrine of separation of powers,the supreme court has been circumspect in adopting principles of equity in the context of enforcing federal statutes.oneida indian nation,at.stevens,dissenting in part relying generally on weinberger,d see also holmberg,at.if congress explicitly puts a limit upon the time for enforcing a right which it created,there is an end of the matter.the congressional statute of limitation is definitive.consequently,when considering the timeliness of a cause of action brought pursuant to a statute for which congress has provided a limitations period,a court should not apply laches to overrule the legislature judgment as to the appropriate time limit to apply for actions brought under the statute.separation of powers principles thus preclude us from applying the judicially created doctrine of laches to bar a federal statutory claim that has been timely filed under an express statute of limitations.see ivani contracting,at ashley,at miller maxwell int l,cir.and this principle is equally relevant when congress creates a cause of action for traditional equitable remedies,such as injunctions,and specifies a statute of limitations for that action.thus,when congress creates a cause of action and provides both legal and equitable remedies,its statute of limitations for that cause of action should govern,regardless of the remedy sought.
a relevant example is provided by the copyright act,where congress created a civil action by which plaintiffs may seek both damages and injunctive relief.see.and in a limitations provision,it provides,no civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued.id.b emphasis added.in view of such a provision,a court is not free to shorten the limitations period,even when a plaintiff seeks equitable relief.
but,of course,the doctrine of laches may be applied to equitable claims brought under the lanham act,which contains no express limitations provision.see holmberg,at.when federal courts,in the exercise of their equitable power,consider laches,they are guided by the limitations period that they would borrow for actions at law and presume that if an equitable claim is brought within the limitations period,it will not be barred by laches.see sara lee,cir hot wax,turtle wax,cir conopco,campbell soup,cir tandy malone hyde,cir.but if the claim is one for injunctive relief,laches would not apply.a prospective injunction is entered only on the basis of current,ongoing conduct that threatens future harm.inherently,such conduct can not be so remote in time as to justify the application of the doctrine of laches.see sara lee,at i n consideration of the public interest,estoppel by laches may not be invoked to deny injunctive relief if it is apparent that the infringing use is likely to cause confusion citing thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,ed.
because not all of the claims relating to the ndc and hillary costumes are,we must consider whether lyons is entitled to a remedy in connection with these claims.
at trial,lyons did not seek to prove actual damages and does not,therefore,press any claim for such damages.it did,however,elect statutory damages under the copyright act,which provides that the copyright owner is entitled to either actual damages or statutory damages.see a.the election for statutory damages must be made before final judgment is rendered.see id.c.in its complaint,lyons demanded statutory damages,and it apparently never abandoned that claim,because at trial it not only chose not to present evidence of actual damages,but it also sought to prove that the defendant conduct was willful,thereby entitling it to enhanced statutory damages.see id.c.
under c,a copyright owner is entitled to statutory damages of not less than or more than for infringement of any one work,as the court considers just.if the copyright owner,however,is able to prove that infringement was committed willfully,the court is given discretion to increase the award of statutory damage to a sum not more than.see id.c.on the other hand,if the copyright owner is only able to prove that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright,the court,in its discretion,may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum not less than.id.while we review for clear error any factual finding that would determine the appropriate level of statutory damages,we would review an award of those damages within the statutory range for abuse of discretion.see superior form builders,dan chase taxidermy supply,cir.
in this case,the district court found that the defendant infringement was not willful,and we conclude that the court finding is not clearly erroneous.although the copyright act does not define willful infringement,other circuits have held that infringement is willful if the defendant has knowledge,either actual or constructive,that its actions constitute an infringement,fitzgerald publ g baylor publ g,cir,or recklessly disregards a copyright holder rights,see import chenson enterprises,cir see also int l,thomas grayston,cir holding that a defendant does not act willfully within the meaning of the statute if he believes in good faith that his conduct is innocent.in this case,substantial evidence supports the district court finding that morris costumes neither knew nor should have known that it was infringing lyons copyrights.for example,an investigator hired by lyons was repeatedly told by a morris costumes employee that morris costumes did not rent barney costumes.perhaps more significantly,evidence in the record established that morris costumes ceased distribution of the ndc costumes in and replaced that costume with the modified hillary work that,while eventually found to be infringing,was also found by the district court to reflect a serious attempt to create a new work with clearly identifiable female characteristics,such as a dress,red cheeks,and long eyelashes.despite the presence of evidence pointing toward the opposite conclusion,such as morris costumes receipt of lyons letter,the district court did not clearly err when it held that the distribution of the ndc and hillary costumes was not willful infringement.
even with our affirmance of the district court willfulness ruling,however,in view of our rulings on limitations and laches,the district court is left with the determination of whether lesser statutory damages should be awarded under c.
lyons also appeals the district court decision not to issue an injunction prohibiting morris costumes from distributing infringing costumes in the future.the court wisely did not rely on laches to bar injunctive relief because laches may not be invoked to deny injunctive relief that otherwise would appear appropriate.rather,the district court concluded that morris costumes voluntary cessation of all activities concerning the costumes at issue rendered the injunction unnecessary.we believe that this statement misconstrues the legal principles applicable to the issuance and denial of injunctions.
as we have noted in the past,it is well established that the voluntary discontinuance of challenged activities by a defendant does not necessarily moot a lawsuit.united states jones,cir citing iron arrow honor soc y heckler,d per curiam.that rule is subject to the caveat that an injunction is unnecessary when there is no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated.united states grant.emphasis added quotation marks and footnote omitted see also county of los angeles davis,d.but this exception is just defendants face a heavy burden to establish mootness in such cases because otherwise they would simply be free to return to their old ways after the threat of a lawsuit has passed.iron arrow,at.alteration in original quoting grant,at.
in the case before us,the defendants did not meet this heavy burden.philip morris testified that the reason why he stopped renting the hillary costume several months before this action was commenced was because of the suit that lyons filed against the manufacturer of the ndc costume,the costume on which hillary was based.even though he stopped renting to see how that litigation fared,he continued to maintain that the hillary costume was in fact not an infringing costume.morris costumes did not make an affirmative showing that continuing infringement was,practically speaking,nearly impossible.despite this state of the record,the district court,in finding an injunction unnecessary,required no more than the defendants bald assertions that they would cease distributing the costumes and would hand over those costumes remaining in their possession following the termination of the litigation.in the context of an infringement action,such assertions,standing alone,can not eliminate the plaintiff reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur in the absence of a court order.davis,at.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,lyons was entitled to an injunction.
we therefore reverse the district court ruling denying lyons an injunction in the face of its findings of infringement and remand with instructions that the district court enter an injunction prohibiting the illegal conduct.
iii.duffy the dragon costume 
the district court held that,in contrast to the ndc and claims,lyons causes of action with respect to the duffy the dragon costume were not under either a statute of limitations or laches theory,but the court found that morris costumes did not infringe lyons copyrights and trademarks in barney when it distributed the duffy costume.lyons contends that the court findings were based on legal error because it applied an inappropriate legal standard for finding substantial similarity under the copyright act claim and wrongly excluded as hearsay evidence of children reactions to the duffy costume,as well as newspaper articles evidencing confusion,in considering the lanham act claim.we address these points in order.
the district court found that morris costume distribution of the duffy costume did not infringe lyons copyrights because,in its words,duffy is not subjectively,intrinsically similar to the barney character when viewed from the perspective of the average adult renter or purchaser of these costumes.we agree with lyons that this exclusive focus upon the average adult perspective is too narrow and fails to apply the established copyright principles of this circuit.
to establish a claim for copyright infringement,a plaintiff must prove that it owned a valid copyright and that the defendant copied the original elements of that copyright.see ale house,raleigh ale house,cir citing feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.when the plaintiff possesses no direct evidence that the defendant copied its protected work,it may create a presumption of copying by indirect evidence establishing that the defendant had access to the copyrighted work and that the defendant work is substantially similar to the protected material.see towler sayles,cir.proof of substantial similarity requires resort to yet another analysis.first,the court must determine whether the two works are extrinsically similar because they contain substantially similar ideas that are subject to copyright protection.id.at.and second,the court must ask whether the works are intrinsically similar in the sense that they express those ideas in a substantially similar manner from the perspective of the intended audience of the work.see id.at.the notion of intrinsic similarity can be a slippery one because it requires the court to inquire into the total concept and feel of the works,but only as seen through the eyes of the ordinary observer.dawson hinshaw music,cir.this ordinary observer is to be a member of the intended audience of the plaintiff work.id.at.in most cases,when a copyrighted work will be directed at the public in general,the court need only apply a general public formulation
