following a bench trial,the district court determined that appellant joseph maxwell website that complained about appellee tmi,violated the provision of the lanham act,c the consumer protection act acpa,d and the texas statute.bus.concluding that maxwell site,as a gripe site,violates none of these statutes,we reverse and render judgment in favor of maxwell.
appellant joseph maxwell intended to buy a house from appellee tmi,a company that builds houses under the name trendmaker homes.unhappy with what he viewed as the salesperson misrepresentations about the availability of a certain model,maxwell decided to create a website to tell his story.to this end,maxwell registered an internet domain name resembled tmi trendmaker homes mark.tmi had already been using the domain name.maxwell registered his domain name for a year after the year passed,maxwell removed the site and let the registration expire.
during its existence,the site contained maxwell story of his dispute with tmi,along with a disclaimer at the top of the home page indicating that it was not tmi site.it also contained what maxwell called the treasure chest.maxwell envisioned the treasure chest as a place for readers to share and obtain information about contractors and tradespeople who had done good work.during the year of the site existence,the treasure chest only contained one name,that of a man who had performed some work for maxwell.the site did not contain any paid advertisements.
the parties agree that some intended for tmi was sent to maxwell site.they also agree that maxwell forwarded each of these messages to tmi.
shortly after maxwell registration expired,tmi sent maxwell a letter demanding that he take down the site and relinquish the domain name.in response,maxwell attempted to the domain name.his attempt was unsuccessful,however,because tmi had acquired the domain name once maxwell registration expired.instead,maxwell registered the domain name.this lawsuit followed.because of the suit,maxwell has never posted any content on the site.
almost immediately,the parties entered into settlement negotiations.maxwell retained a lawyer,but knew he would not be able to afford to pay the legal fees that would be required to defend the entire lawsuit.tmi and maxwell lawyer negotiated a settlement,while maxwell researched his case.following this research,maxwell backed out of the settlement agreement and proceeded pro se.he continued to represent himself through the bench trial on january.
after the trial,the district court issued a memorandum and order.in it,the district court found that maxwell violated the acpa as well as the federal and texas statutes.the district court also issued an injunction forbidding maxwell from using names,marks,and domain names similar to ten of tmi marks,including trend maker,and ordering maxwell to transfer to tmi.the district court also required tmi to submit a proposed judgment and gave maxwell ten days to respond to that proposal.maxwell immediately filed a notice of appeal.
without allowing maxwell ten days to respond,the district court signed tmi proposed judgment.in many ways,this judgment expanded the memorandum and order conclusions.for example,the memorandum and order contained no findings about either common law or statutory unfair competition.yet the judgment stated that maxwell actions constituted unfair competition under both common law and the lanham act.the judgment provided a broader injunction than the one contained in the district court original order by adding three marks to the injunction.the judgment also awarded statutory damages of and,without elaboration,found the case to be an exceptional case,justifying an award of in attorney fees.additionally,the judgment addressed how maxwell was to pay the judgment w ithin twenty days after entry of this order,defendant shall to plaintiff lawyer a cashier check in the amount of,made payable to tmi,maxwell then filed his second notice of appeal.
tmi made several related claims in this lawsuit.in the first,tmi alleged that maxwell violated acpa.additionally,tmi alleged that maxwell actions diluted its mark and thus violated the texas statute,as well as the provision of the lanham act 
commercial use requirement 
we first address whether the two relevant sections of the lanham provision and commercial use for liability the district court concluded that acpa requires commercial use,but did not address commercial use in the context of the provision.tmi argues that the provision applies even in the absence of commercial use.
in making this argument,tmi does not address the provision language,which conditions liability on commercial use 
the owner of a famous mark shall be entitled,subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court deems reasonable,to an injunction against another person commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name,if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark,and to obtain such other relief as is provided in this subsection.
c emphasis added.
citing this language,courts have observed that the provision requires the diluter to have made commercial use of the mark see,bird parsons,cir panavision int l,toeppen,cir.one of the exceptions to the provision further indicates that the provision only applies to commercial use the following shall not be actionable under this section b noncommercial use of a mark.c.we conclude that,under the statute language,maxwell use must be commercial to fall under the provision.
on the other hand,acpa language does not contain such a specific requirement.under acpa,the owner of a mark can recover against a person who,acting with a bad faith intent to profit from that mark registers,traffics in,or uses a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to that mark.d.acpa thus bases liability on a bad faith intent to profit.acpa lists nine factors for courts to consider when determining whether a defendant had a bad faith intent to profit.one of those factors is the person bona fide noncommercial or fair use of the mark in a site accessible under the domain name.d b i iv.
this court has addressed acpa and commercial use in gallo winery spider webs,cir.in gallo,the defendant spider webs registered domain names that could be associated with existing businesses,including.com,and others.at.spider webs then auctioned those domain names,refusing all bids of less than.id.one of spider webs owners testified during deposition that,after registering the domain name,spider webs hoped that gallo would contact it so that spider webs could assist the company.id.with this evidence,the court determined that the defendant use was commercial the company registered domain names and then sold those names to trademark holders.id.at.because spider web use was so clearly commercial,the court noted that it did not need to decide whether acpa also requires use in commerce.id.at.the sixth circuit,too,recently determined that it did not need to consider arguments about whether acpa covers use,as the statute directs a reviewing court to consider only a defendant bad faith intent to profit from the use of a mark held by another party.lucas nursery landscaping,grosse,cir.like the lucas nursery court,we,too,do not need to decide this question in this case.
was maxwell site commercial use 
tmi argues that maxwell site was and therefore not protected from the lanham act coverage.according to tmi,maxwell put the site to commercial use by including the treasure chest and in so doing removed any protections his speech might otherwise have had.
the lanham act defines use in commerce as the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade.when defining commercial use,courts have examined several different aspects of the defendant use.the ninth circuit has emphasized that commercial use in commerce refers to a use of a famous and distinctive mark to sell goods other than those produced or authorized by the mark owner.mattel,mca records,cir and that the phrase requires the defendant to be using the trademark as a trademark,capitalizing on its trademark status.avery dennison sumpton,cir.pu
