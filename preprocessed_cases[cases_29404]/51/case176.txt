quick technologies,qti filed suit against the sage group plc sage group,sage holdings,holdings,and sage software,sage software collectively defendants for trademark infringement and unfair competition.prior to trial,the district court dismissed qti claims against sage group for lack of personal jurisdiction.the district court further denied qti request to amend the pretrial order to add a corrective advertising claim.ultimately,qti prevailed at trial against holdings and sage software on its trademark infringement claims and the district court entered permanent injunctions in qti favor qti,however,did not prevail on its claim for an accounting of holdings and sage software profits.qti appeals.
factual and procedural background 
qti was formed in and initially provided online information about distributors in the promotional products industry companies that imprint a business logo onto coffee mugs,key chains,flashlights.qti claims that by,it had expanded its product offerings to include such things as online databases,online supplier advertising and other databases and business software.qti began using the mark sage information system in january and has been using a variety of marks which incorporate or use the word sage sage,sage information system,and library continuously since that time.
sage group is a public limited company organized under the laws of england and wales.sage group manufactures and sells software for accounting and business management purposes and its principal place of business is in england.on october,sage group received registration for the mark sage in the united kingdom.beginning in,sage group,acting through holdings,acquired several american companies that developed and sold accounting and business management software.by,sage group began to consider whether the company should adopt an international brand name and ultimately adopted sage as such.
on may,qti filed an application with the united states patent and trademark office uspto to register the mark sage information system.this mark was published for opposition in,at which time sage group claims it first learned of qti use of the sage information system mark.negotiations began between sage group and qti regarding use of the mark.these negotiations eventually broke down and sage group filed a notice of opposition to qti use of the sage information system mark with the uspto.
on march,sage group filed an intent to use application for the mark sage with the uspto.sage group claims that it abandoned this application on march,in,holdings and sage software began using the sage mark in connection with their respective products.on may,qti filed a lawsuit against sage group and holdings alleging,among other things,trademark infringement.on april,qti filed a similar suit against sage software and the cases were later consolidated into the instant case.on september,the district court granted a motion by sage group to dismiss the claims against it for lack of personal jurisdiction.
this case was originally set for trial in november.on november,the district court reviewed the parties joint proposed pretrial order.soon thereafter,the district court sua sponte continued the case until april.in january,qti retained new trial counsel.on april,qti served defendants with a proposed amended pretrial order seeking,among other things,to add a damages claim for corrective advertising.on april,the district court rejected qti new proposed pretrial order and entered the joint pretrial order previously submitted to the court in november.
the case was tried before a jury.in addition to instructing the jury on the likelihood of confusion issues,the district judge asked that the jury determine whether holdings and sage software infringement was done willfully,has qti proven the defendants intended to cause confusion,to cause mistake or to deceive the jury was further instructed that if it answered yes to the question of willful infringement,it was to s tate the damages,if any you award qti by reason of the profits made by the defendants from the sale of software products since each defendant began using sage in commerce.the jury returned a verdict for qti on most of the likelihood of confusion issues but did not find that the defendants conduct was willful.thus,the jury did not award an accounting of profits.the district court entered final judgment on may,stating that h aving considered the verdict and the applicable authorities,the court determined that permanent injunctive relief should be entered in favor of qti,but that no damages should be awarded.
discussion 
qti presents the following issues on appeal whether the district court erred in dismissing against sage group for lack of personal jurisdiction,whether the district court abused its discretion in denying qti request to amend the pretrial order to add a new damages claim based on a theory of prospective corrective advertising,and whether the district court erred in instructing the jury that qti must prove that the defendants infringement was done willfully before it could award an accounting of profits under section a of the lanham act,a,and in instructing the jury that willfully means to do an act voluntarily and intentionally and with the specific intent to cause the likelihood of consumer confusion.
personal jurisdiction 
the district court determination of the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant is a question of law subject to de novo review.mink aaaa dev,cir.when personal jurisdiction is challenged,the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing the district court jurisdiction over the defendant.id.when the district court rules on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction without an evidentiary hearing,the plaintiff may bear his burden by presenting a prima facie case that personal jurisdiction is proper.wilson belin,cir.in making its determination,the district court may consider the contents of the record before the court at the time of the motion,including affidavits,interrogatories,depositions,oral testimony,or any combination of the recognized methods of discovery.thompson chrysler motors,cir.
qti contends that it presented a prima facie case for specific jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure k.rule k states 
if the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states,serving a summons or filing a waiver of service is also effective,with respect to claims arising under federal law,to establish personal jurisdiction over the person of any defendant who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of general jurisdiction of any state.
rule k thus sanctions personal jurisdiction over foreign defendants for claims arising under federal law when the defendant has sufficient contacts with the nation as a whole to justify the imposition of united states law but without sufficient contacts to satisfy the due process concerns of the statute of any particular state.world tanker carriers ya mawlaya,cir emphasis omitted.the due process required in federal cases governed by rule k is measured with reference to the fifth amendment,rather than the fourteenth amendment.submersible,perforadora central,cir.furthermore,s pecific jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation is appropriate when the corporation has purposefully directed its activities at the forum state and the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise out of or relate to those activities.alpine view atlas copco ab,cir internal quotations omitted.
in this case,there is no dispute that qti trademark infringement claims arise under federal law and neither side has claimed that sage group is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of any state.thus,the only issue is whether exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states.fed.civ.pro.k.in order to determine whether the exercise of jurisdiction satisfies the fifth amendment,we must conduct the now familiar minimum contacts analysis to determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.world tanker carriers,at internal citations omitted.
qti contends that the following contacts with the united states establish grounds for specific jurisdiction over sage group sage group filed an opposition to qti trademark application with the uspto in which it asserted its use of the sage mark in commerce in the united states,including in its marketing efforts sage group retained a attorney to file the opposition and to negotiate with qti sage group filed an application with the uspto sage group contacted companies concerning its international efforts,including one trip to the by its business development director sage group operated a web site,which provided information about sage group,as well as links to its subsidiaries and sage group used the sage mark in publications circulated in the and added the sage mark to product advertisements,boxes and brochures used by its subsidiaries.
sage group contends that this court should only consider its filings with the uspto and its operation of its website in our minimum contacts analysis because those were the only contacts before the district court at the time it ruled on the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.even considering all of the contacts cited by qti,personal jurisdiction over sage group is inappropriate.
first,qti claims do not sufficiently arise out of or relate to the contacts indicated by the documents filed with the uspto to establish specific jurisdiction.the documents filed by sage group merely indicate that sage group owned various registrations of the mark sage in the united kingdom,it had the intention of using the mark in commerce in the united states,and its subsidiaries were currently using the mark in the united states sage group filings with the uspto further indicate that it had used the mark sage in advertisements placed in publications which circulate in the united states.generally,advertisements are insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.see singletary,cir concluding that advertisements did not establish personal jurisdiction where there was no evidence that the claim arose out of or was related to the advertisements.second,sage group operation of a website containing company and product information and links to its subsidiaries also does not provide sufficient grounds for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.see mink,at finding that a website that is nothing more than a passive advertisement,a website that provides product information,telephone numbers,addresses,mail addresses,and order forms,does not support the exercise of personal jurisdiction.finally,sage group various contacts with companies,including those related to its efforts with its subsidiaries,also do not involve sage group using qti mark in commerce in the,thus they do not form a sufficient basis for specific personal jurisdiction.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court grant of sage group motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.
ii.amendment to pretrial order 
the district court decision not to allow qti proposed amendment of the pretrial order submitted shortly before trial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.masinter tenneco oil,cir.because of the importance of the order in achieving efficacy and expeditiousness upon trial in the district court,appellate courts are hesitant to interfere with the court discretion in creating,enforcing,and modifying such orders.flannery carroll,cir.federal rule of civil procedure e states that t he order following a final pretrial conference shall be modified only to prevent manifest injustice.
qti asserts that a damages claim based on prospective corrective advertising was mistakenly left out of the joint pretrial order presented to the district court in november the district court,concerned with fundamental fairness,refused to allow qti to modify the pretrial order.qti argues that the district court abused its discretion because holdings and sage software would not have been prejudiced by the amendment,rather,the amendment would have caused only a slight inconvenience.moreover,qti argues that it was substantially harmed by not being allowed to amend the pretrial order.we disagree.in trinity carton falstaff brewing,this court explained that 
even though amendment of the pretrial order may be allowed where no surprise or prejudice to the opposing party results,where the evidence and the issue were known at the time of the original pretrial conference,amendments may generally be refused.each party has an affirmative duty to allege at the pretrial conference all factual and legal bases upon which the party wishes to litigate the case.failure to do so may implicate waiver of the issue at the discretion of the trial court,subject to considerations of fairness and efficient administration of justice.
cir citation omitted.accordingly,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the amendment.
iii.accounting of profits 
qti sought to receive an accounting of holdings and sage software profits pursuant to a,in addition to injunctive relief pursuant to.section a provides that 
when a violation of any right of the registrant of a mark registered in the patent and trademark office,a violation under section a,c,or d a,c,or d,or a willful violation under section c c,shall have been established in any civil action arising under this act,the plaintiff shall be entitled,subject to the provisions of section and,and subject to the principles of equity,to recover defendant profits,any damages sustained by the plaintiff,and the costs of the action.the court shall assess such profits and damages or cause the same to be assessed under its direction.in assessing damages the court may enter judgment,according to the circumstances of the case,for any sum above the amount found as actual damages,not exceeding three times such amount.if the court shall find that the amount of the recovery based on profits is either inadequate or excessive the court may in its discretion enter judgment for such sum as the court shall find to be just,according to the circumstances of the case.such sum in either of the above circumstances shall constitute compensation and not a penalty.the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.
as this court has previously stated,t he goal behind and remedies is to achieve equity between or among the parties.seatrax,sonbeck int l,cir.a district court ruling regarding and remedies is subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review.id.the district court instructions to the jury are also subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review.see waco int l khk scaffolding houston,cir.although we afford broad discretion in fashioning jury instructions,the trial court must nevertheless instruct the jurors,fully and correctly,on the applicable law of the case eeoc manville sales,cir internal citations omitted.
section a provides that the court shall assess such profits and damages or cause the same to be assessed under its direction.in this case,in addition to instructing the jury on the likelihood of confusion issues,the district judge asked the jury to decide whether holdings and sage software infringement was done willfully the jury was further instructed that if it answered affirmatively regarding the willful infringement issue,it was then to determine the amount of damages,if any 
qti argues that the district judge erred by conditioning an award of profits upon a finding of a particular mens rea,willful infringement.qti contends,among other things,that a willfulness requirement is contrary to the plain language of a and goes beyond the requirements of this court precedent.in contrast,the defendants urge this court to explicitly hold that willful infringement is a prerequisite to an accounting of profits under a.alternatively,the defendants argue that the district court exercised its discretion appropriately when it ruled in the final judgment that qti was not entitled to an award of profits.
in considering these arguments,we are cognizant that several of our sister circuits have embraced a willfulness requirement in order to obtain an award of profits.see securacomm consulting securacom,cir holding that a plaintiff must prove that an infringer acted willfully before the infringer profits are recoverable bishop equinox int l,cir finding that an award of profits requires a showing that defendant actions were willful or in bad faith minnesota pet breeders,schell kampeter,cir stating that an accounting of profits may be awarded based on various theories i f a registered owner proves willful,deliberate infringement or deception the george basch blue coral,cir holding that in order to justify an award of profits,a plaintiff must establish that the defendant engaged in willful deception alpo petfoods,ralston purina,concluding that an award based on a defendant profits requires proof that the defendant acted willfully or in bad faith.but see adray,cir concluding that a n instruction that willful infringement is a prerequisite to an award of defendant profits may be error in some circumstances as when plaintiff seeks the defendant profits as a measure of his own damage roulo russ berrie,cir explaining that o ther than general equitable considerations,there is no express requirement that the infringer willfully infringe to justify an award of profits burger king mason,cir nor is an award of profits based on either unjust enrichment or deterrence dependent upon a higher showing of culpability on the part of the defendant,who is purposely using the trademark.it is important to note,however,that prior to the amendment of a on august,there were no references to the term willful in a,thus the decisions of our sister circuits are of limited utility to the decision we are faced with today.see trademark amendments act of,stat.substituting a violation under section a,or a willful violation under section c,for or a violation under section a.
several of our previous cases are instructive.in maltina bottling,this court held that an accounting of profits may be proper even if the defendant and plaintiff are not in direct competition,and the defendants infringement has not diverted sales from the plaintiff,cir.the court concluded that an accounting of the profits the defendant earned from its willful infringement was proper and serves two purposes remedying unjust enrichment and deterring future infringement.id.
in texas pig stands,hard rock café international,this court affirmed a district court denial of an award of profits notwithstanding a jury finding that hard rock café infringement was willful and that it was unjustly enriched by its infringement,cir.the court approvingly cited the district court description of the situation while the court believes defendant sold pig sandwiches knowing of plaintiff mark,it appears this was done not as an attempt to profit from the mark but rather in simple disregard of plaintiff rights.id.at.this court concluded that awarding texas pig stands any of hard rock café profits from the sale of pig sandwiches would be a windfall because there was no evidence that the profits were attributable to hard rock café infringement.id.at.
in pebble beach tour,this court adopted a factor based approach to the determination of whether an award of profits is appropriate in trademark infringement cases.cir.the factors to be considered include,but are not limited to whether the defendant had the intent to confuse or deceive,whether sales have been diverted,the adequacy of other remedies,any unreasonable delay by the plaintiff in asserting his rights,the public interest in making the misconduct unprofitable,and whether it is a case of palming off.id.at see also rolex watch usa,meece,cir citing the pebble beach factors.ultimately,this court concluded that the district court in pebble beach did not abuse its discretion in denying an accounting of profits.the court reasoned that because of the lack of actual damages and the lack of an intent to confuse or deceive,injunctive relief satisfied the equities of the case.pebble beach,at.
more recently,this court once again outlined its factor based approach in seatrax,sonbeck international,cir.with regard to remedies,the court noted that b ecause each case presents a different set of facts and circumstances,a evaluation is warranted to determine the nature of the infringing conduct and its adverse effects,if any,on the plaintiff.id.in seatrax,the court rejected the plaintiff contention that an accounting of profits was appropriate because the defendant was unjustly enriched,explaining that evidence of unjust enrichment and diversion of sales was speculative at best.id.at.moreover,the court found that other factors weighed against an accounting of profits,the jury did not find that the infringement was willful,the case did not involve palming off,and the permanent injunction would provide an effective deterrent to future infringement.id.thus,the court concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying profits.
it is obvious from our cases that willful infringement is an important factor which must be considered when determining whether an accounting of profits is appropriate in accordance with our previous decisions,and in light of the plain language of a,however,we decline to adopt a rule in which a showing of willful infringement is a prerequisite to an accounting of profits.rather,we reaffirm the approach outlined in pebble beach,rolex watch usa,and seatrax.
section a remedies are awarded subject to the principles of equity.thus,an award of the defendant profits is not automatic.see champion spark plug sanders.pebble beach,at.in order to determine whether an accounting is appropriate,the court,or the jury in this case,considers the factors outlined in pebble beach once an award is found to be appropriate,a markholder is only entitled to those profits attributable to the unlawful use of its mark.id.citing texas pig stands,at.
in this case,the district judge instructed the jury that it should not reach the issue of awarding profits unless it determined there was willful infringement.under this instruction,the jury was only afforded the opportunity to consider one factor,albeit an important one.if the other factors are applicable to the case,such a limited instruction is improper.
qti asserts that only two of the pebble beach factors are applicable to the facts of this delay by the plaintiff in asserting his rights and the public interest in making the misconduct unprofitable.the defendants do not allege any unreasonable delay by qti in asserting its rights.because the jury was instructed that an award of profits was contingent on a finding of willful infringement,and because the jury was not allowed to consider the public interest in making the misconduct unprofitable in its damages determination,we conclude that the jury instruction constitutes error.however,because the statute is heavily imbued with equitable considerations,an error in the jury instruction does not end the analysis.when the evidence as a whole is measured against the only two pebble beach factors that are arguably applicable,the principles of equity still do not weigh in favor of an award of profits to qti.notwithstanding the error in the jury instruction which limited the jury to considering only wilfulness,qti has not shown that the district court abused the wide discretion afforded it by the statute in denying an award of profits.
as we have previously held,a markholder is only entitled to those profits attributable to the unlawful use of its mark.id.citing texas pig stands,at.in texas pig stands,we concluded that there was no evidence whatsoever that hard rock café used texas pig stands good will to sell its pig sandwiches.at.as the trial court in texas pig stands,summarized the situation,hard rock would have sold just as many pig sandwiches by any other name and there is no basis for inferring that any of the profits received by hard rock from the sale of pig sandwiches are attributable to infringement.id.internal quotations omitted.the defendant in texas pig stands,sold pig sandwiches knowing of plaintiff mark,but it appears this was done not as an attempt to profit from the mark but rather in simple disregard of plaintiff rights.id.at.we believe this case pos
