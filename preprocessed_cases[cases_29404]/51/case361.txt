mattel,mattel appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of jada toys,jada on mattel federal and state trademark infringement counterclaims.mattel also challenges the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of jada as to its dilution and copyright claims.
we hold that because the district court erred in its application of the relevant infringement test,the district court entry of summary judgment in jada favor as to those claims is reversed.we also hold that genuine issues of material fact exist as to mattel copyright and dilution claims and,therefore,the district court entry of summary judgment as to those claims in favor of jada is also reversed.
factual and procedural background 
jada toys is a california corporation that specializes in the distribution and sale of miniature diecast toy cars,trucks,and other vehicles.generally,these vehicles are scale model replicas of actual vehicles.from to,jada produced a line of toy trucks called hot rigz.
in,jada filed an application for a trademark registration of the term hot rigz with the united states patent and trademark office pto.the trademark was issued by and registered with the pto in,though jada used its hot rigz trademark in advertising material and on its toys and their packaging from to.
mattel is also a toy company.among its many lines of toys is its familiar hot wheels miniature vehicle brand,which it has been marketing since.the hot wheels vehicle line includes small scale versions of big rig trucks.since,mattel has employed the use of a flame logo logo to identify the hot wheels brand.in mattel developed a complementary version of the logo,this one incorporating the mattel seal,to be used in conjunction with the sale of its product.mattel owns federal trademark registrations for both of these flame logos.
on april,jada filed an action against mattel,asserting claims for trademark infringement,false designation of origin,and unfair competition.jada allegations,however,were not related to its hot rigz mark rather,jada claimed that mattel advertising and sale of its old school and new school lines infringed on jada use of its registered trademark old skool.mattel asserted various affirmative defenses and counterclaims.among the counterclaims were allegations that jada hot rigz mark infringed on mattel hot wheels mark mattel also counterclaimed for copyright infringement and dilution.ultimately,each party submitted motions for summary judgment.
on march,the district court issued its ruling regarding the parties motions for summary judgment.as to jada claims relating to mattel old school and new school marks,the court granted summary judgment in mattel favor.and as to mattel counterclaims for infringement,copyright,and dilution,relating to jada use of its hot rigz logo,the court granted summary judgment in jada favor.in granting summary judgment as to mattel infringement claims,the district court relied on the dissimilarity of the marks alone to determine that no likelihood of confusion existed.mattel timely appealed the grant of summary judgment as to its counterclaims.
ii.standard of review 
the review of a grant of summary judgment as to an infringement claim is de novo.surfvivor media,survivor,cir.as such,we must determine whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there are any genuine issues of material fact,and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.entrepreneur media,smith,cir quoting wendt host int l,cir.because of the intensely factual nature of trademark disputes,summary judgment is generally disfavored in the trademark arena.id.quoting interstellar starship,epix,cir.the court may affirm a judgment on any ground fairly supported by the record.narell freeman,cir citing denardo murphy,cir,cert.denied,d.
iii.analysis 
mattel trademark claims 
all of mattel infringement claims are subject to the same test.see century real estate sandlin,cir citing rodeo collection,seventh,cir see also vuitton et fils young,cir noting that if a product is marketed in such a way so as to cause a likelihood of confusion,the defendant might be guilty of palming off.therefore,the critical determination is whether an alleged trademark infringer use of a mark creates a likelihood that the consuming public will be confused as to who makes what product.brother records,jardine,cir quoting thane int l trek bicycle,cir.
we employ an eight factor test sleekcraft factors in determining the likelihood of confusion.brookfield commc ns,coast entm t,cir.these factors include strength of the mark proximity of the goods similarity of the marks evidence of actual confusion marketing channels used type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser defendant intent in selecting the mark and likelihood of expansion of the product lines.amf sleekcraft boats,cir citations omitted.
we have previously noted that the test for likelihood of confusion is pliant,and that s ome factors are much more important than others,brookfield,at.jada seizes on such language as an indication that the district court consideration of the dissimilarity of the marks alone was sufficient to support its conclusion.we disagree.
though the language we have used warns against excessive rigidity in applying the test,see,we have never countenanced a likelihood of confusion determination based on a consideration of dissimilarity alone or,indeed,on the consideration of any single factor.instead,we have regularly applied all the relevant factors,noting that a final likelihood of confusion determination may rest on those factors that are of the most relative importance in any particular case.see,surfvivor,at applying all eight factors and noting that the test is a fluid one and the plaintiff need not satisfy every factor,provided that strong showings are made with respect to some of them.thus,while a likelihood of confusion determination may ultimately rest on a subset of factors,evidence of relatively important factors must be considered as part of that set.in the context of two subjectively dissimilar marks,evidence of actual confusion and evidence defining the context in which the goods are sold is particularly relevant.
to hold otherwise would allow the possibility that persuasive evidence of a particular factor may be considered at the expense of relevant evidence of others.this problem is particularly acute where,as here,a court relies on the dissimilarity of the marks to conclude that no likelihood of confusion exists.in such a case,the potential for a judge to elevate his or her own subjective impressions of the relative dissimilarity of the marks over evidence of,for example,actual confusion,is great.and where the subjective impressions of a particular judge are weighed at the expense of other relevant evidence,the value of the approach sanctioned by this court is undermined.
today holding is consistent with our prior decisions.for while jada accurately cites language from the case law of this circuit suggesting that dissimilarity alone may be a sufficient basis upon which to judge the likelihood of confusion,brookfield,at sleeper lounge bell,cir,we conclude that the language employed in those cases constitutes dicta and,therefore,we are not bound by it.see inlandboatmens union of pac.dutra group,cir holding that a panel is not bound by dicta in prior decisions.
in brookfield,for example,we stated that w here the two marks are entirely dissimilar,there is no likelihood of confusion.pepsi does not infringe coke.nothing further need be said.brookfield,at.in brookfield,however,we did not conclude that the marks in question were so dissimilar that no likelihood of confusion could exist.id.at.to the contrary,we found that the marks were quite similar.id.moreover,there is no indication that in brookfield we ignored evidence of other important factors in determining that dissimilarity could be determinative.see id.at.and,beyond that,there was no evidence of actual confusion presented in the case.id.at.thus,in brookfield we were not confronted with a situation where,as here,strong evidence of other important factors existed to counter the c
