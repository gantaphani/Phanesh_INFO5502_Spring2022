defendant bob,who is unaffiliated with audi,used the domain name www.audisport.com to sell goods and merchandise displaying audi name and trademarks.audi claims that website infringes and dilutes its world famous trademarks audi,the audi four ring logo,and quattro,as well as the distinctive trade dress of audi automobiles.audi also claims that violated the anticybersquatting consumer protection act.the district court granted summary judgment and injunctive relief to audi on all claims.the district court also granted audi attorneys fees,but refused to award audi statutory damages under a.appeals the grant of summary judgment and injunctive relief and award of attorneys fees to audi.he also appeals the district court denial of his rule f motion for additional discovery.for the reasons below,we affirm the district court.
on february,defendant bob registered the domain name www.audisport.com.he posted content to the website on june,and april.audi ag,d.according to,richard cylc,who worked at champion audi,an audi dealership in pompano,florida,contacted him via email stating that he liked the site.cylc later asked if it would be mutually beneficial if we develop the site.appellant br.at.cylc then turned development over to devin carlson,a salesperson employed by champion audi,who claims sent content to the site.id.at.testified that carlson gave him verbal authorization to display audi trademarks.alleges that when he asked if displaying the logos was permissible,carlson stated that it had been authorized by a man named bob skal.audi,d at.states that he asked skal for written authorization many,many,many times,but that skal continued to make excuses as to why he had not gotten around to giving written authorization.id.at.
audi has shown that in reality,skal was not affiliated with audi in any way id.at.further,champion audi,the employer of carlson and cylc,entered into an agreement with audi providing that this agreement does not grant dealer champion audi any license or permission to use authorized trademarks except as mentioned herein,and dealer has no right to grant any such permission or interest.id.emphasis added.
beginning on april,agreed with carlson that he would post hyperlinks to another site,www.audisportline.com,which would direct internet customers to an audisport boutique and services webpage.this webpage offered goods such as hats and shirts with the audi sport logo,and an email subscription service offering email addresses.id.these items were posted for sale in.id.at.in exchange for posting the link on the website,would receive a portion of the sales revenue.id.at.each item had a paypal button for customers to make payments.
prior to posting these items for sale,commissioned thompson smith,a graphic designer,to create two logos incorporating the audi ring logo that displayed on his website.smith visited the plaintiff actual www.audi.com website and noticed some items of concern,which he emailed to on may,
audi already has a collection site that is really well done with some very limited audi sport goodies.are we taking over management,production of this and it will then become 
are you sure that we have the licensing rights to reproduce audi,audi sport,quattro,logos if we do,lets please see this in writing for working with vendors.i will need a copy of this.

if incorporated or llc as www.audisport.com,do we have a corporate lawyer 
while the www.audisport.com website was running,the homepage displayed the message who are we we are a cooperative with audi of america,and will be providing the latest products for your audi sic and information on audisport north america.id.at.initially testified that he never received written permission to display audi trademarks,but later stated that 
since the spring of to the present,i received email,oral,and written communications from melissa grunnah,audi ag,currently audi ag press officer devin carlson initially directed me to melissa grunnah,who sends me news and press releases by about audi racing events.she has on more than one occasion given me permission to post news,content,images and racing information at as well as emailed to other multiple parties including.she sends copies of this content by email to multiple people,of which i am one of,on the email distribution list.
on may,due to the fact that the website had generated no profit,carlson cancelled any further development.id.at.he told that he would tell him the actual date he should remove the links,though carlson never got back to about taking them down.on december,december,and january,received cease and desist letters from audi.id.at.
claims that on february,he removed references to all approved page designs,all logos developed,and content posted having audi trademarks audi,audi four rings,and quattro such that,as a result,audisport.com appeared in a noncommercial way.states that through the course of its existence,his website was transformed from a noncommercial informational website,to a site for an audi sic licensee,and then back to noncommercial website,and contends that audi ag continues to use and supply content to.appellant br.at.
despite contention,the facts show that www.audisport.com continued to have some commercial purpose.at the time the district court ruled on summary judgment,was still offering to sell advertising space on the website.audi,d at.simultaneously,the website informed visitors this page is not associated with audi ag or audi usa in any way.id.
the district court found that there were no issues of material fact and entered summary judgment in favor of plaintiff audi for its infringement,dilution,false designation of origin,and cyberpiracy claims.id.at.the court denied audi request for statutory damages under a,but granted its request for a permanent injunction and attorneys fees.id.
the court also denied motion to reopen the discovery period through his submission of a rule f affidavit.it found that although was well aware of the issues with regard to which he sought discovery,he had not attempted to conduct discovery until after business hours on the last day of discovery.id.at.
we review a district court denial of additional time for discovery for abuse of discretion.plott general motors,cir.factors that should be considered include when the moving party learned of the issue that is the subject of discovery,how the discovery would affect the ruling below,the length of the discovery period,whether the moving party was dilatory,and whether the adverse party was responsive to prior discovery requests.id.at.
in this case,the discovery period ended on february.sought additional discovery in the form of a notice of deposition faxed to audi after business hours on this day,which audi did not receive until the next day.audi,d at.the magistrate judge denied motion to compel responses and extend the discovery deadline,and the district court affirmed on june.id.when it denied rule f affidavit,the district court found that such an affidavit is appropriate when a party files it before discovery,but here,filed it after discovery.id.the court also noted that it had previously addressed and rejected this issue in june.id.
contends that his delay was excusable because he was unaware of the issue the request pertained,an alleged abandonment by audi of its mark audi sport until february.appellant br.at.even if we believe,this was twelve days prior to the discovery deadline on which finally made his discovery request.more importantly,counsel conceded at the magistrate hearing that had been aware of the issue this request pertained to since december,a full months before the discovery deadline.
in plott,we found that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff plott motion for additional discovery where he had learned of the pertinent issue three weeks before the close of discovery.plott,at.under this reasoning,we must find that a delay of months is dilatory.
has also failed to show that granting additional discovery time would have changed the outcome of this case.contends that audi abandoned its rights in the audi sport logo.however,as the district court noted,any dispute over use of the domain name www.audisport.com is immaterial to the question of whether he is liable for his use of the audi trademarks.audi,d at.thus,even if had used another domain name,such as www.damatoracing.com,he would still be liable for his commercial use of audi trademarks.
for the reasons above,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it rejected rule f affidavit.
a moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.bennett eastpointe,cir quoting.c see also celotex catrett,d.t he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.anderson liberty lobby,d.if the moving party meets its burden,the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to come forth with evidence demonstrating that there is a genuine issue of material fact,and therefore the case should go to trial.e bailey floyd county bd.of,cir.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,construing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.bennett,at.
trademark infringement claim 
under both common law and federal law,a trademark is a designation used to identify and distinguish the goods of a person.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks,ed quoting.under the lanham act,et,we use the same test to decide whether there has been trademark infringement,unfair competition,or false designation of origin the likelihood of confusion between the two marks.two pesos taco cabana,d.argues that the district court finding of a likelihood of confusion should be reversed because audi did not offer evidence demonstrating actual confusion.however,although proof that the buying public was actually deceived is necessary in order to recover statutory damages under the lanham act,only a likelihood of confusion must be shown in order to obtain equitable relief,which is at issue in this appeal.frisch restaurants elby big boy,cir.
we have held that in determining whether there is a likelihood of confusion,the following eight factors should be considered strength of plaintiff mark relatedness of the goods similarity of the marks evidence of actual confusion marketing of channels used degree of purchaser care defendant intent in selecting the mark and likelihood of expansion in selecting the mark.wynn oil thomas,cir elby big boy,at.
as to the first factor,t he strength of a mark is a factual determination of the mark distinctiveness.the more distinct a mark,the more likely is the confusion resulting from its infringement,and therefore the more protection it is due.frisch restaurant,shoney,cir.audi trademarks are,and has provided no evidence to the contrary.the district court was correct in finding that the audi trademarks are recognizable and widely known.audi,d at.
with respect to the second factor,relatedness of goods,we have held that if the parties compete directly by offering their goods or services,confusion is likely if the marks are sufficiently similar.daddy junky music stores big daddy family music,cir.the record shows that sold merchandise bearing the audi symbol on his website,in addition to selling.com email addresses and advertising space.the goods and services sold by audi and are related,for they are marketed and consumed such that buyers are likely to believe that the services and goods,similarly marked,come from the same source,or are somehow connected with or sponsored by a common company.id.at.
as to the third factor,w hen analyzing similarity,courts should examine the pronunciation,appearance,and verbal translation of conflicting marks.id.contends that his use of the domain name www.audisport.com is lawful because audi cancelled the trademark audi sport in.however,we have held that with respect to domain names,addition of characters along with the mark does not eliminate the likelihood of confusion.paccar telescan,cir finding that telescan domain names,such as www.peterbilt newtrucks.com,had the same appearance as paccar domain name www.peterbilt.com.as in,where the addition of generic or common descriptive words did not make the domain names sufficiently dissimilar,in the case at bar,the addition of sport after audi fails to distinguish the two,and public confusion is thus likely.in addition,as the district court found,the marks used by on the goods and services sold are undoubtedly similar,for they are,in fact,audi actual trademarks.
in evaluating the fourth factor,evidence of actual confusion,we have noted that although such evidence is the best indicator of likelihood of confusion,the absence of actual confusion evidence is inconsequential.id.here,the best evidence is thompson smith email to,supra,where he reveals his confusion with www.audisport.com.he notes that the real audi website already has similar merchandise available.he further inquires about licensing rights and requests to have something in writing.if smith,an experienced graphic designer,was confused by the relationship between audi and business,then a consumer would be more likely to be confused.
with respect to the fifth factor,we consider the similarities or differences between the predominant customers of the parties respective goods or services,and whether the marketing approaches employed by each party resemble each other.daddy junky music stores,at.the same group of,those interested in purchasing goods and services displaying the audi be the predominant customers to either audi or www.audisport.com s goods.in addition,both audi and used the internet in marketing.s imultaneous use of the internet as a marketing tool exacerbates the likelihood of confusion,given the fact that entering a web site takes little one click from a linked site or a search engine list thus,web surfers are more likely to be confused as to the ownership of a web site than traditional patrons of a store would be of a store ownership.paccar,at citation omitted.
as to the sixth factor,degree of consumer care,given the fact that the goods and services offered on website displayed the audi name and trademark,and the low cost of the items,consumers were unlikely to exercise a high degree of care when making purchases.internet users do not undergo a highly sophisticated analysis when searching for domain names.id.at citation omitted.we also recognize that customers exercise a lower degree of care when services or goods for sale are inexpensive.see daddy junky music stores,at for example,home buyers will display a high degree of care when selecting their real estate brokers,whereas consumers of are unlikely to employ much care during their purchases.here,the goods,shirts and hats,and services,such as email addresses,were relatively inexpensive and insignificant.therefore,it is unlikely that a customer would exercise a great deal of care before making a purchase from website.
with respect to the seventh factor,we have noted that t he intent of defendants in adopting their mark is a critical factor,since if the mark was adopted with the intent of deriving benefit from the reputation of the plaintiff,that fact alone may be sufficient to justify the inference that there is confusing similarity.elby big boy,at.we have further explained that intent need not be proved by direct evidence of intentional copying.intent may be inferred.
first,the use of a contested mark with knowledge of the protected mark at issue can support a finding of intentional copying second,the nature of the defendant use of the marks on its web sites,such as including the marks in its domain names,repeating the marks in watermarks,and mimicking the distinctive scripts of the marks,indicates an intent to create the impression that the web sites are sponsored or affiliated with the plaintiff.
here,used audi trademarks knowing that it appeared that he was intentionally copying the marks.in,when he registered www.audisport.com,was aware that audi used the trademarks audi,quattro,and the audi four ring logo.in fact,he emailed volkswagen of america asking if his registration of the domain name would cause any problems.however,the email bounced back to him,and did not take any further action in order to determine whether there were problems using www.audisport.com.further,thompson smith inquiries regarding rights to use the audi trademarks should have put on notice that there were issues with his website and the goods and services for sale.also,although received some form of permission from devin carlson and bob skal neither of whom actually had authorization to grant such permission,never received written permission.audi,d at.
contends that carlson and melissa grunnah gave him permission via emails that were legally binding.appellant br.at.even assuming arguendo that carlson and grunnah were authorized to give permission to use the trademarks,in order to create a legally binding contract by electronic means,michigan law requires that each party agree to conduct transactions electronically.comp.laws.there is no evidence in the record that carlson or grunnah agreed to create a legally binding contract via email authorizing to use audi trademarks.instead,it appears that the emails sent from carlson and grunnah to simply included press releases regarding new audi cars.these press releases were sent in the form of a mass email,and was but one person on the distribution list.audi has pointed out that nothing would have prevented from posting these press releases on his own personal website.however,went far beyond that.he somehow construed the phrase text and photos courtesy of audi ag contained in these audi press releases to give him permission to run www.audisport.com in the manner he did.while we should construe all facts and inferences in favor of on this summary judgment motion,argument that text and photos courtesy of audi ag somehow absolves him from liability for his commercial use of the audi trademarks is objectively unreasonable.we will not draw such unreasonable inferences.see willis roche biomedical laboratories,cir this standard does not allow,much less require,that we draw strained and unreasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant.emphasis in original.
with respect to paccar second factor in inferring a defendant intent to derive benefit from a plaintiff,defendant use of the also prevails.used counterfeit in other words,identical audi trademarks in the domain name and throughout the website such as in watermarks and wallpaper.see paccar,at.
the last factor,likelihood of expansion of product lines,need not be analyzed because the product lines of audi and www.audisport.com already overlap.id.
in light of these factors,we agree with the district court conclusion that there was a likelihood of confusion.
defenses to audi trademark infringement claim 
defends this claim on several grounds.as an initial matter,raises the defense that audi claim is barred by the statute of limitations.however,the lanham act does not contain a statute of limitations.rather,courts use the doctrine of laches to determine whether a suit should be barred.ford motor catalanotte,cir.
audi filed this suit on february.contends that he first posted content to www.audisport.com on june.when deciding whether a suit is under the doctrine of laches,a court should consider whether the owner of the mark knew of the infringing use whether the owner delay in challenging the infringement of the mark was inexcusable or unreasonable and whether the infringing user was unduly prejudiced by the owner delay.kellogg exxon,cir citing brittingham jenkins,cir.the district court judge correctly found that in this case,has presented no evidence demonstrating that audi knew of his infringing use and inexcusably failed to challenge it.audi,d at.in his appeal,has provided no additional evidence that audi delay was intentional or inexcusable.we also agree with the district court conclusion that was not unduly prejudiced because he was never actually authorized to use audi trademarks for a commercial purpose.id.
also defends on the ground that he had consent to use the trademarks.even if carlson,as a dealer,had permission to use audi trademarks,this agreement with audi did not give carlson the right to grant such permission to another party.therefore,did not have the right to profit from the goods carlson provided.further,as discussed above,nothing in the press releases sent to appeared to confer consent to use audi trademarks for commercial gain.website also stated that he had a signed agreement allowing usage of tradenames,even though no such agreement ever existed.
contends that any proof of consumer confusion is rebutted by a disclaimer on his website which stated,t his page is not associated with audi gmbh or audi usa in any way.first,such a disclaimer does not absolve of liability for his unlawful use of marks identical to audi trademarks.ford motor lloyd design,d,the principle that disclaimers are often ineffective is especially applicable when the infringer uses an exact replica of the relevant trademark.in addition,as we stated in paccar,
a n infringing domain name has the potential to misdirect consumers as they search for web sites associated with the owner of a trademark.a disclaimer disavowing affiliation with the trademark owner read by a consumer after reaching the web site comes too late.this initial interest confusion is recognized as an infringement under the lanham act.
paccar,at.further,any effect this disclaimer had in reducing confusion would likely be negated by the statement on the website contending that there was a signed agreement with audi.
also defends his actions on the ground that his w ebsite merely had hyperlinks to goods hats and shirts and email hosting services offered by champion audi,and that such h yperlinks create no liability for him.appellant br.at.however,even if intention was in fact which it does not appear to be,the issue is whether his actions had a commercial effect.we have stated that the proper inquiry is not one of intent if consumers are confused by an infringing mark,the offender motives are largely irrelevant.taubman webfeats,cir internal citations omitted.even minimal advertisements constitute use of the owner trademark in connection with the advertising of the goods,which the lanham act proscribes.id.further,the record shows that the url for the boutique and services webpage was www.audisport.com boutique.htm,which would likely lead a customer to believe that the goods were part of website.in addition,entirely separate from the merchandise,www.audisport.com made advertising space available to sponsors.thus,he was attempting to directly profit from audi good will.
also asserts a defense of fair use,which means that he used the mark for a purpose other than that for which the mark is typically used.the supreme court has held that once a plaintiff shows a strong likelihood of confusion,the defendant may offer evidence rebutting the plaintiff evidence,or simply raise the fair use defense.the court stated that all the defendant needs to do is to leave the factfinder unpersuaded that the plaintiff has carried its own burden on that point.kp permanent,lasting impression,d.even when we construe the facts in a light most favorable to,audi has shown that there is a clear likelihood of confusion based on use of the audi trademarks.has presented no evidence to rebut this finding.all mentions in his brief regarding his fair use defense is that he submitted an affidavit that illustrated his instances using the name audi as a descriptive term for source of audi racing,in disclaimers not associated with audi ag,in the news articles and to describe the pictures given to him.appellant br.at.this information is irrelevant,and fails to address the many commercial uses of www.audisport.com.thus,we find that under kp permanent,audi has carried its burden to disprove fair use,and defense fails.
trademark dilution 
dilution law,unlike traditional trademark infringement law is not based on a likelihood of confusion standard,but only exists to protect the rights a holder
