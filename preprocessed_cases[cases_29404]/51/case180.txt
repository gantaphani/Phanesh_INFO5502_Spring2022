on september,the plaintiffs filed a complaint in federal district court alleging trademark infringement,unfair competition,and dilution of marks under the lanham act,a,c cybersquatting under d unfair and deceptive trade practices under the tennessee consumer protection act,ann.common law trademark infringement and unfair competition and injury to business reputation and dilution of marks under ann.mcgill filed an answer on october,raising as affirmative defenses the first amendment,the commerce clause,laches,fair use,failure to state a claim,the fact that the trademarked terms are generic and that his use of similar terms do not cause confusion,and the assertion that the plaintiffs had lost their right to trademark protection by deviation of doctrine from the religion of seventh day adventism as it was originally formed.answer.
on september,mcgill filed a motion to dismiss.therein,he argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because it could not decide the issue without resolving an underlying dispute over religious doctrine.he also argued that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim because rfra renders trademark law inapplicable to him and because adventism is a religion and thus inherently generic and incapable of being trademarked.the district court denied the motion in full on may.it held that trademark law was applicable despite the free exercise clause,that mcgill had waived the rfra defense by failing to raise it in his answer,and that whether the trademarked terms are generic is a factual issue that could not be resolved on a motion to dismiss.
on october,the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment.on june,the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.the court determined that the trademarks for adventist and adventist had become incontestable under,meaning that they are presumptively valid and that mcgill had the burden of showing otherwise.the court concluded that mcgill could not overcome the presumption as to adventist,but that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to the genericness of adventist.the court further found that the plaintiffs bore the burden of establishing the validity of their sda mark but were not entitled to summary judgment on this point.the court then found that the plaintiffs had established that mcgill use of their marks was likely to cause confusion among the relevant audience.finally,the district court rejected all the defenses that mcgill raised in his answer.in sum,the district court granted the plaintiffs summary judgment on their infringement claims with respect to adventist but denied it with respect to adventist and sda.
during a may,telephone status conference,the parties agreed to mediate.the district judge referred the case to a magistrate judge,who on june,a week before the order issued scheduled the mediation for july.shortly before that date,mcgill lawyer indicated that mcgill would not attend the mediation.on july,mcgill lawyer filed a motion to amend the pretrial order to remove the mediation requirement because mcgill religious convictions will not allow him to compromise his faith.mot.to amend at doc.that same day,mcgill lawyer moved to withdraw.the district court granted the motion to withdraw and denied mcgill motion to amend,ordering the parties to reset the mediation and warning that failure to attend could result in dismissal or default judgment.the parties conferred with the magistrate judge office.new counsel for mcgill indicated that mcgill would not attend or allow counsel to attend.the plaintiffs requested a status conference,which was held on august.the district court again ordered the parties to schedule mediation and to certify to the court that they would attend.the parties scheduled the mediation for october.on september,the plaintiffs filed a certification expressing their intent to attend the conference,and defense counsel filed a certification indicating that mcgill would not attend.the magistrate judge cancelled the mediation,and the plaintiffs moved for default judgment due to mcgill repeated violation of the court order.on may,the district judge granted the motion.conference of adventists mcgill,wl.may.
mcgill then filed a notice of appeal and a motion to stay the district court injunction against his continued use of the marks in his promotional materials.the district court denied mcgill motion to stay and entered judgment.
ii.analysis 
mcgill appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss,the grant of partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs,and the entry of default judgment against him.as the plaintiffs point out,although mcgill appealed the order,he did not present argument regarding that order in his brief and has thus waived any argument that the order should not have been entered.see radvansky city of olmsted falls,cir.the failure to challenge the order,however,does not end our inquiry.a default judgment does not preclude review of whether the allegations in the complaint,if taken as true,were sufficient to state a claim and support a judgment of liability.united states conces,cir see also bank one of cleveland,abbe,cir.furthermore,it is not clear that the order superseded the order.thus,we review the district court denial of mcgill motion to dismiss and its partial grant of the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.in both cases,our review is de novo.autozone,tandy,cir bird parsons,cir.
in challenging those orders,mcgill makes four arguments the district court lacked jurisdiction the district court should have dismissed the case or denied summary judgment under rfra adventism is a religion and thus not eligible for trademark protection as a matter of law and there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the marks were generic and concerning the likelihood of confusion caused by mcgill use of the marks.
jurisdiction 
mcgill argues that the first amendment precluded the district court from exercising jurisdiction because the district court could not apply neutral principles of trademark law without resolving an underlying doctrinal dispute to wit,who are the true adventists.he argues in the alternative that we should create a prudential exception of sorts to relinquish jurisdiction in cases like the one at bar.
as this case involves the enforceability of rights,it makes sense to consider the supreme court precedents in the area of church property disputes.see maktab tarighe oveyssi shah maghsoudi,kianfar,cir.the supreme court has recognized that first amendment values are plainly jeopardized when church property litigation is made to turn on the resolution by civil courts of controversies over religious doctrine and practice.presbyterian church mary elizabeth blue hull mem l presbyterian church.but the court has also held that courts may apply neutral principles of law to resolve church property disputes.jones wolf.eldership of the churches of god church of god at sharpsburg.unlike in presbyterian church,in which property rights turned on whether a church had abandoned the tenets of the faith,this case does not require us to decide any issue of church doctrine.both the plaintiffs and mcgill believe that the second coming of christ is imminent and that the sabbath should be celebrated on saturday.their dispute concerns whether mcgill can use the plaintiffs marks to promote his church services and materials.plainly,the case can be resolved using the neutral principles of trademark law.
the ninth circuit case maktab is instructive.that case concerned a sufi order in which property rights,including the right to use certain trademarked names and symbols,were passed from one spiritual leader,known as the teacher,to the next.the order had splintered,and the two resulting sects disputed which was the true successor to the last teacher.the district court held that it had no jurisdiction to resolve a claim brought by one sect against the other,as that would require it to decide the doctrinal issue of proper succession.the ninth circuit reversed,holding that the district court can apply the regular factors that courts employ to determine infringement and that t he defendants can raise neutral defenses,such as prior use of the marks.maktab,at.like maktab,the instant case can be resolved based on trademark law,without addressing any doctrinal issues.trademark law will not turn on whether the plaintiffs members or mcgill and his congregants are the true believers 
anticipating the approach,mcgill asks us to create an exception to jurisdiction for situations in which there is religious use of intellectual religious property and the application of neutral principles could,in effect,decide a doctrinal dispute and deprive one party the right to the free exercise of its religion.appellant br.at.in support of his proposed rule,mcgill cites a set of cases involving the ministerial exception to statutes.the ministerial exception precludes subject matter jurisdiction over claims involving the employment relationship between a religious institution and its ministerial employees,based on the institution constitutional right to be free from judicial interference in the selection of those employees.hollins methodist healthcare,cir.in essence,mcgill asks the panel to create an analog to the ministerial exception under trademark law for litigants in his position.
we decline the invitation.the ministerial exception is a highly circumscribed doctrine.it grew out of the special considerations raised by the employment claims of clergy,which concern internal church discipline,faith,and organization,all of which are governed by ecclesiastical rule,custom,and law.hutchison thomas,cir.in fact,in blessing the ministerial exception,the hutchison panel distinguished its facts from church property cases.the panel acknowledged that the approach governed in church property cases,but emphasized that that approach had never been applied to the realm of clergy employment and discipline.id.it would be a perversion of the case law,and contrary to the jones line of cases,now to carve out an exception to the approach in property cases.
to sum up,the district court properly exercised jurisdiction over this case,and we do so now,as well.
mcgill claimed below that the enforcement of the plaintiffs trademarks would violate his free exercise clause rights because his religion mandates him to call his church creation seventh day adventist.he argues,in essence,that his religious beliefs require him to violate the law and that the enforcement of the law against him is therefore unconstitutional.
in employment division,department of human resources of oregon smith,the supreme court held that the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes or prescribes conduct that his religion prescribes or proscribes.id.at internal quotation marks omitted holding that state could deny unemployment benefits to drug users,including native americans who had ingested peyote for sacramental purposes.under smith,mcgill would have no defense to trademark law,which is neutral and generally applicable.in,however,congress enacted rfra to restore the test of sherbert verner,and wisconsin yoder,that smith had overruled 
a in general 
government shall not substantially burden a person exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,except as provided in subsection b of this section.
b exception 
government may substantially burden a person exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person 
is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and 
is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
in city of boerne flores,the supreme court held that the enactment of rfra,as applied to the states,exceeded congress remedial powers under of the fourteenth amendment.the court has since vindicated the application of rfra against the federal government.gonzales o centro espirita beneficente uniao do vegetal,upholding the grant of a preliminary injunction to potential targets of federal drug prosecution under rfra.
rfra would appear to trigger strict scrutiny in this case.for a party to assert rfra as a claim or a defense,governmental action must substantially burden,a religious belief rather than a philosophy or way of life,which belief is sincerely held.united states meyers,cir.so far,no one has questioned the sincerity of mcgill belief that god requires him to continue his infringing use of the plaintiffs marks.being compelled to stop could substantially burden his religious practice.see o centro espirita,at government conceded that application of controlled substances act to plaintiffs,who received communion through a sacramental tea containing a schedule i drug,would substantially burden a sincere exercise of religion.mcgill can not claim the benefit of rfra,however,because as we explain,the defense does not apply in suits between private parties 
this case presents an issue of first impression in this circuit whether rfra applies only in suits against the government or also in suits by private parties seeking to enforce federal law against other private parties.the text of the statute makes quite clear that congress intended rfra to apply only to suits in which the government is a party.sotomayor discussed the relevant provisions in a dissent in the second circuit 
two provisions of the statute implicitly limit its application to disputes in which the government is a party.section c states that a person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government emphasis added when read in conjunction with the rest of the statute,it becomes clear that this section reflects congress understanding that rfra claims and defenses would be raised only against the government.for instance,section b of rfra provides that where a law imposes a substantial burden on religion,the government must demonstrate that application of the burden is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest emphasis added.the statute defines demonstrate as meet ing the burdens of going forward with the evidence and of persuasion.where,as here,the government is not a party,it can not go forward with any evidence.in my view,this provision strongly suggests that congress did not intend rfra to apply in suits between private parties.
i recognize that according to rfra applicability section,the statute applies to all federal law.this provision,however,is not inconsistent with a finding that the statute does not apply to suits between private parties.read in conjunction with the rest of the statute,the provision simply requires courts to apply rfra to all federal law in any lawsuit to which the government is a party.
hankins lyght,cir sotomayor,dissenting footnotes omitted.we note further that congress repeatedly referred to government action in the findings and purposes sections of rfra.congress found that governments should not substantially burden religious exercise without compelling justification,that the regime had required that the government justify burdens on religious exercise,and that strict scrutiny was necessary for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.a emphases added.congress described rfra purpose as to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by government.b emphasis added.
rfra legislative history supports our view that congress did not intend the statute to apply against private parties.all of the examples cited in the senate and house reports on rfra involve actual or hypothetical lawsuits in which the government is a party.see.hankins,at sotomayor,dissenting.
the majority in hankins,however,saw things differently.it found rfra language broad enough to apply to an action by a private party seeking relief under a federal statute against another private party who claims that the federal statute substantially burdens his or her exercise of religion.id.at.for three reasons,we do not follow the hankins majority.first,as discussed above,rfra text does not support the hankins majority interpretation.second,the hankins majority limited its holding to the application of rfra federal laws that can be enforced by private parties and the government.that case concerned an action under the adea by a clergyman who had been forced into retirement.the adea claim could have been brought by the eeoc,and the majority sought to avoid disparate application of the statute based on who brings discrimination charges.id.there is no agency that can bring actions.third,a different panel of the second circuit already has expressed doubts about hankins determination that rfra applies to actions between private parties.rweyemamu cote,cir.that panel stated that we think the text of rfra is plain,credited judge sotomayor dissent,and concluded that rfra should not apply to purely private disputes regardless of whether the government is capable of enforcing the statute at issue.id.at.
meanwhile,the other two circuits to have reached the issue have held that rfra does not apply to suits between private parties.see tomic catholic diocese of peoria,cir calling the hankins decision unsound and explaining that rfra is applicable only to suits to which the government is a party worldwide church of god phila.church of god,cir it seems unlikely that the government action congress envisioned in adopting rfra included the protection of intellectual property rights against unauthorized appropriation.sutton providence joseph med,cir noting that congress did not specify that rfra applies to nongovernmental actors,as it typically does when intending to regulate private parties,and holding that private parties could not be considered state actors under rfra unless they acted jointly with government officials to violate rights.we now join their ranks.
whether adventism can be trademarked 
the existence and extent of trademark protection for a particular term depends on that term inherent distinctiveness.courts have identified four general categories of terms generic,descriptive,suggestive,and arbitrary or fanciful.bath body works,luzier personalized cosmetics,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if a mark primary significance is to describe a type of product rather than the producer,it is generic nartron stmicroelectronics,cir.a generic mark can not be protected as a trademark.leelanau wine cellars,black red,cir.mcgill argues that adventism refers to a religion,is therefore a generic term,and thus can not be trademarked 
mcgill argument is certainly logical terms that society understands to refer to a particular faith in general are generic,and no single party can prevent others from using them.see,christian science bd.of dirs.of the first church of christ,scientist evans,christian science is a religion and therefore a generic name not entitled to trademark mcdaniel mirza ahmad sohrab,n,holding that is a religion and that the use of word could not be enjoined because members of the same religion have an equal right to use the name of the religion new thought church chapin,a,denying injunction because plaintiffs claimed that new thought referred to a religion and they could not claim a monopoly of teaching this form of religious faith truth of uri,world church of the creator,cir church of the creator describes a christian denomination,not a religion,and is not generic spiritual assembly of the under the hereditary guardianship,spiritual assembly of the,enjoining defendants use of because the public has come
