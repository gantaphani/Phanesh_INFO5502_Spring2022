this case presents a novel trademark issue with regard to the internet along with several other more straightforward issues.interactive products corporation ipc brought this action alleging,among other things,federal and state claims of trademark infringement,false designation of origin,false advertising and trademark dilution.ipc claims arise primarily out of the fact that defendant mobile office solutions,maintains an internet web page that contains ipc trademark in its url ipc also complains about a particular message that appeared for about a year on web page regarding ipc trademarked product.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all of ipc claims,and ipc appeals with regard to certain of its claims.ipc also appeals the district court award of defendants attorneys fees and expenses incurred in opposing ipc motion to compel the depositions of defendants attorneys.also before this court is the motion of defendants mobile office enterprise moe and douglas mayer for sanctions against ipc for bringing a frivolous appeal as to them.
because the district court reached the correct result in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on all of ipc claims,we affirm that decision.we also affirm the district court decision regarding the magistrate judge award to defendants of expenses incurred in opposing plaintiff motion to compel.we deny defendants moe and mayer motion for sanctions against ipc.
relevant technology 
resolution of the legal issues presented in this case requires a basic understanding of the internet the internet is a global network of interconnected computers that allows individuals and organizations around the world to communicate and to share information with one another.the web,a collection of information resources contained in documents located on individual computers around the world,is the most widely used and part of the internet except perhaps for electronic mail.see united states microsoft.prevalent on the web are multimedia websites.a website consists of at least one,and often many interconnected,web pages.web pages are computer data files written in hypertext markup language html that contain information such as text,pictures,sounds,and audio and video recordings.web pages also usually contain connections hyperlinks to other web pages on the website and other websites altogether.
each website has a corresponding domain name,which is an identifier somewhat analogous to a telephone number or street address.see panavision int l,toeppen,cir.domain names consist of a a term or series of terms,followed by a domain,many of which describe the nature of the enterprise.domains include commercial,educational,and miscellaneous organizations.gov government,networking provider,and.mil military.see id.at.commercial entities generally use the domain,which also serves as a catchall domain.see id.a website domain name,signifies its source of origin and is,therefore,an important signal to internet users who are seeking to locate web resources.because of the importance of a domain name in identifying the source of a website,many courts have held that the use of another trademark within the domain name of a website can constitute a trademark violation.see,paccar telescan tech.llc,cir citing cases.
each web page within a website has a corresponding uniform resource locator url.htm,which consists of a domain name and a path.a path.htm merely shows how a website data is organized within the host computer files.
using a web browser,such as microsoft internet explorer,a cyber surfer may navigate the for,communicating with,and retrieving information from various websites.see microsoft,at.a specific website is most easily located by entering its domain name into the browser.see panavision,at.upon entering a domain name into the web browser,the corresponding website homepage will appear on the computer screen.sometimes,however,a web surfer will not know the domain name of the site he seeks.in that case,the surfer has two principal options to guess the domain name or utilize an internet search engine.
an internet user will often begin by guessing the domain name,especially if there is an obvious domain name to try.web users often correctly assume that the domain name of a particular company website will be the company name followed by.guessing domain names,however,is not always successful.the web surfer who assumes that will always correspond to the website of company x will sometimes be misled.see,panavision,at finding that defendant use of the website to post photographs of the city of pana,illinois,violated the trademark rights of panavision,international,
a web surfer second option when he does not know the domain name is to use an internet search engine.when a keyword is entered,the search engine processes it to generate a sometimes long list of web pages ideally relating to the entered keyword.each search engine uses its own algorithm to search for and arrange web pages in sequence,so the list of web pages that any particular set of keywords will bring up may differ depending on the search engine used.see niton radiation monitoring devices,d.search engines usually look for keywords in places such as domain names,actual text on the web page,and metatags metatags are hidden html code intended to describe the contents of the web page.on many search engines,the more often a term appears in the metatags of a particular web page,the more likely it is that the web page will be hit in a search for that keyword and the higher on the list of hits the web page will appear.see niton,d at.
ii.background facts 
the facts are largely undisputed.the principals in this case are mark comeaux,president of plaintiff interactive products corporation ipc,defendant brian lee,president of defendant mobile office solutions,and defendant douglas mayer,president of defendant mobile office enterprise,moe.each of the parties in this case is involved in either the manufacture or sale of portable computer stands for use in automobiles.the portable computer stands provide a means to secure a laptop computer in a moving vehicle and yet provide availability and convenience of use from the driver seat hopefully while the car is at rest.
in,mayer and comeaux ipc,through which they developed and sold a portable computer stand called the lap traveler.lap traveler is a federally registered trademark of ipc.defendant sells mobile computer accessories through its internet website.between and,sold the lap traveler on its website at the internet url.
in,comeaux and mayer had a disagreement,followed by a state court lawsuit in which comeaux sought dissolution of ipc.in december,comeaux and mayer entered into a settlement agreement to resolve comeaux dissolution petition.under the settlement agreement,comeaux agreed to purchase all of mayer shares of stock in ipc for.the agreement further provided that 
the parties agree that the right to use the lap traveler name and model designations,and the names and model designations of all other ipc products marketed at any time prior to the execution of the agreement,is and shall remain the exclusive property of ipc.mayer shall have no right to use these product names or model designations.
mayer,comeaux,and ipc shall all have the right to manufacture,market and sell products similar to or identical to the lap traveler products currently marketed by ipc,including but not limited to the lap traveler mayer shall not be entitled to use the lap traveler name or model designations in connection with such sales and marketing,although he and comeaux shall each be entitled to claim that they were jointly the inventor of lap traveler products.
the parties shall be free to compete with one another in the future,including solicitation,marketing and sales to any current or future clients or business prospects of ipc without restriction.the parties shall be free to use any vendors,manufacturing suppliers and subcontractors,commissioned or sales people currently employed by comeaux,ipc or mayer.
the terms of the settlement agreement do not require any party to keep the agreement confidential.
also in,the relationship between comeaux and lee,the president of,became strained.in january,comeaux terminated the business relationship between ipc and and instructed lee to remove references to the lap traveler from website.
after parting with comeaux and ipc,mayer,through moe,began manufacturing and selling a portable computer stand called the mobile desk.after comeaux instructed to cease selling the lap traveler,replaced the lap traveler on its website with the mobile desk.the mobile desk is now advertised and sold on the same web page from which formerly advertised and sold the lap traveler.the internet url for this web page remains.htm web page this web page is one of the web pages accessible from linked to website.
throughout,posted the following message the announcement,or slight variations,on its web page 
important announcement about the lap traveler product.
the original lap traveler was by doug mayer and his.they have split.
carries the redesigned and improved product 
the mobile desk 
mayer had provided lee with a copy of the settlement agreement between mayer and comeaux,and lee used the agreement as a guide in drafting the announcement.the announcement was removed from the website in december.
in august,comeaux performed several web searches on the internet using laptraveler as the keyword on various web search engines.the searches consistently resulted in showing web page as one of the listed hits.
iii.procedural history 
on september,ipc filed an complaint against lee,mayer and moe,asserting violations of the federal trademark act,the lanham act,the ohio deceptive trade practices act,and the common law of the state of ohio.counts i through v and count viii are related to use of the term laptraveler in the path of the url for web page and the allegedly misleading nature of the announcement.moe and mayer alleged liability under these counts is apparently premised on an agency or aider and abettor theory,although this theory is not clearly articulated in the complaint.counts vi and vii assert breach of contract claims based on mayer providing lee with a copy of the settlement agreement between mayer and comeaux.
more specifically,count i asserts a claim for infringement under the trademark act.count ii asserts a claim under the lanham act,for false designation of origin and for false or misleading advertising.count iii asserts a claim for trademark dilution under the lanham act,c.counts iv and v assert parallel state law claims for trademark infringement and false designation of origin under the ohio deceptive trade practices act,ohio revised code,and the common law of ohio.count vi appears to allege that mayer breached the settlement agreement by allowing to use the lap traveler trademark on its website.count vii alleges that lee,and moe induced mayer into breaching the settlement agreement.count viii alleges that defendants alleged improper use of the lap traveler trademark tortiously interfered with ipc existing and prospective business relationships.the complaint seeks injunctive relief along with compensatory and punitive damages.
after discovery ended,defendants and lee and defendants moe and mayer filed motions for summary judgment as to each count of the complaint.on april,the district court issued an order granting both motions in part,dismissing with prejudice ipc federal claims and parallel state claims and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over ipc remaining state law claims.ipc appeals only the grant of summary judgment on certain of its federal claims and parallel state claims.specifically,ipc appeals the grant of summary judgment on counts i,ii,iv and v of its complaint.
iv.analysis 
likelihood of confusion 
the touchstone of liability for trademark infringement is whether the defendant use of the disputed mark is likely to cause confusion among consumers regarding the origin of the goods offered by the parties.daddy junky music stores,big daddy family music center,cir.similarly,to succeed on a false designation of origin claim,a plaintiff must show that the false designation creates a likelihood of confusion.johnson jones,cir.furthermore,claims for trademark infringement and false designation of origin under the ohio deceptive trade practices act and ohio common law are subject to the same likelihood of confusion standards as their federal counterparts.see daddy junky music,at.therefore,to succeed on any of its trademark claims at issue in this appeal,ipc must show that the presence of its trademark in the path of web page is likely to cause confusion among consumers regarding the origin of the goods offered by the parties 
the district court found that ipc had failed to present evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact that consumers are likely to be confused by the presence of ipc trademark in the path of web page.therefore,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on ipc trademark claims.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see id.at.
in typical trademark cases,a court should determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists by examining and weighing the following factors the strength of the senior mark relatedness of the goods and services the similarity of the marks evidence of actual confusion the marketing channels used likely degree of purchaser care the intent of the defendant in selecting the mark and the likelihood of expansion of the product lines.id.at.the district court examined these eight factors in the present case.as this court has cautioned before,however,e ach case presents its own complex set of circumstances and not all of these factors may be particularly helpful in any given case.homeowners group,home marketing specialists,cir.the factors are only useful to the extent they assist in determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists.the ultimate question remains whether relevant consumers are likely to believe that the products or services offered by the parties are affiliated in some way.id.
in the usual trademark case,the defendant is using a mark to identify its goods that is similar to the plaintiff trademark.for instance,in daddy junky music,this court considered a case where the plaintiff sold musical instruments under the trademark,daddy junky music stores,while the defendant sold musical instruments from its retail store,big daddy family music center.the district court had determined that there was no likelihood of confusion between the marks of the parties,but this court reversed after weighing each of the eight factors and determining that there was a likelihood of consumer confusion.applying the eight factors is useful to determine likelihood of confusion in typical cases such as daddy junky music where there is not any question that the defendant is using the challenged mark to identify its goods.in such a case,it makes sense to consider such things as the similarity of the marks and the relatedness of the goods and services identified by those marks.
if,for instance,the present case involved a situation where and moe were selling a portable computer stand called the lap travel stand,then this would be a typical trademark case where the eight factors would be helpful in determining whether defendants use of this mark would likely cause confusion with ipc lap traveler trademark.in this case,however,the product defendants are selling is called the mobile desk,a trademark not at all similar to ipc lap traveler trademark.ipc,of course,is not challenging defendants use of the mark the mobile desk to identify their competing product instead,ipc is challenging the presence of its trademark,laptraveler,in the url path of the web page from which defendants are selling the mobile desk product 
therefore,in this case,there is a preliminary question about whether defendants are using the challenged mark in a way that identifies the source of their goods.if defendants are only using ipc trademark in a is,in a way that does not identify the source of a trademark infringement and false designation of origin laws do not apply.new kids on the block news america publishing,cir holding that infringement laws simply do not apply to a use of a mark.
the evidence shows that did not insert the mark laptraveler into the url of its web page while selling the mobile desk.when substituted the mobile desk product for the lap traveler product,it simply never changed the path name of its web page.answering a question about why laptraveler appears in the url,lee testified,because that the way my directory path was set up.the record does not indicate why did not change the path name of its web page once it stopped selling the lap traveler,but lee did testify that making such a change would be not terribly difficult.nevertheless,there is not any evidence in the record that left laptraveler in its url path intending to confuse or mislead anyone.the web page itself clearly and prominently marks the product being sold as the mobile desk.
the ultimate issue in this case,however,is not defendants intent,but whether the presence of laptraveler in the url path for web page is likely to cause confusion among consumers regarding the origin of the mobile desk product.stated another way,the issue is whether a consumer is likely to notice laptraveler in the path and then think that the mobile desk may be produced by the same company or a company affiliated with the company that makes the lap traveler.
to answer this question,it is helpful to review the basic objectives of trademark law,which the united states supreme court has described as follows 
in principle,trademark law,by preventing others from copying a mark,reduce s the customer costs of shopping and making purchasing decisions,for it quickly and easily assures a potential customer that this item with this made by the same producer as other similarly marked items that he or she liked or disliked in the past.at the same time,the law helps assure a producer that it and not an imitating competitor will reap the financial,rewards associated with a desirable product it is the ability of a mark that permits it to serve these basic purposes.

apparently,the present case marks the first time a circuit court has considered the issue of whether the presence of another trademark in the path of a url violates trademark law.several courts have considered the issue of whether the use of another trademark in one website domain name violates trademark law,and the answer is usually that such use is a violation.see,paccar,telescan tech.llc,cir holding that defendant use of domain names such as and violated plaintiff trademark rights in the marks peterbilt and kenworth brookfield communications,west coast entertainment,cir holding that the defendant use of the domain name violated plaintiff trademark rights in the mark moviebuff.but these courts have all relied on the fact that domain names usually signify source.as we recently stated,w ords in many domain names can and do communicate information as to the source or sponsor of the web site.paccar,at data concepts,digital consulting,cir merritt,concurring noting that a domain name does not always act as a trademark and stating,when a domain name is used only to indicate an address on the internet and not to identify the source of specific goods and services,the name is not functioning as a trademark.
the path of a url,however,does not typically signify source.the path merely shows how the website data is organized within the host computer files.see patmont motor werks,gateway marine,no,wl,at.typically,web pages containing paths are not reached by entering the full url into a browser instead,these secondary pages are usually reached via a link from the website homepage,which does not contain a path.for example,a consumer wanting to purchase a lap traveler product would probably not enter.htm into a browser.the consumer would more likely enter,which would bring the consumer to ipc website,which sells the lap traveler.if a consumer were generally looking for portable computer stand products,the consumer might look at a general retailer website,such as.if the consumer were to go to,the consumer would find a link entitled the mobile desk computer stand,which if would bring the consumer to web page selling the mobile desk.
the only two cases that address the issue presented here are patmont motor werks and paccar,telescan tech.llc,d,affirmed in part and vacated in part on a different ground by cir.in patmont motor werks,the district court for the northern district of california held that the defendant use of the plaintiff trademark in the path of one of the defendant web pages did not violate trademark law.wl,at.the plaintiff was a maker of small,motorized scooters,which it sold under the trademark.the defendant owned and operated a website,which resold the product from one of its secondary web pages.the plaintiff asserted that the presence of its trademark in the path of one of the defendant website web pages violated trademark law.the court,however,found as a matter of law that such use does not suggest the plaintiff sponsorship or endorsement,because the mark did not appear in the website domain name.id.the court went on to explain that a website domain name signifies its source of origin but that the path serves a different function and does not signify source of origin.id.
in paccar,the district court for the eastern district of michigan seemingly endorsed the practice of using another trademark in a web page path.in discounting the potential harm to the defendant of enjoining defendant use of the plaintiff trademarks peterbilt and kenworth in defendant websites domain names,the court cited patmont motor werks and suggested that the defendant could instead use the plaintiff trademarks in paths.d at citing patmont motor werks and stating,moreover,some authority suggests that the use of trademarks in the path of a url is acceptable.
ipc attempts to distinguish patmont motor werks and paccar by noting that each of these two cases involved a defendant who was reselling the plaintiff product on its website.therefore,ipc argues,the defendants in those cases were simply making references to trademarked goods offered for sale by the alleged infringer.neither of these two cases,however,relied on this fact in determining that the use of another trademark in a path is not a violation of trademark law.the district court in patmont motor werks based its finding in this regard solely on the fact that a path does not signify source and therefore can not act to confuse regarding source.wl at,and the district court in paccar simply cited patmont motor werks without further analysis.d at.furthermore,there is no basis to conclude that a defendant reselling of the plaintiff product on its web page would decrease the probability that the defendant path use of plaintiff trademark would confuse a consumer regarding the source of the website.if anything,it would seem that the defendant marketing of the plaintiff product on its web page would increase the likelihood that a consumer may think that the defendant is associated with the plaintiff.
because paths do not typically signify source,it is unlikely that the presence of another trademark in a path of a url would ever violate trademark law.for purposes of the present case,however,it is enough to find that ipc has not presented any evidence that the presence of laptraveler in the path of web page is likely to cause consumer confusion regarding the source of the web page or the source of the mobile desk product,which is offered for sale on the web page therefore,the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on ipc trademark claims.moreover,because there is not any evidence that the path of web page signifies source,it was unnecessary for the district court to examine the eight factors traditionally used to determine likelihood of confusion between two marks.
false advertising 
ipc claims that the announcement and the slight variations of the announcement that appeared on website throughout constitute actionable false advertising under the lanham act,a part of count ii,as well as ohio equivalent statute,a part of count iv.with regard to a claim for false advertising,this court has stated as follows
