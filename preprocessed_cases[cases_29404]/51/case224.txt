plaintiff mobile anesthesiologists chicago is a company based in chicago that contracts with medical offices to provide anesthesia services.defendant anesthesia associates of houston metroplex is a much smaller operation consisting of one doctor providing similar services in houston,texas.we refer to the parties as and.brought suit against in federal court in illinois claiming that violated the federal statute by registering a domain name confusingly similar to registered trademark.the district court dismissed the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction.
we affirm.first,we conclude that did not waive its personal jurisdiction defense by asking to delay a preliminary injunction hearing or by asking for expedited discovery to prepare for that hearing.second,we agree with the district court that mobile houston lacked the required minimum contacts with illinois to support personal jurisdiction there.mobile chicago relies principally on the inference that mobile houston expressly aimed its conduct in texas at harming in illinois.that inference is based on two inadequate connections between and illinois creation of a website accessible in illinois but aimed only at the houston market,combined with constructive notice of trademark via federal registration of that mark and receipt of letter.these contacts are not sufficient to establish that activities in texas were calculated to cause harm in illinois.
factual and procedural background 
has been operating in the chicago area since.the company has affiliated offices in other cities,including houston.the record does not reveal exactly when houston affiliate began operations,but alleges that it advertised its services in houston in.
in,registered the website,which it continues to operate today.also owns a federally registered trademark in the words mobile anesthesiologists.it obtained the trademark registration in.
was established by eric chan,its sole member,in.on august,chan registered the website.working under name,chan operates as an independent contractor providing anesthesia services for patients in clinics and medical offices throughout the houston area.
chan professional activities are limited entirely to the state of texas.he is licensed as an anesthesiologist by the state of texas but has not been licensed in any other state.he has never advertised his services other than on his website which offers anesthesia services in the greater houston area and provides a phone number and in a printed advertisement published in texas.
chan has visited illinois just once,on vacation in.he has never visited illinois for business,has never conducted business in illinois,and has no agent or offices in illinois.he has never attended events or performed duties in illinois for any of the professional associations to which he belongs.and although he surely knew there were anesthesiologists in illinois too,chan was unaware that,its trademark,or its website existed until he received a letter from its lawyer in december.there is no evidence that anyone else associated with mobile houston has any relevant contacts with illinois.
the district court dismissed suit for lack of personal jurisdiction.the court pointed out that lacks any meaningful contacts with illinois and that its website,though bearing a name similar to,is not directed at illinois in any way.the assertion that chan,sitting in houston,knew about and intended to do it harm in illinois,was entirely unsupported and an empty conclusion.
begins with the bold argument that waived its right to argue lack of personal jurisdiction when it asked for a continuance of the preliminary injunction hearing and an expedited discovery schedule.we disagree.
filed its lawsuit in the northern district of illinois on february,and requested a preliminary injunction to stop use of its domain name.the court scheduled a hearing for march.on march,counsel filed a motion to continue the preliminary injunction hearing,which chan could not attend because he was scheduled to see patients in texas that day.the motion also requested expedited discovery to prepare for the hearing.thirteen days later,on march,filed its rule b motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.
these preliminary actions do not come close to what is required for waiver or forfeiture.to waive or forfeit a personal jurisdiction defense,a defendant must give a plaintiff a reasonable expectation that it will defend the suit on the merits or must cause the court to go to some effort that would be wasted if personal jurisdiction is later found lacking.see,american patriot ins.agency,mutual risk management,cir rule b defense of improper venue was not waived or forfeited when defendant engaged in preliminary pretrial litigation activity plaintiff should have anticipated defendant objection,and defendant was not testing the wind or causing wasted motion by the court.faced with an impending preliminary injunction hearing and unable to produce its key witness,had the right to ask for more time to learn who was suing it and why without losing its right to object to personal jurisdiction.the district court did not err in proceeding to the substance of the personal jurisdiction defense.
iii.specific jurisdiction 
in a federal question case such as this one,a federal court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant if either federal law or the law of the state in which the court sits authorizes service of process to that defendant.omni capital international,rudolf wolff,federal court should look to a federal statute or to the state statute to determine defendant amenability to service,which is a prerequisite to its exercise of personal jurisdiction.the federal statutes on which is suing do not authorize nationwide service.is amenable to service and hence subject to personal jurisdiction only if it could be served in illinois under illinois law.illinois statute permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction if it would be allowed under either the illinois constitution or the united states constitution.see.comp.stat.c.we have held that there is no operative difference between these two constitutional limits.see tamburo dworkin,cir hyatt international coco,cir.we proceed to the question whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would violate federal due process.
under the supreme court interpretation of the fourteenth amendment due process clause,a defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction in a particular state only if the defendant had certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.international shoe washington,quoting milliken meyer.it is unconstitutional to force a defendant to appear in a distant court unless it has done something that should make it reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.burger king rudzewicz,quoting volkswagen woodson.the court has also framed the constitutional inquiry in terms of whether the defendant purposefully avails itself of the benefits and protections of conducting activities in the forum state.see hanson denckla.
personal jurisdiction can be general or specific,depending on the extent of the defendant contacts.see tamburo,at.does not assert,and the evidence does not support,a claim of general jurisdiction over in illinois,so must show that illinois can exercise specific jurisdiction over for this particular claim.specific personal jurisdiction is appropriate when the defendant purposefully directs its activities at the forum state and the alleged injury arises out of those activities.see,burger king,at.
did not purposefully direct its activities at illinois.it has formed no contracts in illinois and has had no physical presence there.points to the fact that chan is a member of two professional associations headquartered in illinois,but those are the kinds of fortuitous contacts that the supreme court has repeatedly held do not support personal jurisdiction where the contacts bear no relationship to the lawsuit.see,burger king,at volkswagen,at.simply has nothing to do with the state where it is being called to appear in court.
but contends that has done two things in
