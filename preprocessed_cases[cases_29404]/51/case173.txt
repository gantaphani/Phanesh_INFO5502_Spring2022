in this appeal,appellants najat mackie and freetown mini mart,challenge the district court order piercing freetown mini mart corporate veil and adding them both as judgment debtors in a turnover proceeding pursuant to.civ.prac.rem.code.for the following reasons,we vacate the district court orders as they apply to najat mackie and freetown mini mart.
factual and procedural background 
this appeal arises against the backdrop of an elaborate international scheme involving ali mackie one member of a michigan family that engaged in the manufacture,distribution,and sale of counterfeit cigarette papers primarily in the states of michigan,texas,and california.in march,bollor√©,north atlantic trading company,and north atlantic operating company collectively,appellees,as the holders and exclusive licensees of the trademarks,filed a lawsuit against various members of the mackie family the mackie defendants in the northern district of texas,alleging that the mackie defendants and their had violated federal copyright and trademark laws the district court issued a preliminary injunction in july,which temporarily suspended the counterfeiting operation.
in,as a result of raids pursuant to an ex parte seizure order issued by a california federal court,appellees discovered new evidence of continuing counterfeiting activity and filed a contempt motion against the mackie defendants in the northern district of texas.in july,after a contempt hearing in the district court and the entry of a contempt order,appellees received a final contempt judgment against the mackie defendants,including ali mackie,for million the final judgment the judgment was placed in escrow pursuant to a settlement agreement.
in february,after appellees became aware that the mackie defendants had not stopped their counterfeiting activities as required by the settlement agreement,appellees brought another contempt action against the mackie defendants and began to execute on the final judgment.even though he had wired large amounts of money overseas in connection with the counterfeiting scheme,by ali mackie had no assets with which to satisfy the judgment against him.while preparing to execute on the final judgment,in july,appellees took depositions of the mackie defendants and their families,including ali mackie and his mother,najat mackie.among other things,appellees learned for the first time that ali mackie worked and performed managerial duties for his mother gas station in detroit,freetown mini mart,freetown,in return for free room,board,and a leased car from his mother.the record reflects that,at all times relevant to these proceedings,najat mackie was freetown sole shareholder and resided in michigan,and freetown,a corner gas station and convenience store,conducted business only in michigan.najat mackie owned no land and entered into no contracts in the state of texas.
in an effort to collect on the final judgment against ali mackie,appellees filed in the united states district court for the northern district of texas an application for an order setting hearing regarding turnover relief against ali mackie and freetown mini mart,turnover application pursuant to.civ.prac.rem.code the texas turnover statute or the turnover statute,on november.specifically,they argued in the turnover application that freetown should be held liable for the final judgment against ali mackie because freetown was the alter ego of ali mackie on november,appellees personally served ali mackie and najat mackie in michigan with subpoenas duces tecum ordering them to appear and produce documents in a turnover relief hearing in the northern district of texas involving the final judgment against ali.although najat mackie and freetown appellants did not appear at the hearing on november,they were represented by counsel,who made an oral motion to dismiss appellees turnover application,which the court denied.appellants counsel also requested that the court adjourn to allow appellants time to appear personally before the court.the court granted the motion and adjourned until november.
appellants also failed to appear on november,but they were again represented by counsel who filed written motions to quash the subpoenas that had been served on najat mackie and ali mackie and a motion to dismiss the turnover application for lack of personal jurisdiction.after oral argument,the district court denied appellants motions,stating,when the mackies have shown up for a hearing,they have lied on each occasion,and i have found them in contempt of court for that.i do have jurisdiction over them,and i will enter the orders that plaintiffs request.although appellees turnover application requested the turnover only of freetown assets,the district court sua sponte ordered najat mackie assets turned over as well.to reach this outcome,the district court first had to reverse pierce freetown corporate veil after finding that freetown was ali mackie alter ego,and then pierce freetown veil again after finding that freetown was also najat mackie alter ego.
the district court did so by entering three orders,dated november.first,the court entered an order denying appellants motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and denying the motions to quash the subpoenas served on ali mackie and najat mackie order denying motion to dismiss and motion to quash.second,it entered an order piercing freetown corporate veil,finding that freetown was the alter ego of ali mackie and holding freetown and najat mackie liable for the million final judgment against ali mackie,adding both najat mackie and freetown to the contempt order and to the final judgment,awarding appellees costs and attorney fees,and ordering appellants and ali mackie assets frozen and turned over pursuant to the texas turnover statute turnover order.third,the court entered an order appointing a receiver for ali mackie and for appellants order appointing receiver.
appellants timely appealed all three of the district court orders,asserting that they did not have minimum contacts with texas such that personal jurisdiction was proper in the district court the texas turnover statute is an inappropriate vehicle through which to adjudicate the substantive rights of third parties the district court piercing of the corporate veil and finding of alter ego was erroneous and the district court erred when it denied their motion to quash the subpoena served on najat mackie.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court turnover judgment for abuse of discretion.beaumont bank buller.a court abuses its discretion when it acts in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner without reference to any guiding rules and principles.id.internal quotations and citation omitted.in making this determination,we review errors of law de novo.countrywide home loans,cir.
we review a district court decision to pierce the corporate veil for clear error.patin thoroughbred power boats,cir zahra spiritual trust united states,cir.
in entering the three orders at issue in this case,the district court erred to the extent that those orders apply to appellants because a court may not use a proceeding under the texas turnover statute as a vehicle to adjudicate the substantive rights of third parties and appellees did not make the required showing under texas law to establish that freetown was ali mackie alter ego 
the use of the texas turnover statute to pierce the corporate veil 
the texas turnover statute is a procedural mechanism that gives texas courts the power to satisfy a judgment by reaching the assets of a judgment debtor that can not be attached or levied by ordinary legal process in re hamel,antonio.texas courts construing the turnover statute have expressly and consistently held that it may be used to reach only the assets of parties to the judgment,not the assets of third parties.see,beaumont bank,at bay city plastics,mcentire,united bank metro plains overseas.moreover,the turnover statute is a purely procedural mechanism,and it is texas law that proceedings pursuant to the turnover statute may not be used to determine the substantive property rights of the judgment debtors or of third parties.maiz virani,cir holding that a district court may not use a turnover proceeding to adjudicate whether a corporation is an individual judgment debtor alter ego resolution trust smith,cir a proceeding to determine whether a transaction is fraudulent or otherwise to determine property rights of the parties is improper under the turnover statute,for the statute does not allow for a determination of the substantive rights of involved parties it is even more clear that a party not even before the court can not have its rights determined via the turnover proceeding.internal quotations and citation omitted cross,kieschnick johnston,antonio the turnover statute is purely procedural in nature the statute does not provide for the determination of the substantive rights of the parties.steenland.commerce bank ass n,reversing the trial court use of the turnover statute to make factual findings without a jury trial on whether there was nonexempt excess value in judgment debtor homestead even more specifically,texas courts have held that a turnover proceeding is not an appropriate vehicle through which to make an alter ego determination and that a separate trial on the merits of that issue is required before the alter ego can be subject to a turnover proceeding.maiz,at holding that the texas turnover statute can not be utilized to adjudicate the substantive property rights of the two debtor corporations in this case without a prior judicial determination which pierces their corporate veils united bank metro,at noting that the turnover statute is not designed to permit the turnover applicant to skip the trial on the merits in this case with respect to the alter ego issue and declare itself the winner.
moreover,these limitations on the reach of the turnover it applies only to judgment debtors and that it may not be used to adjudicate substantive spring from due process concerns consistent with those that underlie the requirement of personal jurisdiction,they prevent the original trial court from reach ing out and assum ing jurisdiction for trial purposes of potential lawsuits involving third parties.republic ins.millard.courts must respect such limitations on the turnover statute reach because 
w hether a turnover order is enforceable by a contempt order directed to a stranger to the lawsuit is a serious matter that goes to the very heart of due process.a turnover order typically issues without service of citation and effectively shifts the burden to the judgment debtor to account for assets to satisfy a judgment a turnover order that issues against a for property not subject to the control of the judgment debtor completely bypasses our system of affording due process.otherwise,a court could simply order anyone a bank,an insurance company,or the like alleged to owe money to a judgment debtor to hand over cash on threat of imprisonment.
ex parte swate,gonzalez,concurring.therefore,consistent with due process,a court may the district court attempted to do in this the turnover statute to adjudicate the rights and seize the assets of a third party who might not otherwise be amenable to jurisdiction in that court republic,at.
the district court thus erred as a matter of law by using the turnover proceeding to find that freetown was ali mackie alter ego and entering the order reverse piercing freetown corporate veil.see maiz,at united bank metro,at.texas law is clear that appellees must pursue their alter ego proceedings in a separate trial on the merits in the appropriate forum before using the turnover statute to reach appellants assets to satisfy the judgment against ali mackie.maiz,at united bank metro,at.
the alter ego determination 
appellees alternatively contend that,during the proceeding pursuant to their turnover application,the district court did hold a separate trial on the merits of the alter ego issue apart from the turnover proceeding.there is no evidence in the record that any part of this proceeding could be characterized as a separate trial,and thus our analysis could probably end with our above determination that the district court improperly used the turnover proceeding to adjudicate appellants substantive rights.however,out of an abundance of caution,we will proceed to address this argument.even if there had been a separate trial on the merits,appellees argument would still fail because the district court finding of alter ego and its reverse piercing of freetown corporate veil based on that finding were clear error.
under texas law,a lter ego applies when there is such unity between corporation and individual that the separateness of the corporation has ceased and holding only the corporation liable would result in injustice.castleberry branscum.this standard applies equally to cases such as this one,where it is alleged that holding only the individual liable would result in injustice.see zahra,at recognizing that courts can reverse pierce a corporation veil based on a finding of alter ego amer.petroleum exchange,lord.worth allowing creditors to reach corporate assets to satisfy an individual debtor liability where the debtor owned the majority of the stock and treated the corporation as his alter ego.to determine whether the alter ego doctrine applies,a court considers the following factors 
the total dealings of the corporation and the individual,including the degree to which corporate formalities have been followed and corporate and individual property have been kept separately,the amount of financial interest,ownership and control the individual maintains over the corporation,and whether the corporation has been used for personal purposes.
permian petroleum petroleos mexicanos,cir see also castleberry,at.
the great weight of texas precedent indicates that,for the alter ego doctrine to apply against an individual under this test,the individual must own stock in the corporation.permian petroleum,at texas courts will not apply the alter ego doctrine to directly or reversely pierce the corporate veil unless one of the alter egos owns stock in the other.zahra,at holding that a finding of unity between the individual and the corporation alone can not establish an alter ego relationship under texas law,because appellants are not direct shareholders of the corporation castleberry,at stating that,to be considered a corporation alter ego,an individual must have ownership and control emphasis added lucas texas,same patterson wizowaty,noting that there is no texas authority for the proposition that an individual can be held personally liable under the alter ego doctrine when he owns none of the outstanding stock of the corporation.
in the instant case,the district court made no findings that ali mackie owned stock in freetown,and the record reflects that appellees offered no evidence of such ownership.rather,the record shows that,while ali mackie performed managerial duties and held a position on freetown board of directors,najat mackie was the sole shareholder of freetown.appellees do not even argue before this court that they provided affirmative evidence to the district court to show that ali mackie owned stock in freetown instead,they merely assert that ali mackie alleged lack of stock ownership was not proven by appellants.appellees thus rely exclusively on ali mackie managerial control of freetown to support their case that freetown is ali mackie alter ego,which,standing alone,is insufficient under texas law to support an alter ego finding id.
in the alternative,appellees argue that the court could have pierced the corporate veil via the sham to perpetrate a fraud theory.see castleberry,at.this theory applies if recognizing the separate corporate existence would bring about an inequitable result.id.even if the district court had expressly made such a finding which it did not,it still would not suffice to disregard the corporate fiction in this instance because the court had to reverse pierce the corporate veil to reach freetown corporate assets.although the sham to perpetrate a fraud theory may provide a basis for disregarding the corporate fiction,a reverse piercing case requires the creditor to establish an alter ego relationship between the individual debtor and corporation in order to treat them as one and the same.zahra,at emphasis added citing zisblatt zisblatt.worth dillingham dillingham.worth amer.petroleum exchange,at.we therefore also decline to uphold the district court veil piercing based on this theory.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the district court order denying motion to dismiss and motion to quash turnover order and order appointing receiver to the extent that they apply to appellants.the motion for judicial notice carried with the case is denied.
the record at times refers to the mackie family as the makki family for the sake of consistency,we will use a uniform spelling throughout.
the mackie defendants did not include current appellants najat mackie or freetown mini mart,the gas station that she owned.ali mackie,who is najat mackie son,was added as a defendant in.ali mackie is not an appellant in the current proceeding because his appeal was dismissed for want of prosecution on may.
the mackie defendants,including ali mackie,were jointly and severally liable for the judgment amount.neither najat mackie nor freetown mini mart,was named as a judgment debtor.
it is undisputed that the district court had jurisdiction over judgment debtor ali mackie arising from his counterfeiting activities in dallas it therefore had the authority to order turnover relief against him.because freetown was neither a defendant nor a judgment debtor in the original contempt action,however,appellees attempted to reach its assets to satisfy the final judgment against ali mackie by obtaining an order disregarding freetown corporate fiction.
additionally,we note that even if the district court had made a procedurally and substantively proper finding that freetown was ali mackie alter ego,appellants were never served with a summons as required by.to hale a defendant into federal court.instead,appellants were served only with a subpoena duces tecum commanding them to appear and produce documents at the turnover proceeding.the district court adjudication of appellants substantive rights without valid service of process was improper.see.attwell lasalle nat.bank,cir it is axiomatic that in order for there to be in personam jurisdiction there must be valid service of process.see also adams alliedsignal aviation avionics,cir holding that,where a defendant is served improperly,the district court lack s jurisdiction over that defendant whether or not the defendant had actual notice of the lawsuit david siegel,supplementary practice commentaries,rule,federal rules of civil procedure,at west a summons is process because its service subjects the person served to the court jurisdiction,which is necessary to validate a judgment that the court might render against that person.a subpoena is also process,again in the sense of obtaining jurisdiction over the person served with it,but the subpoena acts only to exact testimony or obtain some document or other physical object from that person.however,this fact came to light for the first time at oral argument.neither party briefed this precise issue,and appellants did not assign it as error on appeal therefore,we will not dispose of this case on this ground alone.see ins.of ireland,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d noting that,unlike jurisdiction,which the court must consider sua sponte,b ecause the requirement of personal jurisdiction represents first of all an individual right,it can,like other such rights,be waived.in mcdonald mabee,the court indicated that regardless of the power of the state to serve process,an individual may submit to the jurisdiction of the court by appearance see also united states fagan,cir we do not search the record for unassigned error,and contentions not raised on appeal are deemed waived.
the texas turnover statute,in relevant part,provides.collection of judgment through court proceeding a a judgment creditor is entitled to aid from a court of appropriate jurisdiction through injunction or other means in order to reach property to obtain satisfaction on the judgment if the judgment debtor owns property,including present or future rights to property,that can not readily be attached or levied on by ordinary legal process and is not exempt from attachment,execution,or seizure for the satisfaction of liabilities.b the court may order the judgment debtor to turn over nonexempt property that is in the debtor possession or is subject to the debtor control,together with all documents or records related to the property,to a designated sheriff or constable for execution otherwise apply the property to the satisfaction of the judgment or appoint a receiver with the authority to take possession of the nonexempt property,sell it,and pay the proceeds to the judgment creditor to the extent required to satisfy the.civ.prac.rem.code.
appellees counter that language in some cases indicates that texas courts have begun to read the turnover statute as authorizing courts to determine the substantive property rights of third parties as an aid to enforcing judgments under the statute.see,schultz fifth judicial dist.court of appeals at dallas,abrogated by in re sheshtawy,stating that the turnover statute authorizes the trial court to order affirmative action by the judgment debtor and others to assist the judgment creditor in subjecting such property to satisfaction of the underlying judgment emphasis added.although this language might reflect uncertainty as to how aggressive trial courts can be in enforcing turnover orders which affect the rights of debtors,maiz,at referring to schultz,it does not undermine the above cases that have expressly held that the turnover statute is not a vehicle to adjudicate substantive property rights.see id.
appellants objected to lack of personal jurisdiction in the district court,arguing that they lacked sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state such that haling them into a texas court did not comport with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.the district court overruled this objection,stating only,i do have jurisdiction over them,and i will enter the orders that plaintiffs request.although appellants extensively briefed this aspect of the personal jurisdiction issue before this court,and their objection below preserved the issue for appeal,we need not get into the finer points of this debate because it is subsumed in our discussion of the district court improper use of the turnover statute.appellees do not argue that appellants themselves had sufficient minimum contacts to be amenable to personal jurisdiction in a texas court instead,they argue that,because the district court had personal jurisdiction over ali mackie,it had personal jurisdiction over appellants via the alter ego theory.see patin,at noting that federal courts have consistently acknowledged that it is compatible with due process for a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over an individual or a corporation that would not ordinarily be subject to personal jurisdiction in that court when the individual or corporation is an alter ego or successor of a corporation that would be subject to personal jurisdiction in that court.as discussed above,a turnover proceeding can not be used to establish personal jurisdiction over a party not already amenable to personal jurisdiction in that court,which is precisely what appellees attempted to accomplish in their request for turnover relief.see republic,at.
this assertion is obviously insufficient to support a finding of stock ownership because appellees,not appellants,had the burden of proof on each element of the alter ego issue.see torregrossa szelc,goldstein mortenson.
appellees maintain that stewart stevenson,provides support for their contention that stock ownership is not necessary because the court stated that alter ego can be proven through financial interest,ownership,or control of the corporation.id.emphasis added.however,appellees argument that the court use of the disjunctive in stewart suggests that alter ego may be shown through control absent ownership mischaracterizes that case holding and is inconsistent with the texas supreme
