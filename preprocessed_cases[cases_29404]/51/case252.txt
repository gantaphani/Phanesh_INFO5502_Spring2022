in the most common type of suit for trademark infringement,the plaintiff complains that the defendant is passing off his inferior product as the plaintiff.but here we have the converse case of reverse passing off,in which the plaintiff complains that the defendant is trying to pass off the plaintiff product as the defendant.illinois high school ass gte vantage,cir sands,taylor wood quaker oats,cir a h sportswear,victoria secret stores,cir sterling drug,bayer ag,cir.why would anyone want to do such a thing one reason might be to obliterate the plaintiff corporate identity and prevent him from entering new markets,where the defendant,having appropriated the plaintiff trademark,would claim that the plaintiff was the infringer.such would be a case of deliberate reverse passing off,and terms like passing off and reverse passing off are sometimes reserved for deliberate efforts to confuse the consuming public,but either form of confusion can be actionable without proof of intent to confuse.
the trademark infringement claim is federal,and there is also a claim for false advertising,also under the lanham act,plus several claims governed by illinois law,including one for product disparagement.all the claims were rejected on summary judgment.
the disappointed plaintiff is peaceable planet.like the defendant,the much larger and better known ty there is no comma in ty name,but we have left it in the name as it appears in the caption because that is what it is called in the complaint,peaceable planet makes plush toys in the shape of animals,filled with materials to give the toys a soft and floppy feel.ty plush toys are,of course,the famous beanie babies.
in the spring of,peaceable planet began selling a camel that it named niles.the name was chosen to evoke egypt,which is largely desert except for the ribbon of land bracketing the nile.the camel is a desert animal,and photos juxtaposing a camel with an egyptian pyramid are common.the price tag fastened to niles ear contains information both about camels and about egypt,and the egyptian flag is stamped on the animal.
a small company,peaceable planet sold only a few thousand of its camels in.in march of the following year,ty began selling a camel also named niles.it sold a huge number of its niles two million in one this suit.the district court ruled that niles,being a personal name,is a descriptive mark that the law does not protect unless and until it has acquired secondary meaning,that is,until there is proof that consumers associate the name with the plaintiff brand.peaceable planet did not prove that consumers associate the name niles with its camel.
the general principle that formed the starting point for the district court analysis was unquestionably sound.a descriptive mark is not legally protected unless it has acquired secondary meaning.e,f two pesos,taco cabana,d ty perryman,cir platinum home mortgage platinum financial group,cir abercrombie fitch hunting world,cir.an example is all bran.the name describes the product.if the first firm to produce an cereal could obtain immediate trademark protection and thereby prevent all other producers of cereal from describing their product as all bran,it would be difficult for competitors to gain a foothold in the market.they would be as if speechless.had peaceable planet named its camel camel,that would be a descriptive mark in a relevant sense,because it would make it very difficult for ty to market its own would be satisfactory to have to call it dromedary or bactrian.
although cases and treatises commonly describe personal names as a subset of descriptive marks,perini perini construction,cir marker int l debruler,cir,furs,cir callmann on unfair competition,trademarks monopolies ed,it is apparent that the rationale for denying trademark protection to personal names without proof of secondary meaning ca be the same as the rationale just sketched for marks that are descriptive in the normal sense of the word.names,as distinct from nicknames like red or shorty,are rarely descriptive.niles may evoke but it certainly does not describe a camel,any more than pluto describes a dog,bambi a fawn,garfield a cat,or charlotte a spider.in the tom and jerry comics,tom,the name of the cat,could be thought descriptive,but jerry,the name of the mouse,could not be.so anyone who wanted to market a toy camel,dog,fawn,cat,or spider would not be impeded in doing so by having to choose another name.
the reluctance to allow personal names to be used as trademarks reflects valid concerns three such concerns,to be precise,but they are distinct from the concern that powers the rule that descriptive marks are not protected until they acquire secondary meaning.one of the concerns is a reluctance to forbid a person to use his own name in his own business.sardi restaurant sardie,cir taylor wine bully hill vineyards,cir mccarthy on trademarks unfair competition ed waterman modern pen.holmes,safe hall safe.holmes.supposing a man named brooks opened a clothing store under his name,should this prevent a second brooks from opening a clothing store under his own identical name even though consumers did not yet associate the name with the first brooks store it should not.abraham zion lebow,cir creager russ togs,d w food graham,d,continente continente,aff,cir scott paper scott liquid gold,cir johnson son,johnson,cir,compare brooks brooks clothing of california.secondary meaning acquired by brooks brothers decision supplemented,and aff,cir.
another and closely related concern behind the rule is that some names are so as smith,jones,schwartz,wood,and jackson that consumers will not assume that two products having the same name therefore have the same source,and so they will not be confused by their bearing the same name.mccarthy on trademarks unfair competition,supra,restatement third of unfair competition,comment e scott paper scott liquid gold,supra,at and johnson son,johnson,supra,at.if there are two bars in a city that are named steve,people will not infer that they are owned by the same steve.
the third concern,which is again related but brings us closest to the rule regarding descriptive marks,is that preventing a person from using his name to denote his business may deprive consumers of useful information.maybe steve is a neighborhood figure.if he ca call his bar steve because there is an existing bar of that name,he is prevented from communicating useful information to the consuming public.mccarthy on trademarks unfair competition,supra,basile,basile,charles donnelly,donnelly.
the scope of a rule is often and here limited by its rationale.or,to make the same point differently,one way of going astray in legal analysis is to focus on the semantics of a rule rather than its purpose.case might say that a personal name could not be trademarked in the circumstances of that case without proof of secondary meaning.case might say that personal names can not be trademarked without proof of secondary meaning but might leave off the qualifications implicit in the circumstances of the case.and then in case the court might just ask,is the trademark at issue a personal name as we observed in am int l,graphic management associates,cir,rules of law are rarely as clean and strict as statements of them make them seem.so varied and unpredictable are the circumstances in which they are applied that more often than not the summary statement of a terse formula that judges employ as a necessary shorthand to prevent judicial opinions from turning into better regarded as a generalization than as the premise of a syllogism.the rule that personal names are not protected as trademarks until they acquire secondary meaning is a generalization,and its application is to be guided by the purposes that we have extracted from the case law.when none of the purposes that animate the personal name rule is present,and application of the rule would impede rather than promote competition and consumer welfare,an exception should be recognized.and will be for we find cases holding,very with inescapable implications for the present the rule does not apply if the public is unlikely to understand the personal name as a personal
