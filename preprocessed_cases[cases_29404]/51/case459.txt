oakville hills cellar,oakville,doing business as dalla valle vineyards,appeals from the decision of the united states patent and trademark office pto trademark trial and appeal board the board dismissing its opposition to an application filed by georgallis holdings,llc georgallis to register a mayari mark for use on wine.see oakville hills cellar,georgallis holdings,llc,wl july,opinion.because substantial evidence supports the board finding that oakville registered mark maya and georgallis mark mayari are sufficiently dissimilar,we affirm.
background 
georgallis filed an application at the pto,seeking to register the mark mayari in standard characters for use on wine in international class.oakville opposed the registration,alleging that georgallis mark would likely cause confusion with oakville previously registered and used mark maya in typed form,which is equivalent to standard characters,also for use on wine in international class.opinion at.
the parties argued,and the board evaluated,the following dupont factors the similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance,sound,connotation,and commercial impression the first dupont factor the similarity or dissimilarity of the goods as described in an application or registration or in connection with which a prior mark is in use the second dupont factor the similarity or dissimilarity of trade channels the third dupont factor the conditions under which and buyers to whom sales are made the fourth dupont factor the fame of the prior mark similar marks in use on similar goods the sixth dupont factor the absence of actual confusion the right to exclude others from use the extent of potential confusion and other probative facts,here,federal labelling requirements applicable to wine.id.at see also in re dupont de nemours,ccpa listing factors relevant to the likelihood of confusion determination.
the board found that the second,third,and fourth dupont factors favored a finding of likelihood of confusion,opinion at,but that the first dupont factor favored a finding of no likelihood of confusion,id.at.the board also found the remaining dupont factors that it analyzed to be neutral.id.at.
specifically,for the second dupont factor,the board found the goods at issue to be identical,despite a substantial difference in price and other differences in the specific nature of the wines sold by oakville and georgallis.id.at.the board reasoned that i n the context of an opposition proceeding,the question of registrability of an applicant marks must be decided on the basis of the identifications of goods set forth in the application and registration at issue.id.because georgallis has requested a registration applicable to all kinds of wine in all price ranges,and because oakville registration covers use of its mark on all kinds of wine,the board found the second dupont factor to weigh in favor of a finding of likelihood of confusion.id.likewise,the board found the third and fourth dupont factors,namely,the similarity of trade channels and the sophistication of buyers,to weigh in favor of a finding of likelihood of confusion.id.at.
turning to the first dupont factor,the similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in appearance,sound,connotation,and commercial impression,the board found that the marks at issue,maya and mayari,are visually similar only in part.id.at.the board noted that maya and mayari share the initial four letters.id.at.but the board found no reason to perceive any separation,visual or otherwise,between the maya and ri portions of mayari because t he letters ri,alone,have no relevant meaning,providing no reason for a customer to view the mark logically as maya plus ri,rather than as a single unitary expression.id.the board also rejected oakville argument that the bottle label bearing the mark mayari will inevitably appear to read maya at certain orientation relative to an observer,reasoning that the likelihood of such a mistake remains a matter of speculation,absent evidence regarding the occurrence or regularity of mistakes of this sort.id.
as to sound,the board found nothing in the record to indicate how mayari would be pronounced.id.while acknowledging that maya could be pronounced the same in those marks,the board consider ed the possibility that mayari might be pronounced with the emphasis on its second or third syllables,and that the yar syllable might be salient.id.the board thus found that no evidence show ed that the marks would be pronounced alike,and they may well be pronounced quite differently.id.at.
regarding meaning,oakville argued that both marks are female given names and the names of goddesses.id.at.in particular,oakville contended that maya is a female name of latin origin and the name of a hindu goddess,whereas mayari is a female name of filipino origin and the name of a filipino goddess.id.oakville also presented evidence to show that mayari appears on an internet list of filipino names under the rubric of gods,goddesses and deities of the philippines and on certain websites that discuss tagalog myths.id.
but the board was not persuaded that customers would be aware of the more esoteric meanings of the marks.id.at.rather,the board agreed with georgallis and found that most customers would likely perceive maya as a female personal name or the name of the civilization and perceive mayari as a coinage without meaning.id.the board reasoned that customers would likely find the term maya to be somewhat familiar,while finding mayari unfamiliar.id.overall,the board found that the marks create significantly different commercial impressions.id.the board therefore found the first dupont factor to weigh against a finding of likelihood of confusion.id.
for the sixth dupont factor,similar marks in use on similar goods,georgallis submitted registrations and applications for the registration of marks for beverages,mostly beverages other than wine.id.at.but the board gave little weight to that evidence,reasoning that registrations are not evidence that the marks are in use.id.the board thus found this factor to be neutral.id.
balancing the relevant dupont factors,the board noted that the parties goods are identical and would travel through the same trade channels to the same classes of customers,some of whom would exercise no more than an ordinary degree of care in selecting the goods but that the marks are visually similar only in part,are only possibly similar in their pronunciation,and would likely be perceived to have different meanings and overall commercial impressions.id.at.the board therefore concluded that the marks are sufficiently different that confusion is not likely.id.accordingly,the board dismissed oakville opposition.
oakville timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction under a b.
discussion 
we review the board legal conclusions without deference and its factual findings for substantial evidence.in re pacer,fed.cir.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla and such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.quoting consol.edison nlrb.
likelihood of confusion is a question of law based on underlying findings of fact.in re chatam int l,fed.cir.we assess a likelihood of confusion based on the factors set forth in dupont.at.the likelihood of confusion analysis considers all dupont factors for which there is record evidence but may focus on dispositive factors,such as similarity of the marks and relatedness of the goods.herbko int l,kappa books,fed.cir.quoting han beauty,fed.cir.
oakville argues that the board finding of insufficient similarity between maya and mayari is unsupported by substantial evidence.according to oakville,the board overlooked record evidence of the marks similarities in appearance,pronunciation,meaning,and overall commercial impression.specifically,oakville argues that maya dominates both marks,and that the suffix ri in mayari is of minor import as a distinguishing element,particularly with the registered mark maya entirely subsumed within the leading portion of mayari,which could cause confusion between oakville maya wine and georgallis mayari wine.oakville contends
