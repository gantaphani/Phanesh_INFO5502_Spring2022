background 
factual background 
in the late,the appellee jerry goldstein,steven gold,and eric burdon,the former lead singer of a british band known as the animals,formed far out productions,far out music,and far out management,collectively,the far out entities.in january,goldstein,gold,and burdon met with members of a band known as the night shift,whose members included the appellants,to discuss forming a band.the parties agreed to form a band known as eric burdon and war.
on june,the group performed commercially for the first time at a nightclub known as mother lizard ball in san bernardino,california.the band began production of its first album,entitled eric burdon declares war,soon afterward,and the album was released in march.the album became very successful,and the original members of the band eventually signed exclusive recording and publishing agreements with the far out entities.
burdon eventually lost interest in the group.goldstein then decided to produce a second album with the musicians who had previously been burdon band.according to goldstein,he decided to permit the group to use the name war on the album.
a long series of lawsuits and settlements soon followed.in,the members individually signed a set of contracts with the far out entities,including an agreement that transferred ownership of the trademark war to far out productions.on july,soon after executing those contracts,far out productions filed an application for the service mark war with the united states patent and trademark office pto.the pto issued trademark registration to far out productions on september.
b.the florida judgment 
in november,four of the five remaining original members of the band,including brown and scott,sued the far out entities,gold,and goldstein in florida state court.the appellants alleged that the far out entities had breached the contracts and that the far out entities had fraudulently secured the agreements by promising the appellants that the appellants would retain ownership of the trademark.brown later voluntarily dismissed himself from the action.in an affidavit allegedly filed with the florida court,brown indicated that the suit was without merit and was filed fraudulently in order to terminate the agreements.meanwhile,the far out entities were in deep financial trouble.far out productions and goldstein filed for bankruptcy under chapter on june.
on october,the florida trial court entered an order and a partial final judgment in favor of the appellant scott and the band members.the court deemed as established the material allegations of the complaint,including that the trademark war was procured by fraud.however,the court noted that its orders did not impact upon far out productions in a manner inconsistent with the federal bankruptcy code.in a final judgment entered on january,the court also noted that the claims against goldstein and far out productions were severed by virtue of the appellees pending bankruptcies.
proceedings after the florida judgment and before the present suits 
in,the appellant scott and other band members filed a petition for cancellation of far out productions mark war with the pto.that proceeding was halted due to the bankruptcy stay.meanwhile,in,the appellees licensed brown to perform publicly as war.when the appellees learned that scott and some of the other band members were also performing as war,the appellees applied to the bankruptcy court for permission to bring suit to enforce the trademark.after receiving permission to bring suit,far out productions filed an action for trademark infringement that was nearly identical to its present complaint.
shortly after the suit was filed,far out productions entered into a global settlement with the appellants and the other band members.on april,each of the band members signed written agreements that agreed to dismiss with prejudice any and all lawsuits,even if the lawsuit had been reduced to a final judgment.the contracts also reaffirmed far out productions exclusive ownership in the name war.scott also eventually executed joint stipulations to dismiss with prejudice and vacate the florida judgment.
on august,goldstein filed an incontestability affidavit with the pto on behalf of far out productions.the affidavit declared that far out productions was the owner of the mark and that the mark had been in continuous use for five consecutive years.the declaration also indicated that there had been no final decision adverse to the registrant claim to ownership of the mark and that there were no proceedings pending in any court.
d.the procedural history of the present suits 
from to,the parties intermittently attempted to work out an arrangement under which the band members would perform using the name war,but those efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.on february,far out productions filed the present suit against the appellant scott and the other band members,alleging unfair competition and trademark infringement.far out productions later amended the complaint to add brown as a defendant.
in response to far out productions complaint,scott filed a counterclaim against far out productions and goldstein alleging fraud,trademark infringement,and conversion.brown filed a direct action against the appellees seeking to cancel the trademark registration,to have ownership of the trademark returned to the appellants,and to obtain damages for copyright infringement and breach of contract.
on march,scott moved for summary judgment on far out productions complaint on two grounds that the florida judgment precluded the appellees from relitigating the ownership of the trademark and that the appellees failure to disclose the florida judgment in the incontestability affidavit rendered the affidavit false and the trademark registration invalid.the district court denied scott motion,finding that there were triable issues of fact as to whether the florida judgment applied to far out productions and goldstein.
on february,the appellees filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court held a hearing on march and,and granted the appellees motion.on june,the district court issued a judgment and a permanent injunction,finding that far out productions was the sole owner of the registered trademark war and that the appellants had infringed upon the mark.
on june,the appellants filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a and a motion to amend the judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,claiming that there was newly discovered evidence and that the appellees counsel had submitted false testimony to the court.on august,the district court heard oral argument and denied the motion.in a written order entered on august,the court observed that much of the evidence the appellants presented in their motion was already before the court at the summary judgment hearing.the court regarded the appellants evidence of misconduct and false testimony as unconvincing and found that the appellants new evidence was procedurally and substantively defective.
ii.standard of review 
a.the summary judgment orders 
the ninth circuit reviews a district court summary judgment order de novo.see robi reed,cir,cert.denied,d.accordingly,the appellate court review is governed by the same standard used by the district court under federal rule of civil procedure c.see meade cedarapids,cir.the appellate court must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.see lopez smith,cir en banc.an issue is genuine only if there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable fact finder to find for the party.see anderson liberty lobby,d.a fact is material if the fact may affect the outcome of the case.see id.at.
b.the motion for a new trial or to amend the judgment 
a district court denial of a motion for a new trial or to amend a judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see de saracho custom food,cir.standard for a motion for a new trial,cert.denied,d defenders of wildlife bernal,cir standard for a motion to amend a judgment.to establish that a district court abused its discretion in denying such a motion based on newly discovered evidence,the movant must show that the evidence was discovered after trial,the exercise of due diligence would not have resulted in the evidence being discovered at an earlier stage and the newly discovered evidence is of such magnitude that production of it earlier would likely have changed the outcome of the case.defenders of wildlife,at.
iii.discussion 
a.the preclusive effect of the florida state court judgment 
the appellants assert that the district court erred in declining to give preclusive effect to the florida judgment.because the florida judgment determined that the far out entities obtained the trademark fraudulently,the appellants argue,the appellees have no right to the trademark.moreover,the appellants claim that since the florida judgment was an adverse decision against the appellees,the appellees incontestability affidavit was false.because deciding whether to apply issue preclusion also referred to as collateral estoppel is a question of law,we review de novo a district court refusal to give a state court judgment preclusive effect.see zamarripa city of mesa,cir.
the appropriate collateral estoppel standard 
under the federal full faith and credit statute,federal courts must give state court judgments the preclusive effect that those judgments would enjoy under the law of the state in which the judgment was rendered.see.as a result,the district court should have applied florida law in determining whether to give preclusive effect to the florida judgment.see marrese american academy of orthopaedic surgeons,d section embodies concerns of comity and federalism that allow the states to determine,subject to the requirements of the statute and the due process clause,the preclusive effect of judgments in their own courts.in re nourbakhsh,cir applying florida collateral estoppel doctrine to a default judgment rendered in florida state court.
collateral estoppel,or estoppel by judgment,is a judicial doctrine which in general terms prevents identical parties from relitigating issues that have previously been decided between them.mobil oil shevin,so d.under florida law,courts apply collateral estoppel when the parties are identical the issues are identical and the issue was fully litigated and determined in a contest which results in a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction.see porter saddlebrook resorts,so d.describing the collateral estoppel test as comprising five substantially similar elements.
the preclusive effect of the florida judgment 
the appellants contend that the florida judgment involved the same parties and the same issues and resulted in a final judgment on the merits.even though the final judgment was only issued against far out music,far out management,and gold,the appellants argue that far out productions and goldstein controlled the florida litigation and had filed for bankruptcy merely to avoid being subject to the florida suit.while the florida judgment did resolve some of the same issues as the present suit,it did not involve the same parties.
whether the florida judgment decided the identical issue 
the parties do not seriously dispute whether the florida judgment decided at least some of the same issues present in this litigation.the florida court partial final judgment found that gold and goldstein had fraudulently induced the band members into assigning the trademark to the far out entities in the contracts.while the court did not assign the trademark to the band members or enjoin the far out entities from asserting the trademark in the future,it did actually and necessarily resolve whether the far out entities legitimately obtained ownership in the trademark through the contracts.if the florida judgment were to otherwise satisfy the requirements for collateral estoppel,the appellees would be precluded from asserting that they own the trademark as a result of the contracts 
whether the florida judgment involved the same parties 
whether the florida judgment involved the same parties is a somewhat more difficult question.on its face,the florida judgment did not apply to goldstein and far out productions.the trial court specifically noted in its default order,partial final judgment,and final judgment that its orders did not affect far out productions or goldstein in a manner inconsistent with the bankruptcy code and that the claims against goldstein and far out productions were severed by virtue of the appellees pending bankruptcies.on the surface,then,the florida judgment did not involve the same parties as the present suit and therefore should not collaterally estop the appellees from relitigating whether they legitimately own the trademark.
the appellants contend,however,that the appellees should be estopped from arguing that they did not participate in the florida litigation since they were in privity with the other far out entities.the appellants assert that all three of the far out entities were essentially a single enterprise and that the appellees declared bankruptcy merely to avoid being bound by the florida judgment.
the appellants argument is unavailing.for a third party to be considered in privity with a party involved in litigation under florida law,the third party must have an interest in the action such that she will be bound by the final judgment as if she were a party or must be virtually represented by one who is a party stogniew mcqueen,so d.there is nothing in the record to indicate that far out productions and goldstein were virtually represented by the other far out entities and gold at the time of the florida judgment.
more importantly,the florida judgment can not be binding on the appellees as a matter of federal bankruptcy law.when a debtor files for bankruptcy,subject to certain exceptions not present here,section a of the bankruptcy code automatically stays any other judicial proceeding involving the debtor.see a.the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code plays a vital role in bankruptcy.it is designed to protect debtors from all collection efforts while they attempt to regain their financial footing.in re schwartz,cir describing the automatic stay as one of the fundamental debtor protections provided by the bankruptcy laws.the provision provides stability and certainty to both the debtor and creditors who might otherwise be tempted to bring independent actions to obtain default judgments.see id.at.
in fact,the automatic stay provision is so central to the functioning of the bankruptcy system that this circuit regards judgments obtained in violation of the provision as void rather than merely voidable on the motion of the debtor.see id.at.courts regularly void state court default judgments against debtors when the judgments are obtained in violation of the automatic stay provision,even where the debtor filed for bankruptcy in the midst of the state court proceedings.see,in re fillion,cir in re graves,cir.
on occasion,courts have recognized a narrow equitable exception to the strict enforcement of the automatic stay provision,such as when the debtor has participated extensively in a suit leading to a default judgment before declaring bankruptcy.see,in re docteroff,cir in re bush,cir in re daily,cir in re calder
