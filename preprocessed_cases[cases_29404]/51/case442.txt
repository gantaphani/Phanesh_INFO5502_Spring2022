this trademark infringement action concerns two restaurants,situated on opposite sides of the country,that share very similar names.dan tana,owner of dan tana restaurant in hollywood,california plaintiff,brought this action against the two limited liability companies that own and operate the dantanna restaurants in atlanta,concepts,and dantanna cnn center,llc defendants.plaintiff complaint alleges that david clapp,founder of the dantanna restaurants and managing member of the defendants,intentionally selected and registered as a federal trademark a name for his restaurants that is confusingly similar to the name of plaintiff restaurant in hollywood.the claims forming the basis of plaintiff complaint are false designation of origin,a theory of federal trademark infringement arising under a of the lanham act,a count i deceptive trade practices under georgia uniform deceptive trade practices act,et.count ii fraud pursuant to count iii and the unauthorized appropriation of likeness,an tort recognized under georgia law count iv 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all counts.plaintiff now appeals,arguing that triable issues of fact remain as to whether there is a likelihood of confusion between the two restaurants and whether defendants intentionally appropriated the name of his restaurant.because we conclude that plaintiff has not adduced sufficient evidence giving rise to a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of likelihood of confusion or defendants knowing appropriation of his likeness,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants.
facts and procedural history 
plaintiff dan tana is a former yugoslav soccer star,prominent restaurateur,film producer,and actor.he opened his restaurant,dan tana,in west hollywood,california,in.since that time,the restaurant has enjoyed a storied history,attracting hollywood celebrities and insiders to the restaurant intimate and romantic setting.dan tana serves traditional italian fare,and it resembles an italian trattoria with checkered table cloths and wine flasks hanging from the ceiling.plaintiff,who has been the sole owner of the restaurant since its inception,figures prominently into its ambiance,personally greeting and welcoming his patrons.the press has referred to dan tana as a legendary hollywood hotspot and the ultimate la hangout,and the restaurant has been featured in numerous newspapers,magazines,and books.the name dan tanna received significant publicity in the when producer aaron spelling asked plaintiff for the use of his name for the lead character in his television series vega.
despite the notoriety of plaintiff restaurant,plaintiff did not attempt to register the name dan tana with the patent and trademark office pto until june,years after his restaurant opening.the pto denied his application in december on the basis of the existing registration of the trademark dantanna in the same category of restaurant services sought by plaintiff.defendants had opened the first of two dantanna locations in atlanta in,applied for a federal registration in june,and obtained federal registration of the name dantanna in march,claiming a date of first use of september,
the dantanna restaurants are upscale sports restaurants serving contemporary american cuisine with a surf and turf theme.the restaurants large open floor plans boast big screen televisions tuned to sports channels on surrounding walls.according to its website,dantanna specializes in providing a sophisticated and elegant venue for the viewing of sporting events and strives to emulate the feeling of sitting in a private box at your favorite game.in june,plaintiff filed a petition for cancellation of defendants mark with the pto trademark trial and appeal board,alleging that defendants sought to mislead the public into believing their restaurant was associated with dan tana hollywood.subsequently,plaintiff filed a federal trademark infringement suit in united states district court for the central district of california,which was ultimately dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction over one of the defendants.after plaintiff filed his federal lawsuit,he moved to suspend the trademark cancellation proceeding pending before the pto.the pto stayed the proceeding in september.
plaintiff then filed this lawsuit in the northern district of georgia in march,pleading the federal and georgia trademark infringement,fraud,and tort claims at issue in this appeal.plaintiff complaint seeks a permanent injunction enjoining defendants from all future use of the dantanna mark and the cancellation of defendants federal trademark registration,among other relief.defendants moved for summary judgment arguing that,as a matter of law,plaintiff could not establish the likelihood of confusion necessary to subject them to liability under a of the lanham act,georgia uniform deceptive trade practices act,or fraud under georgia law,nor could plaintiff establish the intentional appropriation of likeness required to impose liability under georgia tort law.the district court agreed,granting summary judgment in favor of defendants as to all counts.this appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court.harrison benchmark elecs.huntsville,cir.in so doing,we view all evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.id.summary judgment is proper where the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.c.
plaintiff appeals the district court disposition of four counts of his federal complaint false designation of origin under a of the lanham act,deceptive trade practices under georgia uniform deceptive trade practices act,fraud under,and appropriation of likeness under georgia tort law.however,we need not separately address whether defendants were entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff deceptive trade practices or fraud claims.the district court held that the georgia uniform deceptive trade practices act and require a plaintiff to prove the same elements as a claim for federal trademark infringement under the lanham act.because this is a question of state law that the parties do not challenge on appeal,we treat the district court holding as correct and merely determine whether the district court properly decided the lanham act count.see jellibeans,skating clubs of,cir.if we determine that the district court decided the lanham act count properly,we will also affirm its decision on the georgia deceptive trade practices and fraud counts.id.thus,we first address plaintiff lanham act claim and then consider his georgia claim.
trademark infringement under a of the lanham act 
trademarks are any word,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof used to identify and distinguish one goods from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods.section a of the lanham act creates a federal cause of action for unfair competition by prohibiting the use in interstate commerce of any word,term,name,symbol or device,or any false designation of origin which is likely to cause confusion as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person.a to establish a prima facie case of trademark infringement under a,a plaintiff must show that it had trademark rights in the mark or name at issue and that the other party had adopted a mark or name that was the same,or confusingly similar to its mark,such that consumers were likely to confuse the two.lone star steakhouse saloon,longhorn steaks,cir plaintiff allegation under the lanham act is that dan tana is a trade name in which he has trademark rights and that defendants are unlawfully infringing on those rights by using and registering the name dantanna in connection with the operation of their atlanta restaurants.
to satisfy the first element of a proof of a valid plaintiff need not have a registered mark.we have recognized that the use of another unregistered,common law,trademark can constitute a violation of a where the alleged unregistered trademarks used by the plaintiff are so associated with its goods that the use of the same or similar marks by another company constitutes a false representation that its goods came from the same source.conagra,singleton,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.however,only those marks that are capable of distinguishing the owner goods from those of others,that are sufficiently distinctive,are eligible for federal registration or protection as common law marks under the lanham act.e,f two pesos,taco cabana,coach house,coach six,cir.
our circuit recognizes four categories of distinctiveness,listed in ascending order of strength that suggest the basic nature of the product or service that identify the characteristic or quality of a product or service that suggest characteristics of the product or service and require an effort of the imagination by the consumer in order to be understood as descriptive and arbitrary or that bear no relationship to the product or service,and the strongest category of trademarks.gift of learning,tgc,cir.suggestive and arbitrary or fanciful marks are deemed inherently distinctive because their intrinsic nature serves to identify a particular source of a product and are generally entitled to trademark protection.two pesos,at.at.generic marks,on the other hand,are generally incapable of receiving trademark protection and may never be registered as trademarks under the lanham act.welding,forman,cir coach house,at.descriptive marks,though not inherently distinctive,may become sufficiently distinctive to enjoy trademark protection by acquiring secondary meaning.f coach house,at.a name has acquired secondary meaning when the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer.welding,at internal quotation and citation omitted.
surnames and first regarded as descriptive terms and therefore one who claims federal trademark rights in a name must prove that the name has acquired a secondary meaning.perini perini,cir tonawanda fay drug,cir same see also e providing that if a mark is primarily merely a surname the pto may deny it federal registration conagra,at requiring a showing of secondary meaning for a surname to give rise to enforceable trademark rights.however,defendants presumed the validity of plaintiff mark in their summary judgment motion below and only contested the second element of plaintiff trademark infringement likelihood of confusion between the two marks.the district court disposed of plaintiff suit solely on this ground,never reaching the issue of trademark validity.therefore,we also proceed on the assumption that plaintiff holds valid trademark rights in the name dan tana and turn to the second element of plaintiff lanham act claim,the likelihood of confusion 
likelihood of confusion 
in evaluating whether there is a likelihood of confusion between two marks,our court applies a multifactor test,evaluating the following seven factors strength of the mark alleged to have been infringed similarity of the infringed and infringing marks similarity between the goods and services offered under the two marks similarity of the actual sales methods used by the holders of the marks,such as their sales outlets and customer base similarity of advertising methods intent of the alleged infringer to misappropriate the proprietor good will and the existence and extent of actual confusion in the consuming public.welding,at.on appeal,plaintiff argues that there is a material issue of fact on the likelihood of confusion between his and defendants mark,precluding summary judgment,and that the district court erred in considering the geographical proximity of the parties use of their marks as an additional relevant factor in its analysis.plaintiff can not prevail on either argument 
we agree with the district court that the only factors that could plausibly support a finding of a likelihood of confusion are the similarity of the marks factor two and the undisputed similarity of the parties sales methods factor four.plaintiff and defendants marks share an identical spelling but for a single letter and the use of a space,an identical use of the possessive,and an identical pronunciation,and both parties sell food prepared and served in retail restaurant establishments however,both of these factors merely suggest a threshold potential for confusion and are thus entitled to little weight.an analysis of the remaining factors demonstrates no real likelihood of confusion in the consuming public.
with respect to the strength of plaintiff mark factor one,we conclude that dan tana is a relatively weak mark for restaurant services outside of the los angeles area.the weaker the mark,the less likelihood of confusion.welding,at.as discussed above,determining the strength of a mark requires a consideration of the mark inherent distinctiveness.if the mark is merely descriptive,such as a personal or surname,its strength depends on whether it has acquired secondary meaning.see perini,at tonawanda,at conagra,at.a descriptive mark with secondary meaning is a relatively strong mark.dieter b h indus.of sw,cir.
as a preliminary matter,we do not find persuasive plaintiff argument that because his mark is derived from his full name,as opposed to his personal or surname,it is an inherently distinctive and,therefore,strong mark.the policy reasons for requiring secondary meaning for the use of a personal or surname as a mark extend equally to the use of full names.see peaceable planet,ty,cir identifying the particular reasons for considering names merely descriptive marks a reluctance to forbid a person to use his own name in his own business a recognition that some names are so common that consumers will not assume that two products having the same name therefore have the same source and the concern that preventing a person from using his name to denote his business may deprive consumers of useful information.although some full names are indeed unique,the majority are shared by numerous individuals across diverse communities and markets.we decline to create a blanket rule distinguishing full names from personal and surnames with respect to the requirement.
thus,dan tana is merely a descriptive mark,the strength of which is dependent upon the showing of secondary meaning.we consider four factors in assessing secondary meaning the length and nature of the name use,the nature and extent of advertising and promotion of the name,the efforts of the proprietor to promote a conscious connection between the name and the business,and the degree of actual recognition by the public that the name designates the proprietor product or service.welding,at.in light of plaintiff continuous use of his mark in the same west hollywood neighborhood for over four decades,as well as the record evidence of the significant press coverage he receives in los angeles publications,it is likely that dan tana has obtained secondary meaning in los angeles.however,dan tana alleges a likelihood of confusion between his restaurant and an establishment thousands of miles away.therefore,the relevant inquiry is whether plaintiff mark is strong enough outside of los angeles to give rise to a likelihood of confusion among consumers of dantanna restaurant services in atlanta.see brennan,brennan,cir t o achieve the status of a strong mark,plaintiff must demonstrate distinctiveness in the relevant market in this case,the relevant market is the pool of actual and potential customers of terrance brennan,for it is those patrons whose potential confusion is at issue.the record fails to establish such widespread secondary meaning.
plaintiff does not advertise nationally or in the atlanta area specifically,though he has enjoyed free advertising from articles in national publications such as the new york times,forbes traveler,and usa today.although these articles suggest some notoriety among food critics and travel writers of nationwide publications,they do not constitute record evidence of any effort by plaintiff to create a conscious connection in the nationwide public mind between the name dan tana and his restaurant.see welding,at see also brennan,at articles and reviews discussing brennan new orleans in the context of the city of new orleans or a trip to new orleans in no way demonstrate that potential diners in new york city who find the word brennan on a restaurant awning will have any reason to think the restaurant is connected with brennan new orleans,or even will have heard of brennan new orleans.even the use of the name dan tanna in the television series vega,which aired for a few years in the late and early,suggests nothing more than that the name dan tana may have a familiar ring to a discrete group of television enthusiasts who viewed the program twenty to thirty years ago,not that patrons of dantanna atlanta would specifically associate the name with plaintiff restaurant.
moreover,the two affidavits submitted by plaintiff as evidence of the national notoriety of his authored by plaintiff himself and the other authored by his only generalized statements as to plaintiff reputation and add no material evidence to the record that is relevant to the inquiry.conagra,at holding plaintiff had established secondary meaning in its mark because it had prominently displayed the singleton name on virtually all of its seafood products for over years,distributed promotional films widely,expended over annually in worldwide markets on its promotion,and included market surveys in the record strongly identifying the company name with its products.in sum,plaintiff has failed to establish widespread secondary meaning of the name dan tana sufficient to demonstrate that he holds a strong mark in restaurant services so as to cause a likelihood of confusion among consumers in atlanta in light of the weakness of plaintiff mark in the context of this infringement suit factor one,the conceded similarity between the two marks factor two adds little weight to plaintiff effort to show likelihood of confusion.
a comparison of the goods and services offered under the parties marks factor three reveals overwhelming evidence that consumers would be unlikely to confuse the two restaurants.the goods and services provided in the parties restaurants are strikingly dissimilar,and the record belies plaintiff assertion that dantanna in atlanta provides nearly identical cuisine and ambiance to his hollywood restaurant.in fact,the only apparent commonality between the two restaurants is that they are both establishments serving meat and fish.dan tana is an italian restaurant where mustached waiters dressed in tuxedos serve classic italian dishes off a menu embellished with italian language.the ambiance is cozy,intimate,romantic,and the restaurant caters to hollywood elite and to celebrities seeking a safe haven from paparazzi.in stark contrast,dantanna in atlanta is an upscale sports restaurant,targeting sports enthusiasts and serving contemporary american cuisine in a modern setting decorated with televisions.coach house,at finding that the registrant restaurant was modeled to emulate the same ambiance and provide the same cuisine as plaintiff restaurant,which contributed to the court finding of a material issue of fact on the likelihood of confusion between the two marks.
the stark differences between the parties restaurants,described in the preceding paragraph,also demonstrate that their customers are dissimilar,which is an aspect of the similarity of the parties actual sales methods factor four.the district court accepted defendants concession that the two parties have identical sales outlets the other consideration in evaluating the similarity of sales methods,in that they both serve food in retail restaurant establishments,but did not compare the restaurants customer base.thus,viewing factor four in its entirety,it adds little weight to the possibility of a likelihood of confusion.
additionally,plaintiff and defendants do not engage in similar methods of advertising factor five.plaintiff admittedly relies solely on free publicity to advertise his restaurant,aside from maintaining a website.defendants,by contrast,both maintain a website and purchase advertising at sporting events and in various local and national publications.thus,the only similarity in the advertising channels used by the two parties is their maintenance of websites on the world wide web.this similarity would dispel rather than cause confusion,however,because the websites are separate and distinct,suggesting two completely unrelated business entities.
there is also scant evidence of any intention of defendants to misappropriate plaintiff mark factor six.plaintiff asserts,in a rather conclusory fashion,that defendants knew of the dan tana restaurant prior to adopting the name dantanna for their own because clapp previously lived in los angeles and worked in the restaurant business there.although this fact gives rise to an inference that clapp could have encountered the dan tana restaurant during his time in california,it does not contradict defendants evidence of an independent and innocent origin of the dantanna mark that the name dantanna was derived from the names of clapp two children,daniel and anna by shortening daniel to dan and connecting the two names with a sign,which was eventually converted into a moreover,clapp testified in his deposition that he did not learn of plaintiff restaurant until sometime in,after he had already selected the name of his restaurant and begun the trademark registration process.aside from plaintiff bald assertion that clapp fabricated this story,the affidavit and his testimony remain uncontroverted by any material evidence.in fact,plaintiff testified in his deposition before the pto that he had no reason to believe that clapp story was not true.where a story of the creation of a mark is undisputed and shows an innocent origin,we have concluded that there is no intent of misappropriation contributing to a likelihood of confusion.see welding,at.
additionally,and perhaps most significantly,plaintiff is unable to identify any credible motive for defendants to trade on the name of his restaurant in atlanta.there is no evidence of any secondary meaning associated with plaintiff mark in the atlanta area there is no competition between the two restaurants and the restaurants fulfill entirely different niches in the food services market.finally,a factfinder is less likely to find intentional infringement where a defendant uses his own name in creating his mark.see conagra,at.although the record indicates that clapp used his children as opposed to his own name for his restaurant,the source of the name is personal and familial and further support for our conclusion that no reasonable jury could find intentional infringement on these facts.
the last factor,actual confusion in the consuming public,is the most persuasive evidence in assessing likelihood of confusion.alliance metals,hinely,cir.again,plaintiff evidence is nominal.in fact,the only evidence adduced by plaintiff as to actual confusion was an affidavit by kenneth mcguire,a los angeles resident and patron of dan tana hollywood,who claimed that he chose to patronize dantanna on a visit to atlanta because of the similarity of the two restaurants names,which led him to believe they had an affiliation.mcguire attested that upon entry he was struck by the signage and the decor in the atlanta dantanna,which was so close to the decor as the dan tana in hollywood that it strengthened his belief of the restaurants association.the district court concluded that the mcguire affidavit was simply not credible in light of the record evidence of the striking dissimilarities between the restaurants interiors,menus,and ambiance and was therefore entitled to little weight.see charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed.under federal rule of civil procedure,the court may disregard an offer of evidence that is too incredible to be believed.even if we declined to completely disregard the affidavit,this evidence of actual confusion is so minimal as to be practically insignificant.
the only other evidence of actual confusion is defendants admission that there have been two incidents in which customers have inquired as to the restaurants possible affiliation with dan tana hollywood since dantanna opened in.this evidence of actual confusion is also weak in considering actual confusion we look not only to the existence but also to the extent of such confusion.welding,at.dantanna has served over one million customers in the five years between its opening and the filing of this lawsuit no reasonable jury would conclude that an inquiry by only two customers of a possible connection between the restaurants demonstrates actual confusion in the consuming public.our cases finding relevant actual confusion have concerned much more significant evidence.alliance metals,at finding ample undisputed evidence of actual confusion where plaintiff attached copies of more than a dozen checks plaintiff received from customers for goods bought from defendants and seven invoices from vendors billing plaintiff under a confusing combination of plaintiff and defendant names conagra,at finding relevant actual confusion where the evidence demonstrated numerous instances where people assumed an affiliation between the parties businesses,including inquiries by distributors to plaintiff about services provided by defendant.
ii.the relevance of geographic proximity of use 
we also reject plaintiff argument that the district court erred as a matter of law in considering the geographic proximity of the use of the parties marks.our circuit has recognized that new factors may merit consideration in determining whether there is a likelihood of confusion.swatch watch,taxor,cir.and our case law already establishes that geographic considerations may be relevant to the analysis,even where we have not articulated this consideration as a separate factor.see,luke cataract laser,sanderson,cir considering the fact that the two companies worked in the same geographical market in holding that there was a clear likelihood of confusion of the parties service marks to sustain the jury verdict alliance metals,at considering the undisputed evidence that both companies distributed prefinished aluminum sheets and sign blanks in the same territory in concluding that there was a likelihood of confusion.
we have already discussed the relevance of geography in our evaluation of the strength of plaintiff mark under the first factor of our existing test.where the secondary meaning acquired by a descriptive mark dictates its strength and distinctiveness,as here,the geographic remoteness of a mark use may be relevant to the inquiry.because plaintiff seeks to establish a likelihood of confusion with a restaurant in atlanta,the geographically remote use of his mark in west hollywood weighs against a finding of nationwide secondary meaning,leaving him with only a weak mark unlikely to cause a likelihood of confusion in atlanta.
geographic considerations are also particularly relevant where a plaintiff holds only trademark rights in a mark because it is that the scope of protection accorded his mark is coextensive only with the territory throughout which it is known and from which it has drawn its trade.hanover star milling metcalf,superseded by statute in irrelevant part as stated in park n fly,dollar park fly.the owner of a registered mark,in contrast,enjoys the unlimited right to use the mark nationwide,and federal registration affords the registrant priority over all future users of confusingly similar marks.c coach house,at.therefore,a lanham act plaintiff asserting trademark rights under a against the owner of a registered mark,as here,bears the burden of establishing the right to use its mark by actual use in a given territory.emergency one,am.fire eagle engine,cir.and because registration constitutes constructive nationwide notice of the registrant priority of use of a mark,only actual use occurring prior to such registration gives rise to enforceable trademark rights.thus,federal registration has the practical effect of freezing a prior user enforceable trademark rights thereby terminating any right to future expansion beyond the user existing territory.allard,advanced programming,cir in the case in which a junior user applies for registration,the extent of the senior territory is frozen as of the date of actual registration to the junior user.
accordingly,because plaintiff continued to operate only a single location of dan tana at the time defendants registered their mark,his trademark rights in the dan tana name are limited to the los angeles market.furthermore,the record also establishes that defendants currently operate restaurants only in the atlanta area and that the mark of neither party is known by the customers in the other market.thus,at present,the parties restaurants coexist in remote markets,geographically and otherwise.on such a record,geographic considerations are indeed relevant and demonstrate a smaller likelihood of confusion.see coach house,at explaining that in an action for trademark infringement,as opposed to a cancellation proceeding,brought by a prior user of an unregistered mark,there is no presumption that the mark is being used nationwide,and therefore where the two parties operate in discrete,remote areas,there is a smaller likelihood that there will be confusion brennan,at in the restaurant industry,especially where individual restaurants rather than chains are competing,physical separation seems particularly significant to the inquiry into consumer confusion.we therefore hold that the geographic remoteness of the parties restaurants is particularly relevant to our analysis where a plaintiff bases a trademark infringement claim on trademark rights.the district court did not err in considering the geographic proximity of use as an eighth factor demonstrating the unlikelihood of confusion 
viewing the factors as a whole,there is minimal evidence of a likelihood of confusion between plaintiff and defendants restaurants aside from the initial similarity of their names and the fact that they both provide restaurant services.the remaining factors all weigh against a likelihood of confusion,some overwhelmingly so.there are stark differences between the two restaurants cuisine and ambiance.there is virtually no evidence of confusion in advertising channels.no reasonable jury could find that defendants intended to trade on plaintiff mark,and there is negligible evidence of any actual confusion between the two restaurants.moreover,in light of the vast geographical distance between the two markets currently used by the parties,a likelihood of confusion is highly unlikely.in sum,plaintiff has failed to adduce sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find a likelihood of confusion between plaintiff and defendants marks.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants on plaintiff lanham act count.
because neither party contests the district court conclusion that the elements to establish deceptive trade practices under georgia uniform deceptive trade practices act and fraud under are identical to those required to prevail on plaintiff federal infringement claim,we also affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on these state law claims.see jellibeans,at.
appropriation of likeness 
we now turn to plaintiff second issue on appeal that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his tort claim.to prove an appropriation of likeness under georgia law,a plaintiff must establish that the defendant invaded his privacy by appropriating,for the defendant benefit,use or advantage,the plaintiff name or likeness.cabaniss hipsley.plaintiff asserts on appeal that an appropriation of likeness need not be intentional to be an actionable invasion of privacy.this position is wholly without merit.
an appropriation of likeness without an intent to use the likeness for one benefit fails to meet the very definition of the tort itself.furthermore,georgia case law plainly establishes that summary judgment is proper where a plaintiff fails to show an intentional or knowing appropriation of likeness.blakey victory equip.sales,holding that the district court properly awarded summary judgment to defendant on plaintiff claim for the sole reason that t here was no evidence that defendants ever knowingly took blakely identity for their purposes.
as discussed in part,plaintiff also fails to present any material evidence that calls into question the truthfulness of clapp claim of origin for his restaurant name aside from the general assertion that clapp experience working in los angeles may have resulted in his knowledge of the dan tana restaurant.without any evidence to contradict clapp account that his restaurant is named after his own two children,as opposed to plaintiff restaurant in hollywood,and without any evidence of a motive for defendants to trade on the name of plaintiff restaurant,there can be no intentional appropriation of plaintiff name or likeness.in sum,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to defendants on plaintiff claim.
conclusion 
because plaintiff failed to produce sufficient evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact on the likelihood of confusion between plaintiff and defendants marks,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to defendants on plaintiff federal and state trademark infringement claims and his claim of fraud arising under georgia law.we also uphold the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants on plaintiff claim due to the absence of any evidence of an intentional appropriation of plaintiff likeness.

the parties consistently refer to this case as involving registered and common law trademarks throughout their appellate briefs,but,because both parties use their marks in association with services in addition to goods bearing the restaurants names,their marks are also properly characterized as service marks.service marks are any word,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof used to identify and distinguish the services of one person from the services of others and to indicate the source of the services.the analysis is the same for service mark and trademark infringement.frehling,int l select group,cir the infringement analysis is the same under both standards and courts thus treat the two terms as interchangeable in adjudicating infringement claims.for simplicity and consistency,however,we will continue to refer to this action as one for trademark,as opposed to service mark and trademark,infringement.the parties consistently refer to this case as involving registered and common law trademarks throughout their appellate briefs,but,because both parties use their marks in association with services in addition to goods bearing the restaurants names,their marks are also properly characterized as service marks.service marks are any word,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof used to identify and distinguish the services of one person from the services of others and to indicate the source of the services.the analysis is the same for service mark and trademark infringement.frehling,int l select group,cir the infringement analysis is the same under both standards and courts thus treat the two terms as interchangeable in adjudicating infringement claims.for simplicity and consistency,however,we will continue to refer to this action as one for trademark,as opposed to service mark and trademark,infringement.
