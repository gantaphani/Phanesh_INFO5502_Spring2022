in this appeal,we consider whether the united states patent and trademark office may reject an application to register a trademark because the application contains multiple marks.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that it may.accordingly,except for the appeal of a subsidiary point that we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
on march,humanoids group registered the humanoids with the institut national de la propriete industrielle of the republic of france.under d of the lanham act,d,humanoids group could claim priority for use of the mark in the united states as of this date,if it filed an application to register the mark with the united states patent and trademark office pto within the next six months 
on the last day of the period,september,humanoids group filed an application with the pto that contained the mark humanoids.the application identified the mark submitted for consideration as humanoids,stated that the application was filed pursuant to d of the lanham act which requires that the mark in the application and the foreign mark be the same,and noted the serial number of the french trademark application for the mark humanoids.but,the application also presented another mark,graphic stories.the application stated that a drawing page displaying the mark in conformance with is submitted with this application,and,on the attached drawing page,identified graphic stories as the mark it sought to obtain.
the pto accepted humanoids group application and assigned it a september filing date,but treated it as an application for the mark set forth on the drawing page graphic stories.because the window expired the next day,the pto failure to treat the application as one for the humanoids mark caused humanoids group to lose the right to claim use of that mark in the united states as of its march french filing date.thus,another party may,application with the pto to register the humanoids mark gained that party priority over use of the mark in the united states.
in an effort to lay claim to the french filing date,and maintaining that it had committed only a scrivener error in identifying graphic stories as its mark in the september application,humanoids group petitioned the pto to designate humanoids as the mark submitted in that application.the pto declined,pointing to its regulatory requirement that an application must present only one mark and to its policy of relaxing this requirement and granting a filing date to an application containing multiple marks only when the body of an application and its drawing page present different marks,and then only by permitting the mark presented on the drawing page to constitute the submitted mark.the pto also noted the general interest in avoiding impractical and time consuming procedures and delay of the entry of mark s into the office automated systems.
humanoids group then filed this action pursuant to the administrative procedure act apa,et,seeking a judgment that the pto denial of its petition violated the apa and an order substituting humanoids as the mark submitted in the september application.the district court granted summary judgment to the pto.the court reasoned that pto regulations limit an application to one mark at the time the application is filed,that the pto acted reasonably in adopting a policy of granting a limited exception to this requirement by looking to the mark identified on the drawing page,and that the pto correctly applied these regulations and policies in denying humanoids group petition.humanoids group appeals.
an entity must complete two,distinct steps to register a mark with the pto.first,the entity must submit an application that meets relevant requirements in order to receive a filing date.second,the entity must meet more detailed requirements to secure final approval of the application to obtain registration.this case involves only the first of these steps.

consistent with this charge and the changes made by the act,the pto promulgated regulations providing that in order to receive a filing date,an application must contain 
the name of the applicant 
a name and address for the correspondence 
a clear drawing of the mark 
a listing of goods or services and 
the filing fee

humanoids group contends that the pto violated the apa in interpreting one of these minimum requirements the requirement that the application contain a clear drawing of the mark in the case at hand and that the district court erred in holding to the contrary and granting summary judgment to the pto.a.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.inova alexandria hosp.shalala,cir.however,because humanoids group brings this action pursuant to the apa,we conduct our review in accordance with the standards announced therein.under the apa,we may,t o the extent necessary,decide all relevant question of law and interpret constitutional and statutory provisions.we can reverse an agency only if we find that its actions are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.
humanoids group argues that the pto has misinterpreted the requirement,set forth in its regulation,that to receive a filing date an application must contain a clear drawing of the mark.the pto interprets this regulatory requirement to mean that an application must present only one drawing of one mark.see in re lavorazioni,wl comm r pat an application that includes two or more drawings displaying materially different marks does not meet this requirement and is not entitled to a filing date.see also pto manual patent trademark office,dep t of commerce,exam guide,exam guide.humanoids group argues that the regulation should instead be interpreted to require merely that an application contain at least one drawing of the mark sought to be registered.brief of appellant at.
generally,courts must defer to an agency interpretation of its own regulation,regarding that interpretation as controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer robbins,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also kentuckians for the commonwealth,rivenburgh,cir.humanoids group,however,argues that this deferential standard is not warranted here.alternatively,it maintains that even if the deferential auer standard applies,we must reject the pto interpretation.we consider each of these contentions in turn.
humanoids group contends that the pto interpretation of does not warrant deference for several reasons.
first,humanoids group argues that the pto did not adopt its interpretation in a formal enough manner to merit judicial deference.in support of this argument,humanoids group points to the holding in christensen harris,d,that agency interpretations not subject to notice and comment as interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines lack the force of law and,therefore,do not warrant deference.but this holding addresses only an agency use of a policy statement,manual,or the like to interpret a statute it does not address the deference to be afforded when an agency employs these materials to state the agency interpretation of its own regulations.see,id.at.conducting a separate a
