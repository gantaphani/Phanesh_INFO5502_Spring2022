the trademark trial and appeal board board affirmed the refusal of the united states patent and trademark office pto to register the mark to appellant.the board held the mark was either generic or merely descriptive and without secondary meaning.in re,wl ttab.this court vacates the board determination that the mark is generic,but affirms its findings on descriptiveness and the absence of secondary meaning,and therefore affirms the denial of the application.
appellant filed an application under b to register the mark as a service mark on march.in its original application,appellant stated that it intended to use the mark in connection with the s ale of metal buildings and roofing systems.the examining attorney initially denied registration on the ground that the proposed mark was merely descriptive,under e.appellant then amended its application and requested reconsideration.in the amendment,the applicant changed the identification of its services to computerized retail services in the field of metal buildings and roofing systems.appellant also filed an allegation of use under c,submitted samples of advertising that described the interactive capabilities of its service,and submitted evidence of acquired distinctiveness.the examiner again refused registration,this time finding that the mark was generic for the specified goods and services without any acquired distinctiveness under f.
the board affirmed the pto rejection on the ground that is generic for a website that provides computerized retail services in the field of metal buildings including steel buildings,wl,at.the board also found that if the terms steel building sic and are not generic,they are at least highly descriptive.id.at.the board noted that the addition of the term,a top level domain tld indicator,was without significance,citing in re martin container,ttab and in re,ttab,wl,at.finally,the board found appellant evidence inadequate to show acquired distinctiveness.
to deny the registration of a mark as generic,the pto has the burden of substantial ly showing that the matter is in fact generic based on clear evidence of generic use.in re am.fertility soc.this court reviews a holding of genericness or descriptiveness for substantial evidence.in re oppedahl larson llp.a generic term,by definition,identifies a type of product,not the source of the product.in re gould paper.a generic term can not function as an indicator of the source of a product,and thus as a trademark,because the relevant public understands the term primarily as the common name for the product.in re.this court test for genericness has two parts first,the court determines the genus of goods or services at issue,and second,the court determines whether the term sought to be registered is understood by the relevant public primarily to refer to that genus of goods or services.marvin ginn int l ass of fire chiefs.an inquiry into the public understanding of a mark requires consideration of the mark as a whole.even if each of the constituent words in a combination mark is generic,the combination is not generic unless the entire formulation does not add any meaning to the otherwise generic mark.am.fertility soc y,at,at.
a merely descriptive mark describes the qualities,ingredients or characteristics of the goods or services related to the mark.estate of beckwith,comm r of patents.a mark is merely descriptive if it immediately conveys knowledge of the ingredients,qualities,or characteristics of the goods with which it is used.in re gyulay.however,if a mark is not merely descriptive,because some imagination,thought,and perception are required to arrive at the qualities or characteristics of the goods,it may still qualify for registration.see in re nett designs.descriptive marks can qualify for registration on the principal register if they acquire secondary meaning,distinctiveness.see f two pesos,taco cabana,d.to show that a mark has acquired distinctiveness,an applicant must demonstrate that the relevant public understands the primary significance of the mark as identifying the source of a product or service rather than the product or service itself.qualitex jacobson prods,d.
only in rare instances will the addition of a tld indicator to a descriptive term operate to create a distinctive mark.oppedahl,at.in those rare instances,a term that is not distinctive by itself may acquire some additional meaning from the addition of a tld,such as.see id.at.in those unusual circumstances,the addition of the tld can show distinctiveness,intimating some internet feature of the item.see id.at.because the evaluation of a mark proposed for registration requires consideration of the mark as a whole,the distinctiveness derived from a connection to the internet,as indicated by the tld indicator,is a part of the calculus for registration.
the board defined the genus for appellant goods or services as the sale of steel buildings on the internet,wl,at,and computerized retail services in the field of metal buildings including steel buildings.id.at.the board,with this definition of genus in mind,first considered steelbuilding in isolation,and then considered the effect of adding.the board found that applicant competitors use the term steel buildings generically,giving several examples of the use of steel buildings by competitors.the record shows,however,that the evidence cited by the board relates to the phrase steel building or steel buildings none refers to steelbuilding or steelbuilding.despite this distinction,the board found to be simply the name of a website that sells,inter alia,steel buildings.id.
as an initial matter,this court examines the board understanding of the genus of goods or services at issue.the applicant defined its goods and services,in its amended application,as computerized retail services in the field of metal buildings and roofing systems.although the definitions of the applicant and of the board appear nearly identical,the parties understand the phrase computerized retail services differently.applicant sells steel buildings on line,but the record indicates it provides services beyond mere sales.in other words,the services at issue are far more than an catalogue.the applicant web site permits a customer to first design,then determine an appropriate price for,its own unique design.finally,the customer may purchase its unique building on line.the web site features a process that facilitates the customer design of his building at his own computer via a complex interactive process.
the web site thus includes more than a mere shopping guide for metal building structures.as the develops the design,the program design elements as necessary to meet codes and other engineering requirements.the program then calculates a price for the designed building.the purchaser can compare prices of different designs,and finally purchase a preferred design.therefore,while correctly concluding that a significant,if not primary feature,of applicant services is the sale of steel buildings,id.at,the board fails to acknowledge the interactive design feature of the applicant goods and services.
although the board misunderstanding of the proper genus for alone requires this court to vacate its decision on genericness,this court also examines generally the board finding on this matter.in deciding whether the relevant public uses the term as the genus or name of the genus of the specified goods or services,the board considered steelbuilding and separately.the board decided that steelbuilding by itself is a generic term.id.at.the board apparently concluded that steelbuilding is generic for steel buildings.the board does not seem to acknowledge an alternative genus,namely the the building of steel structures.in this case,the genus might be both formulations.the board does not adequately define the genus.
in any event,the record does not show substantial evidence that steelbuilding,in common usage,is a compound word used to mean either steel building or steel buildings.see gould,at the pto has satisfied its evidentiary burden if it produces evidence including dictionary definitions that the separate words joined to form a compound have a meaning identic
