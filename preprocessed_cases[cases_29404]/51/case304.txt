this appeal arises from the district court order denying plaintiff appellant pom wonderful motion for a preliminary injunction.pom wonderful the owner of the pom standard character mark brought a trademark infringement claim against defendant appellee robert hubbard,portland bottling company and pur beverages pur to stop pur from using the word pom on its energy drink.the district court denied pom wonderful motion,finding that pom wonderful is unlikely to demonstrate a likelihood of consumer confusion and therefore is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its trademark infringement claim.
exercising our jurisdiction under a,we hold that the district court abused its discretion in finding that pom wonderful is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its claim and,accordingly,we reverse.because the district court decision to deny pom wonderful motion for a preliminary injunction was tainted by its mistaken determination,we remand with instructions that the district court consider whether,in light of our decision today,pom wonderful meets its burden of proving the other elements for a preliminary injunction that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief that the balance of equities tips in its favor and that a preliminary injunction is in the public interest.
pom wonderful owns numerous trademark registrations that together comprise the pom brand family of trademarks.these trademarks are used in connection with various goods,including pomegranate juice beverages.in addition to producing its own pom brand goods,pom wonderful also sells its pomegranate ingredients to other companies in the food and beverage industry.on occasion,pom wonderful licenses the use of its pom brand trademarks to these other companies.
before,when pom wonderful first began using the pom brand trademarks in connection with beverages,no one in the industry was known to have used the term pom in any way.since,pom wonderful has sold more than million bottles of pomegranate juice,making it the leading seller of pomegranate juice in supermarkets throughout the united states.pom wonderful annual supermarket sales exceed million.
pom wonderful has devoted a great deal of time and spent millions of dollars marketing and selling its pom brand products.in and alone,pom wonderful spent million promoting its pomegranate juice beverages.to protect its investment,and the rights of companies that license its pom brand trademarks,pom wonderful actively polices uses that may infringe on its trademark rights.
through these policing efforts,pom wonderful discovered that pur was selling a energy drink labeled pom and informed pur of pom wonderful ownership interest in the pom brand trademarks.when pur refused to change its packaging,pom wonderful filed suit,alleging that pur use of the word pom violated pom wonderful trademark rights under the lanham act see,a.shortly after filing its first amended complaint,pom wonderful moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin pur from selling or marketing its pom beverage.
the district court denied the motion.specifically,after considering the eight sleekcraft factors the district court found that pom wonderful is unlikely to demonstrate a likelihood of consumer confusion as to the source of pur beverage.absent a likelihood of confusion,the district court concluded that pom wonderful is unlikely both to succeed on the merits of its trademark claim and to meet its burden of proving the other factors for issuance of a preliminary injunction that a preliminary injunction is necessary to prevent irreparable harm to pom wonderful that a balancing of the equities favors a preliminary injunction and that a preliminary injunction is necessary to protect the public interest.the district court accordingly denied the motion for a preliminary injunction,and pom wonderful filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we review for abuse of discretion the district court order denying pom wonderful motion for a preliminary injunction.alliance for the wild rockies cottrell,cir.this case implicates two of the ways in which a district court might abuse its discretion.see id.first,a district court abuses its discretion if the court rests its decision on an erroneous legal standard.id.to determine whether a district court abused its discretion in this way,we review legal conclusions de novo.id.second,a district court abuses its discretion if the court rests its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.id.to determine whether a district court abused its discretion in this way,we review factual findings for clear error.id.clear error results from a factual finding that was illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.dreyfus,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,we defer to a district court factual findings unless,based on the entire evidence,we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.lahoti vericheck,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
because de novo review is more stringent than clear error review,it is important to determine which standard applies before considering whether the district court abused its discretion in this case.pom wonderful argues that de novo review applies because the district court decision to deny injunctive relief was grounded in a number of asserted legal errors that the district court committed in applying the sleekcraft factors.we disagree.although legal standards certainly inform a district court application of the sleekcraft factors,ninth circuit precedent requires us to review the district court findings for clear error.
in levi strauss blue bell,we held unequivocally that the clearly erroneous standard should be applied in reviewing a trial court determination concerning likelihood of confusion,cir en banc.since levi strauss,we have further clarified that a district court individual findings which guide the ultimate determination also should be reviewed for clear error.pac.telesis grp.int l telesis commc ns,cir reno air racing ass mccord,cir.
we are bound by that precedent.accordingly,in reviewing the district court decision for an abuse of discretion,we consider whether the district court clearly erred in finding that pom wonderful is unlikely to demonstrate a likelihood of consumer confusion.
iii.analysis 
we now turn our attention to the issue on appeal whether the district court abused its discretion in denying pom wonderful motion for a preliminary injunction.a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy munaf geren,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in winter natural resources defense council,the supreme court announced a test that a party seeking a preliminary injunction must satisfy.under the winter test,the moving party must establish that it is likely to succeed on the merits it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief the balance of equities tips in its favor and an injunction is in the public interest.id.
likelihood of success 
as a threshold matter,pom wonderful must establish a likelihood of success on the merits of its trademark infringement claim.to prevail on its claim,pom wonderful must demonstrate that it has a protected ownership interest in the pom mark,and pur use of the word is likely to cause consumer confusion,thereby infringing upon pom wonderful rights.see dep t of parks recreation bazaar del mundo,cir.although the district court correctly found that pom wonderful is likely to prove that it has a protected ownership interest in the pom standard character mark the first element of a trademark claim,it committed clear error in finding that pom wonderful is unlikely to demonstrate a likelihood of consumer confusion the second element of a trademark claim.
protected ownership interest 
registration of a mark is prima facie evidence of the validity of the mark,the registrant ownership of the mark,and the registrant exclusive right to use the mark in connection with the goods specified in the registration.see a.when proof of registration is uncontested,the ownership interest element of a trademark infringement claim is met.see sengoku works rmc int l,cir.
the district court correctly found that pom wonderful is likely to prove that it has a protected ownership interest in the word pom because pom wonderful proffered a copy of its pom federal trademark registration.this registration was issued in for use with fruit juices,and pur does not contest the registration on appeal.the uncontested registration therefore establishes not only the validity of the pom mark and pom wonderful ownership of the mark,but also pom wonderful exclusive right to use the mark in connection with fruit juices see a.
importantly,pom wonderful exclusive right to use the pom mark covers all design variations of the word because pom was registered as a standard character mark standard character registrations are federal mark registrations that make no claim to any particular font style,color,or size of display.citigroup capital city bank.because a word registered in standard characters is not limited to any particular rendition of the mark,in re mighty leaf tea,internal quotation marks omitted,the registration covers the word per se,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.updated.therefore,pom wonderful exclusive right to use its pom standard character mark is extremely broad,covering the word in all types of depictions.
likelihood of consumer confusion 
despite pom wonderful exclusive right to use all design variations of its pom standard character mark,establishing a protected ownership interest is only half the battle in a trademark infringement claim.brookfield commc ns,coast entm t,cir.to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits,pom wonderful also must show that a reasonably prudent consumer in the marketplace is likely to be confused as to the origin of pur beverage and to associate that beverage with pom wonderful.see dreamwerks prod,skg studio,cir.we look to the following eight sleekcraft factors for guidance in assessing the likelihood of consumer confusion strength of the protected mark proximity and relatedness of the goods type of goods and the degree of consumer care similarity of the protected mark and the allegedly infringing mark marketing channel convergence evidence of actual consumer confusion defendant intent in selecting the allegedly infringing mark and likelihood of product expansion.amf sleekcraft boats,cir,abrogated on other grounds by mattel walking mountain,cir.
importantly,although these sleekcraft factors channel the analytical process,they do not necessarily dictate a result.entrepreneur media,smith,cir.because the factors are fluid,a plaintiff need not satisfy every factor,provided that strong showings are made with respect to some of them.surfvivor media,survivor,cir.thus,despite the important role that the sleekcraft factors play in determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists,it is the totality of facts in a given case that is dispositive.entrepreneur media,at internal quotation marks omitted.
our evaluation of the sleekcraft factors and of the totality of the facts in this case leads us to conclude that the district court clearly erred and therefore abused its discretion when it found that pom wonderful failed to demonstrate that it is likely to show a likelihood of consumer confusion.although the district court correctly found that the strength of mark,relatedness of goods,and degree of consumer care factors weighed in favor of pom wonderful,it incorrectly found that the similarity of marks,marketing channel convergence,actual confusion,defendant intent,and product expansion factors weighed against pom wonderful.when these errors are corrected and the totality of the facts is considered,it is clear that pom wonderful is likely to demonstrate a likelihood of consumer confusion.
strength of mark 
we begin our analysis by examining the strength of pom wonderful pom mark.the district court correctly found that this factor weighs in pom wonderful favor.the scope of a mark trademark protection depends on its strength,with stronger marks receiving greater protection than weak ones.entrepreneur media,at see also brookfield,at.
to determine the strength of pom wonderful pom mark,we begin by placing it on the conceptual distinctiveness spectrum.see brookfield,at.on this spectrum,the most distinctive marks,arbitrary and fanciful marks receive the most trademark protection,whereas the least distinctive marks,generic marks receive no trademark protection.entrepreneur media,at.suggestive and descriptive marks lie between these two extremes,with suggestive marks being entitled to greater protection than descriptive marks.id.unlike descriptive marks,which define qualities or characteristics of a product in a straightforward way,suggestive marks convey impressions of goods that require the consumer to use imagination or any type of multistage reasoning to understand the mark significance.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court correctly found that the pom mark is suggestive because the word pom which is not ascribed independent meaning by conventional dictionaries requires customers to use some additional imagination and perception to decipher the nature of pom wonderful goods.this finding,however,does not by itself render the pom mark strong because suggestive marks,although stronger than descriptive or generic marks,are still presumptively weak.brookfield,at.however,we next consider whether the pom mark has achieved sufficient marketplace recognition to transform it into a strong mark.see id.explaining that placement within the conceptual distinctiveness spectrum is not the only determinant of a mark strength and that actual marketplace recognition can transform a suggestive mark into a strong mark see also entrepreneur media,at explaining that suggestive marks may be strengthened by such factors as extensive advertising,length of exclusive use,and public recognition internal quotation marks omitted.
considering the national scope of pom wonderful sales and marketing efforts,the district court correctly found that pom wonderful enjoys sufficient marketplace recognition to render its pom mark commercially strong.pom wonderful is the leading of pomegranate juice nationwide and in several major cities.since when pom wonderful first acquired the exclusive right to use all iterations of the pom mark in connection with fruit juices pom wonderful has sold more than million bottles of juice.and,pom wonderful extensively markets its products through a wide variety of outlets,including television and newspaper ads,web media,billboards,trade shows,and charity events.in light of this evidence,which is uncontested on appeal,the district court correctly found that pom wonderful is likely to demonstrate that the pom mark is strong.
relatedness of goods 
the district court also correctly found that pom wonderful is likely to demonstrate that its juice beverages are related to pur energy drink.related goods or services are those which would be reasonably thought by the buying public to come from the same source if sold under the same mark.rearden llc rearden commerce,cir quoting sleekcraft,at.to satisfy the relatedness factor,parties need not be direct competitors,see also entrepreneur media,at explaining that goods are related when both companies offer products relating to the same general industry,so long as the goods are similar in use and function,sleekcraft,at.
the district court correctly found and pur does not contest that beverages and energy drinks are sufficiently complementary and related that a reasonable consumer could connect them and be confused regarding the source of the products.both beverages are or,and marketed for their healthful properties.although pur carbonated energy drink is somewhat different from pom wonderful juice beverages,the use and function of these products is clearly related.accordingly,the district court correctly weighed this factor in pom wonderful favor.
degree of consumer care 
we further conclude that the district court correctly found that pom wonderful is likely to demonstrate that consumers exercise a low degree of care and sophistication when selecting inexpensive,beverages like pom wonderful juices or pur energy drink.unlike purchasers of expensive goods whom we expect to be more discerning and less easily confused purchasers of inexpensive goods are likely to exercise less care,thus making confusion more likely.brookfield,at.here,the district court found that the beverages at issue cost between and,and neither party disputes this finding on appeal.accordingly,the district court properly weighed this factor in pom wonderful favor because consumers are likely to exercise a low degree of care when purchasing either company inexpensive pomegranate beverages.
similarity of marks 
the district court,however,clearly erred in finding that the factor weighed against pom wonderful.this factor is always important in determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists because when marks are entirely dissimilar,there is no likelihood of confusion.id.at.accordingly,as the similarities between two marks increase,so too does the likelihood of confusion.see,walt disney,cir.the following axioms define and delimit the similarity analysis similarity is best evaluated by appearance,sound,and meaning marks should be considered in their entirety and as they appear in the and similarities weigh more heavily than differences.see entrepreneur media,at.with these constraints in mind,it is clear that the similarity factor weighs in pom wonderful favor.
turning first to the appearance of the pom mark on the left and the mark on the right,the marks possess many obvious visual similarities.
most significantly,each mark is comprised of the same three letters.these three letters are presented in the same order,with a stylized second letter,the o in pom is heartshaped,and the o in pom has a breve over it.in addition,the letters in both marks are uniformly cased,they are either all uppercase,or all lowercase and presented in a simplistic,white front that is offset by a dark maroon background.
admittedly,the marks also possess some visual dissimilarities,particularly when we consider the marks in the context of their respective labels,with the pom wonderful bottle on the left,the front of the pur can in the center,and the back of the pur can on the right.
as these images reveal,the presentation of the marks differs in terms of prominence,font,size,and capitalization,pom is prominently displayed at the top of the bottle in thicker font and larger uppercase letters,whereas pom is placed near the bottom of the front of the in slimmer font and smaller lowercase letters.in addition,the middle letter in each mark is stylized differently,the o in pom is shaped like a heart and is with red color,whereas the o in pom has a breve over it and is not with color.
however,because l ooks are everything,we next compare the marks sound and meaning.brookfield,at.as for the sound of the marks,the district court found that pom and pom are pronounced in precisely the same manner.because neither party contests this finding on appeal,we agree that the marks are aurally identical.
as for the meaning of the marks,the district court found that pom and pom mean precisely the same thing,as each refers to pomegranate flavoring ingredients.order.because neither party contests this finding on appeal,we agree that the marks are semantically identical.this similarity is particularly noteworthy because c loseness in meaning can itself substantiate a claim of similarity of trademarks.sleekcraft,at 
balancing the marks many visual similarities,perfect aural similarity,and perfect semantic similarity more heavily than the marks visual dissimilarities as we the similarity factor weighs heavily in pom wonderful favor.and,because a lesser degree of similarity is required when a trademark holder mark is strong,the commercial strength of the pom mark amplifies the significance of the marks many similarities.see ebay,cir t he fact that the similarity involves the use of a much stronger mark would make that similarity weigh more heavily in the analysis of this factor.internal quotation marks omitted.mistakenly weighing the marks differences more heavily than their similarities,the district court clearly erred in finding that the similarity of marks factor weighed against pom wonderful.
marketing channel convergence 
the district court also clearly erred in finding that the marketing channel convergence factor weighed against pom wonderful.just as visual,aural,and semantic similarities between marks increase the likelihood of confusion,so too do convergent marketing channels.sleekcraft,at.in assessing marketing channel convergence,courts consider whether the parties customer bases overlap and how the parties advertise and market their products,con stan,cir.marketing channels can converge even when different submarkets are involved so long as the general class of purchasers exposed to the products overlap.see sleekcraft,at finding convergence where both companies sold boats to authorized retail dealers in diverse localities,used the same sales methods,advertised extensively through different national magazines,and priced their products almost identically.
here,it is likely that pom wonderful will be able to show that both companies use parallel market channels.first,both companies sell their products in supermarkets located throughout the united states.as the seller of pomegranate juice,pom wonderful sells its products all over the country and in key cities such as los angeles,chicago,new york,boston,atlanta,dallas,pittsburgh,and charlotte.pur,in turn,sells its products to distributors and supermarkets in alaska,washington,idaho,montana,north dakota,south dakota,minnesota,indiana,michigan,ohio,nevada,arizona,new mexico,texas,utah,and colorado.in addition to selling their products in at least one overlapping state texas both companies sell their products in an overlapping supermarket chain albertson.although it is unclear whether pom wonderful and pur products are sold simultaneously in the same albertson stores,this uncertainty does not alter our analysis because a channel of trade is not limited to identical stores or agents.see century real estate century life of,explaining that a channel of trade includes the same type of distribution channel and that channels converge when products are sold under opposing marks in supermarkets and grocery stores across the country.
second,the products at issue are highly similar.both companies sell or beverages that are inexpensive and marketed to consumers.see lindy pen bic pen,cir finding market channel convergence where the goods at issue pens were essentially interchangeable,inexpensive,and disposable.although pom wonderful advertises its products using a much broader range of outlets than pur uses,the similarities between the products suggest an overlapping general class of consumers.
because pom wonderful and pur sell highly similar products in supermarkets located across the country,the marketing channel convergence factor weighs in pom wonderful favor.the district court clearly erred in finding that this factor weighed against pom wonderful,mistakenly requiring pom wonderful to prove that its beverages were sold in the very same stores as pur pom beverage.although such proof would surely increase the likelihood of consumer confusion,the absence of identical channels does not,by itself,undermine pom wonderful likelihood of proving that the marketing channels converge.
actual confusion,defendant intent,product expansion 
turning to the remaining sleekcraft factors actual confusion,defendant intent,and product expansion we determine that the district court clearly erred by weighing these factors against pom wonderful when,in the context of this case,these factors are simply neutral.although the district court correctly found that pom wonderful failed to adduce evidence of actual past confusion between its products and pur products,of pur intent to deceive when it adopted the mark,or of either party plans to expand their products into new markets,the district court incorrectly found that the absence of such proof weighed against pom wonderful.
failing to prove instances of actual confusion is not dispositive against a trademark plai
