the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann creates and assigns top level domains tlds,such as and.in,icann accepted applications for the creation of new tlds.this suit alleges that the application round violated federal and california law.the district court dismissed the complaint,and we affirm.
factual background 
top level domains 
each internet website is assigned a unique internet protocol ip numerical address.for ease of searching,websites also have alphanumeric domain names,such as.the portion before the dot nytimes is called the second level domain.the portion after the dot com is the tld.
there are three main types of tlds sponsored tlds such as.gov and,restricted to users who meet specified criteria tlds such as.uk or.fr,controlled by sovereign nations and generic tlds such as and,those at issue in this case,open to all users.individual generic tlds are operated by registries,such as verisign,which sell the ability to register a domain name with a particular tld and maintain a zone file,or registry,of all the domain names associated with that tld.these registries approve registrars,such,to sell domain names incorporating those tlds to the public.
a domain name system dns links each of these unique domain names with the ip address corresponding to that website.when an internet user searches for a domain name,the dns converts the domain name to the ip address by searching a list of tlds called the root zone file the root.additional tlds are made available by organizations other than icann on alternative root files.however,alternative root files can only be accessed through special settings not routinely employed by most internet users.thus,the vast majority of internet users can only access websites with tlds included in the root.when the complaint in this case was filed,icann included eight generic tlds on the root.
the dns and the root were initially managed by the national science foundation.see daniela michele spencer,note,much ado about nothing icann new gtlds,berkeley tech.in,the national science foundation transferred control to the department of commerce doc.the doc later issued a white paper proposing that management be transferred to a private,corporation.see management of internet names and addresses,the white paper suggested that the corporation board of directors should be balanced to equitably represent the interests of ip number registries,domain name registries,domain name registrars,the technical community,internet service providers isps,and internet users commercial,and individuals from around the world.id.at see also michael froomkin mark lemley,icann and antitrust.
in,the doc contracted with icann,a corporation,to manage the internet assigned numbers authority iana.see justin lepp,note,icann escape from antitrust liability,froomkin lemley,supra,at.icann thereby obtained the authority to operate the dns and the root,add new tlds to the root,and determine which registries would operate existing tlds.the memorandum of understanding between the doc and icann reserved the doc right to withdraw recognition of icann.see froomkin lemley,supra,at.in,the memorandum lapsed and the doc formally relinquished control over dns policy to icann.see lepp,supra,at 
icann is controlled by a board of directors with qualifications along the lines proposed in the white paper many are industry insiders.the government has no formal input into the selection of the directors.see froomkin lemley,supra,at.
is a registry specializing in expressive tlds,such as.art.food.magic.music.now,and.sucks.according to the complaint,business model contemplates the simultaneous operation of a significant number of tlds.none of tlds is currently available on the root.
d.the and application rounds 
in,icann first solicited applications for new tlds.the application instructions were seven pages,the fee was,and a single application could seek multiple tlds.the application included a release of all liability against icann.applied for tlds.icann approved only seven new tlds,none of which was awarded to.
in,icann again accepted applications for new tlds.this time,the application guidebook was pages in length,the fee was,and each application could seek only one tld.unsuccessful applicants from the round received an credit on one application,but were required to waive any claims arising from the round.did not apply in because the financial and procedural costs were too high.as in,applications for new tlds in came largely from industry insiders.
the list of tlds applied for by others in included tlds currently in use by.as of the filing of the complaint,icann had not announced which new tlds will be included on the root 
procedural background 
in,filed a complaint in the central district of california,alleging that icann violated sections and of the sherman act,the lanham act,the california cartwright act,and the california business and professions code in connection with the application round.the complaint also alleged common law trademark,unfair competition,and tortious interference claims.
in,the district court granted icann motion to dismiss the complaint,holding that the trademark and unfair competition claims failed to present a justiciable case or controversy,and that the other claims failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted the district court dismissed the sherman act claim with prejudice,and granted leave to amend as to all other claims.after elected not to amend,final judgment was entered in favor of icann.this timely appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over this appeal under.we review de novo dismissals for failure to state a claim,coal.for icann transparency,verisign,cir icann transparency,and for absence of a justiciable case or controversy,laub dep t of interior,cir.all allegations of material fact are taken as true and are construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.icann transparency,at.
iii.sherman act 
section of the sherman act prohibits conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce.a claim requires a contract,combination or conspiracy among two or more persons or distinct business entities which is intended to restrain or harm trade which actually injures competition and harm to the plaintiff from the anticompetitive conduct.brantley nbc universal,f d,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because does not prohibit all unreasonable restraints of trade but only restraints effected by a contract,combination,or conspiracy,the crucial question is whether the challenged anticompetitive conduct stems from independent decision or from an agreement,tacit or express.bell atl.twombly,u,alterations,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.
a complaint asserting a claim must allege facts plausibly suggesting not merely consistent with a conspiracy.id.at.it is not enough merely to include conclusory allegations that certain actions were the result of a conspiracy the plaintiff must allege facts that make the conclusion plausible.see kendall visa,cir.this standard does not impose a probability requirement,but simply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement.see twombly,at.
the complaint in this case alleges that the rules and procedures governing the application round were the result of a conspiracy between icann,its board members,and industry insiders.as is common,the complaint includes no direct allegation of an agreement among the alleged.see oltz peter cmty,cir.rather,the complaint conspiracy assertion rests on the following alleged circumstantial evidence a some of icann board members have known,vested interests in the economic performance of the tld registries b icann and its board designed the rules for the application round c the application price was significantly higher than the price,and the rules more complex d the application round price and rules conflicted with business model e the majority of applicants were industry insiders and large technology companies and f some potential applicants,including,were deterred from applying in by the price and rules.
