opinion of the court 
in this appeal,we consider whether a federal district court properly relied on federal rule of civil procedure b to vacate a default judgment entered by another district court.we conclude that it did not,and we will remand so that it may consider whether to set aside the default judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b.
budget blinds,bbi is a california corporation that franchises mobile window covering businesses throughout the united states.according to an affidavit that bbi chief operating officer filed with the district court for the central district of california,bbi was founded in and had about territories and licensees nationwide as of october,the date of the affidavit.bbi owns and licenses two trademarks that it has registered with the principal register of the united states patent and trademark office the name budget blinds registered on december,and a service mark consisting of the words budget blinds in a specific font and configuration registered on february.
valerie white owns a new jersey corporation called val u blinds,that focuses on the design and installation of window blinds.according to an affidavit that white filed with the district court for the district of new jersey,she operates this business from a home office in her basement and garage,and her sales are limited to areas of new jersey.the affidavit further states that she conducted business from to june,as budget blinds or budget blinds of nj,and that she registered her business as a new jersey domestic corporation in september under the name budget blinds of nj,she changed her business name to val u blinds pursuant to the settlement agreement that we describe below.
in a letter to valerie white dated november,bbi legal manager stated that white use of the name budget blinds was a violation of bbi federal,state,and common law trademark rights and was likely to cause public confusion about the origin of white goods.white attorney ronald nelson responded in a letter dated december,that white had used the name budget blinds since,prior to bbi first use of the name.nelson letter added that white had established budget blinds as a common law trademark in the new jersey counties served by her business and that bbi franchisees in this area were infringing her rights by using the name.in a letter to nelson dated february,bbi counsel questioned the existence of a common law trademark and stated that bbi is prepared to bring a lawsuit in california pursuant to the lanham act to enjoin your client infringing activities if the parties could not reach a resolution.
after several additional communications,the parties entered a settlement agreement on april.under the agreement,bbi would pay white and budget blinds of nj,referred to as the corporation in the agreement for the purchase and transfer of any and all interest,claim,or ownership in or relating to the trade name and service mark budget blinds and any confusingly similar names or marks.section of the agreement provided that after june,white and the corporation shall not operate or do business under the trade name and service mark budget blinds or any other name or in any manner that might tend to give the general public the impression that white or her business is in any way associated or affiliated with bbi,or any of the businesses conducted by it or other franchisees or licensees of the marks.among other things,section required white to change her existing corporation name from budget blinds of new jersey,to bb of nj,to conduct all future business using a new corporation to be established under the name val u blinds,and to remove the budget blinds trade name and mark,as well as confusingly similar names or marks,from her company advertising,signs,letterheads,stationery,printed matter,and other forms.most importantly for purposes of this litigation,section f of the agreement also instructed white to take specific steps to disassociate her company telephone number from the name budget blinds.at the time of the agreement,the yellow pages directories for burlington,gloucester,and camden counties listed a phone number for white company next to the name budget blinds.to address this situation,section f of the agreement provided in relevant part 
promptly after execution of this agreement,white,the corporation and blinds shall direct verizon in writing,with a copy to counsel for bbi,i that all of the said three advertisements shall not be renewed in the said three county editions,or elsewhere and ii that customers calling directory assistance in any of those three counties or anywhere else on or after june,should no longer be given the phone number for white company or any other number related to or affiliated with white,the corporation,or blinds in response to an inquiry for the telephone number of budget blinds.from thereafter,upon the reasonable request of bbi,white,the corporation and blinds shall provide similar written directions to other directory publishers including publishers of directories identified by bbi.
in addition to these substantive provisions,the agreement stated that white and her corporations hereby irrevocably appoint bbi as their respective lawful with authority to file any document in the name of and on behalf of white,the corporation or blinds for the purpose of taking any of the actions required by this section upon the event of a default.finally,the agreement contained a clause this settlement agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of california.
white says that she made a effort to comply with her obligations under the agreement,including those in section f related to her telephone number.the record contains a letter dated may,from white attorney to verizon customer service directing verizon not to renew or republish their existing advertisements in all yellow pages including burlington,gloucester,camden and middlesex county editions in which they have used the phrase budget blinds in whole or in part.the letter also directs verizon to instruct directory assistance,beginning june,to answer all inquiries for budget blinds by not providing the telephone numbers of my client the record includes similar letters addressed to and,both of which are dated june.
nonetheless,verizon reprinted the listing that provided the phone number for white company under the name budget blinds in the updated print editions of its yellow pages directories for burlington,gloucester,and camden counties and the corresponding online directories.in a letter dated february,bbi counsel informed white counsel that the continuing existence of these listings was a violation of the agreement,and that it appears that the only way to remedy this violation is for your client to assign to bbi or to a franchisee designated by bbi the telephone number for white company.in response,white counsel proposed setting up a recording that would give callers to this telephone number a choice between connecting to white company or to the local bbi franchisee.bbi rejected this proposal in a letter dated february,reiterating its demand that white assign the number to bbi and stating that it would deem white and her company to be in breach of the agreement as long as there is any circumstance under which a person looking in a current telephone book and calling a number listed under the name budget blinds will reach your clients.in a letter dated march,white counsel informed bbi that,although white would do everything that she considered reasonably possible to mitigate fully the effects of the unauthorized,she would not surrender the phone number itself.
bbi filed a complaint against white,val u blinds,and budget blinds of nj,defendants,which was docketed on april,in the united states district court for the central district of california,southern division.the complaint lists eight causes of action breach of contract specific performance federal trademark infringement state trademark infringement federal false designation of origin federal trademark dilution state trademark dilution and violation of the california unfair competition act.as relief,bbi requested an injunction against further violation of the agreement actual and punitive damages,an accounting of defendants profits,treble damages,costs of suit,attorneys fees,and interest.the complaint asserts that venue is proper in the central district of california because a substantial part of the events giving rise to budget blinds claims occurred within this district in that the harm to budget blinds has occurred in this district and the defendants have intentionally directed their actions toward budget blinds,which is headquartered in this district.the defendants did not file a response to the complaint even though bbi sent them notice of it.white counsel characterizes this as an intentional decision,motivated in part by white limited resources,to ignore the complaint on the ground that the california court allegedly lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendants.
on october,the district court for the central district of california entered a default judgment against the defendants,granting bbi the injunctive relief that it requested in its complaint and in monetary relief bbi registered this default judgment in the district court for the district of new jersey on november.on january,bbi gave the defendants notice that it would file a motion on february in the district court for the district of new jersey for an order directing the turnover of funds from white checking account to bbi in the amount specified in the judgment.on january,the defendants gave notice that they would file a in the new jersey district court to vacate the default judgment,and they filed a brief in opposition to the turnover motion and in support of the.in this brief,the defendants asserted that the default judgment should be declared null and void because the california district court had lacked personal jurisdiction over them.in support of this brief,white submitted an affidavit explaining inter alia that neither she nor her company had ever physically entered california,owned property in california,solicited business in california,purchased or sold any goods in california,or even maintained an internet website.both the brief and white affidavit asserted that an earlier draft of the agreement contained a provision granting white consent to personal jurisdiction in the central district of california but that the defendants refused to allow inclusion of this provision in the final agreement.bbi filed a memorandum of law on january opposing the defendants to vacate the default judgment and arguing that the california court had personal jurisdiction over the defendants.
on april,the district court for the district of new jersey issued an opinion and order in response to the parties motions.see budget blinds white,dist.lexis,wl.instead of resolving the personal jurisdiction issue,the district court vacated the default judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b,which provides on motion and just terms,the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for any other reason that justifies relief.to decide the rule b issue,the district court employed a test derived from harad aetna casualty surety,cir when determining whether to vacate a default judgment,a court should consider the following factors whether the defendant has a meritorious defense whether culpable conduct of the defendant led to the default and whether the plaintiff will be prejudiced.budget blinds,dist.lexis,at,wl,at citing harad,at.first,the district court found that the defendants had an extremely meritorious defense,stating the facts establish that white fully complied with her obligations under the settlement agreement and therefore the provision in the agreement staying all litigation is,most likely,still in effect.dist.lexis,at,wl,at.second,the district court concluded that the culpability factor arguably benefits either party because white had more than a colorable argument that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction but it would have been prudent for her to appear before the california court to make this argument.id.at,wl,at.third,the district court found that bbi will suffer absolutely no prejudice should the court order vacatur.id.at,wl,at.weighing these three factors,the district court concluded that vacatur was appropriate.id.at,wl,at.
even though the briefs of both parties had focused on personal jurisdiction,the new jersey district court did not decide this issue,explaining in a footnote that t he court need not pass on whether the california district court actually possessed personal jurisdiction over white for purposes of a rule b inquiry.it is enough to know that white possessed more than a colorable argument that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction.id.at,wl,at.the district court did,however,grant bbi reasonable legal fees and costs associated with obtaining the default judgment and registering the judgment in this court,in part because a prudent attorney would have responded to bbi complaint despite his or her belief that the california district court lacked personal jurisdiction.id.at,wl,at.accordingly,the district court directed bbi to submit,within days of the order,an affidavit setting forth the details of the fees and costs expended.
on may,bbi filed a timely notice of appeal of the portion of the district court order that vacated the california default judgment.on june,the new jersey district court stayed bbi application for fees and costs pending resolution of this appeal.the district court had jurisdiction over the registration and enforcement of a foreign judgment pursuant to,and we have jurisdiction over bbi appeal of a final order pursuant to.the part of the district court order vacating the default judgment is final within the meaning of,despite the fact that the amount of attorneys fees remains unresolved.see frangos doering equip,cir citing budinich becton dickinson,d.
on may,the defendants filed a notice of of the part of the order that awarded fees and costs to bbi.although neither party questioned the existence of appellate jurisdiction over this portion of the order,we note that the district court has not quantified the amount of attorneys fees,and i t has long been the rule in this circuit that this court lacks jurisdiction to examine the merits of an attorneys fee award where the award has not been quantified.frangos,at.we will vacate the award of fees and costs without considering its merits.the district court granted the award under its inherent power under rule b to impose terms and conditions upon the opening of a judgment.dist.lexis,at,wl,at quoting feliciano reliant tooling,cir.by vacating the order opening the judgment,we vacate these conditions as well.
federal rule of civil procedure c states that a court may set aside a default judgment under rule b.rule b lists six reasons for which a court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding,including the provision in rule b that allows a court to relieve a party from a judgment for any other reason that justifies relief aside from the more specific circumstances described in rules b.we review grants or denials of relief under rule b,aside from those raised under rule b under an abuse of discretion standard.see harris martin,cir.
the power of a court to invoke rule b to vacate its own earlier judgment is unquestioned.as we discuss below,however,it is unclear whether a court has the power to invoke rule b to vacate a judgment when the court in which the judgment is registered the registering court is different from the court that entered the judgment the rendering court.nothing in the text of rule c or rule b suggests that a registering court lacks the power to vacate the judgment of a different rendering court,but as we discuss below,several courts have suggested otherwise.
we decline to establish a categorical rule stating that registering courts lack the power to use rule b to vacate the judgments of rendering courts,but we emphasize that registering courts should exercise this power only under very limited circumstances.even when a court is considering its own judgment,extraordinary circumstances must be present to justify the use of the rule b provision to vacate the judgment.see,gonzalez crosby,d citing ackermann united states.when a court is considering whether to vacate another court judgment under rule b,these circumstances must be even more extraordinary because of the additional interest in comity among the federal district courts.we need not decide exactly how extraordinary a circumstance must be to justify the vacatur of another court judgment.the circumstances of the instant case would not even be extraordinary enough to justify a court decision to vacate its own judgment.it follows,a fortiori,that they are not extraordinary enough to justify vacating the judgment of another court.
several circuits have either held,or stated in dicta,that the power of a federal district court to set aside another district court judgment is limited.
in indian head national bank brunelle,cir,the first circuit held that a registration court errs in entertaining a rule b motion that alleges neither a judgment void for lack of personal jurisdiction nor grounds that would support an independent equitable action.id.at.in indian head,the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania rendered a default judgment against the defendant,conproco corporation.id.at.the plaintiff registered the judgment in the district court for the district of new hampshire pursuant to,and attempted to attach conproco new hampshire bank account.id.instead of directly appealing the judgment or moving in the rendering court to set it aside,conproco moved in the district of new hampshire to set aside the judgment under rule b and rule b,claiming that the default judgment was due to inadvertence and neglect.id.at.the new hampshire district court granted conproco motion after finding that conproco had a valid defense and that the default judgment was not the fault of conproco or its counsel.id.at.the first circuit reversed,explaining that there are indications that the drafters of the rule intended to restrict motion practice under b to the court which rendered judgment,and that deference to the rendering court promotes comity among federal courts,efficient judicial administration in light of the rendering court familiarity with the issues,and simplified collection of judgments.id.the first circuit said that a registering court may grant rule b relief from a different rendering court judgment in only two situations first,when the request for relief is based on grounds that could also support an independent equitable action,id.at,and second,when a request for relief from a default judgment is made under rule b,id.at.conproco request for relief did not fit into these categories,so the first circuit reversed the judgment of the district court granting the relief.id.at.
the seventh circuit went further in board of trustees elite erectors,cir,concluding that a rendering district court may not modify or annul the judgment of another district court under any provision of rule b,including rule b.id.at.elite erectors involved a default judgment rendered in the district court for the eastern district of virginia that the plaintiffs sought to enforce in the district court for the southern district of indiana.id.at.the defendants moved in the indiana district court to annul the judgment under rule b on the ground that the rendering court lacked personal jurisdiction over them.id.the seventh circuit held that any request to annul or modify a judgment under rule b must be presented to the rendering court.id.it proceeded to explain that the parties against whom the virginia district court entered judgment are entitled to resist enforcement in indiana if,but only if,the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia lacked personal or jurisdiction.id.at.but the seventh circuit indicated that resisting enforcement of the judgment in indiana was not the same as formally annulling it under rule b.id.at.the difference is that annulling the judgment would deprive it of its effect in all forums,including the rendering court,whereas successfully resisting the judgment enforcement would deprive it of its effect only in the indiana district court.id.
several other circuits have suggested in dicta that rule b motions should generally be made before the rendering court,but they have not adopted a rigid requirement.in covington industries,resintex,cir,the second circuit held that a registering court could invoke rule b to vacate a rendering court judgment for lack of jurisdiction,but it suggested that registering courts should be more restrained when applying other sections of rule b.see at in the usual case,the court of rendition will be more familiar with the facts than the court of registration and perhaps more conversant with the applicable law.in morris ex rel.rector peterson,cir,the tenth circuit cited indian head for the general rule that a registration court usually defers on rule b motions to the court rendering the judgment,but then applied indian head exception for rule b motions.peterson,at citing indian head,at.in harper macleod solicitors keaty keaty,cir,the fifth circuit held that a registering court may invoke rule b to vacate a rendering court judgment but expressed doubt in dicta that a registering court could do the same with other sections of rule b.see id.at judicial efficiency and comity among district courts often counsel a registering court to defer ruling on rule b motions in favor of the rendering court.in fdic aaronian,cir,the ninth circuit said that r egistering courts generally prefer litigants to bring motions for postjudgment relief in the rendering court,but it concluded that it was proper for a registering court to entertain a challenge to a rendering court judgment on the ground that the judgment was unconstitutional and therefore void id.at.
we are persuaded by the reasoning of the first,second,fifth,seventh,ninth,and tenth circuits to the extent that they conclude that rule b motions other than motions under rule b should generally be raised in the rendering court.nonetheless,we decline to hold that registering courts lack the power in all situations to invoke rule b to set aside judgments rule b exists so that courts may vacate judgments whenever such action is appropriate to accomplish justice,klapprott united states,in situations that are not addressed by the other five clauses of rule b.the drafters of rule b apparently recognized that a provision would be necessary,since it would be impossible to specify all of the scenarios in which justice might require vacatur of a judgment.given the nature of rule b,we do not think that it would be wise to adopt a rule that categorically forbids district courts from vacating the judgments of other district courts under this provision although the interest in comity will usually make it inadvisable for a registering court to vacate a rendering court judgment,we can not rule out the possibility that some set of facts will cause the injustice of enforcing a rendering court judgment to be so great as to outweigh the damage that setting aside the judgment would inflict upon comity we need not decide here what facts would be sufficient,however,because it is clear that the facts of the instant case fall far short of what is necessary to justify vacatur of a rendering court judgment under rule b.
although the text of rule b states simply that a court may grant relief from a final judgment for any other reason that justifies relief,courts have added a requirement that a party seeking rule b relief must demonstrate the existence of extraordinary circumstances that justify reopening the judgment.see,crosby,at.citing ackermann,at.coltec indus.hobgood,cir quoting in re fine paper antitrust,cir.this requirement exists in order to balance the broad language of rule b,which allows courts to set aside judgments for any reason justifying relief,with the interest in the finality of judgments.see in re fine paper antitrust,at mayberry maroney,cir.as we explained above,when a registering court considers the judgment of a different district court,the use of rule b to vacate another court judgment implicates an additional interest in comity,even if the judgment was a default judgment.if the circumstances of a case are not sufficiently extraordinary to outweigh the interest in the finality of judgments,then it follows that the circumstances can not outweigh the interest in finality combined with the interest in comity.
we have explained that a showing of extraordinary circumstances involves a showing that without relief from the judgment,an extreme and unexpected hardship will result.mayberry,at.this hardship requirement may sometimes be satisfied when the judgment precluded an adjudication on the merits.boughner sec y of health,educ.welfare,cir.but extraordinary circumstances rarely exist when a party seeks relief from a judgment that resulted from the party deliberate choices see,coltec,at c ourts have not looked favorably on the entreaties of parties trying to escape the consequences of their own counseled and knowledgeable decisions.see also ackermann,at.petitioner could not show the existence of extraordinary circumstances when he voluntarily chose not to appeal due to the modest expenses that an appeal would require.
in the instant case,the new jersey district court did not mention the extraordinary circumstances requirement in its opinion.we acknowledge that our decision in harad may have contributed to this error by sending confusing signals to the district court regarding the standards for vacating a default judgment.in harad,we reversed the district court decision not to vacate its own earlier default judgment.at.we stated that the decision to vacate a default judgment is left to the sound discretion of the trial court,but that i n exercising this discretion the court must consider whether vacating the default judgment will visit prejudice on the plaintiff,whether the defendant has a meritorious defense,and whether the default was the result of the defendant culpable conduct.id.at.harad makes no reference to any clause in rule b,nor does it consider whether extraordinary circumstances were present.thus,harad may have created the erroneous impression that an exception to the extraordinary circumstances requirement exists when a district court is considering whether to vacate a default judgment,as opposed to a judgment on the merits.
a closer look at harad reveals that its test was not intended to apply to rule b.harad involved a complaint filed by an attorney charles harad and one of his insurance companies home,against another of his insurance companies aetna,seeking a declaratory judgment that aetna had a duty to defend and indemnify harad.at.on december,harad and home served the complaint on aetna at its hartford office rather than the philadelphia office with which they had negotiated previously.id.the hartford office forwarded the complaint to the philadelphia office,and aetna entered an appearance with the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on january,the same day that harad and home filed a request for a default judgment.the district court docketed the default judgment request on january and the entry of appearance on january,and then granted the request for default judgment on january.id.aetna moved to vacate the default judgment,and the parties stipulated that the sole issue to be addressed on the motion was whether aetna had established a meritorious defense to the plaintiffs action.id.the district court then declined to vacate the default judgment,but we reversed,concluding that aetna had a meritorious defense.id.at.although neither the district court opinion,see harad aetna cas.sur,wl.june,nor our opinion cited any federal rule of civil procedure,we see at least two reasons for construing harad as a grant of relief under rule b,which allows relief from a judgment on the basis of mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect,rather than rule b.first,the facts of the case,with the complaint sent to the wrong office and the apparent delay in docketing the entry of appearance,suggest that this was a matter of mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.second,harad obtains its test directly from united states in currency,cir,a case that addresses rule b.see harad,at citing in currency,at.in in currency,we said 
we require the district court to consider the following factors in exercising its discretion in granting or denying a motion to set aside a default under rule c or a default judgment under rule b whether the plaintiff will be prejudiced whether the defendant has a meritorious defense whether the default was the result of the defendant culpable conduct.
in currency,at emphasis added accordingly,we conclude that the district court erred by relying solely on the three factors listed in harad to grant relief under rule b.
appellees assert that emcasco insurance sambrick,cir,provides the appropriate factors for deciding whether to set aside a default judgment.in emcasco,we applied the same three factors that we used in harad,plus a fourth the effectiveness of alternative sanctions.id.at.emcasco does not cite rule b in its review of the district court decision not to vacate a default judgment.as with harad,however,we construe emcasco as describing a standard for vacating a default judgment under rule b,not rule b.first,we think that the default judgment in emcasco could be fairly described as the product of mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.the emcasco district court decided on january,that it would enter a default judgment against the defendant unless he filed an answer by january.at.but the defendant and his counsel were never informed of this decision and instead were erroneously told that they could avert a default judgment merely by entering an appearance,which they did on january.id.given these facts,emcasco was in effect a rule b case.second,most of the cases that emcasco cites in support of its test are applications of rule b.see at thus,emcasco does not provide a test that is applicable to a rule b motion.
we acknowledge that default judgments are generally disfavored in our circuit.see in currency,at t his court does not favor entry of defaults or default judgments.we require doubtful cases to be resolved in favor of the party moving to set aside the default judgment so that cases may be decided on their merits.quoting tozer charles krause milling,cir.but we can not apply this presumption against default judgments if doing so would be inconsistent with the federal rules of civil procedure or our case law interpreting these rules.because extraordinary circumstances are essential for a grant of rule b relief,a case does not become doubtful when the district court has made no attempt to show that such circumstances exist.
finally,our own review of the record does not suggest that the circumstances of this case are extraordinary as we have defined this term in our case law.the defendants acknowledge that their decision not to contest the california judgment was the result of a deliberate choice.thus,the default judgment can not be said to have created an unexpected hardship.boughner,at.since nothing else in the record appears to qualify as an extraordinary circumstance sufficient to justify setting aside any judgment,let alone one entered by a different court,we will vacate the district court order setting aside the default judgment.
we next confront a question that parallels the one we addressed about rule b does a federal district court have the power to consider a motion to vacate another district court judgment under rule b on the ground that the latter court lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant neither party has contended that the district court lacks this power.nevertheless,we will explain why we hold that this power exists.
rule b allows a court to relieve a party from a final judgment if the judgment is void.a judgment is void within the meaning of rule b if the court that rendered it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant.see marshall bd.of,cir.although there is no question that a court may grant a rule b motion to vacate one of its own judgments,we have not explicitly ruled on whether a court has the power to grant a rule b motion to vacate another court judgment for lack of personal jurisdiction 
five circuits have stated either in holdings or dicta that a registering court has the power to hear a rule b motion.three of these circuits explicitly held that a registering court may vacate a default judgment of a rendering court when the rendering court lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant.covington,at second circuit harper macleod,at fifth circuit peterson,at tenth circuit.the first circuit endorsed the view of these circuits in dicta,recognizing that rule b challenges to default judgments are one of the two exceptions to the general rule that rule b motions must be addressed to the rendering court.see indian head,at.the ninth circuit endorsed a registering court power to vacate a rendering court judgment under rule b,but its holding addressed a rule b motion based on a challenge to the constitutionality of the rendering court judgment rather than the rendering court personal jurisdiction.at.we note that the eastern district of pennsylvania has produced a thorough and opinion in on track transportation,lakeside warehouse trucking,in which it held that a registering court has the power to decide a rule b motion challenging a rendering court default judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.
the seventh circuit is an outlier on this issue.as we discussed above,the seventh circuit concluded in elite erectors that the registering court was free to disregard the judgment,without formally annulling it under rule b,if the rendering court lacked personal or jurisdiction.at.because the registering court can not annul the judgment under rule b,the most it can do is decline to enforce the leaving the judgment in place so that other jurisdictions can enforce it.see id.as the eastern district of pennsylvania noted in on track,this is an impracticable solution.see at.if the rendering court merely issued a default judgment,then it never actually litigated the issue of personal jurisdiction.in contrast,the registering court will have actually litigated the issue.thus,the registering court judgment will have preclusive effect,and a defendant could then move the rendering court to vacate the judgment on the basis that it lacked jurisdiction,using the decision of the registering court offensively.id.this would lead to the same result as vacating the judgment altogether,except with one extra step,along with the expenditure of time and resources that this step would entail.id.at.we see no reason to break with the majority of circuits and embrace the cumbersome process endorsed by the seventh circuit.
finally,we do not think a registering court seriously threatens the interest in comity when it vacates a rendering court default judgment under rule b for lack of personal jurisdiction.if the rendering court did not have personal jurisdiction,then the judgment was not merely erroneous it never should have been entered in the first place.moreover,when the rendering court enters a default judgment based on nothing but one party failure to appear,there is no risk that the courts will reach opposite conclusions on personal jurisdiction because the rendering court was not required to address the issue.finally,as the on track court noted,comity must be balanced against the longstanding principle that a defendant is always free to ignore the judicial proceedings,risk a default judgment,and then challenge that judgment on jurisdictional grounds in a collateral proceeding,citing ins.of,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d.the latter principle would be undermined if we held that rule b actions could only be brought in the rendering court that allegedly lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant.
we now reach the question that the parties originally asked the district court to address whether the california district court possessed personal jurisdiction over the defendants.we have the power to resolve this issue ourselves,rather than remand it to the district court,because we conduct de novo review of jurisdictional issues raised under rule b.see page schweiker,cir.both parties have informed us in their briefs and at oral argument that they would prefer that we resolve the issue rather than remand it.unfortunately,we are unable to do so,because we find that the existence of personal jurisdiction turns on disputed questions of fact that should be resolved by a factfinder.therefore,we remand the matter to the district court,with the hope that the district court will resolve this matter as promptly and as inexpensively for the parties as possible.below we provide an overview of the personal jurisdiction issues in this case,pointing out what we believe are the key factual disputes.
personal jurisdiction in california 
in a diversity action,a california federal district court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant if jurisdiction is proper under california statute and if that exercise of jurisdiction accords with federal constitutional due process principles.fireman fund ins.bank of,cir.california statute provides simply that the court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant on any basis not inconsistent with the california or federal constitution.id.citing civ.proc.the statutory and constitutional requirements therefore merge into a single due process test,which requires that the defendant have certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.id.citing int l shoe washington.internal quotation omitted.as both parties acknowledge,we determine whether this requirement is satisfied by applying a test.the test,as summarized in panavision international toeppen,cir,is as follows 
the nonresident defendant must do some act or consummate some transaction with the forum or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum,thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws the claim must be one which arises out of or results from the defendant activities and exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable.
at citation omitted.bbi contends that all three of these requirements were satisfied as a matter of law 
purposeful availment 
bbi asserts that white has purposefully availed herself of the privilege of conducting activities in california and thereby has invoked the benefits of california law.bbi bases its argument on the settlement agreement as well as the defendants alleged trademark infringement.
purposeful availment through the settlement agreement 
the mere existence of a contract is insufficient to establish minimum contacts.burger king rudzewicz,d if the question is whether an individual contract with an party alone can automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts in the other party home forum,we believe the answer clearly is that it can not.but a contract is typically an intermediate step between past negotiations and future transactions,and burger king instructs that it is these negotiations and contemplated future consequences,along with the terms of the contract and the parties actual course of must be evaluated in determining whether the defendant purposefully established minimum contacts with the forum.id.at.bbi argues that several aspects of the settlement agreement terms,as well as prior negotiations and contemplated future consequences,create minimum contacts.
first,bbi points out that the agreement contains a clause stating that it will be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of california.br.of appellant.as burger king points out,a provision standing alone would be insufficient to confer jurisdiction,but combined with other factors,it may reinforce a party deliberate affiliation with the forum state and the reasonable foreseeability of possible litigation there.at.we must therefore consider other factors before we can decide how much weight to afford to this provision.
second,bbi points out that the defendants negotiated the settlement agreement by telephone and mail with bbi and its attorneys.br.of appellant.interpreting california law,the ninth circuit has said that,ordinarily,use of the mails and telephone simply do not qualify as purposeful activity invoking the benefits and protection of the forum state.roth garcia marquez,cir quoting thos.gonzalez consejo nacional de produccion de costa rica,cir.moreover,an important distinction between the negotiations in burger king and those in the instant case is that the burger king defendant actively sought contract negotiations with a company based in the forum state,whereas white did not reach out to anyone in california until bbi threatened litigation.see burger king,at.eschewing the option of operating an independent local enterprise,rudzewicz deliberately reached out beyond michigan and negotiated with a florida corporation for the purchase of a franchise and the manifold benefits that would derive from affiliation with a nationwide organization.
third,bbi asserts that the defendants established minimum contacts by accepting bbi settlement payment which was wired from a california bank to defendants.br.of appellant.to underscore the importance of this payment,bbi cites a case from the southern district of mississippi,medical assurance of mississippi jackson.jackson involved a suit brought by a medical malpractice insurance company against two alabama residents moore,the victim of a botched operation in mississippi that created a need for additional surgery and jackson,moore attorney.id.at.jackson threatened to sue the insurance company on moore behalf and demanded a settlement.id.after a series of letters and telephone calls,moore agreed to a settlement of from the insurance company in exchange for an absolute release.id.jackson and moore accepted and negotiated the check that the insurance company tendered,but they refused to execute the absolute release that the company had also sent them.id.they returned an altered version of the release form instead.id.at.the insurance company sued jackson and moore in a mississippi federal district court,alleging breach of the settlement agreement.id.at.jackson and moore claimed that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over them because the insurance company had sent the payment and the release documents to alabama.id.the court rejected their claim,pointing out that the check was sent from mississippi and was ultimately paid by a mississippi bank,that the release,which is central to this action was sent from mississippi and was to be returned to mississippi,and that defendants did,in fact,return a modified release document to mississippi.id.moreover,the court pointed out that jackson initiated the transaction by threatening to sue the insurance company.id.at.
despite some superficial similarities,jackson is distinguishable.although white and her attorney,like moore and jackson,accepted payment from a bank located in the forum state in exchange for accepting a settlement agreement,they did not initiate the transaction by threatening to sue a california company also,whereas moore had traveled to mississippi for surgery performed by a mississippi doctor.at,white had not directed any activities toward california before bbi contacted her.thus,even if we regard jackson as persuasive authority,it does not compel a finding of purposeful availment.
fourth,bbi argues that the parties contemplated future consequences.among other things,the agreement states that the defendants hereby irrevocably appoint bbi as their respective lawful with authority to file any document in the name of and on behalf of the defendants for the purpose of taking any of the actions required by section of the agreement upon the event of a default.we agree that the provision suggests that the parties contemplated future consequences to some extent.still,a large gulf exists between the future contacts contemplated by this provision and the extensive future contacts contemplated by the burger king contract.whereas the burger king defendant entered into a carefully structured relationship that envisioned continuing and contacts with burger king in florida,id.at,the settlement agreement merely describes what will happen in the event of default.
in sum,we question whether any of the factors that bbi cites the choice of law clause,the mail and telephone negotiations,the acceptance of the settlement check,and the provision would individually support purposeful availment.the combined force of these factors,however,may be sufficient.on the other hand,white has asserted that the original agreement contained a clause consenting to personal jurisdiction in california that the parties removed at white insistence.if true,this suggests that we should hesitate to read the terms of the contract,especially the clause,as indicative of the reasonable foreseeability of possible litigation in california court see at.bbi contests this fact,and we do not have evidence of it in the record other than white affidavit and brief.therefore,on remand the district court may wish to investigate white claim regarding the contract negotiations,since it could shed light on the extent to which the parties contemplated an ongoing relationship with california,including the possibility of litigation there 
purposeful availment through trademark infringement 
bbi contends that the defendants alleged trademark infringement created personal jurisdiction in california because the defendants purposefully directed their activities toward that forum.br.of appellant.relying on the effects test of calder jones,d,bbi says that purposeful availment exists if the defendant committed an intentional act,expressly aimed at the forum state,causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state.dole food watts,cir summarizing calder effects test.
bbi contends that trademark infringement is treated as an intentional tort for jurisdictional purposes.the first case that bbi cites for this proposition is sebastian int l,russolillo,cm,dist.lexis.in russolillo,the court held that the defendant trademark infringement through the sale of counterfeit goods was intentional because the plaintiff had written a letter to put the defendant on notice of the infringement.dist.lexis,at.bbi claims that russolillo is analogous to the instant case,because bbi informed the defendants of their infringement in,prior to the settlement,and informed them of their continuing infringement on february.the second case that bbi cites is panavision.in panavision,the court stated that although the defendant registration of the plaintiff trademark as a domain name was not sufficient to establish jurisdiction in the forum state,the defendant scheme to register the plaintiff trademarks as his domain names for the purpose of extorting money from the plaintiff was an intentional act directed at the forum state at.the instant case is distinguishable from both russolillo and panavision.in russolillo,the court indicated that it was the explicit warning about trademark infringement,not the act of counterfeiting itself,that rendered the defendant trademark infringement intentional.dist.lexis,at.although bbi also sent a warning to the defendants,the record suggests that the defendants acted in good faith to remedy the alleged infringement.if this is true,then any ongoing infringement was not the result of intentional acts on the defendants we agree with bbi claim that surrendering control of the telephone number was absolutely necessary to prevent further infringement.panavision supports the defendants,because it makes clear that the mere use of another party trademark,registration of domain names and creation of web sites does not constitute an intentional act aimed at the forum state for jurisdictional purposes.at.it is possible,however,that the district court findings of fact will reveal more about whether white behavior can be construed as intentional.
bbi also contends that the defendants behavior was expressly aimed at the forum state.we do not find it immediately obvious why the failure to change new jersey telephone listings and to surrender a new jersey telephone number is behavior expressly aimed at california.but bbi relies on language in bancroft masters augusta national,cir,which states that the expressly aiming requirement is satisfied when the defendant is alleged to have engaged in wrongful conduct targeted at a plaintiff whom the defendant knows to be a resident of the forum state.at.even though the defendants alleged infringement was limited to activities in new jersey,bancroft implies that because it was targeted at franchisees of bbi,a known resident of california,it was therefore expressly aimed at california but panavision suggests a contrary result.given the holding in panavision that the use of a company trademarks in domain names and web sites is not expressly aimed at the forum in which the company has its principal place of business,at,we question whether listings in new jersey telephone directories could be characterized as actions expressly aimed at california.
finally,bbi contends that the brunt of the harm to its reputation and profits is felt in california because california is its principal place of business bbi argues that just because bbi is a california corporation,a jurisdictionally sufficient amount of economic harm is felt in california.see harris rutsky.ins.servs.bell clements,cir for a california corporation whose principal place of business is in california,the brunt of the harm is felt in california.we can not resolve this issue without more evidence.bbi california complaint suggests that the defendants alleged infringement is causing economic harm to bbi as a whole.but white claimed that as of march,her company had not received a single call from anyone confused by the erroneous listing,which would suggest that little economic harm has been inflicted upon the new jersey franchisees,let alone the national entity.without further factfinding,it is impossible to decide which party is correct about the economic effects felt by bbi in california.
does the cause of action arise out of activities 
the next prong of the test for specific jurisdiction is whether the cause of action arises out of activities.although this is a distinct requirement,in this case the analysis is identical to the purposeful availment analysis.bbi has not asserted that white or her company has any connection to california aside from those associated with the causes of action for breach of contract and trademark infringement.thus,if the first prong is satisfied,then the second prong is satisfied as well.
fair play and substantial justice,reasonableness 
if the district court finds that the first two prongs are satisfied,it must consider whether minimum requirements inherent in the concept of fair play and substantial justice may defeat the reasonableness of jurisdiction even if the defendant has purposefully engaged in forum activities.burger king,at.although there is a strong presumption of reasonableness if purposeful availment exists,dole food,at,courts must still consider reasonableness as a separate factor.this is a heavily inquiry.california has identified seven factors that affect reasonableness,none of which are determinative 
the extent of the defendants purposeful interjection into the forum state affairs the burden on the defendant of defending in the forum the extent of conflict with the sovereignty of the defendants state the forum state interest in adjudicating the dispute the most efficient judicial resolution of the controversy the importance of the forum to the plaintiff interest in convenient and effective relief and the existence of an alternative forum.
harris rutsky,at citing nobel indus.ab,cir.most of these factors can not be resolved without factfinding from the district court.for example,the district court might wish to consider the second factor in light of the statements throughout white briefs that it is extremely burdensome for a small business in new jersey with no california connections aside from,perhaps,those created through its dealings with bbi to litigate in california.to decide the fifth factor,the district court should focus on the location of the evidence and witnesses.harris rutsky,at.if most of the evidence and witnesses are located in new jersey,where the alleged infringement occurred,this factor weighs against personal jurisdiction in california.
we will vacate the april,order of the district court for the district of new jersey,including the assessment of fees and costs.we remand this case so that the district court may decide the question that the parties asked it to decide over two years ago whether to set aside the california default judgment for lack of personal jurisdiction.
this case arises out of the context of a registration proceeding,and more fundamentally,involves a collateral attack to a foreign default judgment.it is that the grounds for obtaining collateral relief are extremely limited.the majority,however,holds that registering courts have the power to vacate a foreign judgment rendered by their sister federal courts pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.in doing so,it becomes the first court in the nation to reach this conclusion.because i think this holding potentially creates a circuit split where none existed before,and because i question whether such a broad ruling is necessary under the particular circumstances of this case,i respectfully dissent.
under the circumstances before us,one may only seek to collaterally vacate a default judgment obtained in another jurisdiction based on a challenge to the underlying validity of the judgment.sheet metal workers pension fund elite erectors,cir a party that simply refuses to appear may contend in a later case that the first tribunal lacked jurisdiction is the only issue thus preserved emphasis in original yale indem,cir only void judgments are subject to collateral attack,and a void judgment is only one that is rendered by a court lacking jurisdiction over the default or over the subject matter see also ins.of ireland,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d a defendant is always free to ignore the judicial proceedings,risk a default judgment,and then challenge that judgment on jurisdictional grounds in a collateral proceeding.from this,it naturally follows that registering courts may entertain motions to vacate registered foreign judgments pursuant to rule b,on the basis that the rendering court lacked jurisdiction.see james moore et,moore federal practice c ed d executions and enforcement of judgments the court in which the judgment is registered may determine whether the court which entered the judgment had jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties.this is certainly the view that has been expressly embraced by nearly all of our sister circuits to have squarely confronted the question,and i thus concur with the majority opinion insofar as it adopts this relatively uncontroversial position as third circuit law 
however,the opinion does not stop there,but goes further to hold that registering courts may also consider rule b motions to vacate foreign judgments under certain extraordinary circumstances.here,i must part ways with my majority colleagues.while it is true that the precise contours of the registering court authority to grant rule b relief remain unsettled,i am nevertheless unaware of any court considering the has affirmatively declared such authority to exist for any rule b subsection outside of the b context see charles wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice procedure,at ed the courts have not squarely decided to what extent,if at all,the court in which a judgment is registered can give relief from the judgment under rule b indian head bank of nashua brunelle,cir noting neither the parties nor the court itself could find a single case where a court of registration was willing to entertain directly a rule b motion other than one attacking a default judgment for lack of personal jurisdiction.indeed,the only court directly confronting the issue expressly held to the contrary a registration court errs in entertaining a rule b motion that alleges neither a judgment void for lack of personal jurisdiction nor grounds that would support an independent equitable action.brunelle,at.
this is not surprising,in light of the general rule that notwithstanding the rule silence on the topic,applications for rule b relief must typically be made in the court rendering the judgment.see,james moore et,moore federal practice ed although the rule itself does not expressly so provide,it is clear that the drafters of the rule contemplated that the motion would always be brought in the court and in the action in which the judgment was rendered emphasis added charles wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice procedure,at rule b motions generally made to rendering court.while this does not per se preclude one from challenging the underlying judgment upon registration,registering courts most often deny such challenges without prejudice,referring the parties to litigate the rule b issue in the rendering court.see federal practice procedure,at it is appropriate for the court in the district of registration to decline to pass on the motion for rule b relief and to require the moving party to proceed in the court that gave judgment,united states fluor,cir affirming registration court denial of rule b motion without prejudice.and rightly so.with these legal principles in mind,i think the first circuit holding in brunelle best vindicates the significant comity interests implicated in the registration context while adequately preserving collateral avenues of relief for litigants.
furthermore,even if one agrees with the substance of the majority legal that is at odds with the brunelle registering courts have the power to vacate foreign judgments under certain unspecified extraordinary circumstances pursuant to rule b,the question remains whether this is the appropriate case in which to make such a proclamation.this is especially so when,notwithstanding its articulation of a new rule expanding the bases for which collateral relief may be granted in registration proceedings,the majority nevertheless acknowledges that no extraordinary circumstances exist in this case,in any event,so as to warrant any such relief.it would seem then,that a satisfactory resolution could have been had here without advancing the rule b issue we should have accordingly done simply this.for me,this case begins and ends with the district court vacatur of the default judgment insofar as its decision was based in any part on its perception of the merits of the underlying california action it is axiomatic that when a party purposefully fails to appear in an action on the basis of the belief that the foreign tribunal lacks personal jurisdiction,she waives the right to later contest the underlying merits of that action in a collateral proceeding,elite erectors,at hazen research,omega minerals,cir where the defendant makes no appearance and the judgment goes by default,the defendant may defeat subsequent enforcement in another forum by demonstrating that the judgment issued from a court lacking personal jurisdiction but should the attack fail,the default judgment becomes no less final and determinative on the merits of the controversy than a decree entered after full trial.thus,when the district court considered the merits of the california action below to opine that defendant possesses an extremely meritorious defense warranted vacatur,app.vol.at,it missed the fundamental distinction between direct and collateral attacks.moore federal practice registering court can not look into the substance of the judgment to reexamine its validity.as the restatement cogently explains 
i t is inappropriate to consider the merits of an attack on a judgment when that attack is made in the course of a subsequent action in which the judgment is relied on as a basis of claim or defense.to consider the merits of the attack in such a context is to contravene the general principle that relief from a judgment should be sought in the court that rendered the judgment.
restatement second of judgments cmt.a.
accordingly,although i concur with the majority ultimate disposition of the case,i respectfully dissent from its pronouncements on the general availability of rule b relief.under the particular circumstances here,i would hold that a registration court errs when it vacates a foreign judgment on grounds other than those of voidness or which would otherwise support an independent equitable action.the full faith and credit clause and the weighty interests of comity demand nothing less.
the agreement refers to these listings as advertisements,a term whose connotations may be misleading.according to the agreement itself,the advertisements consisted simply of her company name and phone number in an alphabetical list with other companies names and numbers.
the complaint does not reflect the fact that white had already changed the name from budget blinds of nj,to bb of nj.
bbi complaint does not explicitly demand that white surrender the phone number to bbi or one of its franchisees.instead,it requests that white and her company be enjoined and restrained from violating the agreement,which requires,in summary,without limitation,that the defendants discontinue the use display of the budget blinds marks or similar marks or trade names,in any manner whatsoever.
this amount reflects for treble damages and for attorneys fees and costs.bbi proposed order requested in monetary relief,which would have reflected an additional in compensatory damages,but the california district court deleted this amount from the final order.
our review is plenary when we review determinations under rule b.see page schweiker,cir.
the first circuit pointed to the following language in the advisory committee notes to the amendment that created rule b two types of procedure to obtain relief from judgments are specified in the rules as it is proposed to amend them.one procedure is by motion in the court and in the action in which the judgment was rendered.the other procedure is by a new or independent action to obtain relief from a judgment,which action may or may not be begun in the court which rendered the judgment at citing.advisory committee note.the first circuit explained that the other procedure is a reference to language that now appears under rule d this rule does not limit a court power to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment,order,or proceeding grant relief under to a defendant who was not personally notified of the action or set aside a judgment for fraud on the court.at.these actions had been available in both the rendering court and other courts even before the rule enactment.id.according to the first circuit,the first of the two types of procedure is a reference to rule b motion practice,and the committee language reflects its understanding that this procedure would be limited to the rendering court.see id.
despite this conclusion,the seventh circuit did not explicitly overrule its earlier decision in in re joint eastern southern districts asbestos litigation,cir,which said we note that the authority of the registration court to entertain a motion under rule b appears to be well established.id.at.
in an earlier decision,the ninth circuit indicated that at least some rule b motions must be brought in the rendering court.in first beverages,royal crown cola,cir,the ninth circuit said the proper approach to seeking relief from judgment because of a change in the factual circumstances surrounding this case would be to make a rule b motion or a motion to reopen to hear additional proof.such motions must be directed in the first instance to the district court.id.at.aaronian does not cite first beverages.
we do not consider in this opinion whether a registering court ever has the power to set aside judgments under rules b,or.
we also do not think that the language of the advisory committee,as discussed in indian head,at,requires such a rule.the words of the advisory committee are not as important as the text of the rule,which imposes no limitations on a court ability to set aside another court judgment.moreover,we note that even though the first circuit afforded weight to the advisory committee language,it did not follow it literally,since indian head acknowledged that a court may use rule b to vacate the judgment of another court that lacked personal jurisdiction.see id.at.
when the judgment is not a default judgment,an additional interest exists e
