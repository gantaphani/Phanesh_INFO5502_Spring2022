the parties to this dispute over trademarks and the packaging of animal crackers have been negotiating a settlement of their dispute over the past eleven continuing their businesses and continuing to litigate.today,we only add a chapter to their saga,unable to find a principled closing.so,we address trademarks,licenses,and unenforceable agreements to agree,and final judgments are anything but that.
frank liberto manufactures and distributes snack foods,employing a design with red and yellow stripes on his packaging since.liberto registered his mark with the patent and trademark office in.stauffer biscuit,is a snack food company specializing in animal crackers.in,stauffer began using red and yellow stripes on packaging similar to liberto mark,in connection with the sale of its animal crackers.
in,stauffer applied for registration of its package design.although the principal register of trademarks already contained liberto mark,stauffer application was approved and published in the pto official gazette.liberto did not file an opposition to the registration within the statutory period,and stauffer registration,number the registration issued on october.stauffer mark became incontestably registered after october.
nonetheless,in march of,liberto contacted stauffer,alleging that stauffer use of the red and yellow stripes infringed upon his trademark.stauffer denied the allegation,and liberto filed his initial action against stauffer,the litigation.
over three years later on may,the parties executed a settlement agreement,by which liberto agreed to inter alia dismiss his infringement action,to grant an exclusive license to stauffer for use of the striped design on stauffer packaging.stauffer also agreed to enforce the mark against other food manufacturers.despite its incontestable right to use its own mark,stauffer agreed to pay liberto royalties for use of his design in connection with the sale of animal crackers.stauffer further agreed to join liberto in a motion asking the district court to adopt the settlement agreement as its final judgment in the litigation.
the settlement agreement also contemplated that the parties would continue to negotiate the specific terms of the license to be agreed upon.after executing the agreement,but before the joint motion for final judgment was filed,the parties negotiated the details of the license for approximately ten months without success.liberto then urged the district court to approve the settlement agreement and enter judgment.stauffer did not oppose the request,and,on march,the district court entered the settlement agreement as final judgment in the case.neither party appealed,ending the litigation without an agreement over the details of the license.
after judgment was entered,the parties continued to negotiate the details of the license agreement.in particular,the parties could not agree whether stauffer owed payments from the date the settlement agreement was originally executed.without resolving that issue,stauffer agreed that it was obligated to make quarterly royalty payments from the date of final judgment and issued a check in june to confirm the agreement,followed by the first quarterly payment in august.
meanwhile,liberto asked the district court to order arbitration of the issue.stauffer did not object,and the court ordered the parties into arbitration.
in november,before any progress was made in the arbitration proceeding,stauffer informed liberto that it would make no further royalty payments.by the consent of both parties,the arbitration was held in abeyance for the next months,in order to permit the parties to resolve their differences through negotiation.by may,however,no agreement had been reached,and liberto sought to resume arbitration.
stauffer attempted to expand the scope of the arbitration proceedings to visit issues of the litigation,such as ownership of the mark,but the district court confined the arbitration to the issue.finally,in october,the arbitrator concluded that the obligation to make royalty payments to liberto commenced upon execution of the settlement agreement.
while the arbitration was pending,liberto filed this action,the litigation,seeking payment of royalties under the settlement agreement.liberto plead federal trademark infringement,including,common law trademark infringement,unfair competition,dilution,and bad faith negotiation.so,when negotiations dissolved for the last time in,the parties returned to the district court to resolve any and all remaining disputes between them.
in april,while the litigation was in progress,liberto gave notice to stauffer that its license to use the striped mark on its packaging would be terminated in may,if it failed to pay accrued royalties back to the execution date of the settlement agreement.stauffer refused,and liberto formally terminated the license,although stauffer continued to use the design.
then,on march,the district court ruled on the parties for summary judgment,granting partial judgment for liberto on his claim of federal trademark infringement,texas trademark infringement,trademark dilution,unfair competition,and breach of contract.the district court enjoined stauffer from use of the striped design and ordered the surrender or destruction of all packaging,advertisements,or other materials on which the mark appeared.stauffer appeals the grant of injunctive relief.
we review a grant of injunctive relief for abuse of discretion findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.the district court abuses its discretion if it relies on clearly erroneous factual findings when deciding to grant or deny the permanent injunction relies on erroneous conclusions of law when deciding to grant or deny the permanent injunction,or misapplies the factual or legal conclusions when fashioning its injunctive relief.
in support of the injunction,the district court held that the settlement agreement was an enforceable contract under texas law.stauffer argues that the settlement agreement is an unenforceable agreement to agree.we agree.
the validity of the settlement agreement turns largely on the text of the agreement itself,with repairs to the reading given it by the parties in their performance,such as stauffer quarterly royalty payment made under the settlement agreement.
under texas law,settlement agreements are enforceable in the same manner as any other written contract.a contract is legally binding only if its terms are sufficiently definite to enable a court to understand the parties obligations.an agreement to make a contract at a future time is enforceable if it is specific as to all essential terms.by contrast,where an agreement leaves essential terms open for future negotiations,it is not a binding contract but,rather,an unenforceable agreement to agree.thus,whether the settlement agreement is an enforceable contract turns upon whether its essential terms are set forth in the agreement or are left to future negotiation.
whether a given term is essential to a contract is matter of law to be reviewed de novo a determination turning largely on the type of contract at issue and liberto contends that it is enforceable as a license agreement.we ask then whether,according to texas law,the settlement agreement contains all of the essential terms of a trademark license agreement.
as a general matter,texas courts have consistently held that a contract may be held void for indefiniteness if it fails to specify the time of performance,the price to be paid,the work to be done,the service to be rendered,or the property to be transferred.the settlement agreement expressly enunciates the general scope of the license an exclusive license to use liberto red and yellow stripes trademark in the sale of animal crackers.the settlement agreement also stipulates the amount to be paid in royalties of gross revenue from sales of animal crackers,with an annual minimum and maximum of and,respectively,to be adjusted annually according to the consumer price index.
however,the grant language of the settlement agreement is in the future tense,for example plaintiff will grant to defendant an exclusive license emphasis added.the settlement agreement expressly leaves open for future negotiation the specific terms of the license,and the action to be taken by the parties to protect the trademark.other terms are simply specified nor designated for future negotiation.most notably,the settlement agreement fails to mention the duration of the license or the grounds for its renewal or termination also,the time of performance was not manifest in the settlement agreement,as evidenced by the protracted arbitration to determine the effective date of the royalty payments.
recognizing the attendant risk in granting any trademark possibility that the licensee will use the mark in a way that undermines its secondary meaning,thereby potentially rendering the mark or nearly all licensing agreements contain clauses specifying the manner in which the licensed mark may be used.in a license,the licensee is engaging in acts which would infringe the licensor mark but for the permission granted in the license.in that event,quality control is essential.given its centrality,leaving necessary terms of control to be determined in future negotiations militates against the finding of a binding contract.about this reality,liberto says that he is entitled to rely upon the reputation of the licensee in lieu of formal quality control strictures.this is unpersuasive.liberto intended that some mechanism would ultimately be implemented,yet there is no evidence that the parties later agreed upon specific methods of protecting the mark.
liberto argues that,even if the settlement agreement were not a binding contract when executed in,stauffer nonetheless ratified it by making an initial royalty payment in august.we are not persuaded.under texas law,a contact is ratified when a party recognizes its validity by acting under it or by affirmatively acknowledging it the difficulty here is that the settlement agreement never had sufficiently definite terms any subsequent affirmative act,unless it created an enforceable contract in its own right,is,at most,only another promise.nothing in the record suggests that the parties agreed upon the duration of the contract,the enforcement mechanisms,or any of the outstanding terms during the period prior to stauffer royalty payment.
we conclude that the settlement agreement was an agreement to agree,not a contract,and stauffer failure to pay royalties was not a breach of contract warranting injunctive relief.
the district court held,in part,that since stauffer could have relied upon its incontestability defense in the litigation but,instead,chose to settle,it is precluded from contesting the merits or raising any affirmative defenses in this action involving the same trademark infringement cause of action stauffer contends that trademark infringement has never been adjudicated,that the district court erred in ruling for liberto,and that judgment should be rendered in its favor we conclude that the district court should not have applied the doctrines of res judicata and judicial and licensee estoppel 
res judicata applies only where the parties to the respective actions are identical the prior judgment was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction the prior action resulted in a final judgment on the merits and the same cause of action is involved in both cases the res judicata effect of a prior judgment is a question of law that we review de novo.when reasonable doubt exists as to what was decided in the first action,the doctrine of res judicata should not be applied.as only element is disputed,the applicability of res judicata,here,turns on whether the final judgment in the litigation qualifies as a judgment on the merits.we are persuaded that it does not.
no court has ever adjudicated the merits of liberto trademark infringement claim.the final judgment entered in the litigation is a one page document,incorporating the settlement agreement by reference,not mentioning any of the substantive infringement issues raised by stauffer the district court in the litigation neither found trademark infringement nor decided the merits of stauffer incontestability defense.
of course there are circumstances where a settlement agreement approved and embodied in a final judgment of the court is entitled to full res judicata effect.res judicata applies where the parties to a settlement objectively manifest an intent to cement their agreement with claim preclusion 
however,the settlement agreement contains no clear statement regarding res judicata,reading,in relevant part 
plaintiff will grant to defendant an exclusive license to use its alternating red and yellow stripes trademark for defendant use in the sale of animal crackers,the specific terms of such license to be agreed upon.
also,stauffer did not in the settlement agreement renounce its rights to its own registered mark as a condition of the settlement.
likewise,the settlement agreement does not tacitly adjudicate the merits of trademark infringement.resolution of a trademark infringement case via a settlement agreement need not necessarily result in an adjudication of the merits simply because stauffer agreed to negotiate a license for the use of liberto mark in the context of a trademark infringement action does not demand the conclusion that stauffer mark is infringing it signifies only that stauffer will pay to use liberto mark,independent and irrespective of the viability of its own mark.in fact,the language of the settlement agreement can fairly be read to distinguish the two marks,reinforcing their distinctiveness rather than relinquishing stauffer ownership.in short,the language of the settlement agreement is,at best,inconclusive,offering little support for finding that incorporating it into an agreed judgment gave it any preclusive teeth.
liberto argues that the settlement agreement effectuates stauffer renunciation of rights in its mark,but there is no evidence that stauffer was of that mind.beyond the conclusory statement that stauffer had agreed to forgo its defenses in exchange for the right to negotiate a license liberto only cites stauffer advisory to the court in support of its contention.however,the to the entry of the settlement agreement as final not admit infringement.rather,it shows stauffer consent to incorporating the settlement agreement into a final judgment 
the district court pointed to the principle that res judicata bars claims or defenses that were or could have been raised during a previous litigation as we have previously put it the effect of a judgment extends to the litigation of all issues relevant to the same claim between the same parties,whether or not raised at trial.stauffer did not raise its incontestability defense during the litigation,though having earlier raised the issue in a declaratory judgment action in pennsylvania district court however,the parties turned to an alternative solution to quieting the agreement to pursue a license to use liberto mark,pretermitting a determination of liability and,agreeing to a license is consistent with stauffer maintaining rights in its own mark,particularly where no language in the settlement agreement precludes a later assertion of rights to the registered mark.the cases cited by the district court do not resolve our issue because there was never an express or implied adjudication on the merits of trademark infringement,a necessary predicate to res judicata.
such a result neither betrays the equities in the case nor offends public policy.stauffer gained nothing by delaying the ultimate adjudication of the case,all the while attempting to negotiate a license and liberto would not likely have prevailed in its action had stauffer not agreed to enter into the negotiations detailed by the settlement agreement,later entered as a final judgment.
the final judgment ordered by the district court neither clearly expresses nor is predicated upon the conclusion that stauffer infringes liberto mark.the final judgment in the litigation did not resolve the dispute.it was final only in its name.
the district court also found that stauffer was judicially estopped from raising any defense to trademark infringement in the litigation.where a party successfully urges a p
