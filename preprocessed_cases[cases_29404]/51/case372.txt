the opinion filed on march,is amended as follows 
on slip opinion page,at line,after federal intellectual property.insert the following footnote 
in its petition for rehearing,perfect claims that our decision on this point conflicts with universal communication systems,lycos,cir.but neither party in that case raised the question of whether state law counts as intellectual property for purposes of and the court seems to simply have assumed that it does.we thus create no conflict with universal communication.
we note that universal communication demonstrates the difficulties inherent in allowing state laws to count as intellectual property for cda purposes.in that case,the district court struggled with the question of whether the trademark dilution claim brought under florida law counted as intellectual property for purposes of the cda,and concluded that it was more like a defamation claim than a trademark claim.id.at.rather than decide how to draw the line between defamation and trademark,the first circuit held that because of the serious first amendment issues that would be raised if lycos were found liable,defendant had not violated the florida statute.id.at.
the first circuit was able to sidestep the question of what counted as intellectual property on first amendment grounds.but we can not do so here.states have any number of laws that could be characterized as intellectual property laws trademark,unfair competition,dilution,right of publicity and trade defamation,to name just a few.because such laws vary widely from state to state,no litigant will know if he is entitled to immunity for a state claim until a court decides the legal issue.and,of course,defendants that are otherwise entitled to cda immunity will usually be subject to the law of numerous states.an entity otherwise entitled to immunity would thus be forced to bear the costs of litigation under a wide variety of state statutes that could arguably be classified as intellectual property.as a practical matter,inclusion of rights protected by state law within the intellectual property exemption would fatally undermine the broad grant of immunity provided by the cda.
with this amendment,the panel has voted to deny the petition for rehearing and petition for rehearing en banc.
the full court has been advised of the petition for rehearing en banc,and no judge of the court has requested a vote on it.the petition for rehearing and petition for rehearing en banc are denied.no further petitions for rehearing may be filed.

discussion 
section safe harbors 
the dmca established certain safe harbors to provide protection from liability for transitory digital network communications system caching information residing on systems or networks at the direction of users and information location tools.ellison,at citing a d footnotes omitted.these safe harbors limit liability but do not affect the question of ultimate liability under the various doctrines of direct,vicarious,and contributory liability,perfect,cybernet ventures,d,citing ii,at and nothing in the language of indicates that the limitation on liability described therein is exclusive.costar group,loopnet,cir.
reasonably implemented policy i a 
to be eligible for any of the four safe harbors at a d,a service provider must first meet the threshold conditions set out in i,including the requirement that the service provider 
h as adopted and reasonably implemented,and informs subscribers and account holders of the service provider system or network of,a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers and account holders of the service provider system or network who are repeat infringers.
section i a ellison,at.the statute does not define reasonably implemented.we hold that a service provider implements a policy if it has a working notification system,a procedure for dealing with notifications,and if it does not actively prevent copyright owners from collecting information needed to issue such notifications.ellison,at working notification system required corbis,d,must adopt procedure for dealing with notifications in re aimster copyright,d,policy not implemented if service provider actively blocks collection of information.the statute permits service providers to implement a variety of procedures,but an implementation is reasonable if,under appropriate circumstances,the service provider terminates users who repeatedly or blatantly infringe copyright.see i corbis,d at.
implementation 
perfect argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether ccbill and cwie prevented the implementation of their policies by failing to keep track of repeatedly infringing webmasters.the district court found that there was not,and we agree.
in ellison,stephen robertson posted copies of harlan ellison copyrighted short stories on internet newsgroups available through usenet servers.at.ellison asserted that america online,aol had infringed his copyright by providing access to the usenet servers.id.based on evidence that aol changed its contact email address for copyright infringement notices from to in the fall of,but neglected to register the change with the copyright office until april,we held that the district court erred in concluding on summary judgment that aol satisfied the requirements of i.id.at.even though ellison did not learn of the infringing activity until after aol had notified the copyright office of the correct email address,we found that aol allowed notices of potential copyright infringement to fall into a vacuum and go unheeded that fact is sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that aol had not reasonably implemented its policy against repeat infringers.id.at.
similarly,the aimster cases hold that a repeat infringer policy is not implemented under i a if the service provider prevents copyright holders from providing notifications.in aimster,the district court held that aimster did not reasonably implement its stated repeat infringer policy because the encryption on aimster renders it impossible to ascertain which users are transferring which files.d at.the court found that a dopting a repeat infringer policy and then purposely eviscerating any hope that such a policy could ever be carried out is not an implementation as required by i.id.the seventh circuit affirmed,finding that aimster did not meet the requirement of i a because,in part,by teaching its users how to encrypt their unlawful distribution of copyrighted materials aimster disabled itself from doing anything to prevent infringement.in re aimster copyright,cir.
based on ellison and the aimster cases,a substantial failure to record webmasters associated with allegedly infringing websites may raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the implementation of the service provider repeat infringer policy.in this case,however,the record does not reflect such a failure.perfect references a single page from ccbill and cwie dmca log.although this page shows some empty fields in the spreadsheet column labeled webmasters sic name,perfect conclusion that the dmca log thus does not reflect any effort to track notices of infringements received by webmaster identity is not supported by evidence in the record.the remainder of the dmca log indicates that the email address name of the webmaster is routinely recorded in ccbill and cwie dmca log.ccbill interrogatory responses dated december,also contain a chart indicating that ccbill and cwie largely kept track of the webmaster for each website.
unlike ellison and aimster,where the changed email address and the encryption system ensured that no information about the repeat infringer was collected,it is undisputed that ccbill and cwie recorded most webmasters.the district court properly concluded that the dmca log does not raise a triable issue of fact that ccbill and cwie did not implement a repeat infringer policy.
reasonableness 
a service provider reasonably implements its repeat infringer policy if it terminates users when appropriate.see corbis,d at.section i itself does not clarify when it is appropriate for service providers to act.it only requires that a service provider terminate users who are repeat infringers.
to identify and terminate repeat infringers,a service provider need not affirmatively police its users for evidence of repeat infringement.section c states that a service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief if it does not know of infringement.a service provider is also not liable under c if it acts expeditiously to remove,or disable access to,the material when it has actual knowledge,is aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent,or has received notification of claimed infringement meeting the requirements of c.were we to require service providers to terminate users under circumstances other than those specified in c,c grant of immunity would be meaningless.this interpretation of the statute is supported by legislative history.see,at section i is not intended to undermine the knowledge standard of c.
perfect claims that ccbill and cwie unreasonably implemented their repeat infringer policies by tolerating flagrant and blatant copyright infringement by its users despite notice of infringement from perfect,notice of infringement from copyright holders not a party to this litigation and red flags of copyright infringement.
perfect claimed notice of infringement 
perfect argues that ccbill and cwie implemented their repeat infringer policy in an unreasonable manner because ccbill and cwie received notices of infringement from perfect,and yet the infringement identified in these notices continued.the district court found that perfect did not provide notice that substantially complied with the requirements of c and thus did not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether ccbill and cwie reasonably implemented their repeat infringer policy.we agree.
compliance is not substantial if the notice provided complies with only some of the requirements of c a.section c b ii explains that a service provider will not be deemed to have notice of infringement when the notification that is provided to the service provider designated agent fails to comply substantially with all the provisions of subparagraph a but substantially complies with clauses ii,iii,and iv of subparagraph a so long as the service provider responds to the inadequate notice and explains the requirements for substantial compliance.the statute thus signals that substantial compliance means substantial compliance with all of c s clauses,not just some of them.see,at a communication substantially complies even if it contains technical errors such as misspellings or outdated information.see also recording indus.ass of,verizon internet,citing,at 
perfect claims that it met the requirements of c through a combination of three sets of documents.the first set of documents is a page production on october,that includes pictures with urls of perfect models allegedly posted on ccbill or cwie client websites.the october,production did not contain a statement under penalty of perjury that the complaining party was authorized to act,as required by c a vi.the second set of documents was also not sworn to,and consisted of a spreadsheet emailed to fisher on july,identifying the perfect models in the october,production by bates number.on december,perfect completed interrogatory responses which were signed under penalty of perjury.these responses incorporated the july,spreadsheet by reference.
taken individually,perfect communications do not substantially comply with the requirements of c.each communication contains more than mere technical errors often one or more of the required elements are entirely absent.see perfect,ccbill,llc,d,order.in order to substantially comply with c requirements,a notification must do more than identify infringing files.the dmca requires a complainant to declare,under penalty of perjury,that he is authorized to represent the copyright holder,and that he has a belief that the use is infringing.this requirement is not superfluous.accusations of alleged infringement have drastic consequences a user could have content removed,or may have his access terminated entirely.if the content infringes,justice has been done.but if it does not,speech protected under the first amendment could be removed.we therefore do not require a service provider to start potentially invasive proceedings if the complainant is unwilling to state under penalty of perjury that he is an authorized representative of the copyright owner,and that he has a belief that the material is unlicensed 
permitting a copyright holder to cobble together adequate notice from separately defective notices also unduly burdens service providers.indeed,the text of c requires that the notice be a written communication.emphasis added.again,this requirement is not a mere technicality.it would have taken fisher substantial time to piece together the relevant information for each instance of claimed infringement.to do so,fisher would have to first find the relevant line in the spreadsheet indicating ownership information,then comb the pages provided by perfect in order to find the appropriate image,and finally copy into a browser the location printed at the top of the location which was,in some instances,truncated.the dmca notification procedures place the burden of policing copyright the potentially infringing material and adequately documenting on the owners of the copyright.we decline to shift a substantial burden from the copyright owner to the provider perfect separate communications are inadequate.
since perfect did not provide effective notice,knowledge of infringement may not be imputed to ccbill or cwie based on perfect communications.perfect attempted notice does not raise a genuine issue of material fact that ccbill and cwie failed to reasonably implement a repeat infringer policy within the meaning of i a.
perfect also cites to notices of infringement by other copyright holders,and argues that ccbill and cwie did not reasonably implement their repeat infringer policies because they continued to provide services for websites that infringed copyrights.the district court expressly declined to consider evidence of notices provided by any party other than perfect on the basis that these notices were irrelevant to perfect claims.we disagree.
ccbill and cwie actions towards copyright holders who are not a party to the litigation are relevant in determining whether ccbill and cwie reasonably implemented their repeat infringer policy.section i a requires an assessment of the service provider policy,not how the service provider treated a particular copyright holder.see ellison,at aol repeat infringer policy was not reasonably implemented because copyright holders other than ellison could have attempted to notify aol during the time that aol email address was incorrectly listed.thus,ccbill and cwie response to adequate notifications is relevant in determining whether they reasonably implemented their policy against repeat infringers.
a policy is unreasonable only if the service provider failed to respond when it had knowledge of the infringement.the district court in this case did not consider any evidence relating to copyright holders other than perfect.we remand for determination of whether ccbill cwie implemented its repeat infringer policy in an unreasonable manner with respect to any copyright holder other than perfect.
apparent infringing activity 
in importing the knowledge standards of c to the analysis of whether a service provider reasonably implemented its i repeat infringer policy,congress also imported the red flag test of c a ii.under this section,a service provider may lose immunity if it fails to take action with regard to infringing material when it is aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.c a ii.notice that fails to substantially comply with c,however,can not be deemed to impart such awareness.c b i ii.
perfect alleges that ccbill and cwie were aware of a number of red flags that signaled apparent infringement.because cwie and ccbill provided services to and,perfect argues that they must have been aware of apparent infringing activity.we disagree.when a website traffics in pictures that are titillating by nature,describing photographs as illegal or stolen may be an attempt to increase their salacious appeal,rather than an admission that the photographs are actually illegal or stolen.we do not place the burden of determining whether photographs are actually illegal on a service provider.
perfect also argues that a disclaimer posted on made it apparent that infringing activity had taken place.perfect alleges no facts showing that cwie and ccbill were aware of that disclaimer,and,in any event,we disagree that the disclaimer made infringement apparent.the disclaimer in question stated the copyrights of these files remain the creator.i do not claim any rights to these files,other than the right to post them.contrary to perfect assertion,this disclaimer is not a red flag of infringement.the disclaimer specifically states that the webmaster has the right to post the files.
in addition,perfect argues that websites,hosted by cwie,also obviously infringe.while such sites may not directly infringe on anyone copyright,they may well contribute to such infringement.the software provided by grokster in studios grokster,d,also did not itself infringe,but did enable users to swap infringing files.grokster held that instructing users how to engage in an infringing use could constitute contributory infringement.id.at.similarly,providing passwords that enable users to illegally access websites with copyrighted content may well amount to contributory infringement.
however,in order for a website to qualify as a red flag of infringement,it would need to be apparent that the website instructed or enabled users to infringe another copyright.see a m records,napster,cir.we find that the burden of determining whether passwords on a website enabled infringement is not on the service provider.the website could be a hoax,or out of date.the owner of the protected content may have supplied the passwords as a promotion,or as an attempt to collect information from unsuspecting users.the passwords might be provided to help users maintain anonymity without infringing on copyright.there is simply no way for a service provider to conclude that the passwords enabled infringement without trying the passwords,and verifying that they enabled illegal access to copyrighted material.we impose no such investigative duties on service providers.websites are thus not per se red flags of infringement.
perfect also alleges that red flags raised by third parties identified repeat infringers who were not terminated.because the district court did not consider potential red flags raised by third parties,we remand to the district court to determine whether notices made ccbill and cwie aware that it provided services to repeat infringers,and if so,whether they responded appropriately.
standard technical measures i b 
under i b,a service provider that interferes with standard technical measures is not entitled to the safe harbors at a d.standard technical measures refers to a narrow group of solutions to online copyright infringement 
t he term standard technical measures means technical measures that are used by copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works and 
a have been developed pursuant to a broad consensus of copyright owners and service providers in an open,fair,voluntary,standards process 
b are available to any person on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms and 
c do not impose substantial costs on service providers or substantial burdens on their systems or networks.
i.perfect argues that ccbill does not qualify for any safe harbor because it interfered with standard technical measures by blocking perfect access to ccbill affiliated websites in order to prevent perfect from discovering whether those websites infringed perfect copyrights.
there are two disputed facts here.
we are unable to determine on this record whether accessing websites is a standard technical measure,which was developed pursuant to a broad consensus of copyright owners and service providers in an open,fair,voluntary,standards process.i a.we thus remand to the district court to determine whether access to a website is a standard technical measure,and if so,whether ccbill interfered with that access.
if allowing access is a standard technical measure,ccbill claims it only blocked perfect credit card because perfect had previously reversed charges for subscriptions perfect insists it did so in order to prevent perfect from identifying infringing content.if ccbill is correct,perfect method of identifying ccbill to pay the fines and fees associated with well impose a substantial cost on ccbill.if not,ccbill may well have interfered with perfect efforts to police the websites in question for possible infringements.because there are disputed issues of material fact,we remand to the district court for a determination of whether ccbill refusal to process perfect transactions interfered with a standard technical measure for identifying infringement.
transitory digital network communications a 
section a provides safe harbor for service providers who act as conduits for infringing content.in order to qualify for the safe harbor of a,a party must be a service provider under a more restrictive definition than applicable to the other safe harbors provided under 
as used in subsection a,the term service provider means an entity offering the transmission,routing,or providing of connections for digital online communications,between or among points specified by a user,of material of the user choosing,without modification to the content of the material as sent or received.
section k a.the district court held that ccbill met the requirements of k a by provid ing a connection to the material on its clients websites through a system which it operates in order to provide its clients with billing services.order at.we reject perfect argument that ccbill is not eligible for immunity under a because it does not itself transmit the infringing material.a service provider is an entity offering the transmission,routing,or providing of connections for digital online communications.k a.there is no requirement in the statute that the communications must themselves be infringing,and we see no reason to import such a requirement.it would be perverse to hold a service provider immune for transmitting information that was infringing on its face,but find it contributorily liable for transmitting information that did not infringe.
section a provides a broad grant of immunity to service providers whose connection with the material is transient.when an individual clicks on an internet link,his computer sends a request for the information.the company receiving that request sends that request on to another computer,which sends it on to another.after a series of such transmissions,the request arrives at the computer that stores the information.the requested information is then returned in milliseconds,not necessarily along the same path.in passing the information along,each intervening computer makes a copy of the data.a short time later,the information is displayed on the user computer.
those intervening computers provide transient connections among users.the internet as we know it simply can not exist if those intervening computers must block indirectly infringing content.we read a grant of immunity exactly as it is written service providers are immune for transmitting all digital online communications,not just those that directly infringe.
ccbill transmits credit card information and proof of payment,both of which are digital online communications.however,we have little information as to how ccbill sends the payment it receives to its account holders.it is unclear whether such payment is a digital communication,transmitted without modification to the content of the material,or transmitted often enough that ccbill is only a transient holder.on the record before us,we can not conclude that ccbill is a service provider under a.accordingly,we remand to the district court for further consideration the issue of whether ccbill meets the requirements of a.
information location tools d 
after ccbill processes a consumer credit card and issues a password granting access to a client website,ccbill displays a hyperlink so that the user may access the client website.ccbill argues that it falls under the safe harbor of d by displaying this hyperlink at the conclusion of the consumer transaction.we disagree.section d reads 
a service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief,or,except as provided in subsection j,for injunctive or other equitable relief,for infringement of copyright by reason of the provider referring or linking users to an online location containing infringing material or infringing activity,by using information location tools,including a directory,index,reference,pointer,or hypertext link.
even if the hyperlink provided by ccbill could be viewed as an information location tool,the majority of ccbill functions would remain outside of the safe harbor of d.section d provides safe harbor only for infringement of copyright by reason of the provider referring or linking users to an online location containing infringing material or infringing activity.emphasis added.perfect does not claim that ccbill infringed its copyrights by providing a hyperlink rather,perfect alleges infringement through ccbill performance of other business services for these websites.even if ccbill provision of a hyperlink is immune under n,ccbill does not receive blanket immunity for its other services.
information residing on systems or networks at the direction of users c 
section c limits the liability of qualifying service providers for claims of direct,vicarious,and contributory infringement for storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider,at.a service provider qualifies for safe harbor under c if it meets the requirements of i and 
a i does not have actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing 
ii in the absence of such actual knowledge,is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent or 
iii upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness,acts expeditiously to remove,or disable access to,the material 
b does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity,in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity and 
c upon notification of claimed infringement as described in paragraph,responds expeditiously to remove,or disable access to,the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity.
section c.as discussed above,perfect did not provide cwie with knowledge or awareness within the standard of c a,and perfect did not provide notice that complies with the requirements of c.
the remaining question is whether perfect raises a genuine issue of material fact that cwie does not qualify for safe harbor under c because it fails to meet the requirements of c b,namely,that a service provider not receive a direct financial benefit from the infringing activity if the service provider also has the right and ability to control the infringing activity.
based on the rule of construction that where congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under common law,a court must infer,unless the statute otherwise dictates,that congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms,rossi,at cir quoting neder united states,d,we hold that direct financial benefit should be interpreted consistent with the common law standard for vicarious copyright liability.see,ellison,at a vicariously liable copyright infringer derive s a direct financial benefit from the infringement and ha s the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity.thus,the relevant inquiry is whether the infringing activity constitutes a draw for subscribers,not just an added benefit.id.at.in ellison,the court held that no jury could reasonably conclude that aol received a direct financial benefit from providing access to the infringing material because t he record lacks evidence that aol attracted or retained subscriptions because of the infringement or lost subscriptions because of aol eventual obstruction of the infringement.id.
in this case,perfect provides almost no evidence about the alleged direct financial benefit to cwie.perfect only alleges that cwie hosts websites for a fee.this allegation is insufficient to show that the infringing activity was a draw as required by ellison.at.furthermore,the legislative history expressly states that receiving a fee and flat,periodic payments for service from a person engaging in infringing activities would not constitute receiving a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity,at.perfect has not raised a genuine issue of material fact that cwie receives a direct financial benefit from infringing activity.because cwie does not receive a direct financi
