veronica vincent wrote smart foreclosure buying and has registered her copyright in that work,which the chicago association of realtors published through its educational arm the real estate education company.the real estate education company has since been consolidated with the chicago realtors real estate school for simplicity we use the association to refer to the chicago association of realtors and all of its affiliates.the association promised to pay vincent of the book selling price.vincent used the book as the text in a class she taught at the city colleges of chicago.the course title was the same as the book.
in vincent stopped teaching this class.the city colleges continued to offer a course with the same title,taught by ezekiel a prospective student might have thought that vincent was the instructor,as her initials appeared next to the course description in the college catalog.in vincent told the association by phone,fax,and letter to stop publishing her book.the association promptly stopped paying her royalties,but it did not stop printing and selling copies of the book.vincent also asked the city colleges to stop offering any course using her book,or at least to cease using the book title as the name of the course.when vincent discovered that the association was continuing to print the book for use not only in the college courses but also in a educational program it offers for real estate brokers,she demanded that the association pay her a portion of the revenue from these endeavors it refused but did remit several years back royalties.
according to vincent complaint,from which this narration has been drawn,the association,the city colleges,and morris have violated the federal copyright and trademark laws.vincent complaint named harold washington college and wilbur wright college as defendants,but these are just parts of the city colleges operations.one could not sue harvard college,as opposed to the larger institution harvard university of which it is a component.schiavone fortune,d.but the city colleges received the papers and responded to the complaint,so we have reformed the caption.it is unclear whether the city colleges or its governing body the board of trustees of community college district is the real party in interest nothing turns on the answer,so we do not pursue it.vincent also named the city of chicago as a defendant but never served the city with process it has been dismissed as a party,and that decision does not require further discussion.quite apart from the lack of service,the city of chicago has nothing to do with the events of which vincent complains.
the district court dismissed most of the complaint under.b.the complaint is fatally deficient,the judge wrote,because it does not plead facts that show an entitlement to relief.wl,dist.lexis.the only claim,the district court concluded,is vincent contention that the association violated the copyright laws by printing copies of her book after she withdrew consent.with respect to that claim,the district court later granted summary judgment in the association favor,ruling that vincent had failed to establish that the association received written notice of her decision.wl,dist.lexis.
the district judge faulted vincent for failing to demonstrate beyond peradventure that the association had received written notice.but why must notice be in writing the license to print the book was oral an oral contract may be modified or terminated orally.nothing in the copyright act requires all transactions to be it did,then the association would not have had authority to publish the book in the first place because there are no distinctive federal rules for how parties reach contracts concerning copyrights,see harms eliscu,cir friendly,oral licenses and oral terminations are valid to the extent allowed by state statutes of frauds.the association does not contend that an oral termination of an oral license is invalid as a matter of illinois contract law,which governs here.and although the association insists that one term of the oral contract was that termination would be in writing,that contention is itself contested.
a dispute about whether the association received written notice would preclude summary judgment even if a writing were essential.vincent provided evidence that she mailed the association a letter of termination.the association denies receiving this letter,which was sent to its old offices the association had moved without notifying vincent.but the postal service forwards letters for one year after a move and should have forwarded this one.the association moved in september vincent maintains that she mailed her letter that december the association does not contend that it failed to provide the postal service with a forwarding address.vincent maintains that the letter did not come back to her,as it should have done if the postal service could not deliver it.maybe the letter arrived but was misfiled,or maybe someone at the association threw it away because it did not correspond to a written contract in the association files.
evidence of mailing is evidence of delivery.see hagner united states.henderson carbondale coal coke.although almost any evidence may be refuted,the trier of fact determines whether the presumption of delivery has been overcome.certainly a jury could infer that the association received some notice why else did it stop remitting royalties if the association were utterly in the dark,as it purports to have been,then it would have continued paying vincent.
that not all.vincent testified by deposition that she sent the association a termination notice by fax.the association asserts that its old fax machine had been disconnected as part of the move,but that just sets up another factual dispute.vincent testified that the fax went through senders can tell the difference between reaching a fax machine and reaching a disconnected line.fax and phone numbers usually are changed at the same time,or not at all,when a business moves.a new machine at the old number would have received the fax.the association kept its old numbers for voice lines the move of about five city blocks did not affect the area code,and vincent was able to leave a termination message on its system a trier of fact could conclude that the fax number carried over too.proof from the phone company records that the fax number was out of service could be deemed incontrovertible,but all the association offered was its.
summary judgment on the copyright claim was proper,however,with respect to morris and the city colleges.vincent appears to believe that a copyright entitles the author to determine how a work is used and thus to prevent the book adoption as a teaching text.not at all.an author has the exclusive right to control copying,but once a given copy has been sold its owner may do with it as he pleases provided that he does not create another copy or a derivative work.see quality king distributors,research international,d discussing a and the doctrine.when smart foreclosure buying is out of print,students may read it in the library or buy used copies from those who took the class in earlier years.authors capitalize on the durability of the printed word not by charging for each extra person use but by setting a price for new copies that reflects the work value to multiple readers.see stanley besen sheila kirby,private copying,appropriability optimal copyright royalties,econ.
as for the rest of the case a judicial order dismissing a complaint because the plaintiff did not plead facts has a short.any decision declaring this complaint is deficient because it does not allege x is a candidate for summary reversal,unless x is on the list in.b.kolupa roselle park district,cir.civil rule calls for a short and plain statement the plaintiff pleads claims,not facts or legal theories.see bartholet reishauer z√ºrich,cir.factual detail comes in response to a motion for a more definite statement,see.e,perhaps in response to a motion for summary judgment.until then,the possibility that facts to be adduced later,and consistent with the complaint,could prove the claim,is enough for the litigation to move forward.
