in this appeal,plaintiff optimum technologies,optimum raises a number of challenges to the district court disposition of its action against henkel consumer adhesives,hca specifically,optimum argues that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment in favor of hca on optimum claims of trademark infringement and unfair competition the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of hca on optimum claims of breach of confidential relationship,breach of fiduciary duty,fraudulent concealment,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation and the district court erred in a jury trial that resulted in a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on optimum trademark and unfair competition claims,due to a lack of evidence establishing optimum damages.following a careful review of the record and the arguments on appeal,we discern no reversible error by the district court,and,therefore,we affirm.
background 
optimum is a family business based in cartersville,georgia.the company sells a number of flooring and products in both the commercial and home consumer markets.its best selling home consumer product is the rug gripper,a adhesive product that can be applied in strips to the backs of rugs and mats to secure them in place and prevent slippage on various surfaces.beginning in the,optimum began selling the product to home improvement retailers like home depot,lowe,and ace hardware.since,optimum has had a federally registered trademark in the mark,when used in connection with the sale of a serim material to be interposed between carpet and surface to anchor carpet in place,exh.
hca distributes a number of consumer goods,including adhesive tapes,to large home improvement retailers.in some cases,hca manufactures its own home improvement products in other cases its products are supplied by outside manufacturers.in the latter scenario,hca typically obtains its products from third party manufacturers,and then sells and distributes them directly to those retailers with whom hca has existing relationships.
in,hca approached and expressed an interest in entering into a distributor relationship with optimum,one centered on optimum flagship product.the relationship with optimum would permit hca to establish a greater presence in the floor and rug departments of retailers such as home depot and lowe retailers with whom optimum already had accounts.in turn,the distributorship would allow optimum to leverage hca existing relationships with some larger retailers that optimum had been seeking to sell the product to,such as and.under the terms of the parties was based on a handshake and was not reduced to would manufacture and supply the product to hca,and hca would assume responsibility for marketing and distributing the product to retailers.
pursuant to this arrangement,optimum turned over a number of its large retail accounts to hca,including the contact information for those retailers,product pricing information,customer information,and sales figures.as to these accounts,which included home depot and lowe,hca obtained the exclusive right,going forward,to sell and distribute the product.lewis mcdermott,chief executive officer of optimum,testified that the accounts it assigned to hca constituted the vast majority of optimum major retail accounts.
prior to selling the product,optimum and hca worked together in designing the product external packaging.this packaging consisted of a green box,a photo of a hand lifting a rug,a picture of a roll of tape,the phrase rug gripper,and,in the corner of the packaging,the corporate logo of hca predecessor corporation.it is undisputed that hca was permitted to use the trademark during the term of the parties distributor relationship.
hca began distributing the product to retailers in early.hca would place orders for the product with optimum by filing a purchase order.optimum would ship the product to the packaging agreed to by the hca would then sell and distribute the product to retailers.the early years of this business relationship were,by all accounts,uneventful.
within a few years,however,hca had begun internally developing its own adhesive carpet tape product,which it hoped would eventually replace optimum product.hca began internally marketing and testing a latex rug was eventually named for rugs as early as from the period to,however,while this change was being contemplated internally at hca,hca continued to purchase the product from optimum and to distribute the product to retailers.
optimum was not made aware of hca plans to change products.commencing in,hca advised optimum that it was contemplating a packaging change to the product box.at at.in early,as hca was preparing to roll out the product to retail stores,hca informed optimum that it would be mak ing changes in the rug gripper packaging,and that,as a result,optimum was not to order more product packaging without hca okay,exh.
in the fall of,hca sent a which optimum was not all of its large retailers,including home depot,lowe,and ace hardware.the hca memorandum stated that hca was preparing to introduce a new rug gripper product to its retailers,and that it would no longer be selling the old version.br.of appellee at at.it did not mention the product by name,mentioning only a new rug gripper product.id.the memorandum also advised its retailers that hca new rug gripper product would be superior in terms of quality.
hca used the same upc code,bar code,and item number as the product on the new product.hca also used a similar packaging design for its product.specifically,the new product consisted of a green box,a photo of a hand lifting a rug,a picture of a roll of tape,and the phrase for rugs.the product packaging was the same size as the product,and the products packages contained the same quantities of adhesive tape.unbeknownst to optimum,hca began shipping its product to retail stores sometime in late december.
on january,sean mcdermott,who is a vice president of sales in the commercial division at optimum discovered the product on the shelf at a lowe store while on a personal errand.subsequently,hca strategic sourcing manager,mike jupina,informed optimum that the company had decided to take a new direction with its business and that it would no longer be ordering the product from optimum,exh.hca confirmed this decision in a written letter to optimum,which was written by jupina.the relationship between the companies was terminated shortly thereafter.the for rugs product is now sold at a number of the retailers that were once selling the product,including home depot,lowe,and ace hardware.
pertinent to the present action,in the wake of the termination of the parties hca decision to replace the product with at all of its retail of the two products occurred on the shelves of hca retailers.for example,ronald matheny,a home depot representative who was responsible for liaising with vendor representatives at home depot stores throughout the southeast,testified that he had received complaints that the new product was being sold on home depot shelves with the name on the tag underneath.at see also optimum,v.the home depot usa,cv,wl,at,stating that home depot displayed for rugs on shelves labeled rug gripper.optimum sean mcdermott testified that he personally saw the product on a store shelf at a home depot on sidney marcus boulevard in atlanta,georgia,with signage for the product sitting underneath the product there have also been reports that product sat in labeled display cases on retail store shelves.randolph lear,vice president of hca business division,has stated that when product substitutions like these are effectuated by hca,there is some potential for the old product to be with the new product on the retailers shelves.hca has effectively conceded that,in some instances,the rug gripper name remained on shelf tags for some time after sales of the for rugs product began.br.of appellee at.in addition,it is alleged that,for a period after the product had replaced the product,a person purchasing at some home depot stores would have the purchase indicated on the printed home depot store receipt as.
some of hca retailers were allegedly unaware of hca product change optimum has asserted that some store representatives stated that they thought they were still ordering the product,when in actuality they were ordering the product.a representative of home depot in denver,colorado stated to sean mcdermott that she had been under the impression that the products were essentially the same.lewis mcdermott,the company founder,testified that,in his discussions with his at a number of retailers,many of them had made clear that they thought the two rug products were identical.
in addition,even after the parties relationship had been terminated,some of hca own websites apparently continued to contain references to the product.evidence was presented that hca websites contained pictures of the product next to a product description of the product.on some of hca websites,if a customer were to search for a local retailer who was selling the product,they might be directed to a retailer who was actually selling the product.
in april optimum filed the present action in the northern district of georgia,alleging nine counts against hca,including trademark infringement,in violation unfair competition and trade dress infringement,in violation of section a of the lanham act,a unfair trade practices,in violation of the georgia uniform deceptive trade practices act,a breach of confidential relationship breach of fiduciary duty fraudulent concealment fraud and negligent misrepresentation.
b.the district court proceedings 
district court summary judgment order 
in january,hca moved for summary judgment on all counts.the district court disposed of hca motion in a detailed opinion and order.first,with respect to optimum action for federal trademark infringement under,the district court evaluated optimum claim that hca had infringed its registered mark via its alleged conduct.the court determined that,even if optimum had a colorable claim of trademark infringement based on the and mislabeling of the mark and the product on retail store shelves,those alleged infringing uses were only attributable to the retailers,not hca.at.specifically,the court found that there was no evidence that hca was responsible for generating the home depot pricing stickers or shelving labels,which referred to the for rugs product as rug gripper,or for placing the allegedly infringing stickers on the shelves.id.at.because there was no evidence that the alleged infringements at the retail level were attributable to hca,the court concluded that optimum action for trademark on the alleged mislabeling and of the mark and the product in retail not lie.
the court found,however,that there was some evidence that hca had continued to use the mark on the company website,even after the parties distribution relationship had terminated.specifically,the court found that hca website had continued to feature a picture of the for rugs product with a description of the product,and that the website had used the product search feature to guide potential purchasers of the product to retailers of the product.id.at.finding this to be evidence of an unauthorized use of the mark on hca website for trademark law purposes,the court then turned to the question of whether that use was likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake or to deceive.see burger king mason,cir.the court concluded that the mark was strong that the products were similar and served similar functions and that hca use of the mark on the website could arguably result in customer confusion.in light of these determinations,the court concluded that optimum had presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact as to whether hca use of the mark on its web sites created a likelihood of confusion.at.
the district court found,however,that hca alleged unauthorized use of the only occurred on the internet sites.as a result,the court held that there was insufficient evidence to support a broader trademark infringement action against hca based upon allegations of confusion at the retail level.it thus granted partial summary judgment to hca on optimum trademark infringement claim.the court order made clear that,at trial,optimum trademark action would be limited to the issue of hca use of the mark on its web sites.id.at.
turning to optimum claims for unfair competition under both section a of the lanham act,a,and the georgia uniform deceptive trade practices act,a,the district court concluded that the same analysis would apply as that which was used in limiting optimum trademark infringement claim.because the same analysis that governs a trademark infringement also applies to claims brought under a and a,the court concluded that genuine issues of material fact remained as to hca conduct its website.the court reiterated,however,that there was insufficient record evidence to support claims of unfair competition against hca at the level of the retail stores.thus it granted partial summary judgment to hca on these claims 
turning to optimum remaining claims,the district court concluded that hca was entitled to summary judgment on optimum claims of breach of confidential relationship,breach of fiduciary duty,and fraudulent concealment.the court concluded that there was neither a confidential relationship nor a fiduciary relationship between the parties,but that the arrangement had been a typical relationship,one that was terminable at will by either party.in addition,because there was no legally cognizable confidential relationship between the parties,the court concluded that hca had no duty to disclose its plans to replace the product with the product,and,accordingly,a claim for fraudulent concealment would not lie.
as to the claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation,the district court found that both causes of action required a showing that the defendant had made a false representation,but that optimum had failed to demonstrate how hca alleged,the statement to optimum that it would be making a packaging change to the product false.id.at.moreover,the court found that,even assuming the statement was false,there was no showing that optimum had proximately suffered damage in reliance on the fact,the court concluded that optimum had arguably avoided unnecessary cost by reducing its packaging inventory for the product as instructed.thus,the court granted summary judgment in favor of optimum on these claims.
judgment as a matter of law in favor of hca 
in the wake of the summary judgment order,optimum proceeded to a jury trial on its remaining claims of trademark infringement and unfair competition.in accordance with the district court summary judgment order,optimum case at trial was limited to the issue of hca conduct on its websites,and whether that conduct constituted either a trademark infringement or unfair competition.optimum was precluded from introducing any evidence as to confusion at the level of the retailers as the court explained to the jury in an early limiting instruction,t he one single claim that i have allowed to go forward in this case is the alleged trademark infringement that arose as a result of the defendant use of the mark on its website.that is the only claim that you will be allowed to consider in this case.at.
optimum witnesses at trial were likewise limited in their testimony as to whether hca misused the mark in the context of its website they were not permitted to mention any allegations of misconduct at the retail level.see,id.at,testimony of lewis mcdermott limited to allegations of hca misconduct with respect to the website see also id.at limiting witness testimony to the question of whether or not the use of the trademark on the defendant website in the year was likely to cause consumer confusion id.at testimony of steven davis limited to use of the mark on hca website at testimony of ronald matheny of home depot,same id.at testimony of sean mcdermott,same.
in addition,the trial testimony of optimum damages expert was limited to the question of how much of his damage figure of million,which had been set forth in his actually attributable to hca conduct on the website.during his,optimum expert was questioned about why his damages report failed to specifically mention hca website,or to discuss the use of the mark in the context of the internet.the expert eventually conceded that his damage report had been general in nature,that it had been prepared prior to the court summary judgment ruling,and that,consequently,it had failed to separate out those damages that were attributable to hca conduct on the website.at.
optimum jury trial lasted four days.after a period of deliberations,the jury indicated in a note to the court that it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict regarding damages.at.consequently,the court declared a mistrial,hca made a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,having moved for it previously at the close of optimum and again at the close of all of the evidence.
the district court granted hca renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,and dismissed optimum remaining claims for trademark infringement and unfair competition.specifically,the court found that optimum expert testimony should not have been admitted in the first place,as the evidence had failed to establish a connection between the conduct at issue hca use of the mark on the website and the claimed damages million.the court found that there was no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for optimum on the issue of damages,and awarded judgment as a matter of law to hca.at.optimum appeals,challenging both the court summary judgment order as well as its order granting hca judgment as a matter of law.
ii.discussion 
appeal of the district court summary judgment order 
we first address the district court summary judgment order.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.see johnson bd.of regents,cir citation omitted.under that standard,summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in making this assessment,we review all facts and inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving this case,optimum.farley nationwide mut.ins,cir citation omitted.we have held that the plain language of rule c mandates the entry of summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.johnson,at quotations and citation omitted.
optimum count of trademark infringement 
optimum first appeals the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of hca on its trademark infringement claim.on appeal,optimum contends that the court decision was in error.specifically,it argues that it presented sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment on this claim based on the misconduct in the retail stores.
trademark infringement is proscribed by a,which prohibits any person from the use in commerce of any reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.in order to prevail on a trademark infringement claim based on a federally registered mark,the registrant must show that its mark was used in commerce by the defendant without the registrant consent and the unauthorized use was likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake or to deceive.see burger king,at.the parties do not dispute that optimum mark is a federally registered mark that is entitled to protection.thus we must address whether optimum presented sufficient evidence of an unauthorized use of the mark by hca at the retail level and if so,whether the evidence was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to a likelihood of confusion at the retail level.
the first step of a trademark infringement action is to demonstrate an unauthorized use of the plaintiff mark in commerce.see also sunamerica sun life assurance of canada,cir stating that the starting point of a lanham act claim is that the plaintiff had enforceable rights in the mark and that the defendants engaged in a use of the mark.in order for a mark to be use d in commerce the mark must be placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto.see.if such an unauthorized use is shown by the plaintiff,the first prong of a trademark infringement action has been satisfied.see a burger king,at.
in addressing optimum trademark infringement claim,the district court concluded that,even if the of the mark with product on the retailer shelves constituted an unauthorized use,the evidence was not sufficient to allege a claim for trademark infringement directly against hca based on these uses,because the alleged infringing uses were only attributable to the retailers,not to hca.at.the court did not assess whether the incidents of confusion at the retail level were sufficient to create an issue of fact as to a likelihood of confusion for purposes of a trademark action.rather,it stated that,even assuming there was evidence of a likelihood of confusion,there was no evidence that hca was responsible for the alleged misuse of optimum registered mark,that is,generating the home depot pricing stickers or shelving labels or placing the allegedly infringing stickers on the shelves.id.at id.at finding no evidence that hca used the mark in its advertising,and finding that the only allegation of an infringing use of the mark attributable to hca occurred on the internet.since,the court found,hca had not been responsible for any of the allegedly unlawful uses of the mark at the retail level,the court granted partial summary judgment to hca with respect to the alleged misconduct at the retail stores 
our review of the record demonstrates that optimum presented evidence that some of the retail outlets engaged in unauthorized uses of the mark,in that the mark continued to appear on retail shelf tags and shelf crates containing the product.additionally,some retail store receipts allegedly indicated that the product the customer had received was the product,when,in fact,the customer had bought the product.once the product replaced the product in the retail outlets,any continued place ment of the mark on goods or displays at the level of the retail connection with the sale of any product other than optimum constituted an unauthorized use in commerce of optimum mark.see see overland,cir stating,where a gave store customers when they asked for pepsi,and indicated on store receipts that its customers were getting coke when they were in fact getting pepsi,that t aken alone,such conduct appears to present a case of trademark infringement.thus the parties dispute does not center on whether the mark was used in commerce,at the level of the retail stores,without optimum permission.
rather,the pivotal question for us on appeal is whether these alleged unauthorized uses of the mark at the retail level should be attributable to hca,as the distributor of both the and products.optimum argues that it has presented sufficient evidence to establish that hca used its mark at the retail level,without its consent,and that it should be held liable for trademark infringement.a.it contends that,taken together,there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that hca was responsible for the place ment of the mark on goods or displays at the retail level,and that it can be held liable as a result.see.specifically,optimum argues that hca designed the product,including its upc code and its product identification number both of which were identical to that hca distributed the product to retailers,such as home depot,without sufficiently advising them that it was a different product that hca provided the underlying product information that these retailers relied upon to generate the shelf tags,product descriptions,and product labels inside their stores and that hca was responsible for ensuring that its products were properly labeled and identified,and were not erroneously intermingled,on the retail store shelves.
in response,hca argues that the district court was correct in concluding that the infringements at the retail not attributable to hca.it contends that hca did not have control over retailers databases,such as at home depot,and could not itself print a shelf tag to apply in home depot retail stores.br.of appellee at see also id.at.hca refers us to the court finding,in its summary judgment order,that there is no evidence that hca was responsible for generating the home depot pricing stickers or shelving labels or for placing the allegedly infringing stickers on the shelves.at.
in this case,we find,as the district court did,that the evidence produced by optimum was insufficient to establish that hca used its mark at the level of the retailers,such that it could be held directly liable for a trademark infringement.while there is some evidence that the replacement of the product with the product at retail stores may have resulted in confusion,in at least some retail stores,and while that confusion may have resulted in the unintentional and mislabeling of the product with the mark on some store shelves,there is no evidence that hca itself misused the mark,that is,that it placed the mark on goods or displays at the level of the retail stores.see.
on the contrary,the evidence makes clear that hca ceased its use in commerce of the mark when it made the switch over to the product and began selling the product to retail stores.there is no evidence that hca ever sold its product with the mark affixed to it,or that hca identified its product as anything other than at the retail level.see,at testimony of sean mcdermott that he had no evidence that the product was sold with the mark on it at testimony of vickie mcdermott that she never saw the product being sold with the mark on it at testimony of lewis mcdermott,same.
in fact,hca advised its retailers,prior to the implementation of the new product that it would be switching over to a new rug gripper product to its retailers,and that it would no longer be selling the old version.br.of appellee at at.hca randolph lear testified that he made it clear to hca sales force that the product would no longer be available after hca transitioned to the product,and that they were to advise their customers of this fact.a letter written by hca to home depot informed the company that hca would be rolling out a new technology for rugs and mats known as the product,and that this product would be replacing our current rug gripper product.at.
in short,optimum has failed to present sufficient evidence that hca was responsible for the alleged misuses of the mark at the level of the retail stores,evidence that it was required to submit in order to withstand summary judgment on its trademark infringement claim the district court acted properly in concluding that there was insufficient evidence of a use of the mark at the retail level that would support a claim for direct trademark infringement against hca.
optimum suggests in its appeal that the district court should have permitted it to proceed to trial on a claim of contributory trademark infringement,as an alternative grounds for liability.we have long recognized that a distributor in the chain of commerce,such as hca,may be held contributorily liable for a direct trademark infringement by a merchant to whom it distributes a product,where there is evidence that the distributor intentionally induce d the merchant to infringe another trademark or knowingly participated in a scheme of trademark infringement.see mini maid servs.maid brigade,cir adopting the contributory trademark liability standard of inwood,ives,d see also bauer lamp,shaffer,cir a person who knowingly participates in furthering the infringement is liable as a contributing party.optimum contends that it presented evidence that its mark was directly infringed at the level of the retail contention,as we noted earlier,that does not appear to be disputed by the parties that it presented evidence that hca knowingly participated in that infringement by its conduct.see mini maid,at.optimum suggests that hca using the same upc code and product identification number as the product,in providing all of the relevant product information to the retailers,in failing to advise retail stores to update their systems to reflect the new product,and in visiting stores to observe product that hca was a knowing participant in the infringement at the level of the retail stores,such that it should be held contributorily liable for the trademark infringements of the retailers.under this theory,hca knowingly contributed to the at the retail which products appeared above shelf tags bearing the mark,and products sat on retail store shelves in display cases denoted with the,as a result,it should be held secondarily responsible for those acts.
there are problems with this theory in this case,however.first,as the district court noted,optimum failed to properly plead a claim for contributory trademark infringement its complaint is devoid of any mention of holding hca opposed to for the alleged infringements of optimum mark.in fact,optimum complaint makes clear that its trademark infringement claim is based on hca alleged misuse of the mark,not the retailers.see at henkel has used optimum trademarks without authorization id.henkel has used the rug gripper trademarks without the authorization of optimum henkel activities constitute trademark infringement id.henkel infringement is wilful.optimum complaint does not allege that hca was a knowing participant in the separate,direct infringements at the retail level rather,the complaint clearly is based on alleged direct infringements,by hca,of the mark.thus,to permit optimum to now pursue a trademark infringement claim based on a contributory liability theory would require us to convert what is plainly a direct trademark infringement claim into one for contributory infringement.this is a step we are loath to take,and one for which there appears to be no authority in our circuit.indeed,optimum can refer us only to a district court opinion,from a different circuit,in support of the proposition that a court may alternatively construe a claim alleging a violat ion of as a claim for contributory trademark address that claim on the such a claim has not been explicitly pled.see fed of the blind,loompanics.
moreover,although there is no separate statutory provision for contributory trademark infringement,and although both actions stem from the general prohibitory language of,the case law suggests that a contributory infringement claim requires,at a minimum,both an allegation of a direct infringement by a third party,and an allegation of an intentional or knowing contribution to that infringement by the defendant.see,inwood,at.at stating that ives allege d that the manufacturers contributed to the infringing activities of pharmacists who mislabeled generic drugs emphasis added bolar pharm,cir stating that the alleged violation derived from allegations that the defendants manufacture and distribution of capsules identical to the plaintiff capsules,with reasonable anticipation or the intent that they would be illegally substituted for the plaintiff capsules,would constitute contributory trademark infringement emphasis added.to be sure,a number of lanham act cases suggest that contributory trademark infringement is typically alleged as a separate count.see,lockheed martin network solutions,cir where plaintiff alleged one claim for contributory infringement and a separate claim for direct infringement fonovisa,cherry auction,cir where the count for contributory trademark infringement was specifically alleged.
we decline optimum invitation to construe its case as one for contributory trademark infringement,where the elements in support of such a claim have not been pled.the tenth circuit declined a similar opportunity.see procter gamble haugen,cir where the plaintiff never used the phrase contributory infringement,and where the plaintiff only stated that the defendant implied ly approv ed of the infringing acts,stating that the court was reluctant to adopt such a broad definition of notice pleading so as to include a claim for contributory infringement.similar to the tenth circuit,we conclude that,absent some allegation of a contribution to a direct trademark infringement or of a knowing participation in a direct trademark infringement,mini maid,at,we will not construe a claim for direct trademark infringement under as being one for contributory trademark infringement 
finally,we note that there is no evidence in the record of optimum knowing participation in the alleged direct infringements of the mark at the retail that would be necessary to sustain a claim based on a theory of contributory trademark infringement.on the contrary,as we observed earlier,hca warned its retail partners in advance that it would be replacing the product with the product and that it would be discontinuing its sale of the former.at at.moreover,when there were occasional instances of at the level of the retail stores,hca worked to ensure that the problem was rectified and that was no longer labeled on store shelves with the mark.see at,testimony of home depot eric demaree that hca worked to ensure that any labeling problems were fixed at its retail stores.the record is devoid of evidence of a knowing participation on the part of hca in the alleged direct infringements at the retail level,evidence that would be necessary for optimum to withstand summary judgment on a claim of contributory trademark infringement.
for these reasons,we conclude that the district court acted properly in declining to address a separate claim of contributory trademark infringement against hca.because such a claim was not pled by optimum,the district court was not required to address such a claim in ruling on hca summary judgment motion.
in summary,in reviewing optimum trademark infringement action against hca based on the incidents in the retail stores,we conclude that optimum failed to satisfy the first prong of a trademark infringement is,an unauthorized use of the mark by hca at the retail level.because optimum failed to present sufficient evidence to support the use requirement of a trademark infringement action,we need not address the second step of the analysis,that is,whether the alleged misconduct at the retail stores if any was likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake or to deceive.see burger king,at alliance metals,of atlanta hinely,cir applying the likelihood of confusion analysis frehling,int l select group,cir same.any alleged confusion in this case,even if present,was not directly attributable to hca,the alleged infringer.since optimum claim for trademark on the on retail on the use prong,we do not undertake the likelihood of confusion analysis.we agree with the district court that hca was entitled to partial summary judgment on optimum trademark infringement claim,based on the incidents at the retail stores.
optimum count of unfair competition 
optimum also appeals the district court grant of partial summary judgment on its claims of unfair competition and unfair trade practices.optimum brought an unfair competition claim against hca under section a of the lanham act,a.optimum also lodged a claim under georgia analogous state law,the georgia uniform deceptive trade practices act,a.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of hca on both of these counts,at least with respect to the alleged incidents of confusion at the level of the retail stores optimum contends that this was in error.
section a of the lanham act creates a federal cause of action for unfair competition.of kpb,cir per curiam citation omitted.the pertinent statutory provision prohibits the use in commerce of any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact that is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,connection,or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods.a a.section a general purpose is to protect persons engaged in commerce against unfair competition.see dastar twentieth century fox film,d citing alterations omitted.more germane to the present action,however,section a prohibits a false designation of origin has been construed by the courts as creating a federal action for passing off,which occurs when a producer misrepresents his own goods or services as someone else.id.at.at thompkins lil joe records,cir.
in this case,optimum contends that hca pass ed off its product as if it were optimum product or associated with optimum,that is,that it substitut ed its product for that of another while misrepresenting the source of that product to the buyer.br.of appellant at.consequently,optimum argues that it has a viable section a claim against hca based on the product substitution at the level of the retail stores,and that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgement for hca on this claim.
we disagree.the supreme court has made clear that,in the context of a passing off false designation of origin claim under section a,the use of the word origin refers to a false or misleading suggestion as to the producer of the tangible goods that are offered for sale.dastar,at.at.in other words,a passing off claim requires a showing that the defendant falsely represented that the plaintiff was the source of the goods when it was not,that is,that it falsely suggested that the plaintiff was the producer of the tangible product sold in the marketplace.id.at.at.
here,there is no evidence that hca substituted its product on store shelves while suggesting that source was optimum the manufacturer of the product.in fact,the record is bereft of any evidence that hca ever represented as being manufactured by anyone other than hca.because hca did not misrepresent its own goods or services as being someone else,optimum,and because hca did not falsely suggest that optimum was the producer of the product sold in the marketplace,optimum has failed to allege evidence to support a claim of passing off at the level of the retail stores.see id.at.at.as a result,the district court acted properly in granting partial summary judgment on optimum section a claim 
optimum counts of breach of confidentiality,breach of fiduciary duty,and fraudulent concealment 
optimum also appeals the district court grant of summary judgment on its claims of breach of confidentiality and breach of fiduciary duty,and fraudulent concealment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of hca on these three counts,based on its conclusion that the parties were not in a confidential or a fiduciary relationship,and,therefore failing a contractual requirement there was no legally imposed duty that hca disclose to optimum the fact that it was replacing the product with the product.
where two parties enter into a confidential relationship,georgia law will impose a duty on the parties to disclose material facts to one another.see williams dresser,cir one can be liable for suppression of material facts under georgia law only if it is first shown that there is a relationship creating the duty to disclose.the burden is on the plaintiff to establish that a confidential relationship existed between the parties to the agreement.bogle bragg,citation omitted.generally speaking,business relationships are not confidential relationships,nor is t he mere fact that one party reposes trust and confidence in another integrity.williams,at.rather,in order for a business arrangement between two parties to rise to the level of a confidential relationship,it must be shown either that the parties have a long history with each other,or that the arrangement was not at arm length,but was in the nature of a legal partnership or a joint venture.see id.a confidential relationship does not arise,however,where the business transaction is merely an arrangement in which each party is attempting to further its own separate business objectives,rather than entering into some sort of joint venture.id.
mindful of these limitations,optimum argues that the relationship between optimum and hca was in the nature of a joint venture,or a legal partnership,and,therefore,that the parties stood in both a confidential and a fiduciary relationship to one that hca had a legal obligation to disclose its plans with respect to replacing with.we disagree.indeed,there is no evidence that the relationship was anything more than an informal business agreement between a manufacturer and a distributor,one which was terminable at will by the parties.as hca points out,merely calling the relationship a joint venture or a partnership does not make it so.nomenclature is not dispositive,and whether a partner in a joint venture is a party to a legal partnership depends on the rights and responsibilities assumed by the joint venturers,a sharing of the fruits and losses with an equal right,expressed or implied,to direct and control the conduct of the enterprise.jerry dickerson presents.chastain promotions,alterations,citations,and internal quotations omitted.
here,optimum has not presented any evidence that the parties split the profits of their business endeavor,nor has it established that the parties had an equal right to control the putative business enterprise.rather,the record makes clear that these two parties entered into a standard distributor in which optimum manufactured and supplied its product and hca distributed it to retailers.optimum has not presented sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the relationship with hca was in the nature of either a legal partnership or a joint venture,nor is there sufficient evidence to suggest a confidential or fiduciary relationship.w hen the facts do not authorize a finding of a confidential relationship,the trial court does not err in deciding the issue as a matter of law.williams,at.accordingly,the district court acted properly in granting summary judgment in favor of hca on optimum claims for breach of confidentiality and breach of fiduciary duty.and because one duty to disclose material facts is only imposed when the parties stand in such a relationship to one another,bogle,at,the district court also acted properly in granting summary judgment for hca on optimum claim of fraudulent concealment.
optimum counts of fraud and negligent misrepresentation 
optimum also appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of hca on optimum claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation.in order to establish these two claims,a plaintiff must show five elements that false representations were made that the defendant knew they were false that the representations were made either intentionally or negligently that the plaintiff reasonably relied upon the representations and that harm proximately resulted from that reliance.williams,at fraud macintyre edwards,rich,negligent misrepresentation.
the district court found that summary judgment was appropriate for hca on both counts,because optimum had failed to present any evidence of a false statement on the part of hca.the court further found that,even assuming that hca statement that it was preparing for a packaging change was false,summary judgment would still be appropriate,because there was no evidence that optimum suffered actual damages as a result its reliance on that statement.see,stiefel schick,stating that a party must show that actual damages,not simply nominal damages,flowed from the fraud alleged quotations and citation omitted.
we agree that hca was entitled to summary judgment on optimum claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation,because optimum has failed to provide evidence that hca made a false representation to optimum.optimum contends that hca statement,in late,that it was contemplating a packaging change with respect to the that therefore optimum should abstain from ordering additional packaging materially false.see,exh.stating that hca would be planning a packaging change to the rug gripper packaging,and that,as a result,optimum was not to order more packaging without hca okay see also at at.optimum asserts that this statement was false because,at the time the statement was made,hca was in reality contemplating a substitution of for product,rather than merely a packaging change.
as the district court found,however,optimum has failed to demonstrate at statement that hca would be making a packaging change to the product was false.in fact,hca maintains that this statement was actually true it points out that,in the wake of the merger and the name change from manco to henkel consumer adhesives in,hca parent company,henkel corporation,was redesigning the packaging for a number of its product lines,including carpet tape.even if this were not so,hca statement to optimum that it would be changing the packaging of the product was not false,because hca did,in fact,change the packaging,tweaking both the design and appearance of the package when it switched to the product in late.while optimum contends that hca was contemplating more than a mere packaging,it was an outright product factual statement that hca would,in the future,be changing the design and appearance of the product packaging was not false.because optimum has failed to present evidence that hca made a statement that was false the district court acted properly in concluding that hca was entitled to summary judgment on optimum claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation.
appeal of the district court judgment as a matter of law in favor of hca 
finally,optimum challenges the district court decision to grant hca renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,on optimum trademark infringement and unfair competition claims.we review a district court ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule de novo,examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the this case,optimum.doe celebrity cruises,cir citation omitted.
here,as discussed above,the trial proceedings were limited to the issue of hca conduct on its websites,and whether hca conduct on the websites constituted a trademark infringement or unfair competition.optimum was precluded from introducing any evidence as to the alleged misuses of the mark and product at the level of the retailers as the court explained to the jury in an early limiting instruction,t he one single claim that i have allowed to go forward in this case is the alleged trademark infringement that arose as a result of the defendant use of the mark on its website.that is the only claim that you will be allowed to consider in this case.at.optimum trial witnesses were similarly limited in their testimony to the question of whether hca misused the mark or the product in the context of the website they were not permitted to mention allegations of misconduct at the retail level.
after the jury was unable to reach a verdict on optimum trademark and unfair competition claims based on the website conduct,the court declared a mistrial.hca then renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court granted the motion,based on its determination that optimum had failed to establish a connection between the conduct hca use of the mark on the website and the expert damages figure million.because optimum had failed to produce evidence of damages caused by the use of the mark on hca web sites,and,accordingly,because there was no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for optimum on the issue of damages,the court awarded judgment as a matter of law to hca on optimum trademark infringement and unfair competition claims.at.optimum contends that this was in error.
under rule b,a party may renew its motion for judgment as a matter of law after the jury has returned its verdict,if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the party.see lipphardt durango steakhouse of brandon,cir.regardless of timing,however,in deciding on a rule motion a district court proper analysis is squarely and narrowly focused on the sufficiency of evidence.chaney city of orlando,cir.that is,t he question before the district court regarding a motion for judgment as a matter of law remains
