background 
this case arises from a dispute among members of the dakar family over ownership of two trademarks the sonya dakar mark and the problem skin specialists mark.the family conflict pits israel dakar and his son natan against israel wife sonya dakar,their son yigal,and their daughters daniella donna and michal mimi.
according to israel dakar,he and natan founded mindys cosmetics in and have managed the company since.in and,mindys registered the two trademarks at issue,listing donna dakar as the owner of the marks.in,yigal dakar retained kamran for a variety of services on behalf of the family business.kamran was not involved in the trademark registration.in,kamran noticed that the sonya dakar mark had expired.yigal,donna,and mimi instructed kamran to consult sonya about the registration.sonya instructed kamran to register both marks in her name,which kamran did.
in,israel and natan brought suit on behalf of mindys against sonya and donna the dakar defendants and kamran.the complaint alleged trademark infringement by sonya dakar,legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty by kamran,and fraudulent concealment and conversion by kamran and the dakar defendants.kamran moved under california law,to strike the claims against him.the district court denied kamran motion.it held that mindys suit against kamran did not arise from protected conduct under the statute and that,even if it did,mindys had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the merits of its claims.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review

iii.discussion 
kamran contends that mindys suit against him is a strategic lawsuit against public participation slapp within the meaning of california statute.see.california enacted the statute in response to the legislature concern about civil actions aimed at private citizens to deter or punish them for exercising their political or legal rights.united states ex rel.newsham lockheed missiles space,cir.the statute was designed to allow courts to promptly expose and dismiss meritless and harassing claims seeking to chill protected expression.bosley med,kremer,cir.the statute provides that a party may file a motion to strike a cause of action against it if the complaint aris es from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue.b.the statute is to be construed broadly.id.a vess,at.
a court considering a motion to strike under the statute must engage in a inquiry.vess,at.first,the defendant must make a prima facie showing that the plaintiff suit arises from an act in furtherance of the defendant rights of petition or free speech.id.internal quotation marks omitted.second,once the defendant has made a prima facie showing,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the challenged claims.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the defendant bringing a motion to strike need not show that the plaintiff suit was brought with the intention to chill the defendant speech or that any speech was actually chilled.id.
we hold that kamran has made a prima facie showing that the suit against him arises from a protected act under the statute.however,mindys has made a sufficient showing under the second part of the inquiry to withstand kamran motion to strike under the statute.we therefore affirm the district court denial of kamran motion to strike.
prima facie showing of a protected act 
defendant kamran bears the burden of demonstrating that mindys suit against him arises from a protected act.vess,at.
an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech includes 
any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law 
any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law 
any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest 
or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.
e.kamran contends that filing a trademark application with the united states patent and trademark office uspto constitutes a protected act under categories and.the district court did not determine whether this act constituted a protected act because it concluded that the suit did not arise from the filings even if they were protected.while it is a close question,we follow the california legislature direction that the statute be construed broadly,id.a,and hold that kamran act of filing the trademark applications with the uspto was a protected act within the meaning of the statute.
protected act 
the filing of a trademark application is a formal communication to the uspto seeking official action in a process governed by statute.see application for registration verification.we conclude that the application is protected by the statute as a writing made before an executive or other official proceeding authorized by law.e.the application may also be a writing made in connection with an issue under consideration by an executive body,or any other official proceeding.id.e.
california appellate courts interpreting the statute have distinguished between communications made in the course of official proceedings,which are protected,and mere ministerial business communications,which are not.for example,in computerxpress,jackson,the court of appeal found that filing a complaint with the sec that was designed to solicit an investigation qualified at least as a statement before an official proceeding under e.c ommunication to an official administrative agency designed to prompt action by that agency is as much a part of the official proceeding as a communication made after the proceeding had commenced.id.internal citations and some quotation marks omitted.in kibler northern inyo county local hospital district,cal th,the california supreme court held that a hospital peer review procedure qualifies as an official proceeding authorized by law because that procedure is required under california business and professions code section et,governing hospital peer review proceedings.in braun chronicle publishing,the court of appeal similarly concluded that an investigative audit conducted by a state auditor was an authorized,public proceeding because it is and provided for by statute.
in contrast,california appellate courts have held that ministerial acts involving primarily private transactions are not protected acts.for example,in blackburn brady,the court of appeal rejected the contention that statements made in connection with a sheriff auction could amount to protected speech under the law.the ministerial event of a sheriff sale or auction simply does not concern an issue under review or determine some disputed matter as contemplated under the law.id.it was a mere business dealing or transaction.see also kajima eng g,city of los angeles,the submission of contractual claims for payment in the regular course of business before the commencement of litigation simply is not an act in furtherance o
