meredith cranmer cranmer,tumblebus of louisville,appeals from the district court order granting tumblebus incorporated tumblebus motion for a preliminary injunction restricting cranmer use of the tumblebus mark and related trade dress during the pendency of the underlying infringement action.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand to the district court for further consideration of tumblebus motion for a preliminary injunction.
background 
in,brenda scharlow scharlow launched tumblebus,a company which provides gymnastics and physical education instruction to children.tumblebus,which bills itself as a mobile gym on wheels,furnishes such instruction at centers,birthday parties,and the like through the use of school buses retrofitted with gymnastics and other athletic equipment.tumblebus currently operates three to four buses on a regular basis,marketing its services in the greater louisville,kentucky area.
tumblebus business has also expanded to include the sale of retrofitted school buses to other persons wishing to enter the market.tumblebus has sold over two hundred retrofitted school buses to persons across the united states.buses sold by tumblebus seem to be similar in appearance to those used by tumblebus in its own business.tumblebus permits purchasers to use the tumblebus name when marketing their services,and many purchasers operate under names that include the word tumblebus.for approximately six years,tumblebus training session for new bus purchasers has included a presentation by donna dugan dugan,owner of the hot fonts printing company,who offers for sale letterhead,flyers,and other marketing materials containing the tumblebus name and iconography.
according to scharlow,tumblebus expansion into selling retrofitted buses to other operators began somewhat informally,and the decision was made early on not to structure the business as a franchise because franchising would require too much monitoring of individual franchisees operations.tumblebus also appears rather informal,and according to scharlow,tumblebus does not have a complete list of all persons who have purchased retrofitted buses.tumblebus,however,has maintained contact with some purchasers,distributing new lesson plans and business development ideas.
in november,tara pate pate purchased a retrofitted bus from tumblebus.when pate first discussed her potential purchase with scharlow,she indicated that she planned to operate in lexington,kentucky.scharlow,however,informed pate that two other persons were already operating in lexington,but suggested that pate could instead service elizabethtown,brandenburg,washington,bardstown,and radcliff,kentucky.according to scharlow and her husband,pate orally agreed to operate in this area but not to expand into louisville,where tumblebus was based.the scharlows admit,however,that they forgot to put this agreement in writing.testimony at the hearing also indicates that during a meeting between pate,pate mother,and scharlow,scharlow refused to include a territory provision in pate purchase contract.when asked what would prevent pate from operating in the louisville area,scharlow apparently responded that there would be nothing that she could do to stop pate from soliciting customers in the louisville area,but that she was confident in her customers loyalty to tumblebus 
in january,scharlow learned that pate had distributed flyers advertising her business to centers in the louisville area.scharlow contacted pate,reminding pate that she was not supposed to be operating in that area.pate explained that she was having difficulty in obtaining customers in elizabethtown and the surrounding areas,to which scharlow responded that pate could expand her operations into north bullitt county,kentucky,which included a center that tumblebus previously had serviced.ultimately,however,pate decided to leave the market and listed her bus for sale in a louisville newspaper.
cranmer noticed pate advertisement in the louisville newspaper and contacted tumblebus in order to determine,for comparison purposes,what a newly retrofitted bus from tumblebus would cost.scharlow testified that when cranmer called,she noticed that cranmer telephone number had a louisville area code,so she asked cranmer from where she was calling.when cranmer explained that she was calling from louisville,scharlow apparently responded that she would not sell cranmer a bus in louisville because other tumblebus operators were already in that area.cranmer then stated that her sister was interested in purchasing a bus for operation in bloomington,indiana,and the discussion continued.
in april,cranmer purchased pate tumblebus and began operating in the louisville area under the name tumblebus.upon learning that cranmer was operating in louisville,scharlow contacted cranmer.cranmer and scharlow discussed the possibility of cranmer changing or adding something to the name of cranmer business,and scharlow suggested such names as meredith tumblebus,fun bus,and gym on wheels.cranmer eventually listed her business in the fall louisville telephone book with the same louisville telephone number previously used by pate under the name tumblebus of louisville.tumblebus also appeared in the fall louisville telephone book,but was listed after tumblebus of louisville,appeared in smaller typeface,and included a new albany,indiana telephone number.scharlow then began insisting that cranmer remove the word tumblebus from her business name.
scharlow claims that tumblebus has suffered adverse consequences because of cranmer operation in the louisville area.during the preliminary hearing,scharlow recounted incidents in which customers apparently confused the two businesses,such as customers sending their payments to the wrong business and persons who had contracted with cranmer telephoning tumblebus when cranmer failed to show up for scheduled appointments.according to scharlow,tumblebus income has declined as a result.
in july,tumblebus filed suit against cranmer in the district court for the western district of kentucky,accusing cranmer of trademark infringement,trade dress infringement,and false advertising in violation of of the lanham act,a,as well as trademark infringement,trade dress infringement,and unfair competition under kentucky common law.tumblebus then moved for entry of an order preliminarily enjoining cranmer from using the tumblebus mark and associated trade dress.in december,the district court held a hearing with respect to whether a preliminary injunction should issue,during which scharlow,scharlow husband larry scharlow,cranmer,pate,pate mother karen morris,and dugan testified.at the conclusion of the hearing,the district judge stated that he would grant tumblebus request for a preliminary injunction with respect to cranmer use of the tumblebus mark in jefferson county,kentucky floyd county,indiana and clark county,indiana collectively,the greater louisville area.the district judge also indicated that he would enjoin cranmer from using the tumblebus trade dress in the greater louisville area,but stated that he would allow cranmer time to decide whether she would continue to provide services in the greater louisville area which would require physical alteration of the bus appearance or whether she would operate exclusively outside the greater louisville area in which case no change in the bus exterior would be required in january,the district court issued its preliminary injunction order,and cranmer timely appealed to this court.
ii.analysis 
grounds for obtaining a preliminary injunction 
when considering a motion for preliminary injunctive relief,courts must balance 
whether the movant has a strong likelihood of success on the merits whether the movant would suffer irreparable injury without the injunction whether issuance of the injunction would cause substantial harm to others and whether the public interest would be served by issuance of the injunction.

in granting tumblebus motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court below concluded that tumblebus had demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on its tumblebus mark and trade dress infringement claims,notwithstanding cranmer various asserted defenses that tumblebus faced irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief,based on the evidence of actual confusion and the financial losses already sustained by tumblebus that the injunction would not cause substantial harm to cranmer because the injunction did not require cranmer business to cease operation and that the public interest weighed in favor of injunctive relief because of the risk of confusion.on appeal,cranmer central argument,and thus the focus of our inquiry,is that the preliminary injunction entered in this case can not stand because tumblebus has failed to demonstrate a strong likelihood of succeeding on the claims it asserts in this action.see id.at,see also circuit city stores,carmax,cir.
likelihood of success on lanham act mark infringement claim 
section a of the lanham act,a,provides a federal cause of action for infringement of marks and trade dress that have not obtained federal registration.see two pesos,taco cabana,d etw jireh publ g,cir gray meijer,cir.when evaluating a lanham act claim for infringement of an unregistered mark,courts must determine whether the mark is protectable,and if so,whether there is a likelihood of confusion as a result of the infringer use of the mark 
existence of a protectable mark 
first,we must consider whether the district court erred in concluding that tumblebus is a protectable mark whose infringement can give rise to liability under a of the lanham act.the protectability of the tumblebus mark depends on the level of the mark distinctiveness.suggestive arbitrary and fanciful marks are inherently distinctive and are protectable so long as the putative owner has actually used the mark.see two pesos,at.circuit city,at.merely descriptive marks are not inherently distinctive,but can become protectable by developing a secondary meaning generic marks on the other hand,receive no protection.see degidio west group,cir,cert.denied,d.in the case at bar,the district court appears to have concluded that the tumblebus mark is protectable as a suggestive mark,a finding which we review for clear error see id.at.
cranmer contends that tumblebus is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its mark infringement claim because tumblebus is a generic term not entitled to lanham act protection.in cranmer view,the two constituent parts of tumblebus tumble and bus are generic terms that,when combined,are the most concise,easily understood way of referring to the services provided by cranmer and tumblebus see in re gould paper,concluding that the term screenwipe is generic,explaining that,the defendant has simply joined the two most pertinent and individually generic terms applicable to its product,and then attempts to appropriate the ordinary compound thus created as its trademark.in this instance,the terms remain as generic in the compound as individually,and the compound thus created is itself generic.
in support of her argument that tumblebus is a generic term,cranmer cites scharlow testimony that tumblebus was a natural choice because tumblebus business was tumbling on a bus,and that tumblebus was the most descriptive name scharlow could think of.joint appendix at test.of brenda scharlow at.this statement by scharlow,however,does not prove that tumblebus is in fact generic.first,scharlow subsequently clarified during her testimony that the term preschool gym on wheels would be more descriptive of tumblebus business than tumblebus.at test.of brenda scharlow at.moreover,many of the tumblebus advertising materials,including those used by tumblebus,bear phrases such as gym on wheels,which indicates that the term tumblebus alone has not been sufficient to convey the nature of tumblebus services.at tumblebus letterhead including subtitles mobile gym on wheels and a bus filled with fun equipment bringing fitness to children at daycares,elementary and private schools at tumblebus business card including subtitle a gym on wheels.thus,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that tumblebus is not a generic term incapable of obtaining protected status.
moreover,upon consideration of the record before us,the district court apparent categorization of tumblebus as a suggestive,rather than merely descriptive,mark is not clear error.the line between merely descriptive and suggestive marks is admittedly hazy and can be difficult to discern.see degidio,at.nevertheless,the tumblebus mark shares a closer kinship with those marks previously designated as suggestive than those labeled merely descriptive because of the degree of inferential reasoning necessary for a consumer to discern that the tumblebus mark relates to the provision of gymnastics and fitness instruction to children.see inductotherm,cir explaining that a suggestive mark requires the observer or listener to use imagination and perception to determine the nature of the goods internal quotation marks and citations omitted.although the word tumble does describe a subset of the activities which occur inside tumblebus bus,the connection between tumble and bus is not so obvious that a consumer seeing tumblebus in isolation would know that the term refers to instruction,and not,for instance,a mobile laundry service using.again,the fact that tumblebus has found it necessary to include explanatory phrases such as gym on wheels in its advertising materials indicates that the term tumblebus does not merely describe the services provided by tumblebus.as a result,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in classifying tumblebus as an inherently distinctive,suggestive mark.
likelihood of confusion 
to recover on a claim of mark infringement,a mark owner must establish not only that the mark is protectable,but also that use of the mark by the opposing party is likely to cause confusion.when evaluating the likelihood of confusion,a district court must balance the following factors 
strength of the plaintiff mark 
relatedness of the goods 
similarity of the marks 
evidence of actual confusion 
marketing channels used 
likely degree of purchaser care 
defendant intent in selecting the mark and 
likelihood of expansion of the product lines.

cranmer does not appear to challenge the district court determination,and testimony elicited at the evidentiary hearing,as well as cranmer interrogatory responses,indicate that cranmer and tumblebus customers have actually confused the two businesses,misdirecting payments and telephone inquiries.we conclude that the tumblebus mark relative strength as a suggestive mark and the record evidence of actual confusion weigh in favor of finding a likelihood of confusion,and that,based on the record before us,none of the other frisch factors militate against such a finding.see id.at explaining that a suggestive term is considered stronger than one that is merely descriptive,albeit not as strong as an arbitrary or fanciful mark wynn oil thomas,cir noting that e vidence of actual confusion is undoubtedly the best evidence of likelihood of confusion.thus,tumblebus has made a sufficient showing of likely confusion to sustain entry of a preliminary injunction with respect to the tumblebus mark.
asserted defenses 
abandonment of rights in a mark through naked licensing 
cranmer argues that tumblebus is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its mark infringement claim because tumblebus has abandoned any rights it might have to the tumblebus mark through naked licensing.title provides that 
a mark shall be deemed abandoned w hen any course of conduct of the owner,including acts of omission as well as commission,causes the mark to become the generic name for the goods or services on or in connection with which it is used or otherwise to lose its significance as a mark.
one method by which a mark may be abandoned is through naked licensing,which occurs w hen a trademark owner fails to exercise reasonable control over the use of a mark by a licensee,such that the presence of the mark on the licensee goods or services misrepresents their connection with the trademark owner since the mark no longer identifies goods or services that are under the control of the owner of the mark and the mark can no longer provide a meaningful assurance of quality.restatement third of unfair competition cmt.b.
according to cranmer,tumblebus pattern of allowing its purchasers to use the term tumblebus in their businesses has resulted in the tumblebus mark losing its significance in the greater louisville area.the record before us,however,contains insufficient evidence for us to conclude that cranmer defense of abandonment is so strong as to make it unlikely that tumblebus will succeed on the merits of its trademark infringement claim.see exxon oxxford clothes,cir,cert.denied,d because naked licensing is generally ultimately relevant only to establish an unintentional trademark abandonment which results in a loss of trademark rights against the world,the burden of proof faced by third parties attempting to show abandonment through naked licensing is stringent.first,based on the testimony presented at the evidentiary hearing,it is unclear whether the relationship between tumblebus and the purchasers of its buses with respect to the tumblebus mark is most aptly categorized as a license,a agreement,or neither.see mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.in a license,the licensee is engaging in acts which would infringe the licensor mark but for the permission granted in the license.in that event,quality control is essential a consent agreement does not require quality control because by the very essence of the agreement,the parties recognize that concurrent usage does not lead customers to link the goods or services of the parties.whereas a license brings the parties together into a common public image and a joint enterprise,a consent agreement keeps the parties apart at a defined distance.
moreover,cranmer abandonment defense lacks force because it relies on abandonment of the tumblebus mark in other parts of the united states to effectuate a forfeiture of tumblebus rights to the mark in the greater louisville area in support of her abandonment defense,cranmer asserts that,in creating the lanham act,congress recognized the need for nationalization of trademark law in light of the increasing nationalization of trade and commerce.arguably,some of our prior decisions have suggested that a junior operation in a different geographic region from the senior might not,by itself,foreclose the senior claim for infringement against the junior user.see circuit city,at jones,concurring champions,at.these cases would be turned on their heads,however,if we were to conclude that,because trademark rights may extend beyond the particular geographic area in which a business operates,a trademark holder may also lose any rights it has in a mark anywhere in the united states by abandoning the mark in one part of the country or by failing to establish a mark with national significance.
indeed,contrary to cranmer suggestion otherwise,there is considerable support for the concept that rights in a mark may be abandoned in certain geographic areas but not others,partial geographic abandonment.see sheila shine,sheila shine,cir prichard consumers brewing,cir,cert.denied.while a extends to every market where the trader goods have become known and identified by his use of the mark,the mark itself can not travel to markets where the trader does not offer,or has not offered,the articles for sale.such permission for use north of the ohio river,would be a naked license and void,resulting in an abandonment by prichard of any rights to the mark in that area.emphasis added citations omitted restatement third of unfair competition cmt.a priority at common law extends only to the geographic areas in which the trademark owner uses the designation or in which the designation is associated with the trademark owner.common law priority in a particular geographic area is thus lost if the designation has been abandoned by the owner in that geographic area.emphasis added citation omitted restatement third of unfair competition cmt.b if substantial uncontrolled use is confined to a particular geographic or product market,a court may conclude that the mark has been abandoned only in that geographic area or in connection with use on that product.the trademark owner then retains its priority in the use of the mark in other areas or on other products.
in the end,we must return to the statutory mandate of,which provides that abandonment occurs when a term lose s its significance as a mark.so long as the tumblebus mark retains its significance in the greater louisville area,we fail to see why tumblebus should be foreclosed from asserting its rights in the tumblebus mark in that market.see exxon,at i f a trademark has not ceased to function as an indicator of origin there is no reason to believe that the public will be misled under these circumstances,neither the express declaration of congress intent in subsection nor the corollary policy considerations which underlie the doctrine of naked licensing warrant a finding that the trademark owner has forfeited his rights in the mark.given the lack of evidence in the record suggesting that the tumblebus mark has in fact lost its significance in the greater louisville area,we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that tumblebus is likely to succeed on its mark infringement claim notwithstanding cranmer asserted defense of abandonment.
cranmer also argues that tumblebus is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its mark infringement claim because the exhaustion or defense insulates cranmer from liability.the doctrine provides that a purchaser who does no more than stock,display,and resell a producer product under the producer trademark violates no right conferred upon the producer by the lanham act.sebastian int l,longs drug stores,cir,cert.denied,d see also paccar telescan,cir.this is true because,when a retailer merely resells a genuine,unaltered good under the trademark of the producer,the use of the producer trademark by the reseller will not deceive or confuse the public as to the nature,qualities,and origin of the good.see restatement third of unfair competition cmt.
the doctrine does not apply in the case at bar,however,because cranmer is not using the tumblebus mark to resell a genuine good produced by tumblebus,but rather is using the mark to promote her own service.unlike goods,which can be sold and resold without change to their nature,quality,and genuineness,services such as gymnastics and fitness instruction inherently vary depending on who is providing such services.even assuming cranmer and tumblebus use identical retrofitted school buses when providing their gymnastics and services,other factors,such as the quality of instructors and lesson plans,necessarily distinguish the services provided by the two companies,such that the public could be confused as to what qualities the tumblebus mark embodies.see paccar,at the first sale doctrine offers no defense when the reseller used the trademark in a manner likely to cause the public to belie
