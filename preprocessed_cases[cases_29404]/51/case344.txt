appellants falls media,llc,justin heimberg,and david gomberg collectively falls media appeal the district court summary judgment for appellee zobmondo entertainment,llc zobmondo rejecting falls media action for trademark infringement,unfair competition,and related claims arising from zobmondo use of falls media federally registered trademark,would you rather.the district court held that would you rather is not entitled to federal trademark protection because the mark is merely descriptive and lacks secondary meaning,and the district court ordered the mark cancelled from the federal trademark registry.we have jurisdiction under.we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether would you rather is merely descriptive.hence we reverse the summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
this appeal involves a persistent dispute between two competitors,falls and zobmondo,over the right to sell products using the would you rather mark.both competitors use similar marks to identify board games and books that incorporate questions posing humorous,bizarre,or undesirable choices as of,both competitors had established successful businesses earning millions of dollars in revenues from sales of would you rather products.
on july,falls media filed an itu application with the united states patent and trademark office pto stating its intent to use the mark in two product categories books and games falls media published its first book using the mark,would you rather over absolutely absurd dilemmas to ponder,in october of.it published a sequel to the book,would you rather,electric boogaloo,in.these books were carried by retailers including borders,barnes noble,and urban outfitters.to promote the books,falls media also established a website,which as of was receiving about unique visitors per month.although the books were not the subject of a paid advertising campaign at the time of their publication,they received unpaid print,radio,and television publicity,including mention in magazines such as rolling stone and comment on television shows such as oprah and the tonight show with jay leno.heimberg and gomberg also made personal appearances to promote their books.as of zobmondo began using would you rather as a mark on its board falls media had sold about total copies of its two would you rather books.
in september of after falls media filed its itu founder,randall horn,also filed an itu application seeking to register the mark would you rather.horn application was rejected by the pto because of the likelihood of confusion with the mark that was the subject of falls media prior itu filing nonetheless,in zobmondo began producing games using a concept similar to the one adopted by falls media,including zobmondo that crazy would you rather game,and zobmondo the outrageous game of bizarre choices,the latter of which was licensed to hasbro between and.when hasbro license expired in,zobmondo a new version of the game prominently featuring the mark would you rather on the game packaging.zobmondo has produced several versions of its game under the would you rather mark since then.
in january of,the pto issued a notice of allowance of falls media itu application.falls media had not yet released a game using the would you rather mark.falls media sought and received five extensions of time from the pto,finally releasing its first would you rather board game in december.on july,having received falls media statement of use,the pto issued falls media a registration for the would you rather mark.
thereafter,and perhaps in response,zobmondo filed suit against falls media in the central district of california in alleging,among other things,statutory and infringement,copyright infringement,and unfair competition arising from falls media would you rather board game.falls media then filed suit against zobmondo in the southern district of new york alleging trademark infringement,unfair competition,and other claims under federal and state law.zobmondo in the new york action counterclaimed against falls media,seeking,inter alia,cancellation of falls media would you rather trademark registration.the claims in the new york action were transferred to the central district of california and consolidated with zobmondo action against falls media.thus the claims and counterclaims in both actions came to a district court within the ninth circuit.
falls media and zobmondo filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to zobmondo on falls media trademark infringement and unfair competition claims,falls media claim alleging a violation of california business and professions code et,and zobmondo counterclaim seeking cancellation of falls media mark from the federal registry the district court concluded that,despite the presumption of validity given to falls media federal trademark registration,there was no genuine issue of material fact whether would you rather was a protectable mark this mark,as perceived by the district court,was merely descriptive of an aspect of falls media games,and no rational juror could find that falls media had acquired secondary meaning in the mark by the time zobmondo began using it in.
falls media timely appealed.on appeal,falls media contends that it raised genuine issues of material fact regarding whether would you rather is a valid,protectable mark.

marks are generally classified in one of five categories of increasing distinctiveness generic,descriptive,suggestive,arbitrary,or fanciful.two pesos,taco cabana,d.which category a mark belongs in is a question of fact.see lahoti,cir.suggestive,arbitrary,and fanciful marks are considered inherently distinctive and are automatically entitled to federal trademark protection because their intrinsic nature serves to identify a particular source of a product.two pesos,at.generic marks are not eligible for trademark protection.entrepreneur media,at.merely descriptive marks are somewhere although they are not inherently distinctive and are therefore not entitled to automatic trademark protection,a merely descriptive mark can become protectable if it has acquired distinctiveness as used on or in connection with the applicant goods in commerce.f.this acquired distinctiveness is referred to as secondary meaning.two pesos,at.

in this appeal,we review the district court conclusion that falls media raised no genuine issue of material fact on two issues whether would you rather is suggestive and not merely descriptive,and whether falls media had acquired secondary meaning in the mark.we address these issues in turn.
falls media first contends that the district court erred by concluding that there was no genuine issue of material fact whether would you rather is suggestive,concluding instead that the mark is merely descriptive a suggestive mark is one for which a consumer must use imagination or any type of multistage reasoning to understand the mark significance the mark does not describe the product features,but suggests them.winery,gallo winery,cir.by contrast,a merely descriptive mark describes the qualities or characteristics of a good or service.park n fly,dollar park fly,d.it define s qualities or characteristics of a product in a straightforward way that requires no exercise of the imagination to be understood.entrepreneur media,at quoting,at see also union bank of,laredo,union bank of,austin,cir i n many cases,a descriptive term will be an adjective such as speedy,friendly,green,menthol,or reliable.whether a mark suggests or describes the goods or services of the trademark holder depends on what those goods or services are,and w e therefore adjudge a mark strength by reference to the goods or services that it identifies entrepreneur media,at quotation marks omitted.in distinguishing between suggestive and descriptive marks,we are aware that d eciding whether a mark is distinctive or merely descriptive is far from an exact science and is a tricky business at best.lahoti,at quotation marks omitted mccarthy the borderline is hardly a clear one,observing that the dichotomy is not some kind of concrete and objective classification system.
because falls media showed that would you rather was registered without proof of secondary meaning,falls media was entitled to a presumption that the mark is inherently,the burden shifted to zobmondo to show that the mark is merely descriptive by a preponderance of the evidence.see tie tech,at quicksilver,at.federal registration in itself does not mean that falls media can necessarily survive summary judgment solely on the basis of its registration.a ssuming the defendant can demonstrate through law,undisputed facts,or a combination thereof that the mark is invalid,the evidentiary bubble created by the federal registration bursts and the plaintiff can not survive summary judgment.in the face of sufficient and undisputed facts demonstrating invalidity,the registration loses its evidentiary significance.tie tech,at see also talking rain beverage beach beverage,cir.nonetheless,the presumption of validity is a strong one,and the burden on the defendant necessary to overcome that presumption at summary judgment is heavy.see,americana trading,russ berrie,cir reversing a district court grant of summary judgment because the district court gave insufficient weight to the presumptive effect of the plaintiff federal registration.there can be no serious dispute with the principle that a federal trademark registration of a particular mark supports the distinctiveness of that mark,because the pto should not otherwise give it protection.registration alone may be sufficient in an appropriate case to satisfy a determination of distinctiveness.lahoti,at.stated another way,the federal officials who register a mark are perceived to have some expertise in assessing if it is entitled to registration,and absent a presentation of secondary meaning,their registration is entitled to a presumptive validity,a presumptive conclusion that the mark was distinctive else they would not have registered it.nonetheless,while the registration adds something on the scales,we must come to grips with an assessment of the mark itself.
we have generally applied one or two tests to differentiate between suggestive and merely descriptive marks.because the district court found the application of these tests,the imagination test and the competitors needs test,important to its summary judgment inquiry,we examine each in turn.we stress that these tests are only criteria offer ing guidance,fellowship church ananda church of,cir,and that the burden to show that there is no genuine issue of material fact is on the moving party,zobmondo,while the party,falls media,gets the benefit of reasonable inferences.
the first,and clearly the,test is known as the imagination test,and asks whether imagination or a mental leap is required in order to reach a conclusion as to the nature of the product being referenced.rudolph int l,realys,cir quotation marks omitted.for example,the mark entrepreneur as applied to a magazine was descriptive,not suggestive,because an entirely unimaginative,person would understand the significance of the reference.entrepreneur media,at.on the other hand,roach motel was held suggestive because an ordinary consumer having read or heard on television the words roach motel would remember the conception a fanciful abode for roaches in an establishment normally frequented by human travelers.am.home prods.johnson chem,cir.we have said that the imagination test is our primary criterion for evaluating distinctiveness,at.
the district court determined that the imagination test indicated that would you rather is merely descriptive as a matter of law because it requires no imaginative or interpretive leap to understand that this phrase is the main aspect of the game to which it is affixed.falls media argues that the district court erred because multistage reasoning is needed to link the mark to the essential nature of these products that the choices are ridiculous,bizarre,or themed and that they are limited to a format.
we reject falls media argument in part.the imagination test does not ask what information about the product could be derived from a mark,but rather whether a mental leap is required to understand the mark relationship to the product.rudolph int l,at quotation omitted and emphasis added.our prior precedent makes it clear that merely descriptive marks need not describe the essential nature of a product it is enough that the mark describe some aspect of the product.see,bada,at holding the mark merely descriptive when applied to wheel balancers and weights.
but we conclude that the district court erred in concluding that the imagination test indicates that would you rather is merely descriptive as a matter of law.we can not look the entire mark up in a dictionary there is no literal meaning of the would you rather phrase,given that the words precede an ellipse one may infer that there is a question,but only imagination can tell us that the question will serve up a bizarre or humorous choice.see surgicenters of,med.dental surgeries,cir while not determinative,dictionary definitions are relevant and often persuasive in determining how a term is understood by the consuming public entrepreneur media,at holding that entrepreneur is merely descriptive as the name of a magazine because an entirely unimaginative,person would understand its meaning.on the one hand,consumers who already understand the phrase would you rather to refer specifically to a game of questions involving bizarre or humorous choices might not consider the mark very suggestive as the name of a board game,but to consumers who do not share such an understanding,would you rather is simply the first three words of an question.for those consumers,the mark would you rather may not describe anything,except that a question is asked,and may indeed require imagination and multistage reasoning to understand the mark relationship to the game to which it is affixed.see rudolph int l,at,at observing that the mark recovery in the selfhelp context is descriptive,but the same mark is suggestive when used as the name of a business teaching counselors to teach because the extra step constitutes the difference between descriptiveness and suggestiveness.given the record before us,which lacks comprehensive consumer surveys,we can not say with confidence precisely what consumers will understand the phrase would you rather to mean,nor are we confident that our own understanding of the phrase is an adequate substitute with respect to a registered mark the putative infringer burden is not simply to show that the mark describes a feature of the trademark holder product rather,it must show that consumers regard the mark as merely descriptive of that product.borinquen biscuit trading,cir.when we give all reasonable inferences to falls media,and credit its evidence as true,we conclude that the imagination test is inconclusive by itself to determine if the challenged mark is descriptive or suggestive of a board game.
the second test,known as the competitors needs test,focuses on the extent to which a mark is actually needed by competitors to identify their goods or services.rodeo collection,seventh,cir.if competitors have a great need to use a mark,the mark is probably descriptive on the other hand,if the suggestion made by the mark is so remote and subtle that it is really not likely to be needed by competitive sellers to describe their goods or services,this tends to indicate that the mark is merely suggestive.id.internal punctuation omitted.the competitors needs test is related to the imagination test,because the more imagination that is required to associate a mark with a product or service,the less likely the words used will be needed by competitors to describe their products or services.id.internal punctuation omitted.
the district court concluded that the competitors needs test was difficult to apply in this case and declined to consider it because these tests are merely factors to consider and other tests favored zobmondo.falls media argues that this was error,and in this case we agree.drawing all inferences in favor of falls media,the competitors needs test strongly favored falls media argument that would you rather is suggestive.falls media proffered significant evidence suggesting that its competitors do not need to use would you rather to fairly describe their products.perhaps most important is the experience of zobmondo itself.zobmondo identified possible alternative names for its game during development.also,zobmondo marketed and sold its game and a related book for a period of time without using the phrase would you rather instead using the name the outrageous game of bizarre choices,and another board game company used the name would you prefer during the same time period.these titles are not linguistically inferior to would you rather.entrepreneur media,at observing that others need the term entrepreneur because w e are not aware of,nor has emi suggested,any synonym for the word.in the face of this evidence,credited as true on summary judgment,it difficult to say that zobmondo necessarily needs to use would you rather for its version of the board game of bizarre or humorous choices.
zobmondo argues that would you rather is needed to fairly describe its products because the meaning of the phrase would you rather is entrenched in the minds of consumers in a way that renders other possible marks inherently inferior.this argument,however,depends on a disputed issue of fact regarding the meaning of the phrase to consumers,an issue that we have already suggested can not adequately be decided at summary judgment on the basis of abstract theorizing alone.giving all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of falls media,competitors do not need to use would you rather to describe their products.they can say would you prefer or would you most like or use some other verbal formula to convey a choice of alternatives.
the district court also employed a third test,known as the test,which evaluates the extent to which other sellers have used the mark on similar merchandise.mccarthy see also.com,commc house int l,d,i n determining whether a word has a descriptive or suggestive significance as applied to a commercial service,it is proper to take notice of the extent to which others in a similar commercial context use the word.zobmondo introduced evidence of six published books with the words would you rather in the title,as well as printouts from search results using the phrase.falls media argues that the district court improperly credited this disputed evidence over falls media objections without considering whether the words would you rather were used as a trademark and without making all inferences in falls media favor 
we are not aware of any prior case in our circuit employing the test as a controlling measure of trademark validity,and we need not do so here.if,as we see it,a summary judgment is disfavored by both the imagination test and the needs test,then extent of use at most could only be one factor to be considered,and could not command a summary judgment in the face of disputed facts about how a mark might be perceived by consumers.extensive use of a mark by third parties might indicate that the mark is merely descriptive of a given class of products.see,sec,first sec,cir concluding that the mark security center is descriptive in part because of the number of enterprises throughout the nation that use security center in some form.but having determined for purposes of summary judgment that the imagination test is inconclusive and that the competitors needs test favors suggestiveness,we are not persuaded that the result of the test,based on zobmondo proffered evidence,renders would you rather merely descriptive as a matter of law.zobmondo evidence of third party use is relevant,and may be considered by the trier of fact.but it must be measured,not merely against the results of abstract theoretical tests,but against the presumption of validity afforded to falls media registered mark and against any other evidence of distinctiveness that falls media has proffered.
the district court relied on the following evidence in concluding that would you rather is merely descriptive 
a statement by falls media literary agent that the mark was an utterly obvious title for books b ecause it was a clear explanation of the content of the book.
a statement by falls media sales agent that would you rather is a better name than zobmondo because somebody looking at zobmondo would not know that it contains would you rather questions.
a statement by james pressman,who optioned falls media game,that would you rather was a good name for the product because it gave you a good idea of what the game was all about because the questions always started with would you rather.
an from gomberg stating that most people that make the purchase of a would you rather game do it because they familiar with the opposed to the actual game play or content.
zobmondo evidence of books,websites,and copyright registrations suggesting that the would you rather concept predates falls media trademark application.
we agree with the district court that this evidence collectively has some persuasive weight,but we do not believe it is so that there can be no doubt about how the question regarding the distinctiveness of the mark should be answered.packman chi.tribune,cir quoting door,door,cir.that would you rather is an utterly obvious title for a book does not necessarily mean the mark is an equally obvious title in the context of a board game.see lahoti,at mccarthy it must be kept in mind that a term that is in one category for a particular product may be in a quite different category for another product.the statement that would you rather is more descriptive than zobmondo does not exclude the possibility that it is still suggestive,nor does pressman comment that would you rather gives a person a good idea of what the game is about a mark can be suggestive and still convey information about a product.see,mccarthy listing marks that have been found suggestive,including citibank for an urban bank,classic cola for a soft drink,for mattress sales,and florida tan for suntan lotion.gomberg that purchasers are ge
