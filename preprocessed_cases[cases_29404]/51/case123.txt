grayson o company grayson o,a haircare product manufacturer and holder of a registered trademark,brought this trademark and unfair competition action against agadir international llc agadir,a competitor haircare product manufacturer.the district court granted summary judgment to agadir,finding that grayson o had failed to show the marks were likely to be confused.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
grayson o sells products designed to protect hair from heat during styling.the company owns a federal trademark registration for the mark f.f,registration.the registered mark is not stylized and does not claim to protect any particular font,style,size,or color.id.although the registered mark contains no degree symbol,the product labels on which the mark appears do contain a degree symbol the labels also contain a lowercase f,a stylized,and almost no space between the f and.on its website,grayson o refers to its products as or the fahrenheit line,thermafuse,last visited april.
in the hair care industry,often refers to the temperature to which one can heat hair before it melts or scorches.a number of products that reference fahrenheit have entered the market.most relevant to this case,agadir sells a product called hair shield plus or agadir argan oil hair shield plus,depending on how one reads the label the on agadir label is not stylized.both grayson o and agadir sell their products exclusively at salons,which means their direct customers are salon professionals who then sell the products to their clients.
in july,grayson o participated in a tradeshow in las vegas.at the show,grayson o employees and customers approached van darren stamey,the president of grayson o,and told him that someone is infringing on your mark.the alleged infringer was agadir,which was marketing its products at the show and displaying a prominent sign.on july,grayson o sent agadir a cease and desist letter regarding the f mark and another mark unrelated to this litigation.agadir responded that it used on its label not as a mark,but as a fair and good faith description of the good attached to the label.agadir explained that its products protect hair up to fahrenheit and that no likelihood of confusion existed between its use of the term and grayson o mark given the difference between the appearances of the product labels.at some point after receiving the letter,agadir changed the name of its products from heat shield to hair shield and resized the phrase hair shield on the label 
on december,grayson o initiated this lawsuit,alleging that agadir infringed on its trademark and engaged in unfair competition in violation of the lanham act and north carolina law.upon completion of discovery,grayson o moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability for trademark infringement and unfair competition and sought to enjoin agadir from using the mark.agadir also moved for summary judgment.
after examining the relevant factors,the district court found that grayson o had failed to show a likelihood of confusion between the marks.grayson o agadir int l llc,cv moc dck,wl,at.in particular,the court held that grayson o mark was conceptually and commercially weak,that the marks were not similar,that there was no evidence of agadir intent to infringe on grayson o mark,and that there was only de minimis evidence of confusion.id.the court denied grayson o motion for partial summary judgment and granted summary judgment to agadir.id.grayson o timely noted this appeal.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment to agadir and its denial of summary judgment to grayson see synergistic int l,llc korman,cir.
to demonstrate trademark infringement under the lanham act,a plaintiff must prove,first,that it owns a valid and protectable mark,and,second,that the defendant use of a reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of that mark creates a likelihood of confusion.carefirst of,first care,cir.quoting a.grayson o has registered its mark,and so we assume the registered mark is valid and protectable.we must focus,therefore,on whether any likelihood of confusion exists between grayson o mark and agadir mark.
to determine if a likelihood of confusion exists,we consider nine factors 
the strength or distinctiveness of the plaintiff mark as actually used in the marketplace 
the similarity of the two marks to consumers 
the similarity of the goods or services that the marks identify 
the similarity of the facilities used by the markholders 
the similarity of advertising used by the markholders 
the defendant intent 
actual confusion 
the quality of the defendant product and 
the sophistication of the consuming public.
george.llc imagination entm t,cir.not all of these factors will be relevant in every trademark dispute,and there is no need for each factor to support the plaintiff position on the likelihood of confusion issue.synergistic,at.the parties agree that factors,and weigh in favor of finding a likelihood of confusion because the products are nearly identical and are sold in similar facilities with similar advertising the district court,therefore,rested its conclusion that grayson o had not established a likelihood of confusion on factors,and the strength of grayson o mark,the similarities between the marks,agadir intent,and evidence of confusion.accordingly,we turn to those factors.
the first factor the strength of grayson o mark is paramount in determining the likelihood of confusion.pizzeria uno temple,cir.if a mark lacks strength,a consumer is unlikely to associate the mark with a unique source and consequently will not confuse the allegedly infringing mark with the senior mark.a mark strength comprises both conceptual strength and commercial strength.carefirst,at.
measuring a mark conceptual or inherent strength focuses on the linguistic or graphical peculiarity of the mark,considered in relation to the product,service,or collective organization to which the mark attaches.id.citation omitted quoting perini perini,cir.part of this determination involves placing the mark into one of four categories of distinctiveness generic descriptive suggestive or arbitrary or fanciful.george,at.
generic marks,like bleach,are never entitled to trademark protection because they are not distinctive.id.at.descriptive marks merely describe a function,use,characteristic,size,or intended purpose of the product,such as minute glue or after tan lotion.sara lee kayser roth,cir.because descriptive marks are not inherently distinctive,they are accorded protection only if they have acquired a secondary meaning,that is,if in the minds of the public,the primary significance of a product feature or term is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself.id.quoting dayton progress lane punch,cir.
by contrast,arbitrary,fanciful,and suggestive marks are inherently distinctive,and thus receive the greatest protection against infringement.id.arbitrary or fanciful marks typically involve words or words that are unrelated to the product,like,exxon gasoline or apple computers.id.suggestive marks do not describe a product features but merely suggest them,requiring some imagination on the part of the viewer.george,at.examples of suggestive marks include coppertone,orange crush,and playboy.id.quoting sara lee,at.grayson o asserts that its mark is suggestive,and agadir does not argue to the contrary thus,we accept grayson o contention that its mark is suggestive.
but we can not accept grayson o conclusion that the fact that its mark is suggestive means that it is conceptually strong.as we explained in carefirst,the suggestive designation does not resolve the mark conceptual strength.at.rather,the frequency of prior use of a mark text in other marks,particularly in the same field of merchandise or service,illustrates the mark lack of conceptual strength.id.alteration in original quoting pizzeria uno,at.this is so because consumers are unlikely to associate a mark with a unique source if other parties use the mark extensively.id.
in this case,agadir has presented numerous instances of other uses of in the haircare industry,including some that were in use or registered prior to grayson o registration of its mark.if grayson o mark was truly a distinctive term,it is unlikely that many other businesses in the haircare industry would independently think of using the same mark or similar variants of it.see id.that so many have done so indicates that and the variation f are not conceptually strong.
as for commercial strength,agadir contends that grayson o has waived any argument that its mark is commercially strong.a party waives an argument by failing to present it in its opening brief or by failing to develop its argument even if its brief takes a passing shot at the issue.brown nucor,cir.quoting belk,meyer,cir.near the conclusion of its opening brief,grayson o only asserts,without argument or explanation,that there are genuine issues of material fact as to the commercial strength of its mark.although grayson o briefly addresses and criticizes the district court commercial strength analysis in its reply brief,these arguments do not appear anywhere in its opening brief.accordingly,grayson o has waived its challenge to the district court conclusion that its mark lacked commercial strength.
but even if grayson o had preserved its commercial strength argument,we could not reverse the district court contrary holding.in determining the commercial strength of a mark,a court considers whether a substantial number of present or prospective customers understand the designation when used in connection with a business to refer to a particular person or business enterprise.carefirst,at quoting perini,at.the commercial strength inquiry is analogous to the inquiry for secondary meaning.id.at.thus,the factors to be considered include advertising expenditures consumer studies linking the mark to a source sales success unsolicited media coverage of the product attempts to plagiarize the mark and the length and exclusivity of the mark use.perini,at discussing secondary meaning.
as the district court explained,grayson o sales and advertising expenditures were minimal when compared to the dollar hair care industry.grayson o,wl,at.furthermore,grayson o offered no evidence of unsolicited media coverage,attempts to plagiarize the mark,or consumer studies linking the f mark or the term to grayson o,despite the fact that grayson o has been using the mark for four years.id.
in its reply brief,grayson o argues that the district court erred in failing to limit its advertising and sales analysis to products sold exclusively in salons.in particular,grayson o asserts that the district court should have compared its advertising and sales to those of agadir product.we do not understand and grayson o provides no assistance how this comparison would shed light on whether a substantial number of present or prospective customers would connect the mark solely to grayson to the extent that grayson o would have preferred that the court compare its sales and expenditures to the smaller market of products sold exclusively in salons,grayson o does not indicate,and the record does not disclose,what that market was or what evidence grayson o presented on this point 
for these reasons,like the district court,we find that grayson o mark was both conceptually and commercially weak.
we next address the second factor the similarity of the two marks.in testing for similarity,we must examine the allegedly infringing use in the context in which it is seen by the ordinary consumer.anheuser busch,l l wings,cir.it is undisputed that grayson o and agadir do not sell their products in the same salons.thus,relying solely on a comparison of the marks to determine the likelihood of confusion would be inappropriate.see what a burger of,whataburger,of corpus christi,cir.but the appearance of the marks is still relevant in assessing whether the marks are sufficiently similar that a customer would confuse them.
the grayson o mark that is seen by the ordinary consumer differs notably from the mark that grayson o registered,and both grayson o marks differ from agadir mark.grayson o registered mark is f,which has a clear between the uppercase f and the.however,grayson o product label is,which has only a miniscule between the lowercase f and the and includes a degree symbol.by comparison,agadir label reads hair shield plus with no f and three additional words.the text of agadir mark thus differs both from grayson o registered mark and from the mark grayson o uses on its label.the only textual similarity between agadir label and grayson o label is,and the only textual similarity between agadir label and grayson o registered mark is.
nevertheless,grayson o contends that the number constitutes the dominant portion of its mark and that the marks are similar because this dominant portion also appears on agadir label.the dominant feature of a trademark is whatever is most noticeable in actual conditions.callman on unfair competition,trademarks and monopolies ed,westlaw database updated emphasis omitted.courts give the dominant part of a mark more weight when assessing similarity because consumers are more likely to confuse marks with dominant similar features than marks with less noticeable similar features.see lone star steakhouse saloon,alpha of virginia,cir.while in some cases a court can easily identify a mark dominant portion,a court need not engage in a technical dissection of a mark in order to deem one part dominant.see,george,at.such a requirement would defeat the purpose of determining whether the allegedly infringing use would confuse consumers,who typically do not engage in nuanced,piecemeal comparisons of marks.
in support of its argument that constitutes the dominant portion of its mark,grayson o heavily relies on pizzeria uno and synergistic.in those cases,we compared marks consisting of two independent words pizzeria uno and taco uno and glass doctor and windshield doctor.unlike the marks in pizzeria uno or synergistic,grayson o mark appears in the marketplace as a single word.swatch ag beehive wholesale,llc,cir.rejecting the argument that swa in swatch and swap is the dominant portion of both marks because w e compare whole words,not parts,and generally use the phrase dominant portion to refer to the words in multiword marks citation omitted.
moreover,in pizzeria uno and synergistic,the mark owners had disclaimed one of the two words in their marks as part of the registration process,thereby conceding that the disclaimed words were descriptive and indistinctive in pizzeria uno,we found uno the dominant word because,in addition to the disclaimer of pizzeria,uno was the more conspicuous word in the mark and not a term in common use in english which describes or identifies any product or characteristics of a product.at.similarly,in synergistic,we found doctor the dominant word because the owners had explicitly disclaimed glass and windshield,both of which merely described the services offered.at.
here,grayson o has not disclaimed any part of its registered mark,as neither part is descriptive,and no other distinction exists between the two parts.both f and are short,and because the registered mark has no associated style,they are,by default,the same size and font.in the marketplace the f and the are not only the same size and adjacent to each other,but they also have only an almost indiscernible space between them.to apply the analysis in pizzeria uno and synergistic would require us to disregard critical attributes of the mark grayson o registered and the mark consumers see.
indeed,were we to ignore all this and compare only the use of in grayson o and agadir marks,we still could not find the marks similar because the marks look dramatically different to consumers in the marketplace.see carefirst,at b ecause the analysis looks to the actual use of competing marks,a comparison of the texts of the two marks alone is insufficient if the marks have different appearances in the marketplace.nothing about the style,color,or presentation of the marks is remotely alike.see supra notes.grayson o label includes an f followed by a ligature of.both are rendered in a dark font over a light ovoid shape on a solid red background agadir label does not begin with its label begins with agadir
