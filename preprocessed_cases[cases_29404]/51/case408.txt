background 
terri welles was on the cover of playboy in and was chosen to be the playboy playmate of the year for.her use of the title playboy playmate of the year,and her use of other trademarked terms on her website are at issue in this suit.during the relevant time period,welles website offered information about and free photos of welles,advertised photos for sale,advertised memberships in her photo club,and promoted her services as a spokesperson.a biographical section described welles selection as playmate of the year in and her years modeling for pei.after the lawsuit began,welles included discussions of the suit and criticism of pei on her website and included a note disclaiming any association with pei 
pei complains of four different uses of its trademarked terms on welles website the terms playboy and playmate in the metatags of the website the phrase playmate of the year on the masthead of the website the phrases playboy playmate of the year and playmate of the year on various banner ads,which may be transferred to other websites and the repeated use of the abbreviation pmoy as the watermark on the pages of the website pei claimed that these uses of its marks constituted trademark infringement,dilution,false designation of origin,and unfair competition.the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment.pei appeals the grant of summary judgment on its infringement and dilution claims.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
the district court also granted summary judgment on pei contract claims.those claims arose from a contract between pei and a corporation created by welles,pippi,when welles agreed to be playmate of the year in,pippi,signed a contract with pei.the contract contained a term requiring prior written approval from pei before welles made any use of her name with the designation playmate of the year.pippi,was dissolved in.pei argues that pippi,was welles alter ego and that the terms of the contract are currently enforceable against welles.the district court rejected this argument and granted summary judgment on pei contract claims in favor of welles.we affirm.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law the court must not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter but only determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial 
discussiona.trademark infringement 
except for the use of pei protected terms in the wallpaper of welles website,we conclude that welles uses of pei trademarks are permissible,nominative uses.they imply no current sponsorship or endorsement by pei.instead,they serve to identify welles as a past pei playmate of the year.
we articulated the test for a permissible,nominative use in new kids on the block new america publishing,the band,new kids on the block,claimed trademark infringement arising from the use of their trademarked name by several newspapers.the newspapers had conducted polls asking which member of the band new kids on the block was the best and most popular the papers use of the trademarked term did not fall within the traditional fair use doctrine.unlike a traditional fair use scenario,the defendant newspaper was using the trademarked term to describe not its own product,but the plaintiff thus,the factors used to evaluate fair use were inapplicable the use was nonetheless permissible,we concluded,based on its nominative nature.
we adopted the following test for nominative use 
first,the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark second,only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service and third,the user must do nothing that would,in conjunction with the mark,suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder 
we noted in new kids that a nominative use may also be a commercial one 
in cases in which the defendant raises a nominative use defense,the above test should be applied instead of the test for likelihood of confusion set forth in sleekcraft the test better evaluates the likelihood of confusion in nominative use cases.when a defendant uses a trademark nominally,the trademark will be identical to the plaintiff mark,at least in terms of the words in question.thus,application of the sleekcraft test,which focuses on the similarity of the mark used by the plaintiff and the defendant,would lead to the incorrect conclusion that virtually all nominative uses are confusing.the its requirements that the defendant use marks only when no descriptive substitute exists,use no more of the mark than necessary,and do nothing to suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the mark addresses concerns regarding the likelihood of confusion in nominative use cases.
we group the uses of pei trademarked terms into three for the purpose of applying the test for nominative use.first,we analyze welles use of the terms in headlines and banner advertisements.we conclude that those uses are clearly nominative.second,we analyze the use of the terms in the metatags for welles website,which we conclude are nominative as well.finally,we analyze the terms as used in the of the website.we conclude that this use is not nominative and remand for a determination of whether it infringes on a pei trademark.
headlines and banner advertisements.
to satisfy the first part of the test for nominative use,the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark.this situation arises when a trademark also describes a person,a place or an attribute of a product and there is no descriptive substitute for the trademark.in such a circumstance,allowing the trademark holder exclusive rights would allow the language to be depleted in much the same way as if generic words were protectable.in new kids,we gave the example of the trademarked term,chicago bulls.we explained that one might refer to the world champions or the professional basketball team from chicago,but it far simpler and more likely to be understood to refer to the chicago bulls.moreover,such a use of the trademark would not imply sponsorship or endorsement of the product because the mark is used only to describe the thing,rather than to identify its source.thus,we concluded,such uses must be excepted from trademark infringement law.
the district court properly identified welles situation as one which must also be excepted.no descriptive substitute exists for pei trademarks in this context.the court explained 
t here is no other way that welles can identify or describe herself and her services without venturing into absurd descriptive phrases.to describe herself as the nude model selected by hefner magazine as its prototypical woman for the year would be impractical as well as ineffectual in identifying terri welles to the public 
we agree.just as the newspapers in new kids could only identify the band clearly by using its trademarked name,so can welles only identify herself clearly by using pei trademarked title.
the second part of the nominative use test requires that only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product
