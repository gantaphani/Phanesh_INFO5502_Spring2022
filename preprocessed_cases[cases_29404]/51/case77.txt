savin corporation,appeals from a summary judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york scheindlin,dismissing savin corporation claims alleging trademark dilution,in violation of both the federal trademark dilution act ftda,c,and new york general business law,and trademark infringement,in violation of the lanham act.on appeal,savin corporation argues that the district court erred in holding that i the ftda requires a plaintiff to demonstrate evidence of actual dilution even where the court finds that the marks are identical ii the standard for dilution under new york general business law is the same as the standard for dilution under the ftda and iii there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the use of certain marks creates a likelihood of confusion with the marks.
we agree with the that the district court erred in its analysis and disposition of the ftda and dilution claims,but we find no error in the district court analysis of the trademark infringement claim.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
a.the parties 
the following facts,which are essentially undisputed,are derived primarily from the district court presentation of background facts,in which we discern no clear error,savin corporation plaintiff,a delaware corporation,was founded in and has its principal place of business in stamford,connecticut.plaintiff is engaged in the business of marketing,selling,and distributing business equipment for commercial,business,and use.plaintiff products include color and technology for photocopying,printing,facsimile,and other systems.plaintiff also offers consulting and support services related to information technology and office management.plaintiff products are sold through seventeen branches consisting of over sixty sales and service offices and over trained dealers throughout the united states.plaintiff realizes annual revenues of over million from sales of its products and services in the united states.plaintiff largest customers are in the government,education,and military sectors.
max lowe,savin corporation founder,named the company after his,robert savin.since,the company has used the trade name savin or savin in various forms in connection with various products and services.plaintiff ownership of the savin mark is incontestable with respect to i copy paper and developing liquid ii photocopying machines and parts thereof and iii maintenance and repair services for photocopiers and word processors.the company also owns the mark savin for facsimile machines.
during alone,plaintiff spent over million in advertising its products and services,which are regularly featured in print and television advertisements,trade magazines,and tradeshow promotions worldwide.plaintiff advertisements have appeared in magazines such as newsweek,time,and business week.plaintiff also maintains an active.which plaintiff markets and promotes its products and services.this website address is featured prominently in many of plaintiff advertisements.
are the savin group savin engineers,savin consultants,savin engineers,savin consultants and jmoa engineering,jmoa collectively,defendants or savin engineers.jmoa and savin engineers,are new professional engineering corporations with offices in pleasantville,syracuse,and hauppauge,new york together,the two corporations comprise the savin group.savin consultants is a new corporation that was incorporated in and that ceased to be actively engaged in business after savin engineers,was incorporated in.defendants provide professional engineering consulting services,in particular,consulting services to entities concerned with environmental waste management.defendants also offer professional engineering services in connection with inspecting buildings and providing plans.
rengachari srinivasaragahavan,whose nickname since college has been nivas referred to in this opinion as nivas,is the founder and sole shareholder of each of the corporations.nivas chose the name savin by spelling nivas backwards.since,defendants have continually used the name savin in commerce.defendants did not perform a search or investigation prior to adopting and launching their trade names,and only became aware of plaintiff products and services about ten years ago.
defendants have registered the internet domain names and.these websites,which became accessible after june,provide information about the engineering services offered by nivas companies.defendants did not perform a search or investigation prior to adopting and launching these websites,but were aware of plaintiff domain name prior to registering defendants domain names.other than through these websites,defendants have not advertised their services in any general interest media.
in july,plaintiff discovered defendants domain name registrations and proceeded promptly to send two successive letters to defendants,who elected to take no action in response to those letters.
in may,one of plaintiff executives was attending a chamber of commerce meeting in stamford,connecticut,when another attendee,a vendor who had once sold products to defendants,approached and asked the executive,who was wearing a name tag that displayed the name savin,if she was associated with savin engineers.
presently,there are several hundred other businesses using the name savin in various industries and capacities,including,for example,a general contractor in newington,connecticut savin brothers,a dry cleaner in chesapeake,virginia savin cleaners,and a dentist in glencoe,new york savin dental associates.plaintiff has been aggressive in protecting its marks,with respect to both traditional media and the internet 
b.the claims 
on november,plaintiff filed a complaint the complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,alleging,inter alia,violations of both the federal trademark dilution act ftda,c,and new york general business law and trademark infringement,in violation of the lanham act,following discovery,both sides moved for summary judgment.on october,in a,unpublished opinion and order,the district court denied plaintiff motion,granted defendants motion in its entirety,and dismissed all claims in the complaint.see savin savin group,civ,wl.
with respect to plaintiff infringement claim under the lanham act,the court found that while one of the polaroid factors weigh ed in p laintiff favor,the overwhelming number of factors as well as the internet initial interest confusion factor weighed in defendants favor.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded,defendants were entitled to summary judgment on the infringement claim.id.
the district court concluded that plaintiff claim of a violation of the ftda had to be dismissed as well,because,the court found,plaintiff had failed to raise a material issue of fact with regard to an essential prong of the dilution test.id.at.the court found,in particular,that plaintiff had failed to produce any evidence of actual essential element of a claim of a violation of the than that defendants had used a junior mark that was identical to plaintiff senior mark.thus,the court held,plaintiff had failed to produce sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find that actual dilution had occurred.id.at.the court did find,however,that plaintiff had produced sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact on the other contested elements of an ftda distinctiveness and fame of the senior mark.id.
finally,with respect to the dilution claim,the court found that t he standards for dilution under section were essentially the same as that under the ftda that plaintiff had failed to produce sufficient evidence to create a triable issue under the ftda and,thus,that the section claim also fail ed.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.final judgment was entered on october,dismissing the complaint,and this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
i.the ftda claim 
plaintiff argues that the district court erred in holding that,even though the marks at issue are identical,plaintiff was required to demonstrate circumstantial evidence of actual dilution to maintain its claim under the ftda.defendants,on the other hand,argue that the district court was correct in dismissing the ftda claim because plaintiff had failed to tender admissible evidence to prima facie prove any of the requisite elements of a claim under the ftda.
the ftda permits the owner of a qualified,famous mark to enjoin junior uses throughout commerce,regardless of the absence of competition or confusion.tcpip holding haar communications,cir see.indeed,o ne circuit has characterized the dilution act as coming very close to granting rights in gross in a trademark.tcpip holding,at quoting avery dennison sumpton,cir.specifically,the ftda provides that t he owner of a famous mark shall be entitled to an injunction against another person commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name,if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark.c.thus,to establish a violation of the ftda,a plaintiff must show that 
its mark is famous the defendant is making commercial use of the mark in commerce the defendant use began after the mark became famous and the defendant use of the mark dilutes the quality of the mark by diminishing the capacity of the mark to identify and distinguish goods and services.

the supreme court has made clear that a plaintiff seeking to take advantage of the broad rights afforded under the ftda must show,as an essential element of an ftda claim,actual dilution,rather than a likelihood of dilution.moseley secret catalogue,d.the theory of dilution by blurring,the form of dilution particularly relevant to the case at bar,has been described by professor mccarthy as follows 
i f one small user can blur the sharp focus of the famous mark to uniquely signify one source,then another and another small user can and will do so.like being stung by a hundred bees,significant injury is caused by the cumulative effect,not by just one this is consistent with the classic view that the injury caused by dilution is the gradual diminution or whittling away of the value of the famous mark by blurring uses by others.it is also consistent with the rule in the cases that even a small infringer will not be permitted to nibble away at the plaintiff reputation and goodwill.

fame and distinctiveness 
in this circuit,to sustain a claim under the ftda,in addition to actual dilution,a plaintiff must show that the senior mark possesses both a significant degree of inherent distinctiveness and,to qualify as famous,a high degree of acquired distinctiveness.tcpip holding,at,emphasis added.although a plaintiff must show a preponderance of evidence on each element of a claimed violation of the ftda in order ultimately to prevail on such a claim,see moseley,at,the element of fame is the key ingredient.this is because,among the various prerequisites to an ftda claim,the one that most narrows the universe of potentially successful claims is the requirement that the senior mark be truly famous before a court will afford the owner of the mark the vast protections of the ftda 
indeed,actionable dilution under the ftda is defined as the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services,regardless of the presence or absence of competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties,or likelihood of confusion,mistake,or deception.emphasis added.this requirement reflects the purpose of the ftda,which is to protect famous trademarks from subsequent uses that blur the distinctiveness of the mark or tarnish or disparage it,even in the absence of a likelihood of confusion.genovese drug stores,tgc stores,internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,where it is possible for a district court to determine in the first instance the issue of the famousness of a senior mark,the court would be well advised to do so.indeed,this will often obviate the costly litigation of potentially much thornier issues,such as whether actual blurring or tarnishing of the senior mark has in fact occurred or,as in the instant case,whether a junior and senior mark that are each used in varying ways in different contexts and media are in fact identical for purposes of the ftda.
here,the district court held that plaintiff had created a material issue of fact as to the distinctiveness and fame of its marks.wl,at.although defendants chose not to this conclusion,they nonetheless contend that the lack of inherent distinctiveness and fame in plaintiff marks provides an alternate basis upon which this court should affirm the summary judgment granted by the district court.of course,we may affirm the d istrict c ourt order of summary judgment on any ground that finds adequate support in the record.eichelberg passenger,cir.we need not exercise that power here,however,as we see no error in the district court conclusion that plaintiff has raised genuine issues of fact with regard to the fame and distinctiveness of its marks.
with respect to fame,or acquired distinctiveness,we recognize that the marks ultimately may be found to possess only a degree of niche fame.nevertheless,we agree with the district court conclusion that plaintiff has shown more than a mere scintilla of evidence of fame,which is a sufficient quantum of proof to submit the question to the finder of fact.wl,at.in particular,the court found that 
plaintiff spent over million on advertising in and has achieved annual revenues of million.further,p laintiff products and services are regularly featured in print advertisements,trade magazines,and tradeshow promotions.plaintiff advertisements have appeared in well known magazines such as newsweek,time,and business week.
id.citations omitted.these are sufficient indicators of fame to withstand a summary judgment challenge to a claim under the ftda.nabisco,pf brands,d,finding top ranking sales dollars and advertising expenses of more than million in a period to be significant indicators of the fame of the mark,aff,cir.
with regard to inherent distinctiveness,the district court was correct to conclude that plaintiff marks are entitled to a presumption of inherent distinctiveness by virtue of their incontestability.see sporty farm,at equine,equitechnology,cir.defendants assert that this presumption should not apply to the marks at issue because they are merely descriptive marks,which can never possess inherent distinctiveness.see tcpip holding,at d escriptive marks,which possess no distinctive quality,or at best a minimal degree,do not qualify for the dilution act protection.defendants argument is unavailing,however,because plaintiff marks are not,as a matter of law,merely descriptive marks.
while it is true that savin is a surname and that savin was named after robert savin,the of plaintiff founder,the word savin also has a dictionary meaning admittedly,the savin mark is not as obviously distinctive as,for example,honda or acura.but it is still entirely possible for a reasonable to determine that the savin mark possesses a sufficient degree of distinctiveness to sustain a finding of dilution,especially given that plaintiff marks are not patently used as a surname.lane capital,lane capital,cir see,imaf,penney,t he name or word adiansi is not likely to be immediately identified with a person by an average buyer of a sweater at penney.thus,the fact that adiansi is a surname is not dispositive on the issue of inherent distinctiveness.
evidence of actual dilution 
in moseley,the supreme court stated that direct evidence of dilution such as consumer surveys will not be necessary if actual dilution can reliably be proved through circumstantial obvious case is one where the junior and senior marks are identical.at.the court cautioned,however,that w hatever difficulties of proof may be entailed,they are not an acceptable reason for dispensing with proof of an essential element of a statutory violation.id.
plaintiff interprets moseley to stand for the proposition that where both marks are identical,that fact,in itself,is sufficient circumstantial evidence to satisfy the element of actual dilution.not all courts read the portion of the moseley decision as does plaintiff,however.indeed,the district court did not.and,at least two other courts have questioned whether the supreme court intended for plaintiffs to be able to establish a violation of the ftda merely by showing the commercial use of an identical junior mark.see lee middleton original dolls,seymour mann,d,see also nike,circle group internet,d.
the holdings in those cases,however,are of little assistance here.the district court in lee middleton original dolls took a decidedly cautious approach,leaving the issue for the jury to resolve 
in view of the developing status of the law on the nature of evidence required,the court believes that the best course is to permit the plaintiff the opportunity to present its dilution claim to the jury.the defendant motion for summary judgment on this issue will be denied.
d at.and in circle group internet,the court was able to avoid the question on the facts 
the parties disagree on the correct interpretation of the moseley court dicta regarding circumstantial evidence.according to defendant,the moseley court meant that proof of actual dilution by circumstantial evidence is sufficient if the marks are identical.plaintiff,on the other hand,maintains that if the marks are identical,that in itself constitutes sufficient circumstantial evidence of dilution.the court need not resolve this dispute,however,because in addition to the identity of the marks at issue,there is sufficient circumstantial evidence of dilution in the record to preclude summary judgment.
d at internal citations omitted.
moreover,the district court opinion in the case at bar seems to have been the sole basis for the district courts in those other cases to question the plain import of the language of the supreme court in moseley.see lee middleton original dolls,d at citing only savin savin group,wl,at,for the proposition that more than a showing of identical marks is required to make out a prima facie case of actual dilution see also circle group internet,d at citing only savin savin group for same.indeed,in most of the other cases identified as having dealt with this issue,the courts seem to have assumed that where the other elements of an ftda claim have been satisfied,moseley only requires a showing of the use of an identical junior mark to establish per se evidence of actual dilution 
we interpret moseley to mean that where a plaintiff who owns a famous senior mark can show the commercial use of an identical junior mark,such a showing constitutes circumstantial evidence of the element of an ftda claim.thus,for example,a store owner who loses a franchise yet continues to use the famous mark,in so doing,violates the ftda and may be enjoined thereunder from using the mark.see,d at.indeed,a number of commentators have suggested that this is precisely what the supreme court was getting at in,that an identity of marks creates a presumption of actual dilution this would comport with the holdings of other courts in analogous contexts.see,am.honda motor,d at w hen identical marks are used on similar goods,dilution obviously occurs.
it can not be overstated,however,that for the presumption of dilution to apply,the marks must be identical.in other words,a mere similarity in the a close not suffice to establish per se evidence of actual dilution.further,where the marks at issue are not identical,the mere fact that consumers mentally associate the junior user mark with a famous mark is not sufficient to establish actionable dilution.moseley,at.s uch mental association will not necessarily reduce the capacity of the famous mark to identify the goods of its owner,the statutory requirement for dilution under the ftda.id.strictly enforcing the identity requirement comports well with the purposes of the ftda and with the principle previously elucidated by this court that the class of parties protected by the federal dilution statute is narrow indeed.see tcpip holding,at the ftda further differs from traditional trademark law in that the class of entities for whose benefit the law was created is far narrower.
oftentimes,the issue of whether the marks are identical will be and factually intensive in nature.for instance,marks that are textually identical may appear very different from one another,in terms of font,size,color,where they are used in the form of dissimilar corporate logos,either in traditional media or on the internet.depending on the circumstance,this may or may not determine the outcome of the identity analysis.similarly,marks that are textually identical may be pronounced differently,which also could be relevant under certain circumstances,such as,for example,where the marks are used in radio advertising.indeed,the need for careful and exacting analysis of the identity issue highlights the basis for our emphasis on the famousness factor as a more expeditious avenue of resolution,given the case law in this circuit limiting application of the ftda to only the most famous of marks.see id.
here,the marks at issue may be identical in some contexts but not in others.where the senior and junior savin marks both are used in website addresses,the marks may be identical.on the other hand,where the savin marks at issue appear in stylized graphics on webpages,the competing marks may be found merely to be very similar.for its part,the district court appears to have concluded,without analysis,that the marks are identical p laintiff offers no circumstantial evidence of any kind tending to show actual dilution other than the fact that the marks are identical.wl,at emphasis added.in analyzing the similarity of the marks in the context of assessing plaintiff infringement claim,however,the court found as follows 
p laintiff and d fendants both use the name savin,and their logos display similar block letter fonts,with one arm of the letter v slanted at a greater angle than the other.the only apparent difference in the marks is that d efendants logo incorporates four squares,one slightly tilted,to the left of the name.given that both marks feature the same name,such a difference is inconsequential.
id.at citations omitted.
we find the district court language in this regard to be somewhat ambiguous.in particular,we are uncertain whether,in analyzing the ftda claim,the court a concluded that the marks are identical,id.at,based on its previous determination regarding the similarity of the marks in the infringement context b simply assumed them to be identical,arguendo or c arrived at its determination by some altogether different route,perhaps as an effect of choices made by plaintiff in pleading its case and presenting its evidence.in light of the lack of any detailed analysis in the opinion of the district court regarding the issue of the identity of the marks for purposes of the ftda claim,we deem it necessary to remand the issue to the district court for clarification and specific findings as to whether the junior and senior marks are identical.
in this regard,we caution that although the differences between the marks noted by the court in the infringement context may be inconsequential in that context,such differences may indeed be relevant in the analysis of the dilution issue.the fact that defendants have used the marks somewhat differently than has,by registering the domain name as opposed to simply also be relevant.we emphasize,however,that it is the identity of the marks themselves that is germane in the dilution context,and the modifying of the adding one or more generic descriptors to the mark in a website address,for not necessarily defeat a showing that the marks themselves are identical in specific contexts.see,legg packing olde plantation spice,d,opsc olde plantation spice mark is nearly identical in appearance to legg old plantation mark,differing only in the spelling of olde and the addition of the generic word spice.the marks are identical in sound and connotation.emphasis added golden door,odisho,cir focusing,in the infringement context,on identical portions of a junior and senior mark.
for all of the foregoing reasons,we vacate that portion of the judgment of the district court dismissing plaintiff claim of a violation of the ftda,and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
ii.the dilution claim 
in ruling on plaintiff dilution claim,brought under new york general business law,the district court held that t he standards for dilution under section are essentially the same as that under a of the lanham act.savin savin group,wl,at quoting winner int l llc omori,d.the district court then held that a s p laintiff failed to produce sufficient evidence to create a triable issue under the ftda,it follows that the section claim also fails.id.based on this conclusion,the court granted summary judgment to defendants on the section claim.the district court was incorrect,however,to rely on winner international llc omori enterprises,and the sources cited therein,for the proposition that the same showing must be made to sustain an ftda claim as to sustain a claim under section.indeed,a careful reading of the relevant language in winner makes clear that the particular point of equivalence that was dispositive in that case is inapposite to the case at bar.
in winner,the district court was concerned principally with the question of the similarity of two competing trade dresses.see d at.in assessing the plaintiff claims for dilution under the ftda and under state law,the court found as follows 
in order to establish a claim for injury to business reputation or dilution under new york law,plaintiff must establish two elements a distinctive mark capable of being diluted and a likelihood of dilution 
dilution has been defined as either a blurring of a mark product identification or the tarnishment of the affirmative associations a mark has come to convey.a prerequisite to a finding of dilution is that the marks are substantially similar.that standard has been applied to a finding of dilution under federal law as well.
id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the winner court concluded that because the trade dresses were not substantially similar,a claim for dilution was not sustainable under either the ftda or the new york statute.
here,in contrast,the district court impliedly found the marks to be not only substantially similar but in some contexts virtually identical.see wl,at,see also discussion supra part.this case,then,is plainly distinguishable from winner on the facts.in any event,regarding the issue of the standard of proof for a claim of a violation of the ftda,neither winner nor the sources cited therein and relied on by the district court represent a correct view of the law as it now stands.
a likelihood of dilution may have been enough to sustain a claim for dilution under the ftda in.in,however,the supreme court decided moseley,which changed the landscape of the law on this issue.as the sixth circuit noted in autozone,tandy 
to resolve a circuit split,the supreme court addressed the discrete issue of whether a dilution claim required proof of actual dilution or whether proof of a likelihood of dilution would suffice.analyzing the text of the ftda,the court held that the statute unambiguously requires a showing of actual dilution,rather than a likelihood of dilution.
cir quoting moseley,at.citations omitted.
this circuit was one of those which,before moseley,required a showing of a mere likelihood of dilution to sustain a claim of a violation of the federal statute.see,nabisco,pf brands,cir reading the federal statute to permit adjudication granting or denying an injunction,whether at the instance of the senior user or the junior seeking declaratory relief,before the dilution has actually occurred.now,of course,the federal standard requires a showing of actual dilution,moseley,at.see discussion supra part i,and,thus,is more stringent than the new york standard.therefore,the district court erred in dismissing plaintiff section dilution claim based solely on the court determination that plaintiff had failed to produce sufficient evidence to create a triable issue under the ftda.wl,at.accordingly,we vacate that portion of the judgment of the district court dismissing the dilution claim and remand for consideration of that claim under the appropriate standard.
iii.the trademark infringement claim 
a claim of trademark infringement is analyzed under a familiar test.the test looks first to whether the plaintiff mark is entitled to protection,and second to whether the defendant use of the mark is likely to cause consumers confusion as to the origin or sponsorship of the defendant goods.virgin,nawab,cir citing gruner jahr usa publ g meredith,cir.
validity of plaintiff marks 
defendants admit that three of plaintiff marks are incontestable.savin savin group,wl,at.accordingly,we need not tarry with the first prong of the infringement test.
likelihood of confusion 
t he crucial issue in an action for trademark infringement is whether there is any likelihood that an appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers are likely to be misled,or indeed simply confused,as to the source of the goods in question.mushroom makers,barry,cir maternally yours,your maternity shop,cir.the court,in making this determination and fashioning suitable relief,must look to a host of other factors.mushroom makers,at.first articulated in the seminal case polaroid polarad electronics,at,the eight principal factors,known as the polaroid factors,are as follows the strength of the senior mark the degree of similarity between the two marks the proximity of the products the likelihood that the prior owner will bridge the gap actual confusion the defendant good faith or bad faith in adopting its own mark the quality of defendant product and the sophistication of the buyers.id.moreover,depending on the complexity of the issues,the court may have to take still other variables into account.id.
here,plaintiff argues that the district court erred in its application of the first and sixth,in assessing i the strength of plaintiff mark and ii the good faith of defendants in adopting their own mark.plaintiff also notes that if the district court erred in assessing the strength of the senior mark,then error would be implied in the court analysis of proximity as well.for their part,defendants argue that even if the court erred in analyzing the strength of the senior mark and the good faith of defendants,any such error would be insufficient to overturn the ruling of the d istrict c ourt on likelihood of confusion,as five of the other polaroid factors weigh in favor of defendants,and no single factor of the analysis is dispositive.
in reviewing the d istrict c ourt evaluation of the polaroid factors,each individual factor is reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard,but the ultimate determination of the likelihood of confusion is a legal issue subject to de novo review.brennan,brennan rest,cir.
strength of the senior mark 
t he strength of a mark depends ultimately on its distinctiveness,or its quality,in the eyes of the purchasing public.drizzle,cir,overruled on other grounds by squibb,cir.as noted above,an incontestible registered trademark enjoys a conclusive presumption of distinctiveness.see park n fly,dollar park and fly,d see also discussion supra part i.yet even if a mark is registered and,thus,afforded the utmost degree of protection,lois sportswear,levi strauss,cir,the presumption of an exclusive right to use the mark extends only so far as the goods or services noted in the registration certificate,mushroom makers,at.
here,the district court made the following findings 
three of p laintiff marks are incontestable and hence are presumptively strong as applied to the goods and services listed on the registrations,namely liquid and paper for photocopiers photocopiers and parts thereof and maintenance and repair services for photocopiers and word processors.plaintiff is also able to show that its marks possess secondary meaning in the market for business machinery and related services.plaintiff has submitted evidence that it sells it sic products through seventeen branches and over trained dealers throughout the united states spent over million in advertising in and realized annual revenues of over million.such evidence is sufficient to establish that p laintiff marks possess secondary meaning in p laintiff market.
wl,at footnote and citations omitted.critically,however,the court also found that plaintiff had not shown that its marks were strong in the market for professional engineering services,and had not submitted any evidence that its marks possess ed secondary meaning in the market for professional engineering services.id.
as we find no clear error in these findings,we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that the presumption of the strength of plaintiff mark does not extend to the field of professional engineering.see mushroom makers,at paco sport,paco rabanne parfums,d.accordingly,we also agree with the court ultimate determination that the first polaroid factor,strength of the mark,weighs in favor of defendants.
similarity of the marks 
e ven close similarity between two marks is not dispositive of the issue of likelihood of confusion,at.rather,the crux of the issue is whether the similarity is likely to cause confusion among numerous customers who are ordinarily prudent.swatch group movado,civ,wl at,dist.lexis,at,citing morningside group morningside capital group,cir.thus,an inquiry into the degree of similarity between two marks does not end with a comparison of the marks themselves.spring mills,ultracashmere house,cir.as this court has stated,the setting in which a designation is used affects its appearance and colors the impression conveyed by it,at internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,the impression conveyed by the setting in which the mark is used is often of critical importance.spring mills,at.
here,the district court found that 
p laintiff and defendants both use the name savin,and their logos display similar block letter fonts,with one arm of the letter v slanted at a greater angle than the other.the only apparent difference in the marks is that d efendants logo incorporates four squares,one slightly tilted,to the left of the name.given that both marks feature the same name,such a difference is inconsequential.
wl,at.in addition,one of the settings in which the junior mark has allegedly infringed the senior mark is the internet,where the subtle differences in font and other characteristics noted by the district court are of even less significance,given that the overarching concern of the individual searching the internet is to arrive at the correct website,which is ultimately identified by a purely website address we find no clear error in the district court determinations on this point and,in light of the foregoing,agree that this factor weighs in plaintiff favor.
proximity of the entities products services 
this factor focuses on whether the two products compete with each other.to the extent goods or trade names serve the same purpose,fall within the same general class,or are used together,the use of similar designations is more likely to cause confusion.lang ret.living pub,cir.in assessing this factor,the court may consider whether the products differ in content,geographic distribution,market position,and audience appeal.pharm.gillette,cir see,arrow fastener stanley works,cir holding that customers were not likely to be confused when both parties sold staplers in the same stores,but one party sold a pneumatic stapler and the other a lightweight small stapler.
here,the district court found,inter alia,as follows 
t he proportional difference in price between p laintiff back office facilities management services and d efendants professional engineering services is at least as great as,if not greater than,that between the two types of staplers in arrow fastener.similarly,the expertise of p laintiff engineers in information technology and that of d efendants engineering professionals in construction and waste management projects serve very different needs within the sectors from which both parties draw their customers.
even though p laintiff marks may be strong in the market for sophisticated business equipment and services,professional engineering services do not reasonably fall within the broadly defined market of potentially related services.although the marks are very similar,consumers are unlikely to be confused as to source because of the competitive distance between the parties services 
wl,at.we discern no clear error in the district court findings on this point,and thus we concur in the court determination that the products and services are not proximate as a matter of law.
actual confusion 
i t is black letter law that actual confusion need not be shown to prevail under the lanham act,since actual confusion is very difficult to prove and the act requires only a likelihood of confusion as to source.lois sportswear,at.nonetheless,it has been noted that 
there can be no more positive or substantial proof of the likelihood of confusion than proof of actual confusion.moreover,reason tells us that while very little proof of actual confusion would be necessary to prove the likelihood of confusion,an almost overwhelming amount of proof would be necessary to refute such proof.
world carpets,dick littrell new world carpets,cir.
in the instant case,the district court found that plaintiff had submitted as evidence of actual confusion only the single incident at the chamber of commerce meeting,see supra,where someone who had previously sold an exhibit to d efendants mistakenly concluded that one of p laintiff executives was associated with savin engineers.wl,at.a single anecdote of confusion over the entire course of competition,however,constitute s de minimis evidence insufficient to raise triable issues.see nora beverages,perrier group of,cir.the district court findings on this point are not clearly erroneous,and we find that the court committed no error in concluding that this factor weighs in defendants favor.
bridging the gap 
the question under this factor is the likelihood that plaintiff will enter the market for professional engineering services relating to the construction industry.see pharm,at.this factor is designed to protect the senior user interest in being able to enter a related field at some future time.id.quoting scarves by vera,todo imports,cir.
here,the district court found that 
plaintiff claims that it intends to expand its involvement in the area of facilities management,but the only evidence p laintiff presents to support this allegation is a statement by thomas salierno,plaintiff president and chief operating officer,that p laintiff intends to work in an office environment and expand into whatever the customer needs.this statement fails to support any inference that p laintiff intends to enter d efendants market.
wl,at citations omitted.we agree with the district court conclusion that even drawing all inferences in plaintiff favor,this bare assertion fails to raise a genuine issue of material fact that plaintiff is likely to enter defendants corner of the marketplace.
good faith 
the factor considers whether the defendant adopted its mark with the intention of capitalizing on the plaintiff reputation and goodwill and on any confusion between his and the senior user product.pharm,at internal quotation marks omitted.
here,plaintiff asserts that defendants acted in bad faith because i nivas had knowledge of plaintiff products and services for approximately ten years ii savin engineers never performed a search or investigation prior to adopting and launching their trade names incorporating the term savin and iii savin engineers were aware of plaintiff domain name prior to registering their and domains.therefore,plaintiff argues,the district court clearly erred in finding that defendants did not act in bad faith.
