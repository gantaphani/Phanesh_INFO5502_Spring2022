facts and proceedings 
from until may,george vais george manufactured and sold firearm muzzle brakes through his unincorporated proprietorship,vais arms.during that time,george moved his business to various locations across the united states,including houston,texas boise,idaho prescott,arizona and finally,kerrville,texas.he marketed his muzzle brakes primarily through telephone and mail order catalogues,recognizing sales throughout the united states,as well as in some foreign countries.
during the early days of the operation of his business,george developed a severe allergy to household and industrial chemicals and solvents,including those he used in the manufacture of his muzzle brakes.in summer,george condition worsened significantly,and he decided to leave the united states and return to his native greece in the hope that the change in environment would improve his health.in preparing for his departure,george asked ronald bartlett bartlett,a gunsmith at a nearby san antonio sporting goods outlet,whether he would be interested in purchasing george muzzle brake business and continuing the production and sale of vais muzzle brakes.bartlett ultimately agreed to purchase george business and formed the plaintiff corporation vais arms,for that purpose.
on december,george and bartlett executed a bill of sale in which vais arms,as seller,agreed to sell to vais arms,as buyer,all of vais arms assets and equipment,for a lump sum payment of.the bill of sale specified that the transfer would take place on may.it also referenced an attached exhibit listing the assets and equipment to be sold.the total cost of the items listed was,roughly less than the amount of the purchase price.
in addition,the parties executed an attachment to the bill of sale which reads as follows 
the following is agreed to by george vais and ronald bartlett 
george vais agrees to the following 
to get a trade name patent for vais arms,and include it in the sale of assets.
to help move the equipment to the new location and make sure everything works.to give instructions for the first two weeks after the move.
c.if ronald bartlett dies before the transfer of all assets,all payments on the note will be refunded to ronald estate.
ronald bartlett agrees to the following 
a.if george dies before all payments are made on the note,ronald will make remaining payments on the note to a trust fund for george children,this trust fund will be established by george estate.
finally,the parties executed a agreement which states,in pertinent part 
covenant.for a period of years after the effective date of this agreement,george vais arms will not directly or indirectly engage in any business that competes with vais arms.this covenant shall apply to the geographical area that includes all states and countries which are included in the current customer bases.
vais arms,immediately began operations on may.for approximately two weeks thereafter,george worked alongside bartlett in bartlett store,assisting him in the production of the muzzle brakes.when vais arms,became fully operational,george went home to greece.
vais arms,soon began marketing its muzzle brakes nationwide and,like its predecessor,vais arms,quickly recognized sales throughout this country.early in,however,george returned from greece and began manufacturing and marketing muzzle brakes under the vais mark.
in march,after receiving a series of customer inquiries prompted by george national advertising campaign,bartlett applied for federal registration of the vais trademark in connection with firearms components and accessories,namely muzzle brakes.george filed a notice of opposition.as of the time of this appeal,bartlett application was still pending.
in september,vais arms,filed suit in the district court alleging that george use of the vais mark infringed vais arms,rights as senior user of the mark and that george sales and marketing efforts violated the terms of the agreement.vais arms,brought claims for unfair competition under a of the lanham act trademark dilution and injury to business reputation under of the texas business and commerce code breach of the agreement under of the texas business and commerce code and trademark infringement and unfair competition under texas common law.a year later,vais arms,filed a motion for summary judgment on all its claims.it also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting george from using the vais mark in connection with the sale of muzzle brakes and from manufacturing,selling,and marketing firearm muzzle brakes in contravention of the agreement.
in january,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of vais arms,on its claims for unfair competition,trademark dilution and injury to business reputation,and trademark infringement and unfair competition under texas common law the trademark claims.the district court based its decision on a determination that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether george had abandoned the vais mark in selling his business to bartlett and leaving the country.the court declined to grant summary judgment in vais arms,favor as to its claim for breach of the agreement,however,choosing instead to hold the motion in abeyance pending further briefing on the reasonableness of the agreement geographic and temporal limitations.accordingly,the district court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting george use of the vais mark but reserved ruling on vais arms,request for an injunction enforcing the terms of the agreement.
following further briefing on the reasonableness of the temporal and geographic limitations of the agreement,the district court granted vais arms,motion for summary judgment on its claim for breach of the agreement.the court also permanently enjoined george from competing with vais arms,in the manufacturing and marketing of firearm muzzle brakes anywhere in the united states until may.after judgment was entered in its favor,vais arms,filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment to make permanent the court earlier injunction prohibiting george use of the vais mark.
before the district court could rule on that motion to alter or amend,however,george filed a motion to reconsider the grant of summary judgment on vais arms,trademark claims.george advanced that vais arms,waived its abandonment argument by failing to assert it in its complaint,and that he had not had adequate time to respond to vais arms,abandonment argument before the district court granted summary judgment.george noted that the issue of abandonment was raised for the first time in vais arms,reply brief.the district court rejected george first ground for reconsideration but allowed the parties additional time to submit supplemental briefs and evidence on abandonment.
after considering the supplemental briefing and evidence on abandonment,the district court determined that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether george had abandoned the mark.accordingly,the court denied george motion to reconsider its prior grant of summary judgment on vais arms,trademark claims.the court then granted vais arms,motion to alter or amend the judgment and permanently enjoined george from using the mark in connection with the manufacturing,marketing,or selling of firearm muzzle brakes.the court denied george motion to stay the injunction pending appeal.
george timely filed notices of appeal from the district court rulings granting summary judgment,enjoining his use of the vais mark,and enjoining his activities in contravention of the agreement.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment 
trademark abandonment 
george asserts that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether he abandoned the vais mark when he sold his business to bartlett and moved back to greece.he argues that,as a result,the district court erred in holding that vais arms,was the senior holder of the mark and granting summary judgment on vais arms,trademark claims.specifically,george contends that as a matter of law,a person can not abandon his surname,and even assuming arguendo that a person can abandon his surname,genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether he intended to abandon the vais mark.because he did not argue before the district court that a person can not abandon his surname,george has waived this argument on appeal we therefore consider only whether a genuine issue of material fact exists as to george intent to abandon.
as a threshold matter,george reasserts on appeal his argument that in the district court vais arms,waived the issue of abandonment by raising it for the first time in its reply to george memorandum in opposition to vais arms,motion for summary judgment.george cites the sixth circuit decision in atlas supply company atlas brake shops,for the proposition that abandonment is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded otherwise it is deemed waived.as the district court aptly noted,however,vais arms,does not raise the issue of abandonment as a defense but as a means to show a break in the chain of priority,that it has become the senior holder of the mark and is therefore entitled to bring claims for infringement and dilution in that posture,vais arms,was not required to plead abandonment in its complaint,and atlas is inapposite.
george procedural contention that he was denied an adequate opportunity to respond to vais arms,abandonment argument is equally unpersuasive.the record establishes that the district court permitted him to file a supplemental memorandum on the issue of abandonment along with any additional evidence in his favor.although we have not comprehensively identified all the circumstances under which a district court may rely on arguments and evidence presented for the first time in a reply brief,we have stated that rule c merely requires the court to give the an adequate opportunity to respond prior to a ruling.further,those circuits that have expressly addressed this issue have held that a district court may rely on arguments and evidence presented for the first time in a reply brief as long as the court gives the nonmovant an adequate opportunity to respond as the district court allowed george such an opportunity,he can not now complain that he was prejudiced by vais arms,failure to raise the issue until its reply 
as for the substance of george arguments,he contends that genuine issues of material fact exist on whether he intended to abandon the vais mark when he sold his business to bartlett and moved home to greece.under the lanham act,a mark is deemed abandoned 
w hen its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use.intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances.nonuse for three consecutive years shall be prima facie evidence of abandonment.use of a mark means the bona fide use of that mark made in the ordinary course of trade,and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark 
the party asserting abandonment must establish that the owner of the mark both discontinued use of the mark and intended not to resume its use.the burden of proof is on the party claiming abandonment 
the parties do not dispute that george discontinued his use of the mark when he sold his business to bartlett and departed for greece.rather,the sole point of contention is whether,in so doing,george possessed the requisite intent to abandon his proprietary right to the vais mark to support its contention that george intended to abandon the mark,vais arms,filed numerous declarations and affidavits from george former customers in which the declarants or affiants expressed their belief,and the facts on which these beliefs were grounded,that when george sold his business,he had no intention of reentering the muzzle brake business in this country.in addition,vais arms,introduced into evidence an october shooting magazine article about george retirement from the muzzle brake business and the transfer of his business to bartlett.the article describes george struggle with his allergy to household and industrial those used in the manufacture of muzzle his belief that by moving back to his native greece he could improve his condition.the article makes no mention whether george intended ever to return to the united states or ever to resume his trade,either in the united states or abroad.
for his part,george produced nothing but his own affidavit,in which he states that he had developed a condition known as multiple chemical sensitivity and had left for greece in the hope that the clean environment there would improve his health.he further states conclusionally that he did not intend to abandon his business name of vais arms and that he had hoped to return after a stay in greece to pursue his craft of manufacturing muzzle brakes.as objective evidence of his intent not to abandon the mark,george stated that he asked bartlett to strike out provision a of the attachment to the bill of sale prior to signing.this provision reads george vais agrees to the following to get a trade name patent sic for vais arms,and include it in the sale of assets.a review of the attachment confirms that the provision was,in fact,and initialed by bartlett.this is not dated.
bartlett does not contest that he and initialed provision a.he insists,however,that he did not strike out the provision prior to george signing the bill of sale in december of,as george avers,but did so early in march to reflect that he no longer held george responsible for registering the vais mark.thus,he asserts,this act can not be construed as evidence that george lacked the requisite intent to abandon,only that bartlett would assume responsibility for registering the mark.
that intent is determined by an objective test is too well settled to require citation.viewing the summary judgment evidence in the light most favorable to george as an assumption that the occurred,as he contends,at the signing in december,agree with the district court determination that george failed to establish that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to his intent to abandon the vais mark.george vague,statements in his affidavit to the effect that he hoped to regain his health in greece and return one day to his craft of manufacturing muzzle brakes is not sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the element of intent,particularly when viewed in light of vais arms,overwhelming evidence of abandonment.t he owner of a trademark can not defeat an abandonment claim by simply asserting a vague,subjective intent to resume use of a mark at some unspecified future date.at most,george affidavit establishes only his subjective,uncommunicated desire not to abandon the mark,without any indication of when or how he intended to resume its commercial use it does not establish a genuine issue as to his intent to abandon.
neither does bartlett striking out of provision a in the attachment raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the element of intent to abandon the mark.that provision referred to george duty to procure a trade name patent and to include it in the sale of assets it says nothing about the actual transfer of the trade name itself.neither does it make the transfer due at signing,only at some unidentified time in the future.thus,even assuming that the provision was stricken at or prior to george signing the bill of sale,bartlett act of striking it out does not convey an understanding on the part of either party that the vais mark was not being transferred along with the sale of the business other assets.quite to the contrary,a reasonable reading of provision a in context of the whole transaction over the five months between the signing of the bill of sale and the effective date of the sale confirms that the provision was struck out by bartlett solely to relieve george of the procedural hassle of registering the vais mark before he left the country for health rea
