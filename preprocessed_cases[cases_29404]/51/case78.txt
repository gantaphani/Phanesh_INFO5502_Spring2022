playtex products,playtex or plaintiff appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york baer,granting summary judgment for defendants and fort james operating collectively,or defendants and dismissing plaintiff claims of trademark infringement under,false designation of origin under a,dilution under c,dilution under bus,and unfair competition under common law.see playtex prods.plaintiff,maker of wet ones wipes,seeks damages and injunctive relief for defendants use of the mark quilted northern on its wipes.because the challenged junior trademark is not confusingly similar to the senior mark,there is no evidence of actual consumer confusion,and there is no evidence of bad faith on the part of defendants,we affirm the district court dismissal of the claims for trademark infringement,false designation of origin and unfair competition.in light of the substantial differences between the two marks and playtex failure to demonstrate actual dilution,we also affirm the dismissal of plaintiff dilution claims under federal and new york state law.
background 
over twenty years ago,plaintiff playtex products registered wet ones as a mark for towelettes with the united states patent and trademark office pto.wet ones,according to playtex,is the market leader for bath tissue,and in the last six years the company has sold million worth of these wipes.
owns the quilted northern brand,which has been on the market for about years and has sold billion worth of bath and the last five years.in,introduced its first generation wipes product,quilted northern fresh moist,which did not fare well in the market.shortly thereafter,launched a product with a new name quilted northern.an application for quilted northern,as well as for,was filed with the pto in april of,and released the new product into the market in july of that year.though playtex claims that continues to prosecute the application for without the quilted northern name attached,claims to have now abandoned that application and disclaims any intent to use alone.photographs of trademark in the record confirm that its wipes are labeled as quilted northern on the packaging.
playtex responded to new product with a lawsuit for trademark infringement under,for false designation of origin under a,for dilution under c,for dilution and unfair competition under bus,and for unfair competition under common law.both parties moved for summary judgment before judge harold baer,of the southern district of new york,who in august granted motion and dismissed playtex claims.see playtex prods.inc.judge baer analyzed the infringement claim under the framework established by judge friendly in polaroid polarad elecs,cir.relying heavily on the dissimilarity in the mark s themselves,the differences in the way the products are presented to consumers,and prominent use of its own house brand on the product package,at,judge baer found that playtex had failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact about the likelihood of consumer confusion and ruled in favor of.id.at.given that there was no likelihood of consumer confusion,the court dismissed the and claims as well.id.at.finally,the court found that the same dissimilarity compelling its conclusions with regard to infringement also compelled a finding that there was no viable dilution claim.id.at.playtex appealed.
discussion 
trademark infringement 
under a,a plaintiff may prevail on a trademark claim upon showing that the defendant used in commerce,without plaintiff consent,a reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive there are two key components of trademark infringement under this provision the plaintiff must prove that its trademark is protectable and that the defendant mark is likely to confuse consumers as to the source or sponsorship of its product.see nabisco,cir nabisco ii.the first of these questions relates closely to the second,because a trademark key consideration in assessing its also a factor in determining the likelihood of confusion.see,virgin enters.nawab,cir.
the inquiry turns on whether numerous ordinary prudent purchasers are likely to be misled or confused as to the source of the product in question because of the entrance in the marketplace of defendant mark.cadbury beverages cott,cir citing gruner jahr usa publ g meredith,cir.to support a finding of infringement,there must be a probability of confusion,not a mere possibility.nora beverages,perrier group of,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.this standard does not change on summary judgment.the fact that on summary judgment the evidence must be construed in a light favorable to the party does not modify the standard itself,which requires a showing of a probability,or likelihood,of confusion.id.
in addressing the likelihood of confusion,courts in the second circuit apply the eight factors set forth in polaroid,at 
the strength of plaintiff mark 
the similarity of the parties marks 
the proximity of the parties products in the marketplace 
the likelihood that the plaintiff will bridge the gap between the products 
actual consumer confusion between the two marks 
the defendant intent in adopting its mark 
the quality of the defendant product and 
the sophistication of the relevant consumer group.
see nabisco ii,at.
where the predicate facts are beyond dispute,the proper balancing of these factors is considered a question of law.id.when balancing the factors,district courts generally should not treat any single factor as dispositive nor should a court treat the inquiry as a mechanical process by which the party with the greatest number of factors wins.id.instead,the court should focus on the ultimate question of whether consumers are likely to be confused.id.citing paddington attiki imps,cir.
on appeal from a grant of summary judgment,the findings with respect to predicate facts underlying each polaroid factor are reviewed with considerable deference to the district court patsy brand,realty,cir quoting cadbury beverages,at see also lois sportswear,levi strauss,cir.the district court balancing of the polaroid factors is subject to de novo review.brennan,brennan,cir.
applying the polaroid factors.
before turning to the polaroid issues that are central to this appeal,we briefly address those factors which are relatively insignificant here or that are not in serious dispute.see at.it is beyond question that the products,customers,and channels of trade here are not different,and may be identical.a wet wipe is a wet wipe,and there is no reason to believe that consumers see it differently.to the extent there is any difference between the product segments,the other segments would be natural areas of expansion for wet ones.therefore,as judge baer found,the proximity and factors weigh in playtex favor.id.at.the factor also weighs in playtex favor,because consumers can not be expected to invest much time or effort in distinguishing among inexpensive bath tissues.id.at see also nabisco,pf brands,cir purchasers of relatively inexpensive goods are held to a lesser standard of purchasing care.citation and internal quotation marks omitted hereinafter nabisco i,abrogated on other grounds,moseley v secret catalogue,d.as for the factor,playtex does contend that product is inferior,but this is not alleged to be a major factor in the case.at.indeed,playtex briefs do not even mention this factor on appeal.
the strength of the mark 
we turn next to the polaroid factors discussed more extensively by the district court.the first of these,the strength of a trademark,encompasses two different concepts inherent distinctiveness and acquired distinctiveness.virgin,at.the scale of inherent distinctiveness,from least to most distinctive,is described in terms of marks that are generic descriptive suggestive and arbitrary or fanciful.tcpip holding,haar communications,cir.this court has described generic marks as those consisting of words that identify t
