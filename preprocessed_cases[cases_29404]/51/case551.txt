background 
in,state paving corporation,a highway construction company,successfully bid on a state of florida department of transportation fdot or state of florida project for construction of sound barrier walls.the original agreement was reduced to writing and expressly incorporated the fdot standard specifications for road and bridge construction standard specifications.during the course of the construction,state paving submitted a value engineering change proposal vecp proposing to use a new design for sound walls that would reduce costs.the new sound wall design described in the vecp allegedly included the use of a post column positioned in a pile using a new method devised by state paving which was particularly suitable for use in sandy soil.fdot accepted the vecp on july,agreeing to change the specifications of the contract to include the use of the sound wall design described in the vecp.the supplemental agreement signed by the parties stated that the contract adjustment and sum agreed to constitutes a full and complete settlement and that state paving accepts the terms of this supplemental agreement as full compensation for all costs of equipment,manpower,materials,overhead,profit and delay damages and for all their costs,whether direct or indirect,or whether incurred now or in the future,related to the issues set forth in this agreement.pursuant to the contract and supplemental agreement,the state of florida paid state paving fifty percent of the cost savings realized by the vecp.
on june,state paving filed a patent application with the united states patent and trademark office for a structure and method using the technology described in the vecp.the application matured into two patents patent the patent,issued on august,directed to an improved method of forming a post by inserting the post into a cement slurry pile which is particularly suitable for use in building structures in sandy soil and patent the patent,issued on july,directed to the structure of the post and cement pile 
fdot began using data from the vecp in subsequent requests for bids.state paving learned about one of these instances in september and sent a letter to potential bidders,advising them of the pending patent application and seeking a patent royalty.state paving also sought additional payments under the contract for its use of the vecp data in other contracts to which state paving was not a party.
the issues were not resolved by negotiation,and in august state paving and state contracting collectively state contracting or plaintiffs brought the present lawsuit against the state of florida and seven private contractors in the united states district court for the southern district of florida.
the plaintiffs filed a amended complaint on june,asserting the following claims direct patent infringement by the state of florida of the patent directed to the method of forming the improved post and cement pile count i direct patent infringement by the state of florida of the patent directed to the structure of the improved post and cement pile count ii direct patent infringement by private highway construction contractors which worked for the state of florida for infringement of both patents count iii violations of the lanham act by the state of florida for its representation to potential bidders of construction projects that the specified method for sandy soil construction was unpatented count iv unconstitutional taking by the state of florida of plaintiffs proprietary and patent rights in designs and specifications for the construction of sound barrier walls count v breach of contract by the state of florida for failure to compensate plaintiffs under the contract for use of plaintiff proprietary technology on sound barrier construction projects after the original contract with plaintiffs count vi and contributory patent infringement by joelson concrete pipe company based on its manufacture,use and sale of posts specially made as a component of the patented apparatus and method count vii.

ii.of judgment 
before addressing the merits,we are obligated to consider the issue of our jurisdiction.bender williamsport area sch,d e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction.internal quotations and citations omitted see also helfgott karas,dickenson.at the time the plaintiffs appealed to this court,there remained pending in the district court the counterclaims directed toward and patent invalidity.since it appeared that there might be no appealable final judgment and no certification pursuant to.b,on june,we issued an order directing the parties to address the jurisdictional issue.the parties agreed that the judgment of the district court was not final because of the pending counterclaims and that no rule b certification had been entered,but filed in the district court an emergency for certification of final order of summary judgment for defendants pursuant to rule b.

iii.sovereign immunity 
patent infringement and lanham act claims counts i,ii,and iv 
on the issue of sovereign immunity,this case is governed by florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board college savings bank,d,and college savings bank florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board,d.in those cases,the supreme court established the eleventh amendment immunity of states from,respectively,patent infringement suits under the patent statute and unfair competition suits under the lanham act.in florida prepaid,d,the supreme court held that although congressional intent to abrogate states immunity for patent infringement claims was unmistakably clear in the language of the patent and plant variety protection remedy clarification act patent remedy act,the commerce clause,the patent clause,and the amendment did not provide congress with authority to abrogate state sovereign immunity with respect to patent infringement claims.id.at.accordingly,the supreme court reversed this court decision in college savings bank florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board,which had sustained the abrogation of immunity.at.in the companion case at the supreme court,college savings bank,d,the court held that the trademark remedy clarification act did not abrogate sovereign immunity for actions brought under the lanham act.the court also held that florida did not voluntarily waive its sovereign immunity through its activities in interstate commerce and expressly overruled the court previous decision in parden terminal railway of alabama state docks department,d,which had recognized an implied or constructive waiver of sovereign immunity.at.the supreme court affirmed the third circuit decision in college savings bank florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board,cir.at.
under the court decisions in college savings bank and florida prepaid,florida enjoys sovereign immunity with respect to the patent infringement and lanham act claims unless florida has waived sovereign immunity.the district court rejected state contracting assertion that florida has waived its immunity either generally or specifically by participating in the litigation.on this appeal,plaintiffs contest the district court waiver decision.
we are not persuaded that florida has generally waived its immunity to suit.the florida supreme court decision in state road department of florida tharp,so d,held merely that a bill of complaint for an injunction against the state of florida in state court on a theory of trespass could be maintained because the state had waived immunity by state statute and by the florida constitution.the case may also represent a holding that sovereign immunity is waived as to takings claims in state court.the question,however,remains whether florida has waived sovereign immunity in this particular case as to the patent and lanham act claims in the federal district court.it is that an express waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocal.coll.sav.bank,at.pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d great life ins.read.after college savings bank,it is clear that any waiver of sovereign immunity by a state must be express and voluntary,and can not be implied or constructive.at.expressly overruling parden.the court also emphasized that the test for finding an express waiver is a stringent one.coll.sav.bank,at.under this standard we can not find a general waiver of immunity with respect to lanham act and patent claims.
state contracting also claims that florida has waived its sovereign immunity by defending this litigation,both on its own behalf and as the representative of the alleged private infringers.it is quite clear that those activities do not amount to a waiver.in florida department of state treasure salvors,d,for example,the supreme court held that t he fact that the state appeared and offered defenses on the merits does not foreclose consideration of the eleventh amendment issue.see also allinder ohio,cir holding that the state of ohio did not waive immunity by generally defending itself when it raised defenses in addition to sovereign immunity.
in its answer to the amended complaint,the state of florida counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of and invalidity of the and patents.state contracting next asserts that florida has waived immunity as to the patent claims by filing the counterclaim and by litigating the counterclaim.the question whether the filing of a counterclaim constitutes a waiver of immunity as to the patent claims is substantial,for some courts have suggested that the filing of a counterclaim waives immunity,see,paul howard puerto rico aqueduct sewer authority,cir,newfield house,massachusetts department of public welfare,cir,and others have made clear that the filing of a patent counterclaim of invalidity is quite a separate matter from asserting affirmative defenses of invalidity,cardinal chem.morton int l,d discussing differences between filing an answer asserting invalidity and filing a counterclaim for declaratory judgment of invalidity.in college savings bank,cir,aff,d,the third circuit held that florida filing of a lanham act counterclaim did not waive its defense of sovereign immunity because it was not until the supreme court decision in seminole tribe of florida florida,d,that the successful assertion of an immunity defense became a reasonable possibility.in seminole tribe,the supreme court first held that congress authority to abrogate a state eleventh
