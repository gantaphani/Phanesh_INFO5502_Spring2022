plaintiff appeals the district court order granting summary judgment to defendants.plaintiff degidio argues that the district court erred when it determined that his mark,lawoffices,was descriptive and that it had not acquired secondary meaning.we affirm.
background 
this case represents an attempt by plaintiff,anthony degidio,to obtain trademark protection for the mark lawoffices plaintiff is the registrant of the domain name and alleged founder and owner of the corresponding website which provides a directory of forty attorneys,legal information relating to cyberlaw issues,a vanity service listing of domain names for sale and a hosting service for legal related websites.plaintiff,however,does not own either a federal or state registration for the designation 
defendants,west group corporation,the thompson corporation,and west licensing corporation,utilize the designation law and the domain name to market the west legal directory,which serves as an online resource for various legal information 
plaintiff filed this trademark action on august,alleging violations of the ohio deceptive trade practices act,ohio ann.et.count i unauthorized use of trademark pursuant to ohio ann.et.count ii common law unfair competition count iii false designation of origin under a count iv federal trademark dilution count v common law dilution count vi and the tort of misappropriation count vii.both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court found that lawoffices was not a protectible mark because it was descriptive and it had not acquired a secondary meaning.accordingly,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment as to counts,but not vii.plaintiff dismissed count vii and thereafter timely appealed.

as the district court correctly noted,in order to prevail on any of the first six counts,plaintiff must establish that the designation is indeed a valid and legally protectable trademark.see degidio west group,d,citing herman miller,palazzetti imports exports,cir,am.online,cir sunbeam products v.the west bend,cir,overruled in part on other grounds sub,traffix devices,mktg.displays,d the district court also correctly noted that the lanham act offers protection against infringement of both registered and unregistered marks.see,two pesos,taco cabana,d.to determine whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection under a,the courts look to the general principles qualifying a mark for registration under of the lanham act.etw jireh,cir citing two pesos,at.as this court has previously indicated,we employ the same analysis to alleged trademark violations under ohio law,as we do under the federal law.allard,advanced programming,cir abercrombie fitch stores,am.eagle outfitters,cir leventhal,thomson cent.ohio,ohio app d.finally,the same federal trademark principles apply to analogous federal and state common law claims.daddy junky music big daddy family music,cir.
as the district court observed,whether plaintiff mark qualifies for trademark protection is determined by where the mark falls along the established spectrum of distinctiveness.degidio,d at citing boston beer slesar.brewing,cir.putative trademarks may either be inherently distinctive or acquire distinctiveness through secondary meaning.see two pesos,at.professor mccarthy,in his treatise,further explains that 
within the two basic categories are that form the complete spectrum of distinctiveness of marks.arrayed in an ascending order roughly reflecting their eligibility to trademark status and the degree of protection afforded,the categories are generic terms descriptive suggestive arbitrary or fanciful.generic terms can never be trademarks,descriptive terms are not inherently distinctive and suggestive,arbitrary and fanciful terms are regarded as being inherently distinctive.

in the present case,neither party is arguing that plaintiff mark is either generic or arbitrary or fanciful.because suggestive marks are inherently distinctive,whereas descriptive marks can only acquire distinctiveness through secondary meaning,we first consider into which,plaintiff mark falls.
plaintiff mark is descriptive 
a suggestive term suggests rather than describes an ingredient or characteristic of the goods and requires the observer or listener to use imagination and perception to determine the nature of the goods,at.as this circuit explained earlier,examples of a suggestive term include citibank,which connotes an urban or modern bank,or goliath,for wood pencils,connoting a large size.champions golf club,v.the champions golf club,cir.on the other hand,a trademark is merely descriptive if it describes one,or more,of the following the intended purpose,function or use of the goods the class of users of the goods a desirable characteristic of the goods or the end effect upon the user.wynn oil thomas,cir.as the champions golf club court explained,examples of descriptive marks are best,superior,and preferred.champions golf club,at.
the district court found that plaintiff mark was,at best,descriptive.degidio,d at.to aid in its determination,the court relied on a following test that was articulated by professor and accepted by the parties 
how much imagination on the buyer part is required in trying to cull a direct message from the mark about the quality,ingredients or characteristics of the product or service in doing this,it must be kept in mind that the ordinary consumer does not spend much time in the marketplace lingering over such problems.on the other hand,if the potential buying class at issue are experts or professionals,a more critical examination is reasonable.
does the mark directly convey a real and unequivocal idea of some characteristic,function,quality or ingredient of the product or service to a reasonably informed potential buyer that typical buyer will already have some knowledge about the product or service and is neither an expert nor a totally uninformed about the product.is some reflection or reasoning process necessary to cull some direct information about the product from the term used as a mark 
does the mark so closely tell something about the product or service that other sellers of like products would be likely to want to use the term in connection with their goods perhaps a more realistic way to pose this question is to ask whether,without any prior knowledge of this mark,others would be likely to want to use it to describe their products 
are,in fact,other sellers now using this term to describe their products even if the mark is descriptive and has attained secondary meaning,if many others in other product markets are using this term,the mark may be labelled sic weak and entitled only to narrow protection.
even though the mark may tell something about the goods or services,is it just as likely to conjure up some other,purely arbitrary connotation,sugar spice baked goods,or poly pitcher plastic pitchers.
how does the mark fit into the basic concept that descriptive marks can not pinpoint one source by identifying and distinguishing only one seller that is,are buyers likely to regard the mark really as a symbol of origin,or merely as another form of advertising
