on may,george and company,llc george brought this trademark infringement action against imagination entertainment limited,imagination holdings pty limited,and imagination dvd,incorporated collectively imagination,claiming that imagination infringed upon george trademark rights in lcr and left center right.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of imagination.george appeals,and we now affirm.
george is a limited liability new york corporation with its principal place of business in naples,florida.it has marketed and sold dice games,party games,board games,and related entertainment products for more than a century.
imagination is an australian corporation with its headquarters in kent town,australia.it markets and sells dice games,board games,and related gaming products in several countries,including the united states.
each of the parties markets and sells a generic dice game the dice game.game play for the dice game is simple and straightforward.at least three players are required,and each player starts with three chips.the players then take turns rolling three dice.each side of the dice is marked with one of the following the letter l,the letter r,the letter c,or a dot symbol.the number of l on the roll indicates the number of chips to be passed to the player to the left of the roller,the number of r indicates the number of chips to be passed to the player to the right of the roller,and the number of c indicates the number of chips to be placed in the center pot.dots are neutral and do not require the roller to pass his chips or place them in the center pot.when a player has two or less chips in his possession,he rolls the number of dice equivalent to the number of chips he possesses for example,a player with two chips rolls two dice.a player with no chips still plays,but on his turn he has to pass the dice to the next player and hope that the rollers adjacent to him,after their roll,pass him some chips.as the game progresses,players gain and lose chips,while the number of chips in the center pot increases.the dice game ends when only one player has chips remaining,and that player is declared the winner and is awarded the chips in the center pot 
according to george,beginning some time in,it began to market and sell versions of the dice game under the names lcr and left center right.from to,the game was sold in foil wrap,with either lcr or left center right on the foil 
beginning in,george began to market and sell its version of the dice game exclusively under the lcr name.the parties agree that george intended lcr to be an abbreviation of left center right.george owns registered trademarks for lcr and a related design the rolling dice design george never sought to register the mark left center right.
at the time george initiated this trademark infringement action,it sold its lcr game in two forms,either in blister packaging or in a plastic tube hanging from a rack the blister packaging and the cardboard on the display rack are similar in all material respects they are predominately white in color,and contain a designation following the rolling dice design and a notice that lcr is a trademark of george.
several features of the blister packaging are worthy of note.first,the packaging prominently displays the name of the dice game through the rolling dice design.the rolling dice design depicts the faces of three dice in horizontal succession,with the face of the first dice containing an l,the second a c,and the third an in the design,the three dice almost touch each other,with the l dice tilted to the left,the c dice tilted to the right,and the r dice tilted to the left.a symbol is located in the lower corner of the design.
second,the packaging uses the following tagline,left,center or t lose your chips the tagline.third,the packaging contains a design the arrows design in which the faces of the three dice that appear in the rolling dice design are arranged in a design,with the l dice on the upper left side of the design,the c dice on the bottom of the design,and the r dice on the upper right side of the design.the word left is located to the left of the face of the l dice,the word center is located below the face of the c dice,and the word right is located to the right of the r dice.the arrows design also has three chips,one below the face of the l dice,one above the face of the c dice,and one below and slightly to the right of the face of the r dice.three arrows also appear,one running around the left side of the chip below the face of the l dice,one pointing from the face of the c dice to the chip appearing above it,and one running around the right side of the chip below the face of the r dice.
fourth,a much smaller version of the rolling dice design appears in other places on the packaging,and each time a symbol follows the design.the design is used to inform the customer that lcr is the new game that everyone getting hooked on.so simple,kids love it.it is also used to inform the customer that the game is so contagious and that parents grab up lcr for themselves.customers are told through use of the design that you play lcr with chips or whatever makes it fun for you.finally,the design is used to inform the customer that lcr is a game for or more players ages to 
after the initiation of this trademark infringement action,george added a new package design,which is predominately blue in color,to its arsenal of lcr products in addition to an designation following the rolling dice design,the new product contains designations next to the tagline and the arrows design.
george markets and sells its lcr games online and in retail shops,including its own retail shop in williamsville,new york.in the four years leading up to the filing of this infringement action,george sold an average of more than lcr games per year.
in,imagination began marketing its version of the dice game to potential distributors under the name left center right.in june,imagination began distributing and selling left center right to the consuming public.the rules and game play for left center right are the same in all material respects to the rules and game play of lcr.on january,imagination filed an application with the uspto for the purpose of registering left center right as a trademark on the principal register.on july,the application was denied on the ground that the mark left center right was descriptive.on january,imagination filed an amended application,which on march,was denied,once again on descriptiveness grounds.on september,imagination amended its application once more,this time seeking registration on the supplemental register on october,the uspto accepted imagination amendment and placed left center right on the supplemental register.
imagination sells left center right in two versions,a card pack version and a tin version both the card pack and tin version are bright red with bent yellow arrows depicting game movement with the game name,left center right,displayed in the center of each package.the tagline the addictive dice game is featured prominently on the card pack version on the bottom right inside a dice and prominently on the tin version on the bottom center.
imagination places its name and logo in an upper corner of each version.imagination packaging displays a designation next to left center right and contains the notice imagination name and logo and left center right are trademarks of imagination entertainment limited and imagination holdings pty.
on may,george filed this trademark infringement action seeking declaratory,injunctive,and monetary relief under the lanham act,et,and virginia law.the gist of george complaint is that imagination use of left center right infringes on george federal trademark rights in left center right and george lcr trademark,which is.in resolving these claims,the district court granted imagination motion for summary judgment,reasoning that george had no federal trademark rights in left center right and that there was no likelihood of confusion created by imagination use of left center right.george noted a timely appeal.
we review an award of summary judgment de novo.hawkspere shipping,intamex,cir.summary judgment is only appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to george,the party opposing imagination summary judgment motion,and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.hill lockheed martin logistics,cir en banc.
george first alleges that imagination use of left center right infringed upon its federal trademark rights in lcr.
a trademark includes any word,name,symbol,or device used by an individual to identify and distinguish his goods from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods.a trademark puts the purchasing public on notice that all goods bearing the trademark originated from the same source and are of equal quality.retail,freebies publ g,cir.thus,a trademark not only protects the goodwill represented by particular marks,but also allows consumers readily to recognize products and their source,preventing consumer confusion between products and between sources of products,bicast,cir.
to establish trademark infringement,a plaintiff must prove that it owns a valid and protectable mark,and that the defendant use of a reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of that mark creates a likelihood of confusion.a carefirst of,first care,cir petro stopping,james river petroleum,cir.the parties do not dispute that george possesses a valid and protectable mark in lcr the only question is whether imagination use of left center right creates a likelihood of confusion with george use of lcr.
a likelihood of confusion exists if the defendant actual practice is likely to produce confusion in the minds of consumers about the origin of the goods or services in question.carefirst,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in assessing whether such confusion exists,we look to how the two parties actually use their marks in the marketplace to determine whether the defendant use is likely to cause confusion.id.
our likelihood of confusion case law instructs us to examine nine factors the strength or distinctiveness of the plaintiff mark as actually used in the marketplace the similarity of the two marks to consumers the similarity of the goods or services that the marks identify the similarity of the facilities used by the markholders the similarity of advertising used by the markholders the defendant intent actual confusion the quality of the defendant product and the sophistication of the consuming public.see pizzeria uno temple,cir setting forth factors one through seven see also sara lee,cir identifying factors eight and nine.not all of these factors are of equal importance,nor are they always relevant in any given case,l l wings,cir see also id.noting that the pizzeria uno factors are not meant to be a rigid formula for infringement they are only a of various considerations that may be relevant in determining the ultimate statutory question of likelihood of confusion.however,evidence of actual confusion is often paramount in the likelihood of confusion analysis.lyons,morris costumes,cir see also lone star steakhouse saloon,alpha of,cir noting that the actual confusion factor is entitled to substantial weight as it provides the most compelling evidence of likelihood of confusion.
the first likelihood of confusion factor focuses on the strength of the mark.generally,the stronger the mark,the greater the likelihood that consumers will be confused by competing uses of the mark.strength consists of both conceptual strength and commercial strength.carefirst,at.
a mark conceptual strength is determined in part by its placement into one of four categories of distinctiveness generic descriptive suggestive or arbitrary or fanciful.pizzeria uno,at.a generic mark describes a product in its entirety,sara lee,at,and,therefore,neither signifies the source of goods nor distinguishes the particular product from other products on the market.retail,at.unlike distinctive marks,a generic mark is never entitled to trademark protection.see id.referring to a generic mark as the antithesis of a distinctive mark.examples of generic marks are bleach,copiers,cigarettes,and cars.
fanciful marks,which are inherently distinctive,typically involve words created for the sole purpose of serving as a trademark.see sara lee,at noting that clorox,kodak,polaroid,and exxon are fanciful marks.arbitrary marks,which are also inherently distinctive,typically involve common words that have no connection with the actual product,as they do not suggest or describe any quality,ingredient,or characteristic,so the mark can be viewed as arbitrarily assigned.see also id.noting that camel cigarettes and apple computers are arbitrary marks.
suggestive marks,which are also inherently distinctive,do not describe a product features but merely suggests them.retail,at.in other words,the exercise of some imagination is required to associate a suggestive mark with the product.id.examples of suggestive marks are coppertone,orange crush,and playboy.sara lee,at.
descriptive marks define a particular characteristic of the product in a way that does not require any exercise of the imagination.retail,at.examples of descriptive marks include after tan lotion and minute glue.sara lee,at.descriptive marks are not inherently distinctive rather,they require a showing of secondary meaning before they receive trademark protection.retail,at see also e noting that registration may be refused if the proposed mark,when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant is merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them.saying that a trademark has acquired secondary meaning is shorthand for saying that a descriptive mark has become sufficiently distinctive to establish a mental association in buyers minds between the alleged mark and a single source of the product.retail,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also sara lee,at noting that secondary meaning exists when,in the minds of the public,the primary significance of a product feature or term is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself internal quotation marks omitted perini perini,cir secondary meaning is the consuming public understanding that the mark,when used in context,refers,not to what the descriptive word ordinarily describes,but to the particular business that the mark is meant to identify.
distinguishing between a suggestive mark and descriptive mark can be difficult.however,if the mark imparts information directly,it is descriptive,but i f it stands for an idea which requires some operation of the imagination to connect it with the goods,it is suggestive.pizzeria uno,at quoting union carbide,cir.an abbreviation of a descriptive term which still conveys to the buyer the descriptive connotation of the original term will still be held to be descriptive.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition hereinafter mccarthy collecting cases see also id.if a series of letters is merely a recognizable abbreviation for a descriptive or generic term,the abbreviation is also classified as descriptive or generic.
the district court concluded that the lcr mark was suggestive,understandably because imagination conceded the mark was suggestive.under these circumstances,like the district court,we are constrained to conclude that the lcr mark is suggestive.we are obligated to defer to the determination of the uspto,which constitutes prima facie evidence of whether a mark is descriptive or suggestive.lone star steakhouse,at.if the uspto believes a mark is descriptive,the registrant must provide evidence of secondary meaning before the uspto will grant registration.id.here,the parties agree that the lcr mark was registered by the uspto without any proof of secondary meaning,and that the uspto determined that the lcr mark was suggestive.and although imagination had an opportunity in the district court to rebut the presumption raised by the uspto determination,it declined to do so,instead conceding that the lcr mark is suggestive.accordingly,even though lcr is an abbreviation for left center right and we harbor doubt that the lcr mark is suggestive we are not at liberty to take issue with the district court determination.
our strength of the mark analysis does not end here.the placement of a mark in either the descriptive or suggestive category simply is the first step.the second step considers the mark commercial strength,a concept similar to the secondary meaning inquiry considered in evaluating a mark validity.carefirst,at.proof of secondary meaning entails a rigorous evidentiary standard.perini,at.in perini,we set forth six factors for a court to consider in assessing the acquisition of secondary meaning.id.they are the plaintiff advertising expenditures consumer studies linking the mark to a source the plaintiff record of sales success unsolicited media coverage of the plaintiff business attempts to plagiarize the mark and the length and exclusivity of the plaintiff use of the mark.id.
with regard to the first perini factor,george advertising expenditures were minimal.with regard to the second factor,no consumer studies were performed linking the lcr mark to george.the absence of such evidence is telling,as such evidence is generally thought to be the most direct and persuasive way of establishing secondary meaning.search,llc,cir.with regard to the remaining factors,the record discloses that george enjoyed some unsolicited media attention was not aware of any attempts to plagiarize prior to imagination activities used the lcr mark for over twenty years and enjoyed recent sales success.
in assessing these factors under the summary judgment standard,it is evident that lcr has not acquired secondary meaning in the context of our commercial strength analysis.put simply,the record does not disclose that a substantial number of present or prospective customers,when hearing or reading of lcr,would associate lcr specifically with george.id.at concluding that,notwithstanding evidence of advertising expenditures and sales success,summary judgment was appropriate.
in our view,the lcr mark lack of commercial strength renders the mark weak for purposes of our strength of the mark analysis.petro stopping,at even a mark held to be suggestive may be found weak under the first likelihood of confusion factor.as we noted in petro stopping,the strength of a mark ultimately depends on the degree to which the designation is associated by prospective purchasers with a particular source.at.here,the record is devoid of meaningful evidence demonstrating that consumers associate the lcr mark with george.
in assessing the similarity of the marks under the second pizzeria uno factor,we focus on the dominant portions of the parties marks.lone star steakhouse,at pizzeria uno,at.in other words,we focus on whether there exists a similarity in sight,sound,and meaning which would result in confusion.see pizzeria uno,at noting that uno,as used by the parties,was similar in appearance,sound,and meaning see also sara lee,at noting that the two marks at issue,though not identical,were perceived similarly by the eye and ear mccarthy noting that the degree of similarity between marks is tested on three levels as encountered in the marketplace sight,sound,and meaning.
the district court found that lcr and left center right were dissimilar.the district court reasoned that the marks neither looked alike,nor sounded alike.the district court noted that lcr consisted of three capital letters,and left center right consisted of three words.the district court also noted that,because the parties conceded lcr was suggestive,it did not necessarily follow that consumers in the marketplace would understand lcr and left center right to be similar in meaning.
the district court conclusion that the second pizzeria uno factor weighed against george was correct.the two marks look and sound different.george tries to counter this evidence by arguing that,as an abbreviation of left center right,lcr means the same thing as left center right.assuming arguendo that this is the case,the manner in which the marks are used on their respective packaging distinguishes the two marks beyond doubt.imagination packaging and branding is totally different from that of george.george uses a plain white background with the game prominently displayed encased in clear plastic near the rolling dice design,the tagline,and the arrows design.george uses mostly the same elements in its newer,blue packaging.in contrast,imagination game does not use lcr alone or in a similar design to the rolling dice design,the tagline,or the arrows design.the names of both george and imagination appear on their respective packaging as the source of their respective goods.in short,a consumer in a toy store or online examining the marks unquestionably would conclude that the two marks are quite different.luigino,stouffer,cir holding that lean cusine was dissimilar to lean tasty,reasoning that w ith the exception of the word lean,which is generally descriptive of food and not registerable as a trademark,the two marks look and sound different petro stopping,at holding that petro stopping center and james river petro card were dissimilar in sight and appearance henri food prods,kraft,cir holding that yogowhip and miracle whip are dissimilar because they look and sound different and because of the differences in the product labels.
with regard to the third factor,the similarity of the goods or services identified by the marks,we note that the goods in question need not be identical or in direct competition with each other.cae,clean air eng g,cir.the district court concluded that the parties goods were nearly identical and,therefore,the similarity factor weighed in favor of george.we find no error in the district court examination of the third factor.
the fourth and fifth factors examine the similarity of the facilities used by the parties and the similarity of their advertising.the district court found that these two factors favored george because the parties competed in a similar manner in overlapping markets.we find no error in the district court treatment of these factors.
the sixth factor to be considered is imagination intent in adopting its left center right mark.in pizzeria uno,we noted that this factor sometimes is a major factor because i f there is intent to confuse the buying public,this is strong evidence establishing likelihood of confusion,since one intending to profit from another reputation generally attempts to make his signs,advertisements,to resemble the other so as deliberately to induce confusion.at.
george argues that imagination intentionally adopted a similar mark to trade on george goodwill in lcr.george further posits that imagination exhibited bad faith by failing to conduct a trademark search or to obtain advice of counsel before adopting the left center right mark for use on its version of the dice game.despite these contentions,george has presented no meaningful evidence that imagination wished to capitalize on george lcr trademark.imagination understandably chose left center right because it succinctly describes how the generic dice game is played.moreover,george packaging does not lead one to conclude that it sought trademark rights in left center right.a symbol only follows the rolling dice design,and language on the packaging notifies a potential competitor that trademark rights are sought only in lcr lcr is a trademark of george.george packaging designates exactly what it considers to be a and the rolling dice design.thus,imagination use of left center right evidences at most an intent to compete with lcr and not an intent to infringe on george lcr trademark.finally,the failure to conduct a trademark search or contact counsel shows carelessness at most,but is in any event irrelevant because knowledge of another goods is not the same as an intent to mislead and to cause consumer confusion.luigino,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the district court committed no error in concluding that the intent factor militated against a finding of a likelihood of confusion.
the seventh and most important factor is actual confusion.actual confusion can be demonstrated by both anecdotal and survey evidence.tools usa and equip.champ frame straightening,cir.evidence of only a small number of instances of actual confusion may be dismissed as de minimis.petro stopping,at see also mccarthy.in assessing the weight of the evidence,we note that 
e vidence of the number of instances of actual confusion must be placed against the background of the number of opportunities for confusion before one can make an informed decision as to the weight to be given the evidence.if there is a very large volume of contacts or transactions which could give rise to confusion and there is only a handful of instances of actual confusion,the evidence of actual confusion may receive relatively little weight.
mccarthy see also petro stopping,at in light of the plaintiff huge volume of commerce,the plaintiff meager evidence of actual confusion is at best de minimis.
before the hearing on imagination motion for summary judgment,george evidence of actual confusion came from two individuals,corinne harrison and melissa fortunato.harrison is a toy store owner in des moines,iowa.in january,an imagination distributor visited harrison store and showed her imagination catalog.when harrison saw imagination left center right game depicted,she thought the game had been licensed by george because it bore the left center right name.
in february,harrison visited imagination booth at a new york toy fair.there,she saw left center right game materials and still believed the game was licensed by george because it bore the name left center right.harrison ordered a number of units of imagination left center right game because she still mistakenly thought imagination game was licensed by george.according to harrison,had she known imagination game was unlicensed,she would not have placed the order,implying that it was wrong for imagination to take business away from a small company like george.
fortunato,a toy company manager,contacted george in october seeking to obtain a license to make a deluxe version of george lcr game.george declined because it was interested in making its own deluxe version.upon seeing imagination catalog,fortunato believed that imagination had obtained a license from george to make a deluxe version of george lcr game.
after the district court took imagination motion for summary judgment under advisement,george twice sought leave to file additional evidence of actual confusion.in both instances,the district court granted the motion,which allowed george to present evidence of actual confusion from two additional individuals,sharon lynch and jill smilanich 
in november,lynch,a sales associate at george retail store in williamsville,new york,was approached in the store by a customer looking for a game called left center right.the customer had previously played lcr,as her friend purchased lcr at george store.the customer informed lynch that the toys r us where imagination game was sold was selling a more expensive version of george game.
in december,smilanich,george office manager,received a call from a consumer who had purchased imagination game but mistakenly believed it was george game.according to smilanich,the caller complained about the game she purchased and,upon learning she had purchased imagination game,she became upset and said she would not have purchased the game had she known it was not george game.
the district court found that the testimony of these witnesses amounted to,at most,de minimis evidence of actual confusion.accordingly,the district court looked at the seventh factor as weighing heavily against a finding of a likelihood of confusion.
the district court consideration of the actual confusion factor was not in error.the evidence in the record demonstrates that george sells lcr games per year.like petro stopping,in light of george huge sales volume,four instances of consumer confusion is at best de minimis.at syndicate sales,hampshire paper,cir evidence of only two consumers who were confused was minimal and did not prevent dismissal on summary judgment king of the mountain sports,chrysler,cir holding that seven examples of actual confusion was de minimis.at worst,the company failure to uncover more than a few instances of actual confusion creates a presumption against likelihood of confusion in the future.petro stopping,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the seventh factor weighs heavily against a likelihood of confusion 
factor eight,the quality of the defendant product,as noted by the district court,has no relevance in this case.it applies in situations involving the production of cheap copies or knockoffs of a competitor goods.sara lee,at.here,imagination goods are priced at or above the prices of george goods.accordingly,the district court correctly determined the eighth factor has no relevance in this case.
the ninth factor,the sophistication of the consuming public,similarly is not relevant.in sara lee,we noted that this factor will only be relevant when the relevant market is not the public.id.here,the relevant market is the public,and there is no evidence that persons who buy dice games are any more sophisticated about dice games than those who comprise the market for other ordinary retail goods.
examining the pizzeria uno factors,we note that some favor george and some favor imagination.however,the most significant factor,actual confusion,weighs decidedly against george.this factor,along with the weakness of the lcr mark,the lack of similarity between the two marks,and the lack of predatory intent,leads to the inescapable conclusion that there is no likelihood of confusion as a matter of law between imagination use of left center right and george use of lcr.in fact,we are aware of no case where a court has allowed a trademark infringement action to proceed beyond summary judgment where two weak marks were dissimilar,there was no showing of a predatory intent,and the evidence of actual confusion was de minimis.accordingly,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to imagination on george claim that imagination use of left center right federally infringed on george use of lcr.
george also contends that the district court erred when it held that george did not have a valid and protectable mark in left center right.in rejecting george contention,the district court concluded that george abandoned all trademark rights in left center right because the undisputed evidence demonstrated that george had abandoned the use of left center right as a mark back in.
in general,the party claiming ownership of a mark must be the first to use the mark in the sale of goods.mccarthy the party claiming ownership must also use the mark as a trademark,that is,the mark must be used to identify the source of the goods to potential customers.microstrategy,motorola,cir.thus,so long as a person is the first to use a particular mark to identify his goods in a given market,and so long as that owner continues to make use of the mark,he is entitled to prevent others from using the mark to describe their own goods in that market.defiance button mach.c c metal prods,cir.
however,if the owner of a mark ceases to use the mark without an intent to resume use in the reasonably foreseeable future,the mark is said to have been abandoned.emergency one,american fireeagle,cir.once abandoned,a mark returns to the public domain and may,in principle,be appropriated for use by others in the marketplace,indianapolis colts,metro.baltimore football club,cir,in accordance with the basic rules of trademark priority,manhattan,sweater bee by banff,cir see also mccarthy once held abandoned,a mark falls into the public domain and is free for all to use.while acquiescence may bar suit against one person,abandonment opens rights to the whole world.abandonment paves the way for future possession and property in any other person.footnotes omitted.
a trademark is abandoned when its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use.our case law requires a showing of by the legal owner and no intent to resume use in the reasonably foreseeable future by the legal owner
