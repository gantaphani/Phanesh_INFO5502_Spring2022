emergency one,appeals from a nationwide injunction entered by the district court prohibiting from using its american eagle mark in connection with the sale of its fire trucks or from otherwise infringing upon the trademark rights of american fireeagle,afe.we vacate the injunction and remand the case for further proceedings.
a manufacturer of fire trucks and rescue vehicles,sued afe for trademark infringement.the parties agree that afe american fireeagle mark,which depicts a bald eagle superimposed over an american flag,and american eagle mark are sufficiently similar as to create a likelihood of confusion among potential purchasers of fire trucks.afe counterclaimed on the grounds that had abandoned its mark,that afe had then acquired ownership through use of the mark,and that subsequent renewed use of the mark infringed on afe trademark rights.a jury initially determined that had not abandoned the american eagle mark and,therefore,afe was infringing on mark.based on the verdict,the district court entered an injunction against afe continued use of its american fireeagle mark.the injunction was unlimited in its geographical scope.
afe appealed.this court concluded that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that had discontinued use of the american eagle mark.emergency one,american fireeagle,cir american fireeagle i.we explained,however,that the case does not end there because did produce evidence that it intended to resume use of the mark on fire trucks.see west supp providing that a trademark is abandoned when its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use.on the issue of intent to resume use of the mark,we held that the jury instructions fail ed to instruct the jury that in order to avoid abandonment a trademark owner who discontinues use of the mark must have an intent to resume use in the reasonably foreseeable future.american fireeagle i,at emphasis added.we also concluded that the jury instructions failed to advise the jury that the type of use that is relevant to determining whether a trademark owner has discontinued use is use in the course of trade in a particular good.id.emphasis added.we vacated the judgment and the injunction and remanded for a new trial.
upon remand,the district court granted request for bifurcation of the trial.the only issue submitted to the jury was whether had abandoned its rights in the american eagle mark prior to the time that afe began using its similar mark.specifically,the second jury was asked to decide if intend ed to resume use of the american eagle trademark on fire trucks in the reasonably foreseeable future.the jury determined that had not intended to resume use of the mark.following the verdict,afe requested that the district court impose an unlimited injunction,virtually identical to the one imposed against afe after the first trial,against continued use of its mark.objected,however,arguing that a nationwide injunction was inappropriate and that an evidentiary hearing was necessary to establish the proper geographical scope of the injunction.the district court concluded that had waived the right to challenge the geographical scope of the injunction,that was therefore not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue,and that a nationwide injunction was appropriate.the district court noted that jury issues still remained with respect to whether afe was entitled to monetary relief from on afe trademark infringement claim or its claims under the north carolina unfair and deceptive trade practices act,see,and north carolina common law.immediately appealed the district court entry of the injunction.see a west.
we review the entry of an injunction by the district court for abuse of discretion.see wilson champus,cir.argues that because common law trademark rights extend only to the geographical areas in which afe has made bona fide use of the mark,afe is not entitled to injunctive relief in any market where it has not established such use.asserts that the district court therefore abused its discretion by entering a blanket,nationwide injunction against without any evidence of the localities in which afe used the mark.
before considering the scope of the injunction entered against,a brief review of the governing principles of trademark law is in order.afe and both asserted trademark rights in an unregistered mark.common law determines who enjoys the exclusive right to use an unregistered trademark,the extent of such rights,and the proper geographical scope of any injunctive relief necessary to protect against the infringement of such rights.see spartan food,hfs,cir explaining that the geographical extent of an injunction against infringement of an unregistered mark is governed by common law as expounded by the supreme court.
at common law,trademark ownership is acquired by actual use of the mark in a given market.see united drug theodore rectanus.to acquire ownership of a trademark it is not enough to have invented the mark first or even to have registered it first the party claiming ownership must have been the first to actually use the mark in the sale of goods or services.sengoku works rmc int l,cir see homeowners group,home mktg.specialists,cir o wnership rights flow only from prior appropriation and actual use in the market.see generally thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,ed.the owner of a mark acquires both the right to use a particular mark and the right to prevent others from using the same or a confusingly similar mark.homeowners group,at.accordingly,trademark ownership confers an exclusive right to use the mark.see united drug,at.
when more than one user claims the exclusive right to use an unregistered trademark,priority is determined by the first actual use of the mark in a genuine commercial transaction.allard,advanced programming,cir see united drug,at.t he general rule is that,as between conflicting claimants to the right to use the same mark,priority of appropriation determines the question.see also blue bell,farah,cir the exclusive right to a trademark belongs to one who first uses it in connection with specified goods.sweetarts sunline,cir same.the first user,then,to appropriate and use a particular senior has priority to use the mark to the exclusion of any.see lucent info,lucent,cir see also mccarthy,supra,at.and,priority must be established before an injunction can be entered against an infringing trademark user.see scott paper scott liquid gold,cir r elief is only available if the plaintiff establishes priority.the priority to use a mark,however,can be lost through abandonment.see american fireeagle i,at.once abandoned,a mark may be seized immediately and the person doing so may establish priority of use and ownership under the basic rules of trademark priority.mccarthy,supra,at.
the territorial extent of ownership rights in an unregistered mark is not unlimited.see spartan food,at.in hanover star milling metcalf,the supreme court explained the limited scope of common law trademark rights 
into whatever markets the use of a trademark has extended,or its meaning has become known,there will the manufacturer or trader whose trade is pirated by an infringing use be entitled to protection and redress.but this is not to say that the proprietor of a trademark can monopolize markets that his trade has never reached s ince it is the trade,and not the mark,that is to be protected,a trademark extends to every market where the trader goods have become known and identified by his use of the mark.but the mark,of itself,can not travel to markets where there is no article to wear the badge and no trader to offer the article.
id.at.internal quotation marks omitted see also united drug,at.at common law,therefore,the exclusive right to use a mark is limited to areas where the mark had been used and the claimant of the mark had carried on business.armand subway,doctor,cir see spartan food,at the common law rights are restricted to the locality where the mark is used and to the area of probable expansion.
although federal registration of a mark does not itself confer ownership rights,registration constitutes prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark,of the registrant ownership of the mark,and of the registrant exclusive right to use the registered mark b west.moreover,the presumption of priority enjoyed by the registrant of a mark is nationwide in effect.c.thus,registration of a trademark under the lanham act creates a presumption that the registrant is entitled to use the registered mark throughout the nation.draeger oil,cir.by contrast,a user claiming ownership of a mark under principles does not enjoy the benefit of the presumptions conferred by registration and must establish his right to exclusive use in effect,registration shift s the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant,who must introduce sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of plaintiff right to such exclusive use.pizzeria uno temple,cir internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,a plaintiff asserting a claim of infringement against trademark ownership rights bears the burden of establishing its exclusive right to use the mark by actual use in a given territory.
the nature of trademark rights in large measure determines the appropriate scope of any injunctive relief.thus,the owner of trademark rights in an unregistered mark is not entitled to injunctive relief in those localities where it has failed to establish actual use of the mark.see spartan food,at.by limiting injunctive relief to the territory where the mark is being used,courts ensure that a trademark does not precede its owner into markets that the owner trade has never reached.hanover milling,at.for this reason,even the owner of a federally registered enjoys the presumption of nationwide not entitled to injunctive relief except in the area actually penetrated through use of the mark.lone star steakhouse saloon,alpha of virginia,cir internal quotation marks omitted accordingly,even though the senior user of an unregistered mark has established priority over a junior user through prior appropriation,injunctive relief is appropriate only in those areas where the senior user can show sufficient actual use.see spartan food,at reversing the award of injunctive relief to the extent that it covered territory beyond the area in which the senior user established actual use armand subway,at explaining that even though the owner of a registered trademark has an exclusive right of use that enjoys nationwide protection,the protection is only potential in areas where the registrant in fact does not do business and a competing user could use the mark there until the registrant extended its business to the area.
afe established its priority in the mark when the jury on remand determined that,after discontinuing use of the mark,had not intended to resume use of the mark in the reasonably foreseeable future.see mccarthy,supra,at.for all practical purposes,the abandonment determination also settled the issue of liability,who had priority in the mark.conceded to the district court that afe was the prevailing party on the issue of the ownership of the trademark.because the mark was not registered,however,the common law rights of afe in the abandoned mark were restricted to the locality where the mark was used and to the area of probable expansion.spartan food,at.thus,any injunctive relief to which afe was entitled was also limited to the areas where afe used the mark.the parties stipulated that b oth and afe market and sell certain types of fire trucks in the eastern district of north carolina.although afe claimed that it was entitled to injunctive relief much broader in scope than the eastern district of north carolina,afe has not directed us to any facts it presented to the district court to establish the extent of its use of the mark.actually,the only facts regarding the extent of afe use that were presented to the court were presented by,which suggested afe might be entitled,at most,to injunctive relief covering north carolina,south carolina,west virginia and michigan,based on sales volume.in any event,there was no factual basis in the record from which the court could conclude that a nationwide injunction was appropriate.see spartan food,at vacating injunction to the extent it covered an area for which the senior user failed to prove sufficient use of the mark.we conclude that there is an insufficient factual basis to support the nationwide scope of the injunction and,therefore,that the district court abused its discretion.see,allard,at vacating an injunction of national scale where the court failed to set forth the geographic scope of defendants trade territory natural footwear hart,schaffner marx,cir vacating nationwide injunction where the district court failed to scrutinize the extent of the senior user sales,advertising,and reputation on either a or basis.
afe argues that the district court correctly determined that waived its right to contest the geographic scope of the injunction.the district court did not elaborate on the basis for its conclusion that waived its right to challenge the injunction.however,afe presented to the district court the same waiver argument it makes on challenge to the territorial scope of the injunction is effectively an affirmative defense that failed to raise and thus waived.specifically,afe argues that in challenging the scope of the injunction,was in fact claiming to be an innocent or remote user of the mark.afe asserts that this is an affirmative defense which is subject to waiver.see brinkley harbour recreation club,cir a party failure to raise an affirmative defense in the appropriate pleading generally results in waiver.responds that its challenge went to the scope of the remedy imposed by the district court as opposed to liability.
in order to accept afe argument,we must determine that a remote user claim qualifies as an affirmative defense that is actually raising such a defense but that waived its ability to do so by not alleging in its pleadings that it was a remote user of the mark.we conclude that although a remote user claim can be categorized as an affirmative defense,is not technically raising this claim and,therefore,has not waived its ability to challenge the injunction.
as previously explained,the senior user of a mark acquires priority over a subsequent user and thereby enjoys the exclusive right to use the mark within the areas where the mark had been used and the claimant of the mark had carried on business.armand subway,at see hanover star milling,at.the innocent or remote user defense stands as an exception to the general rule that the senior user,by virtue of its prior appropriation,has superior rights in the mark over a party that subsequently begins using the mark.the legal foundation that underlies this defense derives from the tea doctrine,which blends several common law trademark principles established by the supreme court in hanover star milling company metcalf and united drug company theodore rectanus company.under the tea doctrine,the first user of a common law trademark may not oust a later user good faith use of an infringing mark in a market where the first user products or services are not sold.ass for healthcare communications,cent.area agency on aging,cir.in other words,a junior user,who in good faith adopted a mark for use at a place remote from the place of senior use of a similar mark,has a right to continue its use of the mark superior to the right of the senior user.spartan food,at.thus,even though a junior user is,by definition,not the first to ever use a mark,it may assert the exclusive right to use a mark in a particular area if the area was geographically remote from the senior user market at the time that the junior user appropriated the mark and if the junior user was acting in good faith at the time.
a use is geographically remote if the mark was used in an area where the senior user mark was not known such that there could be confusion as to source.best cellars,wine made simple,civ,wl,march,citing rectanus,at.with respect to the requirement,courts are divided on whether the junior user must establish a lack of actual knowledge that the mark was already in use,see mccarthy,supra,majority view,or merely that there was no intent to infringe,see id.a
