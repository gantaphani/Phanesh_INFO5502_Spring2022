in this action alleging breach of a hotel franchise agreement and federal trademark infringement,defendants heartland properties llc,david adams,and betty adams appeal the district court denial of motions,grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs la quinta corporation and baymont franchising llc,and the award of liquidated and treble damages to baymont.we affirm.
in,heartland properties llc and its guarantors,david and betty adams collectively referred to as heartland,entered into a franchise agreement with budgetel franchises international,the corporate predecessor to baymont franchising llc baymont,to operate a budgetel inn in shepherdsville,kentucky.baymont is a subsidiary of la quinta corporation la quinta 
the license agreement granted heartland a license to operate the shepherdsville inn using baymont unique internal operating system which included,inter alia,baymont trademarks,logos,reservation system,and other intellectual property.the agreement required heartland to maintain certain system standards for its facilities,technology,and service,and gave baymont the right to amend,modify,delete or enhance any portion of the system.heartland agreed to carry the costs for compliance with these standards,including any updates in computer hardware and software.
specifically,the license agreement provided that baymont would maintain a reservation system that in its sole discretion,it determines will best serve the system conversely,heartland agree d to participate in the reservation system and to bear telephone line connection charges,supply costs and other such expenses of meeting system standards and participating in the reservation system.in addition,heartland was obligated to pay monthly recurring fees to baymont.these fees included a royalty of five percent of heartland gross room revenues,as well as marketing and reservations assessments.
pursuant to section.b of the license agreement,baymont could terminate the franchise arrangement at any time if i licensee fails fully to remedy specified agreement breaches within days of baymont written notice vi licensee fails to pay its debts as they fall due or xi with good cause,for any other reason.in the event of heartland failure to operate under the system for any reason including,but not limited to,section.b termination for licensee uncured default,heartland agreed to pay liquidated damages to baymont in an amount equal to of the aggregate recurring fees which accrued with respect to inn operations during the immediately preceding full calendar months.heartland right to use the system and all trademarks,signage,logos,and equipment ended immediately when the license term expired or was terminated earlier for any reason.additionally,upon termination of the franchise,heartland shall promptly pay all sums then owed to baymont.
heartland possessed the right to terminate the agreement by giving at least months prior written notice to baymont,but only effective on the tenth anniversary of the opening date september,
in the fall of,baymont adopted a new system standard for computerized reservations known as the system,which necessitated the installation of updated computer hardware and software at its franchise hotels.the system was designed to improve the centralized reservation system and ensure the integration of all of baymont franchisees into the shared reservation system used by baymont affiliates,la quinta inn suites and la quinta inn.as part of the upgrade,baymont required its franchisees to sign a software license agreement pursuant to which franchisees payments for the acquisition,installation,and initial training on the system were amortized over a period of months,commencing upon installation of the new computer system.under the terms of the agreement,heartland was to pay a total of over the period for costs.however,if the license agreement expired or was terminated for any reason,heartland would be obligated to pay in full the remaining balance owed for the.system.
in october,the baymont inns franchise advisory council,consisting of representative baymont franchisees,approved the adoption of the system.in late,baymont shipped the components for the system to heartland,along with a copy of the agreement.in january,baymont conducted a series of conference calls and training sessions with its franchisees to ease the transition to the new computer program.the parties disagree about the extent of heartland participation in these events.in february,baymont attempted to work with heartland to bring it into conformance with the system,but installation was never completed because heartland allegedly refused to provide baymont with access to its facilities.it is undisputed that heartland neither signed the agreement nor made the system operational at its hotel.
consequently,on february,baymont sent a letter notifying heartland that it was in default under sections and of the license agreement due to its failure to execute the agreement and install the system.baymont ordered heartland to cure the default within thirty days,but heartland failed to do so.
heartland attributes its refusal to sign the agreement to baymont failure to address its concerns,purportedly shared by other franchisees,about conflicts between the terms of the original license agreement and the,the agreement effect on heartland option at the anniversary date under section.a of the license agreement.heartland also cites sloppy and disruptive installation of the computer infrastructure and related technical problems as factors in its decision not to sign the agreement or participate in the system.heartland claims that baymont terminated the license agreement before arrangements could be made for heartland representatives to attend any training seminars and before rescheduled work could be completed on the system.
on march,after unsuccessful attempts to resolve these controverted issues,baymont notified heartland by letter that its rights under the license agreement would be terminated effective april.
on may,heartland filed suit against la quinta in the kentucky state circuit court,alleging breach of the license agreement and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and seeking injunctive relief.la quinta removed the action to federal court,where it was ultimately consolidated with baymont separate action against heartland baymont complaint averred federal trademark infringement and false designation of sponsorship under the lanham act,and a,misappropriation of trade secrets,and breach of contract baymont also sought declaratory relief to prevent heartland continued use of baymont trademarks and intellectual property.
in february,with the stipulation of the parties,the district court entered a preliminary injunction against heartland,precluding further use of baymont name,trademarks,and system standards.discovery concluded on november,after an extension of the original discovery deadlines.an extended deadline for the filing of dispositive motions expired on january.on that date,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.in addition,heartland filed three motion to produce,a motion to compel,and a motion to reopen discovery.heartland maintained that the failure of baymont and la quinta to cooperate with discovery and to identify all of their employees with knowledge of the dispute justified reopening discovery.
in an order entered on march,the magistrate judge declined to reopen discovery and denied heartland three motions,citing heartland entirely unacceptable delays in the context of the current posture of the proceedings.over heartland objections,the district court affirmed the magistrate decision,and thereafter granted summary judgment on all claims in favor of la quinta and baymont,and denied heartland cross motion for summary judgment.
the district court dismissed la quinta from the action,finding that a s the claims devolve solely into an analysis of the rights and liabilities under the license agreement,la quinta was not a proper party to the action because it was not shown to be a party to the license agreement.with regard to baymont liability for breach of contract,the district court categorized the parties dispute over the status of negotiations and the completeness of hardware and software installation as immaterial in light of the undisputed fact that heartland failed to cure its default within the requisite period under the license agreement.the court explained 
heartland contends that baymont breached the license agreement because its requirement that heartland participate in and pay for the system hardware and software constituted an impermissible unilateral modification of the termination clause in the agreement.it argues that requiring it to sign the system license agreement with the amortization provision essentially locked franchisees into their franchise agreement until the system was paid off.heartland urges that this modified the termination clause because it would be required to pay any remaining balance for the unamortized portion of the system if it chose not to renew its franchise relationship with baymont at the end of the contract period.
section.a providing for termination by heartland on the tenth anniversary of the opening of its hotel remained unaltered by the adoption of the system and its attendant financial requirements.in accordance with its duties at and after termination,pursuant to section.f,heartland agreed in its license agreement to promptly pay all sums then owed to baymont.the unamortized portion of the system cost simply became one of the sums owed.heartland contention is merely that,because it was approaching its anniversary in,it would constitute an expensive if it chose to terminate its franchise relationship,and thus it was unfair.however,it can not and does not argue that the adoption of the system with its attendant costs was not anticipated and permitted by its agreement.similarly,heartland contention that baymont should have agreed to waive the unamortized portion of the cost is an argument without teeth inasmuch as baymont did precisely what it was permitted to do under the agreement,and was entitled to payment of all sums then owed upon termination of the agreement.
in sum,heartland sole defense to the claim for breach of the license agreement rests upon the assertion that baymont defaulted on the contract and caused heartland.as we reject the contention that baymont committed any breach of the agreement,we will grant summary judgment in favor of baymont on its claim of liability.
footnote omitted.the court also granted summary judgment in favor of baymont on its remaining claims against heartland and the adams.
in a separate order,the district court granted baymont motions for damages and attorney fees and awarded the following sums in unpaid recurring fees and accounts receivable that heartland owed to baymont under the license agreement at the time of termination,plus prejudgment interest at the rate of eight percent per annum in liquidated damages for early termination,as provided in section.a of the license agreement,plus prejudgment interest in treble damages for willful,unauthorized use of baymont intellectual property in violation of the lanham act and attorney fees pursuant to a in an amount to be established by further order of the court heartland now appeals.
heartland first argues that the district court improperly denied the three motions that it filed simultaneously with its summary judgment motion,nearly two months after the close of discovery.we disagree.
while i t is that the plaintiff must receive a full opportunity to conduct discovery to be able to successfully defeat a motion for summary judgment,a district court decision denying further discovery is generally unreviewable unless the appellant has filed a rule f affidavit or a motion that gives the district court a chance to rule on the need for additional discovery.ball union carbide,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
we review the district court decision precluding additional time for discovery for an abuse of discretion.audi ag,cir citing plott motors,cir.factors that should be considered include when the moving party learned of the issue that is the subject of discovery,how the discovery would affect the ruling below,the length of the discovery period,whether the moving party was dilatory,and whether the adverse party was responsive to prior discovery requests.audi ag,at.it is not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny the discovery request when the party makes only general and conclusory statements regarding the need for more discovery and does not show how an extension of time would have allowed information related to the truth or falsity of the document to be discovered.ball,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the multiple reasons provided by the magistrate judge and district court for the denial of heartland motions are well founded and need no further reiteration.heartland not only failed to comply with the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure f,see generally singleton united states,cir,cacevic city of hazel park,cir,but also failed to adequately explain to the court its inability to obtain discovery in a timely fashion or the need to depose more individuals and obtain certain documents,including baymont privilege log and information concerning how other franchisees were treated,six weeks after the close of an discovery period.heartland was not,as it claims,prematurely foreclosed from conducting discovery it was simply dilatory in its discovery requests.
as the magistrate judge aptly observed,heartland own discovery conduct was not unblemished,and the relief requested by the discovery motions was not reconcilable with heartland position on summary no genuine issues of material fact preclude entry of a judgment in its favor on all claims.thus,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court decision denying heartland belated discovery motions.
heartland next argues that the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of baymont on its breach of contract counterclaim should be reversed.we conduct de novo review of a district court summary judgment determination.med.mut.of ohio amalia enter,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if,taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.a genuine issue of material fact exists when there is sufficient evidence for a trier of fact to find for the party.ciminillo streicher,cir.a mere scintilla of evidence,however,is not enough for the party to withstand summary judgment.id.we review cross motions for summary judgment under this standard as well,evaluating each motion on its own merits.beck city of cleveland,cir.
heartland contends that the agreement effected significant changes and imposed additional demands on franchisees such as itself,beyond those contained in the license agreement.because these material changes were imposed without its written consent,heartland asserts that baymont anticipatorily breached the license agreement,thereby excusing further performance on heartland part.heartland focuses on several discrete provisions in the agreement the amortization period,the forum selection clause,a disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability pertaining to the software,and baymont right to disable the software should the franchisee be in default.

heartland renews its primary argument,made to the district court,that the agreement imposed a penalty on its right to terminate the franchise under section.a of the license agreement,because if it opted not to renew its contract on the tenth anniversary of its opening date,but before the amortization period ended,it would have to pay the remainder of the balance it owed for the system and thus would be charged for a reservation system that it was no longer using.
we agree with the district court,however,that baymont implementation of the system with its attendant costs was fully contemplated and permitted under the unambiguous terms of the license agreement.sections.a and.d of the license agreement expressly gave baymont the right to add,amend,delete system standards,including the reservation system,and required heartland to participate in and bear such costs 
standards standards of quality and service associated with the system collectively,system standards shall at all times be subject to baymont supervision and control licensee agrees,at its sole expense to comply with all such system standards,and system manuals and policy statements.without limiting the foregoing 
changes.baymont shall have the right,from time to time to add,amend delete system standards,including without limitation for iv inn technology including for computer hardware and software for various applications,such as rooms management,records maintenance,accounting,and budgeting and v reservation system participation including for the purchase or lease and maintenance of terminal and telephone equipment and service,and related computer hardware and software.baymont may,in its sole discretion,permit deviations from system standards,based on local conditions baymont assessment of special circumstances.
reservation system.baymont shall maintain a reservation system with a distinctive national telephone access number for making reservations at system inns,such technological substitute s supplements as baymont,in its sole discretion,determines will best serve the system.licensee agrees to participate in the reservation system and shall bear supply costs and other such expenses of meeting system standards and participating in the reservation system.
emphasis added.section.a of the license agreement allowed baymont to,
by adoption or amendment of its systems manuals policy statements,amend,modify,delete or enhance any portion of the system,including any of the marks,system standards and the prototype package,as may be desirable,in the sole judgment of baymont,to maintain or enhance the reputation of the system or improve system license marketability.
consistent with these provisions,baymont had the right to institute changes to its reservation system and require heartland to conform to this new system standard at its sole expense.indeed,david adams admitted so during his deposition,conceding that under the terms of the license agreement,baymont had the right to charge heartland for upgrades to the reservation system.
moreover,the license agreement stated that if it was terminated for any reason,termination by heartland under section.a,heartland was required to promptly pay all sums then owed to baymont.there is no inherent inconsistency,then,between the two agreements rather,as the district court correctly determined,in the event the license agreement was terminated,t he unamortized portion of the system cost simply became one of the sums owed.heartland argument that the payment provisions of the agreement materially altered the license agreement so as to penalize heartland termination rights does not withstand scrutiny.
other courts,in similar circumstances,have upheld the right of franchisors to make changes to their systems,sometimes at the expense of the franchisee,if authorized under the franchise agreement.for instance,in trail burger king,burger king of miami,so d,the florida third district court of appeal held,in the context of a declaratory judgment action,that a chain restaurant corporation could change certain standards,including an increase in the quantity of meat used to make hamburgers 
the plaintiff argues that any changes in standards and specifications in the operation of its restaurant from those in existence at the time of the execution of the agreement would be a modification or amendment thereto.it is also argued that since the agreement provides for modification and amendment only by the written consent of both parties,the chancellor erred in allowing the defendant to make reasonable changes from time to time as circumstances may dictate.
we have found that the chancellor was correct in determining that such changes are not modifications or amendments to the agreement,but were provided for in the agreement.it is clear from the language of the instrument that one of the objects is to provide uniformity among all franchised restaurants.a review of the clauses of the agreement summarized above reveals that this uniformity is accomplished by providing that the defendant set and maintain standards and specifications which the plaintiff must follow or suffer termination of the agreement.the chancellor has interpreted the agreement in accordance with the natural and ordinary meaning of the language employed.

in sum,we reject heartland assertion that baymont breached the license agreement through its implementation of the system and insistence that heartland adopt its new reservation system.baymont did not breach the license agreement,but heartland did when it failed to comply with its contractual obligation to adopt new system standards.the district court therefore did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of baymont,and denying heartland motion,regarding the parties respective breach of contract claims 
in light of this determination,heartland claims against baymont for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and la quinta for intentional interference with a contractual relationship necessarily fail.heartland has not shown that baymont engaged in any overt acts or inaction that might be deemed bad faith conduct.see foseid state bank of cross plains.in fact,
where the contracting party complains of acts of the other party that are specifically authorized in their agreement,we can not see how there can be any breach of good faith and fair dealing.indeed,it would be a contradiction in terms to characterize an act contemplated by the plain language of the parties contract as a bad faith breach of that contract.

with respect to la quinta role in this matter,heartland argues that la quinta was the party behind the actions to force heartland to sign the agreement.we agree with the district court,however,that t o the extent that heartland contends that la quinta interfered with its ability to perform under the agreement,it contends,at the same time,that its acts were the acts of quinta.it does so to assert that their acts in connection with the system constituted a breach of the licensing agreement.as we have determined that baymont actions in implementing the system were authorized under the license agreement,heartland has failed to establish that la quinta interfered with its franchise relationship with baymont.
the district court awarded baymont in liquidated damages,using the following formula set forth in section.a of the license agreement 
i f the inn ceases to be operated under the system for any reason including,but not limited to,section.b termination for licensee uncured default,licensee shall pay baymont within days following the effectiveness of such event,as liquidated damages to compensate baymont for lost revenues in an amount difficult to ascertain,and not as a penalty an amount equal to of the aggregate recurring fees which accrued with respect to inn operations during the immediately preceding full calendar months 
section of the license agreement provides that section.a does not apply if the licensee terminates the license term pursuant to section.a,the option at the anniversary of opening,which requires months prior written notice to baymont.
as in the proceedings below,heartland does not dispute the calculation that in liquidated damages was due under this formula.heartland instead argues that the award is unreasonable because a shortened period of loss should have been used as the basis for the liquidated damages award.it reasons that because it had the right to terminate the license agreement on september,and purportedly provided the requisite advance notice of,baymont maximum loss of royalties should be limited to the period of march,to september,or eighteen months.
under wisconsin law,liquidated damages provided for in a contract must be reasonable.wassenaar panos.stat.ann.states 
damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach,the difficulties of proof of loss,and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.a term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.
in determining reasonableness,a court must inquire into all relevant circumstances,wassenaar,at,and consider three factors whether the parties intended to provide damages or for a penalty whether the injury caused by the breach would be difficult or incapable of accurate estimation at the time of entering into the contract and whether the stipulated damages are a reasonable forecast of the harm caused by the breach.id.at see rainbow country rentals retail,ameritech publ g.if the damages provided for in the contract are grossly disproportionate to the actual harm sustained,the courts usually conclude that the parties original expectations were unreasonable.wassenaar,at footnote omitted.the wisconsin courts employ the approach in determining the reasonableness of the stipulated damages clauses and look at the harm anticipated at the time of contract formation and the actual harm at the time of breach or trial.id.the party challenging the contractual provision stipulating damages has the burden of proving facts which would justify of the liquidated damages clause.id.at.
after reviewing the particular circumstances of the present case,we conclude that the district court award of liquidated damages was reasonable.baymont submitted concrete evidence that its lost royalties over the entire remaining term of the license agreement would have exceeded.actual damages,in the context of the hospitality industry,are difficult to quantify and not strictly monetary a franchise operation yields not only future royalties,but additional intangibles such as brand recognition and loyalty,and a competitive presence in a geographic region.the full term of heartland license agreement was twenty years.thus,baymont conceivably could have had a presence in the shepherdsville market through,but lost these benefits through heartland breach.
the formula,based on recurring fees that actually accrued,was at the time of contracting not an arbitrary calculation,but a reasonable forecast of the damages baymont would sustain in the event of heartland breach.see wassenaar,at.the formula was based on common business practices and the parties recent historical performance under the license agreement,resulting in ascertainable losses in the event of breach.id.
in travelodge hotels,elkins motel,no.civ.whw,wl,unpublished,the united states district court for the district of new jersey upheld as reasonable a similar liquidated damages clause in a hotel franchise agreement,taking into account the economic complexities of the market 
the liquidated damages clause in this case is contained in section of the license agreement,and reads that liquidated damages shall total 
an amount equal to the sum of accrued royalties and system assessment fees during the immediately preceding full calendar months liquidated damages will not be less than the product of multiplied by the number of guest rooms in the facility.
section of the addendum specifically set liquidated damages at an amount equal to the product of multiplied by the number of guest rooms in the facility.thi the contends that this represents a negotiated reduction on liquidated damages from the formula set forth in section of the license agreement.
according to thi,the language of the liquidated damages clause demonstrates the parties clear intent to choose among the available remedies rather than to set an arbitrary number having no bearing on the contractual relationship.thi also points out the inherent difficulty of calculating its lost earnings under the license agreement,as it is dependent upon a percentage of monthly gross room revenues.the room revenues,in turn,are dependent upon the number of bookings in a given month,which can fluctuate drastically from month to month.
thi bargained with the franchisees to receive income over the period of the license agreement,and has lost the benefit of its bargain due to the defendants breach.defendants ha ve not offered proof of any contractually acceptable excuses to avoid the application of the liquidated damages clause.

like the franchisee in travelodge hotels,heartland has not proffered any contractually acceptable excuses to avoid the liquidated damages award.id.heartland argument favoring a shortened period of loss is based on the fallacy that it terminated the license agreement on september,and provided the requisite advance notice,so as to be excepted from the license agreement liquidated damages provision contained in section.it did not.baymont terminated the license agreement on march,because heartland was in noncompliance.moreover,as the district court observed,the record is devoid of any evidence supporting heartland claim that it gave baymont advance notice of its option not to renew the agreement.under the circumstances,the district court award of in liquidated damages was eminently reasonable.
lastly,heartland argues that the district court award of treble damages for its lanham act violations constitutes an impermissible penalty under the statute,which authorizes the trebling of damages for willful trademark infringement,but admonishes that such an award shall constitute compensation and not a penalty.a 
the district court awarded baymont in treble damages for heartland willful and unauthorized use of baymont intellectual property and marks during the holdover period from april,to april.this award was derived from the parties agreement that the appropriate measure of damages under the lanham act was the royalties,as defined in section.a of the license agreement that baymont would have received from heartland the district court accepted heartland computation of royalties,a lesser amount than proposed by baymont,and trebled the sum inasmuch as it appears clear that the defendants holdover was willful and unjustified.

in the present case,the record demonstrates that,despite the express language in section of the license agreement prohibiting the use of baymont marks after termination of the agreement,and notification to this effect from baymont in its march,notice of termination,heartland continued to use and display baymont marks in advertising and on its internet page,and even to advertise its new water park,without paying royalties,until the end of april year after the termination and two months after the district court entered the preliminary injunction ordering it to cease.thus,there is no question that heartland acted in deliberate defiance of the license agreement.
further,in accepting heartland computation of royalties as the basis for the lanham act damages award,the district court excluded royalties on heartland revenues from movies and pool charges,even though heartland previously had remitted such royalties to baymont.baymont likewise received no royalties on heartland income from its new water park or restaurant,even though heartland admittedly used baymont trademarks to advertise these attractions.because of heartland infringement,baymont lost the ability to control its brand image and reputation and was prevented from operating in the shepherdsville intangible,but valuable,lost assets.

moreover,contrary to heartland claim,the award of both liquidated damages for breach of contract and treble damages for trademark infringement does not contravene the language of a and necessarily make the statutory damages duplicative or punitive.the eleventh circuit addressed and properly rejected this argument in ramada inns,
the franchisees contend that the district court erred in awarding ramada inns damages under both the liquidated damages clause of the franchise agreement and under the lanham act.the franchisees point out that the purpose of including the liquidated damages in the agreement was to compensate ramada inns for lost franchise fees and expenditures to attract a new franchisee for a period of two years after breach of the franchise agreement.because some of the trademark infringement award was based upon the same items considered for liquidated damages,the franchisees claim that ramada inns received a double recovery for a single injury.
first,we note that ramada inns observation that damages were awarded for two sets of wrongs is as irrefutable as the franchisees contention that the damage awards included common elements.liquidated damages were awarded because the partners breached the franchise agreement trademark infringement damages were awarded because they held over for six months after the agreement was term
