in this unfair competition case,we consider whether the lanham act permits the owner of a foreign trademark and its sister company to pursue false association,false advertising,and trademark cancellation claims against the owner of the same mark in the united states.bayer consumer care ag bcc owns the trademark flanax in mexico and has sold naproxen sodium pain relievers under that mark in mexico and other parts of latin america since the.belmora llc owns the flanax trademark in the united states and has used it here since in the sale of its naproxen sodium pain relievers.bcc and its sister company bayer healthcare llc bhc,and collectively with bcc,bayer contend that belmora used the flanax mark to deliberately deceive mexican american consumers into thinking they were purchasing bcc product.
bcc successfully petitioned the trademark trial and appeal board ttab to cancel belmora registration for the flanax mark based on deceptive use.belmora appealed the ttab decision to the district court.in the meantime,bcc filed a separate complaint for false association against belmora under of the lanham act,and in conjunction with bhc,a claim for false advertising.after the two cases were consolidated,the district court reversed the ttab cancellation order and dismissed the false association and false advertising claims.
bayer appeals those decisions.for the reasons outlined below,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
this appeal comes to us following the district court grant of belmora federal rule of civil procedure b motion to dismiss bayer complaint and belmora rule c motion for judgment on the pleadings on the trademark cancellation claim.in both circumstances,we assume all facts to be true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of bayer as the plaintiff.cooksey futrell,cir 
a.the flanax mark 
bcc registered the trademark flanax in mexico for pharmaceutical products,analgesics,and.it has sold naproxen sodium tablets under the flanax brand in mexico since.flanax sales by bcc have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars,with a portion of the sales occurring in mexican cities near the united states border.bcc flanax brand is in mexico and other latin american countries,as well as to mexican americans and other hispanics in the united states,but bcc has never marketed or sold its flanax in the united states.instead,bcc sister company,bhc,sells naproxen sodium pain relievers under the brand aleve in the united states market.
belmora llc began selling naproxen sodium tablets in the united states as flanax in.the following year,belmora registered the flanax mark in the united states.belmora early flanax packaging below,left closely mimicked bcc mexican flanax packaging right,displaying a similar color scheme,font size,and typeface.
belmora later modified its packaging below,but the color scheme,font size,and typeface remain similar to that of bcc flanax packaging.
in addition to using similar packaging,belmora made statements implying that its flanax brand was the same flanax product sold by bcc in mexico.for example,belmora circulated a brochure to prospective distributors that stated,
for generations,flanax has been a brand that latinos have turned to for various common ailments.now you too can profit from this highly recognized topselling brand among latinos.flanax is now made in the and continues to show record sales growth everywhere it is sold.flanax acts as a powerful attraction for latinos by providing them with products they know,trust and prefer.
belmora also employed telemarketers and provided them with a script containing similar statements.this sales script stated that belmora was the direct producers of flanax in the us and that flanax is a very well known medical product in the latino american market,for flanax is sold successfully in mexico.id.belmora sell sheet,used to solicit orders from retailers,likewise claimed that flanax products have been used for many,many years in mexico and are now being produced in the united states by belmora llc.id.
bayer points to evidence that these and similar materials resulted in belmora distributors,vendors,and marketers believing that its flanax was the same as or affiliated with bcc flanax.for instance,belmora received questions regarding whether it was legal for flanax to have been imported from mexico.and an investigation of stores selling belmora flanax identified at least purchasers who believed that the flanax products were the same as,or affiliated with,the flanax products they knew from mexico.
proceedings below 
in,bcc petitioned the ttab to cancel belmora registration for the flanax mark,arguing that belmora use and registration of the flanax mark violated article of the paris convention as made applicable by sections b and h of the lanham act.bcc also sought cancellation of belmora registration under of the lanham act because belmora had used the flanax mark to misrepresent the source of the goods on which the mark is used.see also lanham act.
the ttab dismissed bcc article claim,concluding that article is not and that of the lanham act did not provide an independent basis for cancellation.however,the ttab allowed bayer claim to proceed.in,after discovery and a hearing,the ttab ordered cancellation of belmora flanax registration,concluding that belmora had misrepresented the source of the flanax goods and that the facts d id not present a close case.the ttab noted that belmora knew the favorable reputation of bayer flanax product,copied bayer packaging,and repeatedly invoked that reputation when marketing its product in the united states.
shortly after the ttab ruling,bayer filed suit in the southern district of california,alleging that bcc was injured by belmora false association with its flanax product in violation of lanham act a a,and bcc and bhc were both injured by belmora false advertising of flanax under a b.the complaint also alleged three claims under california state law.
belmora meanwhile appealed the ttab cancellation order and elected to proceed with the appeal as a civil action in the eastern district of virginia it argued that the ttab erred in concluding that bayer had standing a cause of action under and in finding that belmora had misrepresented the source of its goods.belmora also sought a declaration that its actions had not violated the false association and false advertising provisions of lanham act a,as bayer had alleged in the california district court proceeding.bayer filed a counterclaim challenging the ttab dismissal of its paris convention treaty claims.
the california case was transferred to the eastern district of virginia and consolidated with belmora pending action.belmora then moved the district court to dismiss bayer a claims under rule b and for judgment on the pleadings under rule c on the claim.on february,after two hearings,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order ruling in favor of belmora across the board.
the district court acknowledged that belmora flanax has a similar trade dress to bayer flanax and is marketed in such a way that capitalizes on the goodwill of bayer flanax.it nonetheless distilled the case into one single question 
does the lanham act allow the owner of a foreign mark that is not registered in the united states and further has never used the mark in united states commerce to assert priority rights over a mark that is registered in the united states by another party and used in united states commerce 
the district court concluded that t he answer is no based on its reading of the supreme court decision in lexmark international,static control components.accordingly,the district court dismissed bayer false association and false advertising claims for lack of standing.at the same time,it reversed the ttab cancellation order.
bayer filed a timely notice of appeal,and we have jurisdiction under.the patent and trademark office uspto intervened to defend the ttab decision to cancel belmora registration and to argue that the lanham act conforms to the united states commitments in article of the paris convention

false association and false advertising under section a 
the district court dismissed bayer false and false advertising claims because,in its view,the claims failed to satisfy the standards set forth by the supreme court in lexmark.at the core of the district court decision was its conclusion that bayer claims fell outside the lanham act zone of interests and are not cognizable because bayer does not possess a protectable interest in the flanax mark in the united states,and that a cognizable economic loss under the lanham act can not exist as to a mark that was not used in united states commerce.
on appeal,bayer contends these conclusions are erroneous as a matter of law because they conflict with the plain language of a and misread lexmark.
while much of the lanham act addresses the registration,use,and infringement of trademarks and related marks,a goes beyond trademark protection.dastar twentieth century fox film.written in terms of the putative defendant conduct,a sets forth unfair competition causes of action for false association and false advertising 
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,or any container for goods,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which 
a false association is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,connection,or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person,or 
b false advertising in commercial advertising or promotion,misrepresents the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of his or her or another person goods,services,or commercial activities,
shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
lanham act a,a.subsection a,which creates liability for statements as to affiliation,connection,or association of goods,describes the cause of action known as false association.subsection b,which creates liability for misrepresent ing the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of goods,defines the cause of action for false advertising.
significantly,the plain language of a does not require that a plaintiff possess or have used a trademark in commerce as an element of the cause of action.section a stands in sharp contrast to lanham act,which is titled as and expressly addresses infringement.requiring for liability the use in commerce of any reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of a registered mark emphasis added.under a,it is the defendant use in commerce whether of an offending word,term,name,symbol,or device or of a false or misleading description or representation of fact that creates the injury under the terms of the statute.and here the alleged offending word,term,name,symbol,or device is belmora flanax mark.
what a does require is that bayer was likely to be damaged by belmora use in commerce of its flanax mark and related advertisements.the supreme court recently considered the breadth of this likely to be damaged language in lexmark,a false advertising case arising from a dispute in the market.at.the lower courts in lexmark had analyzed the case in terms of prudential standing that is,on grounds that are prudential rather than constitutional.id.at.the supreme court,however,observed that the real question in lexmark was whether static control has a cause of action under the statute.id.at.this query,in turn,hinged on a straightforward question of statutory interpretation to which it applied traditional principles of interpretation.id.at.as a threshold matter,the supreme court noted that courts must be careful not to import requirements into this analysis that congress has not included in the statute 
we do not ask whether in our judgment congress should have authorized static control suit,but whether congress in fact did so.just as a court can not apply its independent policy judgment to recognize a cause of action that congress has denied,it can not limit a cause of action that congress has created merely because prudence dictates.
id.the court concluded that a broad authorization permitting suit by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged should not be taken literally to reach the limits of article iii standing,but is framed by two background principles,which may overlap.id.
first,a plaintiff claim must fall within the zone of interests protected by the statute.id.the scope of the zone of interests is not especially demanding,and the plaintiff receives the benefit of any doubt.id.at.because the lanham act contains an unusual,and extraordinarily helpful purpose statement in,identifying the statute zone of interests requires no guesswork.id.section provides 
the intent of this chapter is to regulate commerce within the control of congress by making actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks in such commerce to protect registered marks used in such commerce from interference by state,or territorial legislation to protect persons engaged in such commerce against unfair competition to prevent fraud and deception in such commerce by the use of reproductions,copies,counterfeits,or colorable imitations of registered marks and to provide rights and remedies stipulated by treaties and conventions respecting trademarks,trade names,and unfair competition entered into between the united states and foreign nations.
lanham act,
the supreme court observed that m ost of the enumerated purposes are relevant to a case,while a typical case will implicate only the act goal of protecting persons engaged in commerce within the control of congress against unfair competition.lexmark.at.the court concluded that to come within the zone of interests in a suit for false advertising under a,a plaintiff must allege an injury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales.id.at.
the second lexmark background principle is that a statutory cause of action is limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the statute.id.the injury must have a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute prohibits.id.in the a context,this means show ing economic or reputational injury flowing directly from the deception wrought by the defendant advertising and that that occurs when deception of consumers causes them to withhold trade from the plaintiff.id.at.
the primary lesson from lexmark is clear courts must interpret the lanham act according to what the statute says.to determine whether a plaintiff,falls within the class of plaintiffs whom congress has authorized to sue,we apply traditional principles of statutory interpretation.id.at.the outcome will rise and fall on the meaning of the congressionally enacted provision creating a cause of action.id.at.
we now turn to apply these principles to the case before us.
we first address the position,pressed by belmora and adopted by the district court,that a plaintiff must have initially used its own mark in commerce within the united states as a condition precedent to a a claim.in dismissing bcc a claims,the district court found dispositive that bayer failed to plead facts showing that it used the flanax mark in commerce in the united states.upon that ground,the district court held that bayer does not possess a protectable interest in the flanax mark.id.
as noted earlier,such a requirement is absent from a plain language and its application in lexmark.under the statute,the defendant must have use d in commerce the offending word,term,name,or symbol,but the plaintiff need only believe that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.lanham act a,a.
it is important to emphasize that this is an unfair competition case,not a trademark infringement case.belmora and the district court conflated the lanham act infringement provision in which authorizes suit only by the registrant,and thereby requires the plaintiff to have used its own mark in commerce with unfair competition claims pled in this case under a.section makes clear that congress knew how to write a precondition of trademark possession and use into a lanham act cause of action when it chose to do so.it has not done so in a.see russello.united states,w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.
given that lexmark advises courts to adhere to the statutory language,apply ing traditional principles of statutory interpretation,lexmark.at,we lack authority to introduce a requirement into a that congress plainly omitted.nothing in lexmark can be read to suggest that a claims have an unstated requirement that the plaintiff have first used its own mark word,term,name,symbol,or device in commerce before a cause of action will lie against a defendant who is breaching the statute.
the district court thus erred in requiring bayer,as the plaintiff,to have pled its prior use of its own mark in commerce when it is the defendant use of a mark or misrepresentation that underlies the a unfair competition cause of action.having made this foundational error,the district court resolution of the issues requires reversal 
admittedly,some of our prior cases appear to have treated a plaintiff use of a mark in united states commerce as a prerequisite for a false association claim.see lamparello falwell,cir both infringement under and false designation of origin under a have the same five elements.people for the ethical treatment of animals doughney,cir same int l bancorp,t he tests for trademark infringement and unfair competition are identical.lone star steakhouse saloon alpha of,cir t o prevail under and a of the lanham act for trademark infringement and unfair competition,respectively,a complainant must demonstrate that it has a valid,protectible trademark.however,none of these cases made that consideration the ratio decidendi of its holding or analyzed whether the statute in fact contains such a requirement.see,thomas mccarthy,trademarks and unfair competition ed observing that international bancorp merely assumed that to trigger lanham act a,the plaintiff mark must be used in commerce.moreover,all of these cases predate lexmark,which provides the applicable supreme court precedent interpreting a.see dep t of health human servs.fed.labor relations,cir a decision by a panel of this court,or by the court sitting en banc,does not bind subsequent panels if the decision rests on authority that subsequently proves untenable.
although the plaintiffs use of a mark in commerce was a fact in common in the foregoing cases,substantial precedent reflects that a unfair competition claims come within the statute protectable zone of interests without the preconditions adopted by the district court and advanced by belmora.as the supreme court has pointed out,a goes beyond trademark protection.dastar,at.for example,a plaintiff whose mark has become generic and therefore not protectable may plead an unfair competition claim against a competitor that uses that generic name and fail s adequately to identify itself as distinct from the first organization such that the name causes confusion or a likelihood of confusion.blinded veterans ass blinded am.veterans,see also kellogg biscuit,requiring the defendant to use reasonable care to inform the public of the source of its product even though the plaintiff shredded wheat mark was generic and therefore unprotectable singer june,same,for singer sewing machines.
likewise,in a reverse passing off case,the plaintiff need not have used a mark in commerce to bring a a action a plaintiff must prove four elements that the work at issue originated with the plaintiff that origin of the work was falsely designated by the defendant that the false designation of origin was likely to cause consumer confusion and that the plaintiff was harmed by the defendant false designation of origin.universal furniture int l,collezione europa usa,cir.thus,the plaintiff in a reverse passing off case must plead and prove only that the work originated with him not that he used the work which may or may not be associated with a mark in commerce.id.
the generic mark and reverse passing off cases illustrate that a actions do not require,implicitly or otherwise,that a plaintiff have first used its own mark in united states commerce.if such a use were a condition precedent to bringing a a action,the generic mark and reverse passing off cases could not exist.
in sum,the lanham act plain language contains no unstated requirement that a a plaintiff have used a trademark in u.commerce to bring a lanham act unfair competition claim.the supreme court guidance in lexmark does not allude to one,and our prior cases either only assumed or articulated as dicta that such a requirement existed.thus,the district court erred in imposing such a condition precedent upon bayer claims 
as bayer is not barred from making a a claim,the proper lexmark inquiry is twofold.did the alleged acts of unfair competition fall within the lanham act protected zone of interests and if so,did bayer plead proximate causation of a cognizable injury we examine the false association and false advertising claims in turn.
as to the zone of interests,lexmark advises that m ost of the lanham act enumerated purposes are relevant to cases.at.one such enumerated purpose is making actionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks in commerce within the control of congress.lanham act,see also two pesos,taco cabana,stevens,concurring trademark law protects the public by making consumers confident that they can identify brands they prefer and can purchase those brands without being confused or misled.as pled,bcc false association claim advances that purpose.
the complaint alleges belmora misleading association with bcc flanax has caused bcc customers to buy the belmora flanax in the united states instead of purchasing bcc flanax in mexico.for example,the complaint alleges that bcc invested heavily in promoting its flanax to mexican citizens or mexican americans in border areas those consumers cross into the united states and may purchase belmora flanax here before returning to mexico.and mexican americans may forego purchasing the flanax they know when they cross the border to visit mexico because belmora alleged deception led them to purchase the belmora product in the united states.
in either circumstance,bcc loses sales revenue because belmora deceptive and misleading use of flanax conveys to consumers a false association with bcc product.further,by also deceiving distributors and vendors,belmora makes its flanax more available to consumers,which would exacerbate bcc losses.see stating in a brochure for distributors that flanax is now made in the and acts as a powerful attraction for latinos noting a distributor concern that the product is legal to sell in the us.in each scenario,the economic activity would be within the control of congress to regulate.lanham act.
we thus conclude that bcc has adequately pled a a false association claim for purposes of the zone of interests prong.its allegations reflect the claim furthers the purpose of preventing the deceptive and misleading use of marks in commerce within the control of congress.
turning to lexmark second prong,proximate cause,bcc has also alleged injuries that are proximately caused by belmora violations of the false association statute.at.the complaint can fairly be read to allege economic or reputational injury flowing directly from the deception wrought by the defendant conduct.id.at.as previously noted,bcc alleges substantial sales in ma
