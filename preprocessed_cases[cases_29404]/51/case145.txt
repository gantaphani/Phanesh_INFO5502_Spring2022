retail services,and freebie,collectively rsi brought this action for declaratory relief against freebies publishing,eugene zannon,and gail zannon collectively defendants seeking an order declaring that rsi use of the domain name did not violate the anticybersquatting consumer protection act,see d west supp,that rsi use of the term freebie in its domain name did not infringe upon defendants registered freebies trademark under the lanham act,see west supp,and that the term freebies is generic and therefore not protectable as a trademark.in response,defendants filed a counterclaim under the lanham act based on rsi use of the word freebie in its domain name,asserting claims for trademark infringement and cybersquatting.additionally,defendants included lanham act claims for unfair competition and trademark dilution.see a,c west supp.defendants also alleged that rsi domain name violated section of the virginia code.
the district court concluded that the word freebies is generic and not registrable as a federal trademark.without a valid trademark before it,the court then awarded summary judgment to rsi on all claims and counterclaims.the district court also addressed sua sponte rsi claim for attorneys fees and costs that rsi raised in its complaint but did not pursue as part of its summary judgment motion.finding that defendants harbored no fraudulent intent or bad faith in asserting the counterclaims and that no exceptional circumstances otherwise existed,the district court denied rsi claim for attorneys fees.a west supp.
defendants appeal the district court grant of summary judgment on a number of grounds,focusing mainly on the argument that there was a genuine factual dispute over the generic nature of the term freebies a factual dispute created,if nothing else,by the certificate of registration issued to defendants by the patent and trademark office pto for the freebies trademark.
rsi cross appeals the sua sponte denial of attorneys fees and costs.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the decision of the district court in toto.
before we recount the facts of this case,a brief discussion of the legal context in which the facts arise is helpful.trademarks identify and distinguish goods produced by one person from those manufactured or sold by others and indicate the source of the goods.west supp.to the purchasing public,a trademark signif ies that all goods bearing the trademark originated from the same source and that all goods bearing the trademark are of an equal level of quality.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed hereinafter mccarthy.because of its role in assuring consumers of the origin and quality of the associated goods,a trademark is also a prime instrument in advertising and selling the goods.id.
thus,a proposed mark can not acquire trademark protection unless the mark is distinctive,that is,unless it serves the traditional trademark functions of distinguishing the applicant goods from those of others and identifying the source of the goods.two pesos,taco cabana,d see west.the antithesis of a distinctive mark is a generic mark which merely employs the common name of a product or service,sara lee,cir,or refers to the genus of which the particular product is a species,park n fly,dollar park fly,d.because a generic mark,by definition,neither signifies the source of goods nor distinguishes the particular product from other products on the market,a generic term can not be protected as a trademark nor registered as one.see two pesos,at.sara lee,at larsen terk techs,cir noting that generic marks are accorded no protection at all.the concepts of generic name and trademark are mutually exclusive because a generic term can never function as a mark to identify and distinguish the products of only one seller.mccarthy at.from a policy standpoint,of course,if a business were permitted to appropriate a generic word as its trademark,it would be difficult for competitors to market their own brands of the same product.imagine being forbidden to describe a chevrolet as a car or an automobile because ford or chrysler or volvo had trademarked these generic words.blau plumbing,cir.
whether trademark protection extends to a proposed mark is tied to the mark distinctiveness.see sara lee,at.in determining the distinctiveness of a given mark,courts use a categorical approach,placing the mark in one of four classifications that increase in distinctiveness as follows generic,descriptive,suggestive,and arbitrary or fanciful.see pizzeria uno temple,cir.on the opposite end of the spectrum from the generic category are marks that are fanciful or distinctive marks.fanciful marks are,for the most part,nonsense words expressly coined for serving as a trademark.sara lee,at offering clorox,kodak,polaroid,and exxon as examples.arbitrary marks consist of recognizable words used in connection with products for which they do not suggest or describe any quality,ingredient,or characteristic,as if the trademark was arbitrarily assigned.id.citing camel cigarettes and apple computers as examples.
between the generic and the arbitrary or fanciful categories are descriptive marks and suggestive marks,which are often difficult to distinguish from each other.descriptive marks merely describe a function,use,characteristic,size,or intended purpose of the product.id.mentioning after tan lotion and minute glue.descriptive marks are not inherently distinctive the lanham act accord s protection only if they have acquired a secondary meaning.larsen,at see e registration may be refused if the proposed mark,when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant,is merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them.saying that a trademark has acquired secondary meaning is shorthand for saying that a descriptive mark has become sufficiently distinctive to establish a mental association in buyers minds between the alleged mark and a single source of the product.mccarthy at see two pesos,at.this acquired distinctiveness necessary for a descriptive mark to be protected is generally called secondary meaning.sara lee,at explaining that secondary meaning exists when,in the minds of the public,the primary significance of a product feature or term is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself internal quotation marks omitted.
in contrast to descriptive marks,suggestive marks are inherently distinctive and,like arbitrary or fanciful marks,qualify for registration without any showing of secondary meaning.see pizzeria uno,at.a mark is suggestive if it connote s,without describing,some quality,ingredient,or characteristic of the product.sara lee,at providing the following examples coppertone,orange crush,and playboy.a helpful rule of thumb is that if the mark imparts information directly,it is descriptive,but i f it stands for an idea which requires some operation of the imagination to connect it with the goods,it is suggestive.pizzeria uno,at quoting union carbide,cir.
with these concepts in mind,we consider the facts.
in,the zannons purchased the right to publish freebies magazine,a periodical providing information about free offerings.the zannons also acquired ownership rights to the stylized trademark freebies,which the previous publisher registered in to use as a logo for the magazine.apparently,the zannons abandoned this particular mark for a period of time beginning in june however,in march,the zannons filed an application,on behalf of freebies publishing,with the pto for a new certificate of registration for a different rendition of the stylized freebies mark.although the pto eventually issued a certificate of registration for the mark,the application process was not without difficulty.the pto examining attorney initially refused the application because,among other reasons,the proposed mark merely describes the goods t he mark describes the subject matter of applicant publication.freebies publishing submitted a response but was unable to convince the pto that the proposed freebies trademark was suggestive rather than merely descriptive.
in december,having received no evidence demonstrating that defendants mark had acquired secondary meaning,the pto finalized its refusal of registration.this refusal was withdrawn,however,after eugene zannon filed an affidavit under b,which allows the pto to accept as evidence of distinctiveness a declaration that the proposed mark has been in substantially exclusive and continuous use in commerce by the applicant for five years.thus,the freebies mark was finally registered on november,for use in connection with periodicals namely,magazines and newspapers with information about mail order offerings.
defendants continued publishing freebies magazine until march.after that time,freebies publishing shifted its focus from traditional printed media to cyberspace,offering its mail order information over the internet under the domain name.defendants apparently anticipated this change well prior to,having registered the domain name in november.
rsi provides customer management services to retailers,which rsi delivers to its clients through computer products designed to instantly profile any given customer making a retail purchase.when a customer makes a purchase from an rsi client,the rsi product enables information to be sent from the point of sale to rsi database of customer transactions.the system then instantaneously identifies a potential incentive offer,described by rsi as a freebie,which is printed out and presented to the customer along with the purchase receipt.
in,between the time that the defendants abandoned the original freebies trademark and applied for the new registration,rsi received legal advice that the term freebie was available for use and could be legally protected.rsi took no further action,however,until,when it registered the domain name for later use,two years before defendants registered the domain name.by that time,of course,freebies was a registered trademark.
in,rsi agreed to perform customer management services for blockbuster,a large and corporation in the retail business of video and dvd rentals and sales.in order to service the blockbuster account,frank byerley,rsi owner,formed freebie,drawing the corporate name from a promotional scheme for blockbuster customers to earn freebie points which they could cash in for viewing.in august,rsi began operating its website at so that blockbuster customers could manage their freebie points online.meanwhile,defendants had been offering their information online at for five months.
in december,defendants demanded that rsi cease using the word freebie in connection with its business.rsi refused to do so,believing the word freebies to be generic in nature,not entitled to trademark protection,and free for public use.defendants initiated an arbitration proceeding against rsi pursuant to the uniform domain name dispute resolution policy udrp,which is incorporated into all registration agreements pursuant to which a domain name is issued to a member of the public.the udrp requires the registrant to submit disputes concerning the domain name to an approved dispute resolution this case the national arbitration the purpose of what is essentially arbitration.see dluhos strasberg,cir udrp proceedings do not fall under the federal arbitration act and judicial review of those decisions is not restricted to a motion to vacate arbitration award under of the faa,which applies only to binding proceedings likely to realistically settle the dispute.the arbitrator concluded that was confusingly similar to defendants registered trademark and that rsi had no trademark rights in the name freebie.additionally,the arbitrator determined that rsi registered the domain name in bad faith because it used the plural term freebies as a metatag for its website,which directed an internet search for freebies to rsi site the arbitrator was persuaded that this evidence demonstrated rsi awareness of defendants freebies trademark and,therefore,bad faith in acquiring its domain name.accordingly,rsi was ordered to transfer the domain name to defendants.
rsi responded by filing this action against defendants for a declaration that rsi use of the word freebie as part of its domain name does not violate the anticybersquatting consumer protection act,see d,and does not constitute trademark infringement,see a,trademark dilution,see c,or unfair competition,see a.rsi also asked the district court to rule that the word freebies is generic and to cancel the freebies registration,rendering the arbitration order null and void.defendants counterclaimed for trademark infringement and dilution,cybersquatting,and violations of virginia law.
the district court granted summary judgment to rsi,concluding that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated the generic nature of the word freebies.see retail,freebies publishing,d.the court rejected the same argument defendants now offer on summary judgment was inappropriate because an issue of fact existed by virtue of the pto registration of the freebies mark,which is prima facie evidence that the mark was sufficiently distinctive to warrant trademark protection.defendants also argued unsuccessfully that,even though use of the word freebie is now widespread,the freebies mark was entitled to protection because the defendants did not use the word in the generic sense.on appeal,defendants contend that the district court was wrong to reject these arguments.
we apply the familiar de novo standard in reviewing a district court grant of summary judgment based on the conclusion that a mark is insufficiently distinctive to warrant trademark protection.see search,llc,cir.summary judgment is to be entered when,viewed in the light most favorable to the,the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see search,at.in light of the district court holding,the relevant inquiry here is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.a mere scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff position will be insufficient there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.id.at.see nartron stmicroelectronics,cir,cert.denied,d affirming summary judgment on the basis of overwhelming evidence of genericness.
we turn first to defendants argument that their certificate of registration alone creates an issue of fact as to whether the word freebies is generic and thereby precludes summary judgment in favor of rsi.for the reasons that follow,we can not agree.
under the lanham act,the issuance of a certificate of registration arms the registrant with prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of the registration of the mark,of the registrant ownership of the mark,and of the registrant exclusive right to use the registered mark.b west.because the pto may not register a generic mark,the fact that a mark is registered is strong evidence that the mark satisfies the statutory requirements for the distinctiveness necessary for trademark protection.see e,b west.the certificate of registration supplies the registrant with prima facie evidence that its mark is not generic in the eyes of the relevant public and that its mark at a minimum is descriptive and has obtained secondary meaning.america online,v.at t,cir see search,at.this is a significant procedural advantage for the registrant.without a certificate of registration,the owner would be required to establish that the disputed mark was sufficiently distinctive to warrant trademark protection in the first place.see pizzeria uno,at.the effect of the presumption is to satisfy that burden in the absence of rebutting evidence.see america online,at see also tie tech,kinedyne,cir in trademark terms,the registration is not absolute but subject to rebuttal and discharges the plaintiff original common law burden of proving validity in an infringement action.
the presumption of validity flowing from trademark registration,therefore,has a effect,requiring the party challenging a registered mark to produce sufficient evidence to establish that the mark is generic by a preponderance of evidence.see glover ampak,cir pizzeria uno,at.the burden shifted by the presumption is one of production rather than persuasion.see.in all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided for by act of congress or by these rules,a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption,but does not shift to such party the burden of proof in the sense of the risk of nonpersuasion,which remains throughout the trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast.if sufficient evidence of genericness is produced to rebut the presumption,the presumption is neutralize d and essentially drops from the case,although the evidence giving rise to the presumption remains.america online,at reeves sanderson plumbing,d a lthough the presumption of discrimination drops out of the picture once the defendant meets its burden of production the trier of fact may still consider the evidence establishing the plaintiff prima facie case.
relying on our decision in america online,defendants contend that summary judgment in an infringement action on the basis that a registered trademark is or has become generic is never appropriate.defendants argue that america online established a rule in this circuit that the issuance of a certificate of registration is,by itself,sufficient to create a jury issue on the validity of the mark in question because it embodies the pto informed opinion that the mark is registrable.we disagree.
in america online,we considered the question of whether,in a federal trademark infringement action,a district court should afford deference to the pto determination that a given mark is registrable and,by definition,not generic.in rejecting the application of chevron deference,we explained that the pto decision to register a mark,without requiring evidence of secondary meaning,is powerful evidence that the registered mark is suggestive and that a district court should receiv e the certificate of registration into evidence and treat it as prima facie evidence of the validity of the mark.at.although we concluded that the prima facie evidence provided by the certificate of registration was in this case sufficient to establish a question of material fact that could not be resolved on summary judgment,id.at,we nowhere suggested that registration created a per se issue of fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment.the panel in america online carefully noted that the registration was sufficient in this case to preclude summary judgment,and that,in addition to the certificate of registration,there was other evidence that the mark was not generic.id.at first emphasis added the latter observation,of course,would be pointless if,as defendants argue,america online held that a certificate of registration alone settles the matter of summary judgment.at most,america online suggests that,as a general rule,the introduction of a certificate of registration will create enough of an factual dispute to render summary judgment inappropriate on the basis that the mark is generic.see search,at the prima facie evidence provided by the certificate of registration is generally sufficient to establish a question of material fact that can not be resolved on summary judgment.accordingly,we reject the defendants contention.
having decided that the certificate of registration alone does not immunize defendants claims from dispositive motions prior to trial,we turn to the district court conclusion that there was no genuine issue of material fact on the issue of genericness and that rsi was thus entitled to summary judgment.
rsi evidence of genericness 
to rebut the presumption that the mark is not generic,rsi must offer sufficient proof that the primary significance of the mark is its indication of the nature or class of the product or service,rather than an indication of source.glover,at.additionally,the evidence must demonstrate the generic understanding of the mark from the viewpoint of the relevant public.id.quoting.the district court determined that the relevant consuming public includes internet users seeking information about mail order offerings.retail,d at.we agree with this conclusion,and defendants do not take issue with it.
defendants mark was registered for use in connection with magazines and newspapers with information about mail order offerings.although the publication of the printed freebies magazine ceased in,defendants continued to offer the same kinds of information on their website,hoping to attract internet users looking for material.thus,the issue boils down to this whether rsi has offered sufficient evidence that,in the minds of internet users interested in online free information,the term freebie or freebies does not give an indication of source,glover,at,but rather identifies the nature or general class of goods or services,employs the common name of a product or service.sara lee,at.
evidence offered to rebut the presumption of validity may come from any number of sources,including purchaser testimony,consumer surveys,listings and dictionaries,trade journals,newspapers,and other publications.glover,at see in re merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,evidence of the public understanding of the term may be obtained from any competent source.other common sources include evidence of generic use by competitors,generic use of the term by the mark owners,and use of the term by third parties in trademark registrations.nartron,at.
the district court considered various dictionary definitions that were roughly uniform in defining freebie as a slang term meaning something given or received without charge.retail,d at quoting webster ninth collegiate dictionary see,the american heritage college dictionary ed an article or service given free.webster ii new riverside university dictionary something given or received gratis cambridge international dictionary of english,online edition,available at s omething which is given to you without you having to pay for it,esp.as a way of attracting your support for or interest in something.the district court noted that,according to the oxford english dictionary,freebie has been understood to mean something that is provided free since its inclusion in the american thesaurus of slang a complete reference book of colloquial speech.retail,d at.although not controlling,dictionary definitions are relevant and sometimes persuasive on the issue of genericness based upon the assumption that dictionary definitions usually reflect the public perception of a word meaning and its contemporary usage.mccarthy at internal quotation marks omitted see,grottanelli,cir d ictionary definitions of a word to denote a category of products are significant evidence of genericness.shoe shonac,cir because generic use implies use consistent with common understanding,we have often looked to dictionaries as a source of evidence on genericness.
furthermore,as noted above,evidence of the owner generic use,in particular,is strong evidence of genericness.mccarthy at.the district court highlighted the contents of defendants own website,which undercut their position that freebies is not a generic term.see retail servs,d at.for example,the home page included a banner announcing that the website was bringing you the best free and almost free offers since and stating that is the best place on the web for free and almost free offers that you wo find anywhere else.the stylized freebies logo at the top of the home page appeared above the same slogan that had been emblazoned on the printed version of freebies magazine the magazine with something for nothing.
the actual offers included on or in freebies magazine used the term freebies in this same that the reader would ordinarily expect to pay for but could obtain for free with the information provided by the magazine or website.for example,the edition of freebies magazine included a section entitled football freebies which explained how to obtain fabulous freebies offered by your own special team.the section was divided into two columns.one column,under the heading team,listed addresses for various national football league franchises,and the other column,under the heading freebie,listed items that could be obtained for no cost such as bumper stickers or posters upon request.likewise,on the website,typical items might include american flag lapel pins or tie tacks,like those offered on january,which could be obtained by sending the specified postage and handling costs to the address provided by.gail and eugene zannon,moreover,both gave deposition testimony confirming that their use of the term freebies was consistent with the commonly understood meaning of the word,referring to free goods and services,and that their primary business is the distribution of information about free or almost free goods and services.
defendants use of the term freebies is consistent with the use of that term by scores of other websites on the internet.typical of these domain names are,which compiles categorized lists of freebie products and where to get them,which uses a banner announcing freebies,free stuff,giveaways call them what you want,they all break down to the same thing getting something for nothing,which offers one of the web largest collection of freebies if it freebies you want,then it freebies you got so put away your wallet and grab some freebies and,the domain name for a website describing itself as your searchable source for freebies and providing information about a wide variety of free products and services.there is also,your source for freebies and free stuff daily for freebies hunters like you,which claims to be t he resource for free stuff on the web only top notch freebies are listed,and,which also claims to be the internet leading resource for free stuff with the latest and greatest freebies.
defendants website,and those listed above,are but a few of the websites or more that incorporate the word freebie or freebies into their domain names.these websites are now so common that the term freebie site is often used by these sites to refer to other sites that,like defendants,offer information about free products or services in addition to this voluminous information pulled directly from these websites,the record contains declarations from competitor sites.glenda mcgarity,the owner of a website called killer freebies deals,understands the word freebies to refer to free or almost free goods and services,supplies information about freebies offered by other individuals or companies,and is aware of many such internet businesses that offer freebies.likewise,lee seats,who operates section on the topic of freebies,uses freebies on his website to refer to free or almost free goods and services and is in the business of providing information,tips and advice about how to obtain free or almost free goods and services,freebies offered by other companies or individuals.finally,rsi offered a list of newspaper or news media reports using the phrase freebie site to refer to websites similar to defendants.
the district court concluded that the evidence of genericness was so that no genuine issue of fact existed as to whether,in the public mind,freebies indicates free or almost free products and is not identified with defendants or their website in particular.retail,d at.such evidence necessarily rebuts the presumption of.
defendants arguments 
additional evidence that freebies is not generic.
defendants contend that the district court failed to take into consideration any of their evidence,in addition to the certificate of registration,that created an issue of fact by demonstrating the distinctive,nature of the mark.first,defendants point out that in reviewing defendants application for trademark registration,the pto examining attorney considered one of the same dictionary definitions of freebie that the district court found persuasive on the issue of genericness.defendants argue the fact that the pto ultimately issued the certificate of registration seriously undercuts the value of the dictionary definition.this is not additional evidence it is part and parcel of the certificate of registration which,as we explained at length,is itself evidence the word or phrase in question is not generic.we fail to see how this part of the registration process offers anything that the whole does not.the district court,of course,took the registration into account and acknowledged its presumptive effect,but simply concluded it was not enough to prevent summary judgment for rsi.see retail,d at 
defendants also contend that the district court all but ignored substantial evidence demonstrating that the registered term was not only not generic,but was a strong,commercially successful mark with a secondary meaning.in particular,defendants that receives an average of visits per month from consumers around the world,that freebies magazine in print form had millions of paying subscribers and that defendants sold more than books offering information similar to that provided in freebies magazine.evidence of an acquired secondary meaning,however,has no relevance unless the mark in question has been found not to be generic.see,home builders ass of greater louis l l exhibition,cir a generic mark is the common name of a product or service it may not be registered nor used exclusively by one competitor,even if it has acquired secondary meaning.a h sportswear,victoria secret stores,cir same.
for these same reasons,we also discount defendants reliance on the evidence of actual and potential to defendants,for example,there were several hundred complaints from consumers who were seeking defendants website but ended up in rsi site,or.evidence establishing a likelihood of confusion simply do es not bear upon the question of whether a trademark is generic.ale house,raleigh ale house,cir.in sum,defendant has failed to highlight any significant evidence,outside of the certificate of trademark registration,that would create a genuine issue of fact on genericness.
use of freebies 
defendants contend that,even if the word freebies is generic,they were not using this term generically in connection with their business,which defendants carefully describe as the provision of information about or low cost promotional offers.defendants emphasize that they do not actually distribute or offer the free products or samples,which they concede would constitute a generic use of freebies,but simply tell consumers how to obtain such items from others,which they claim does not.in essence,defendants argue that this distinction transforms their use of freebies from generic to descriptive.
in our view,this distinction is not significant.of course,it is certainly possible for a term to serve as a generic description for one category of products but function as a distinctive mark for unrelated products in a different context.see,in re seats,holding that the word seats was not generic for ticket reservations services even though it could not be registered in connection with chairs or couches.even though defendants do not directly distribute free products or freebies,their business nonetheless revolves around freebies in the generic sense of the word.as defendants website proclaims,they are bringing you the best free and almost free offers since.accordingly,we reject defendants contention that they were not using the term in its generic sense.
the incontestable status of freebies 
defendants suggest that,even if we do not agree that freebies is,at the very least,a descriptive mark that has acquired secondary meaning,it is beyond dispute that freebies has become incontestable,and therefore is not subject to challenge with regard to its secondary meaning.this argument misses the mark.
if a registered trademark becomes incontestable,the rebuttable presumption that a registered mark has acquired secondary meaning becomes conclusive evidence of the registrant exclusive right to use the registered mark subject to a number of affirmative defenses enumerated in the lanham act.b west supp.this list,however,does not include a defense based upon a mark lack of secondary merely descriptive mark,then,is subject to challenge based on its lack of distinctiveness until it acquires incontestable s
