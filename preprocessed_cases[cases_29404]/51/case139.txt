christopher lamparello appeals the district court order enjoining him from maintaining a gripe website critical of reverend jerry falwell.for the reasons stated below,we reverse.
reverend falwell is a nationally known minister who has been active as a commentator on politics and public affairs.hustler magazine falwell,d.he holds the common law trademarks jerry falwell and falwell,and the registered trademark listen america with jerry falwell.jerry falwell ministries can be found online at,a website which receives hits or visits per day.
lamparello registered the domain name on february,after hearing reverend falwell give an interview in which he expressed opinions about gay people and homosexuality that lamparello considered offensive.lamparello created a website at that domain name to respond to what he believed were untruths about gay people.lamparello website included headlines such as bible verses that falwell chooses to ignore and jerry falwell has been bearing false witness exodus against his gay and lesbian neighbors for a long time.the site also contained criticism of reverend falwell views.for example,the website stated 
falwell says that he is on the side of truth.he says that he will preach that homosexuality is a sin until the day he dies.but we believe that if the reverend were to take another thoughtful look at the scriptures,he would discover that they have been twisted around to support an political agenda at the expense of the gospel.
although the interior pages of lamparello website did not contain a disclaimer,the homepage prominently stated,this website is not affiliated with jerry falwell or his ministry advised,if you would like to visit falwell website,you may click here and provided a hyperlink to reverend falwell website.
at one point,lamparello website included a link to the webpage for a book that offered interpretations of the bible that lamparello favored,but the parties agree that lamparello has never sold goods or services on his website.the parties also agree that lamparello domain name and web site at,which received only hits per day,had no measurable impact on the quantity of visits to reverend falwell web site at.
nonetheless,reverend falwell sent lamparello letters in october and june demanding that he cease and desist from using or any variation of reverend falwell name as a domain name.ultimately,lamparello filed this action against reverend falwell and his ministries collectively referred to hereinafter as reverend falwell,seeking a declaratory judgment of noninfringement.reverend falwell,alleging trademark infringement under,false designation of origin under a,unfair competition under and the common law of virginia and cybersquatting under d.
the parties stipulated to all relevant facts and filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to reverend falwell,enjoined lamparello from using reverend falwell mark at,and required lamparello to transfer the domain name to reverend falwell.lamparello,d at.however,the court denied reverend falwell request for statutory damages or attorney fees,reasoning that the primary motive of lamparello website was to put forth opinions on issues that were contrary to those of reverend falwell and not to take away monies or to profit.id.at.
lamparello appeals the district court order reverend falwell the denial of statutory damages and attorney fees.we review de novo a district court ruling on for summary judgment.see people for the ethical treatment of animals doughney,cir hereinafter peta.
we first consider reverend falwell claims of trademark infringement and false designation of origin.
section of the lanham act creates a cause of action against 
a ny person who shall,without the consent of the registrant a use in commerce any reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.
similarly,section a creates a cause of action against 
a ny person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,uses in commerce any word or name,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which a is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,connection,or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person.
both infringement and false designation of origin have five elements.to prevail under either cause of action,the trademark holder must prove 
that it possesses a mark that the opposing party used the mark that the opposing party use of the mark occurred in commerce that the opposing party used the mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of goods or services and that the opposing party used the mark in a manner likely to confuse consumers.

trademark law serves the important functions of protecting product identification,providing consumer information,and encouraging the production of quality goods and services.see qualitex jacobson prods,d.but protections against unfair competition can not be transformed into rights to control language.cpc int l,skippy,cir quoting mark lemley,the modern lanham act and the death of common sense,yale.such a transformation would raise serious first amendment concerns because it would limit the 
ability to discuss the products or criticize the conduct of companies that may be of widespread public concern and importance.much useful social and commercial discourse would be all but impossible if speakers were under threat of an infringement lawsuit every time they made reference to a person,company or product by using its trademark.
id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
lamparello and his amici argue at length that application of the lanham act must be restricted to commercial speech to assure that trademark law does not become a tool for unconstitutional censorship.the sixth circuit has endorsed this view,see taubman webfeats,cir,and the ninth circuit recently has done so as well,see bosley med,kremer,cir.
in its two most significant recent amendments to the lanham act,the federal trademark dilution act of ftda and the anticybersquatting consumer protection act of acpa,congress left little doubt that it did not intend for trademark laws to impinge the first amendment rights of critics and commentators.the dilution statute applies to only a commercial use in commerce of a mark,c,and explicitly states that the n oncommercial use of a mark is not actionable.id.c.congress explained that this language was added to adequately address legitimate first amendment concerns,at,reprinted in,and incorporate d the concept of commercial speech from the commercial speech doctrine.id.at,reprinted in at lorillard tobacco reilly,d defining commercial speech as speech proposing a commercial transaction internal quotation marks and citation omitted.similarly,congress directed that in determining whether an individual has engaged in cybersquatting,the courts may consider whether the person use of the mark is a bona fide noncommercial or fair use.d b i iv.the legislature believed this provision necessary to protect the rights of internet users and the interests of all americans in free speech and protected uses of trademarked names for such things as parody,comment,criticism,comparative advertising,news reporting,wl,at.
in contrast,the trademark infringement and false designation of origin provisions of the lanham act sections and a,respectively do not employ the term noncommercial.they do state,however,that they pertain only to the use of a mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services,a,or in connection with any goods or services,id.a.but courts have been reluctant to define those terms narrowly rather,as the second circuit has explained,t he term services has been interpreted broadly and so t he lanham act has been applied to defendants furnishing a wide variety of public and civic benefits.united we stand,united we stand,am,cir.similarly,in peta we noted that a website need not actually sell goods or services for the use of a mark in that site domain name to constitute a use in connection with goods or services.peta,at see also taubman,at concluding that website with two links to websites of entities violated the lanham act.
thus,even if we accepted lamparello contention that sections and a of the lanham act apply only to commercial speech,we would still face the difficult question of what constitutes such speech under those provisions.in the case at hand,we need not resolve that question or determine whether sections and a apply exclusively to commercial speech because reverend falwell claims of trademark infringement and false designation fail for a more obvious reason.the hallmark of such claims is a likelihood of there is no likelihood of confusion here.
t he use of a competitor mark that does not cause confusion as to source is permissible,cir.accordingly,lamparello can only be liable for infringement and false designation if his use of reverend falwell mark would be likely to cause confusion as to the source of the website found at.this test generally strikes a comfortable balance between the first amendment and the rights of markholders.mattel,mca records,cir.
we have identified seven factors helpful in determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists as to the source of a work,but not all these factors are always relevant or equally emphasized in each case.pizzeria uno temple,cir internal quotation marks,citations,and brackets omitted.the factors are a the strength or distinctiveness of the mark b the similarity of the two marks c the similarity of the the marks identify d the similarity of the facilities the two parties use in their businesses e the similarity of the advertising used by the two parties f the defendant intent g actual confusion.id.citation omitted.
reverend falwell mark is distinctive,and the domain name of lamparello website,closely resembles it.but,although lamparello and reverend falwell employ similar marks online,lamparello website looks nothing like reverend falwell indeed,lamparello has made no attempt to imitate reverend falwell website.moreover,reverend falwell does not even argue that lamparello website constitutes advertising or a facility for business,let alone a facility or advertising similar to that of reverend falwell.furthermore,lamparello clearly created his website intending only to provide a forum to criticize ideas,not to steal customers.
most importantly,reverend falwell and lamparello do not offer similar goods or services.rather they offer opposing ideas and commentary.reverend falwell mark identifies his spiritual and political views the website at criticizes those very views.after even a quick glance at the content of the website at,no one seeking reverend falwell guidance would be misled by the domain.believing reverend falwell authorized the content of that website.no one would believe that reverend falwell sponsored a site criticizing himself,his positions,and his interpretations of the bible.see new kids on the block news am.publ g,cir stating that use of a mark to solicit criticism of the markholder implies the markholder is not the sponsor of the use 
finally,the fact that people contacted reverend falwell ministry to report that they found the content at antithetical to reverend falwell views does not illustrate,as reverend falwell claims,that the website engendered actual confusion.to the contrary,the anecdotal evidence reverend falwell submitted shows that those searching for reverend falwell site and arriving instead at lamparello site quickly realized that reverend falwell was not the source of the content therein.
for all of these reasons,it is clear that the undisputed record evidences no likelihood of confusion.in fact,reverend falwell even conceded at oral argument that those viewing the content of lamparello website probably were unlikely to confuse reverend falwell with the source of that material.
nevertheless,reverend falwell argues that he is entitled to prevail under the initial interest confusion doctrine.this relatively new and sporadically applied doctrine holds that the lanham act forbids a competitor from luring potential customers away from a producer by initially passing off its goods as those of the producer,even if confusion as to the source of the goods is dispelled by the time any sales are consummated,at.according to reverend falwell,this doctrine requires us to compare his mark with lamparello website domain name,without considering the content of lamparello website.reverend falwell argues that some people who misspell his name may go to assuming it is his site,thus giving lamparello an unearned one that quickly disappears when it realizes it has not reached reverend falwell site.this argument fails for two reasons.
first,we have never adopted the initial interest confusion theory rather,we have followed a very different mode of analysis,requiring courts to determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists by examin ing the allegedly infringing use in the context in which it is seen by the ordinary consumer,l l wings,cir emphasis added citing cases see also of,whataburger,cir.
contrary to reverend falwell arguments,we did not abandon this approach in peta.our inquiry in peta was limited to whether doughney use of the domain name constituted a successful enough parody of people for the ethical treatment of animals that no one was likely to believe was sponsored or endorsed by that organization.for a parody to be successful,it must convey two that it is the original,but also that it is not the original and is instead a parody.peta,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.doughney argued that his domain name conveyed the first message that it was peta website and that the content of his website conveyed the requisite second message that it was not peta site.id.although t he website content ma de it clear that it wa s not related to peta,we concluded that the website content could not convey the requisite second message because the site content wa s not conveyed simultaneously with the first message,the domain name itself,as required to be considered a parody.id.at.accordingly,we found the district court properly rejected doughney parody defense.id.at.
peta simply outlines the parameters of the parody defense it does not adopt the initial interest confusion theory or otherwise diminish the necessity of examining context when determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists.indeed,in peta itself,rather than embracing a new approach,we reiterated that t o determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists,a court should not consider how closely a fragment of a given use duplicates the trademark,but must instead consider whether the use in its entirety creates a likelihood of confusion.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted emphasis added.when dealing with domain names,this means a court must evaluate an allegedly infringing domain name in conjunction with the content of the website identified by the domain name 
moreover,even if we did endorse the initial interest confusion theory,that theory would not assist reverend falwell here because it provides no basis for liability in circumstances such as these.the few appellate courts that have followed the ninth circuit and imposed liability under this theory for using marks on the internet have done so only in cases involving a factor utterly absent business use of another mark for its own financial gain.see,paccar telescan,cir promatek,equitrac,cir brookfield communications,west coast entm t,cir.
profiting financially from initial interest confusion is thus a key element for imposition of liability under this theory when an alleged infringer does not compete with the markholder for sales,some initial confusion will not likely facilitate free riding on the goodwill of another mark,or otherwise harm the user claiming infringement.where confusion has little or no meaningful effect in the marketplace,it is of little or no consequence in our analysis.checkpoint,at.for this reason,even the ninth circuit has stated that a firm is not liable for using another mark in its domain name if it could not financially capitalize on a misdirected consumer looking for the markholder site even if it so desired.interstellar starship,epix,cir.
this critical of another firm mark to capture the markholder customers and does not exist when the alleged infringer establishes a gripe site that criticizes the markholder.see hannibal travis,the battle for mindshare the emerging consensus that the first amendment protects corporate criticism and parody on the internet.tech,winter the premise of the initial interest confusion cases is that by using the plaintiff trademark to divert its customers,the defendant is engaging in the old bait and switch.but because internet users who find gripe sites are not sold anything,the mark may be the bait,but there is simply no switch.citations omitted applying the initial interest confusion theory to gripe sites like lamparello would enable the markholder to insulate himself from at least to minimize access to it.we have already condemned such uses of the lanham act,stating that a markholder can not shield itself from criticism by forbidding the use of its name in commentaries critical of its conduct.cpc int l,at quoting bean,drake publishers,cir.j ust because speech is critical of a corporation and its business practices is not a sufficient reason to enjoin the speech.id.
in sum,even if we were to accept the initial interest confusion theory,that theory would not apply in the case at hand.rather,to determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists as to the source of a gripe site like that at issue in this case,a court must look not only to the allegedly infringing domain name,but also to the underlying content of the website.when we do so here,it is clear,as explained above,that no likelihood of confusion exists.therefore,the district court erred in granting reverend falwell summary judgment on his infringement,false designation,and unfair competition claims.
we evaluate reverend falwell cybersquatting claim separately because the elements of a cybersquatting violation differ from those of traditional lanham act violations.to prevail on a cybersquatting claim,reverend falwell must show that lamparello had a bad faith intent to profit from using the domain name,and the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to,or dilutive of,the distinctive and famous falwell mark.peta,at citing d a.
the paradigmatic harm that the acpa was enacted to eradicate is the practice of cybersquatters registering several hundred domain names in an effort to sell them to the legitimate owners of the mark.lucas nursery landscaping,grosse,cir.the act was also intended to stop the registration of multiple marks with the hope of selling them to the highest bidder,distinctive marks to defraud consumers or to engage in counterfeiting activities,and marks to prey on consumer confusion by misusing the domain name to divert customers from the mark owner site to the cybersquatter own site,many of which are pornography sites that derive advertising revenue based on the number of visits,or hits,the site receives,wl,at.the act was not intended to prevent noncommercial uses of a mark,such as for comment,criticism,parody,news reporting,and thus they are beyond the scope of the acpa.id.at.
to distinguish abusive domain name registrations from legitimate ones,the acpa directs courts to consider nine nonexhaustive factors 
i the trademark or other intellectual property rights of the person,if any,in the domain name 
ii the extent to which the domain name consists of the legal name of the person or a name that is otherwise commonly used to identify that person 
iii the person prior use,if any,of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering of any goods or services 
iv the person bona fide noncommercial or fair use of the mark in a site accessible under the domain name 
v the person intent to divert consumers from the mark owner online location to a site accessible under the domain name that could harm the goodwill represented by the mark,either for commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or disparage the mark,by creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source,sponsorship,affiliation,or endorsement of the site 
vi the person offer to transfer,sell,or otherwise assign the domain name to the mark owner or any third party for financial gain without having used,or having an intent to use,the domain name in the bona fide offering of any goods or services,or the person prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct 
vii the person provision of material and misleading false contact information when applying for the registration of the domain name,the person intentional failure to maintain accurate contact information,or the person prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct 
viii the person registration or acquisition of multiple domain names which the person knows are identical or confusingly similar to marks of others that are distinctive at the time of the registration of such domain names,or dilutive of famous marks of others that are famous at the time of registration of such domain names,without regard to the goods or services of the parties and 
ix the extent to which the mark incorporated in the person domain name registration is or is not distinctive and famous within the meaning of subsection c of this section.

these factors attempt to balance the property interests of trademark owners with the legitimate interests of internet users and others who seek to make lawful uses of others marks,including for purposes such as comparative advertising,comment,criticism,parody,news reporting,fair use,wl,at emphasis added.the first four factors suggest circumstances that may tend to indicate an absence of intent to profit from the goodwill of a mark,and the others suggest circumstances that may tend to indicate that such intent exists.id.however,t here is no simple formula for evaluating and weighing these factors.for example,courts do not simply count up which party has more factors in its favor after the evidence is in.harrods sixty internet domain names,cir.in fact,because use of these listed factors is permissive,w e need not march through them all in every case.virtual works,volkswagen of,cir.the factors are given to courts as a guide,not as a substitute for careful thinking about whether the conduct at issue is motivated by a bad faith intent to profit.lucas nursery landscaping,at.
after close examination of the undisputed facts involved in this case,we can only conclude that reverend falwell can not demonstrate that lamparello had a bad faith intent to profit from using the domain name.peta,at.lamparello clearly employed simply to criticize reverend falwell views.factor iv of the acpa,d b i iv,counsels against finding a bad faith intent to profit in such circumstances because use of a domain name for purposes of comment,and criticism,wl,at,constitutes a bona fide noncommercial or fair use under the statute,d b i iv that lamparello provided a link to an webpage selling a book he favored does not diminish the communicative function of his website.the use of a domain name to engage in criticism or commentary even where done for profit does not alone evidence a bad faith intent to profit,wl,at,and lamparello did not even stand to gain financially from sales of the book at.thus factor iv weighs heavily in favor of finding lamparello lacked a bad faith intent to profit from the use of the domain name.
equally important,lamparello has not engaged in the type of conduct described in the statutory factors as typifying the bad faith intent to profit essential to a successful cybersquatting claim.first,we have already held,supra part,that lamparello domain name does not create a likelihood of confusion as to source or affiliation.accordingly,lamparello has not engaged in the type of conduct creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source,sp
