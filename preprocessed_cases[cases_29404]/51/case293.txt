the parties use of the carelink mark.healthcom is an illinois corporation that provides remote electronic monitoring devices and emergency response services for clients in states,including arkansas.healthcom solicits local hospitals and home health care agencies to become members of healthcom national association for emergency response.each member subscribers individual clients or patients are then offered a variety of carelink emergency response services.a carelink program typically consists of monitoring equipment,usually leased by healthcom to the member health care provider or directly to the subscriber,plus a support center operated by healthcom,which responds to the subscriber emergency calls in a prearranged fashion and may monitor medical equipment in the subscriber home or monitor the whereabouts of an subscriber,such as one suffering from alzheimer disease.each markets carelink programs and equipment to its patients,bills the patients,and pays healthcom a monthly fee for each patient using carelink services.
ca is a private,nonprofit arkansas corporation organized in to provide a broad range of support services to elderly and disabled persons in a region in central arkansas.ca mission is to provide,alternatives to nursing home care.ca has employees and volunteers who assist some elderly persons in the region.ca has never provided personal emergency response services,but it has occasionally paid for such services being provided to ca clients.in january,ca adopted the trade name carelink to use in lieu of its corporate name,which had proved awkward and hard to remember,and which created the that ca is a government agency.
facts relating to first usage.healthcom began marketing emergency response services under the carelink service mark in or early.from to,healthcom spent an estimated attempting to sell its services in arkansas.despite these efforts,during this period healthcom made only one sale in arkansas,to an end user who stopped using its carelink service in april.healthcom had no arkansas customers from april to september,when it entered into a contract with north arkansas regional medical center in harrison.by july,healthcom had contracts with seven arkansas health care providers and served individual subscribers.healthcom estimated that its total arkansas revenues in would be just over.healthcom has never had a customer for its carelink services located within the region served by ca.healthcom applied for federal trademark registration on may,and its application is pending.
ca adopted the carelink trade name and logo in early and has prominently displayed the logo on stationery,business cards,client information materials,and other publicity materials.ca registered its carelink mark with the arkansas secretary of state on march,and has used the mark in promoting all of its services,except hospice care.ca annual revenues grew from to from early to.although ca derives most of its revenues from government grants,in it received approximately in private donations and an estimated from clients able to pay for its services.all of ca clients reside in its region,but its activities are publicized beyond central arkansas through news coverage,telephone listings,advertisements,and a monthly column in an arkansas newspaper for the elderly.
the dispute unfolds.ca did not know of healthcom prior usage when it adopted the carelink name and logo and received a state registration in early.when ca learned that the north arkansas regional medical center was using healthcom carelink mark for emergency response services in northern arkansas,ca sent a letter to that provider.the parties were unable to resolve the resulting dispute.healthcom then commenced this action,alleging common law trademark infringement and unfair competition in violation of the lanham act,a,and seeking an injunction barring ca from using the mark and cancellation of ca state registration.ca counterclaimed,alleging unfair competition under the lanham act and trademark infringement under ann,and seeking an injunction prohibiting healthcom from using its carelink mark in arkansas or,alternatively,in ca region.
deciding the case on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court dismissed healthcom claims because its use of the carelink mark in arkansas prior to ca state registration was de minimis.the court granted ca a permanent injunction prohibiting healthcom from using the mark anywhere in arkansas because ca use of the mark has been substantial,because a statewide injunction is necessary to prevent confusion among consumers and to prevent healthcom from passing off its services as those of ca,and because ca state registration entitles it to a statewide injunction.healthcom appeals,arguing that its common law trademark is entitled to priority because it first used the mark in arkansas.alternatively,healthcare argues the district court abused its discretion in granting ca an overly broad injunction.
nearly a century ago,the supreme court established what is now called the tea first user of a common law trademark may not oust a later user good faith use of an infringing mark in a market where the first user products or services are not sold.see united drug theodore rectanus.hanover star milling metcalf.the rationale is a core principle of trademark law the owner of a mark may not monopolize markets that his trade has never reached and where the mark signifies not his goods but those of another.hanover star milling,at.that essential principle applies even when the first user has federally registered its mark under the lanham act,with one important modification the owner of a registered mark has the right to expand its use into a new market unless an infringing user had penetrated that market prior to registration.see natural footwear hart,schaffner marx,cir,cert.denied,d.
in this case we must apply the tea doctrine in resolving two distinct inquiries.first,we must determine whether healthcom,as the first user of a carelink common law mark elsewhere in the country,is entitled by reason of its own market penetration to oust ca from any area in arkansas.second,to the extent healthcom failed to prove first use in arkansas,we must determine whether ca,as owner of a mark used only in six counties,is entitled to statewide injunctive relief against healthcom present use of its mark.
it is undisputed that,in early,ca adopted the carelink mark in good faith,without knowledge of healthcom prior use.to be entitled to injunctive relief against ca subsequent good faith use,healthcom must prove that its prior use of the mark penetrated the geographic market in question.in determining whether healthcom achieved the necessary market penetration,we apply the factors identified in our sweetarts cases 
healthcom dollar value of sales at the time ca entered the market,number of customers compared to the population of the state,relative and potential growth of sales,and length of time since significant sales.though the market penetration need not be large to entitle healthcom to protection,it must be s
