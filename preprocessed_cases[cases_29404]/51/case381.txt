pebble beach company pebble beach,a golf course resort in california,appeals the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of its complaint against michael caddy caddy,a owner located in southern england.in addition,pebble beach seeks review of an order denying its request for an opportunity to conduct jurisdictional discovery.because caddy did not expressly aim his conduct at california or the united states,we hold that the district court determined correctly that it lacked personal jurisdiction.given the nature of the claims and the facts of this case,we conclude also that the district court properly exercised its discretion by denying pebble beach motion to conduct additional jurisdictional discovery.thus,we affirm.

personal jurisdiction 
the arguments are straight forward.caddy contends that the district court may not assert personal jurisdiction over him,and,consequently,that the complaint against him was properly dismissed.pebble beach argues in return that caddy is subject to specific personal jurisdiction in california,or,alternatively,in any forum in the united states,because he has expressly aimed tortious conduct at california and the united states pebble beach asserts that it may look to the entire united states as a litigation forum pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure k if caddy contacts with california are insufficient to warrant jurisdiction.as explained more thoroughly below,rule k may,in limited circumstances,be a basis for establishing jurisdiction where the united states serves as the relevant forum for a minimum contacts analysis.glencore grain rotterdam shivnath rai harnarain,cir.
when a defendant moves to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant.see harris rutsky.ins,bell clements,cir.however,this demonstration requires that the plaintiff make only a prima facie showing of jurisdictional facts to withstand the motion to dismiss.doe unocal,cir internal citations omitted.moreover,for the purpose of this demonstration,the court resolves all disputed facts in favor of the plaintiff,here,pebble beach.id.
the general rule is that personal jurisdiction over a defendant is proper if it is permitted by a statute and if the exercise of that jurisdiction does not violate federal due process.fireman fund ins.nat.bank of,cir.here,both the california statute and rule k what is often referred to as the federal compliance with due process requirements.see harris rutsky,at california statute unocal,at applying rule k as a federal statute.consequently,under both arguments presented by pebble beach,resolution turns on due process.
for due process to be satisfied,a defendant,if not present in the forum,must have minimum contacts with the forum state such that the assertion of jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.
in this circuit,we employ the following test to analyze whether a party minimum contacts meet the supreme court directive.this minimum contacts test is satisfied when,
the defendant has performed some act or consummated some transaction within the forum or otherwise purposefully availed himself of the privileges of conducting activities in the forum,the claim arises out of or results from the defendant activities,and the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable.
bancroft masters,augusta,cir.if any of the three requirements is not satisfied,jurisdiction in the forum would deprive the defendant of due process of law.omeluk langsten slip batbyggeri,cir.the plaintiff bears the burden of satisfying the first two prongs of the minimum contacts test.schwarzenegger,at internal citations omitted.here,pebble beach arguments fail under the first prong.accordingly,we need not address whether the claim arose out of or resulted from caddy activities or whether an exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable per the factors outlined by the supreme court in burger king rudzewicz,d.
under the first prong of the minimum contacts test,pebble beach has the burden of establishing that caddy has performed some act or consummated some transaction within the forum or otherwise purposefully availed himself of the privileges of conducting activities in the forum.bancroft,at.we have refined this to mean whether caddy has either purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum,or purposefully directed his activities toward the forum.schwarzenegger,at.although we sometimes use the phrase purposeful availment to include both purposeful availment and direction,availment and direction are,in fact,two distinct concepts.id.
thus,in order to satisfy the first prong of the minimum contacts test,pebble beach must establish either that caddy purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities in california,or the united states as a whole,or that he purposefully directed its activities toward one of those two forums.id.
purposeful availment 
pebble beach fails to identify any conduct by caddy that took place in california or in the united states that adequately supports the availment concept.evidence of availment is typically action taking place in the forum that invokes the benefits and protections of the laws in the forum.id.at.evidence of direction generally consists of action taking place outside the forum that is directed at the forum.id.suggesting evidence of purposeful direction includes activities such as distribution and advertising.all of caddy action identified by pebble beach is action taking place outside the forum.thus,if anything,it is the type of evidence that supports a purposeful direction analysis.accordingly,we reject pebble beach assertion that caddy has availed himself of the jurisdiction of the district court under both concepts and proceed only to determine whether caddy has purposefully directed his action toward one of two applicable forums.
