this case arose out of a trademark dispute between two michigan wine producers leelanau wine cellars,ltd lwc and black red,b r,owned by roberta kurtz.following district court proceedings that resulted in an appeal to this court and a remand to the district court,the district court conducted a bench trial on lwc lanham trademark act,claim.following the bench trial,the district court issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law in which it rejected lwc claim that b r use of the mark chateau de leelanau vineyard and winery created a likelihood of confusion among consumers.the court entered judgment in favor of,and lwc appealed.
for the reasons below,we affirm the district court.
in,michigan leelanau peninsula was designated an approved american viticultural area ava.federal regulation defines a viticultural area as a delimited region distinguishable by geographical features,the boundaries of which have been delineated.an area designation as an ava permits the name of the area to be used as an appellation of origin on wine labels and in advertising.
both lwc and b r own and operate wineries located in the leelanau peninsula.lwc began operating its winery in.in,lwc successfully applied with the united states patent and trademark office uspto for registration of the mark leelanau cellars on the principal register.in,kurtz and joanne smart formed b b r was initially devoted exclusively to growing fruit,including apples,cherries,plums,and grapes and,prior to,sold its grape harvest to wineries,including lwc.in,b r received permission from the michigan department of commerce to do business as le coeur de leelanau and registered that entity as a vineyard and winery.in,b r,for the first time,utilized a part of its grape harvest to produce wine.b r elected in to change the name le coeur de leelanau to chateau de leelanuau vineyard and winery.that same year,b r received permission from the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms to sell wine.b r began selling its wine in earnest in january and ceased its other fruit growing activities in.during this period,b r was aware of the existence of lwc and had been for approximately years.
in october,michael jacobson,the owner of lwc,directed a letter to kurtz and smart notifying them that their use of the word leelenau as part of the name for their wine infringes upon the exclusive rights we have to do business under the names leelanau wine cellars,and leelanau cellars.b r continued to utilize the name,however,and ultimately applied for and received a trademark from the state of michigan in november.in october,b r successfully registered the name chateau de leelanau vineyard and winery on the principal register of the uspto.smart testified that b r consultation with lwc was incorrect in asserting that it held the exclusive right to use the word leelanau in its brand name.
on may,lwc filed suit against b r,smart,and kurtz in the united states district court for the western district of michigan.an amended complaint followed on september.the amended complaint raised two claims under the lanham trademark act,and,a claim for common law unfair competition,and a claim under the michigan consumer protection act.comp.laws.on august,the district court issued a written order granting lwc motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability on lwc federal trademark claims and permanently enjoining b r from using the term leelanau in any trade or brand name for the sale of wine following a bench trial on august and,on the issue of willfulness,the district court sent a letter dated october,to counsel,notifying them that it probably erred in granting summary judgment and a preliminary injunction to lwc.in light of the evidence at the bench trial,the district court explained,it was likely to rule that there was not a sufficient likelihood of confusion and rule in favor of b r,but remained open minded on the issue.the court issued an order november,setting forth the bases for its belief that its previous ruling was incorrect.lwc sought the opportunity to conduct a consumer survey,and the court denied that motion.on february,the court entered judgment in favor of b r,withdrew its august order in favor of lwc,and lifted the previously imposed injunction against b r use of the word leelanau.lwc appealed to the sixth circuit on march.on appeal,a panel of our court affirmed the district court power to reconsider its previous ruling unilaterally,but reversed and remanded with instructions to the district court to permit lwc to conduct its consumer survey.
on remand,the district court permitted lwc to conduct its desired consumer survey.on august,the court held a bench trial on the issues of liability and damages.the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law on september.in its order,the court considered the admissibility of lwc consumer survey,conducted by sara parikh.it found that the survey was potentially unreliable but nevertheless allowed its admission.on the central issue of the likelihood of consumer confusion,the court applied the test used in the sixth circuit to evaluate trademark infringement claims.it concluded that lwc did not possess a strong mark and that,because b r distributed its wine primarily through its tasting rooms,it was unlikely that consumers would have to distinguish between lwc wines and b r wines or incorrectly associate the company products.accordingly,the court determined that lwc failed to carry its burden of showing a likelihood of confusion among relevant consumers and entered judgment on behalf of b lwc filed a timely notice of appeal.

only those marks that are distinctive as a matter of law are accorded trademark protection.abercrombie fitch stores,am.eagle outfitters,cir.certain marks,described as arbitrary,fanciful,or suggestive are inherently distinctive and protectable see two pesos,taco cabana,d.a generic mark may never qualify for trademark protection id.between these two poles lie descriptive marks marks that are descriptive are not inherently distinctive but may enjoy the benefit of protection if they develop a secondary meaning.id.at tumblebus,at.this rule applies equally to phrases or terms that are descriptive of the geographic origin of a product.forschner group,arrow trading,cir.a descriptive mark achieves secondary meaning when in the minds of the public,the primary significance of a product feature or term is to identify the source of the product rather than the product.inwood,ives,d.a geographically descriptive mark that has acquired secondary meaning no longer causes the public to associate the goods at issue with a particular place but to associate the goods with a particular source.appalachian log homes,cir.
the district court deemed lwc mark geographically descriptive,and the parties rightly do not contest the correctness of that determination,as it is not clearly erroneous,degidio west group,cir ordinarily,we review the district court classification of a term as descriptive or suggestive under the clear error standard.where it is determined that the mark as perceived by potential purchasers describes the geographical origin of the goods the mark is primarily geographically descriptive,at see also forschner group,at a geographically descriptive term or phrase is one that designates geographical location and would tend to be regarded by buyers as descriptive of the geographic location of origin of the goods or services.internal quotation marks omitted.the parties do,however,vigorously dispute whether lwc mark possessed secondary meaning,entitling it to trademark protection.although b r does not expressly challenge the validity of lwc trademark,its claim that lwc descriptive trademark never attained a secondary meaning or incontestability is,in fact,a challenge to the lwc mark registration,and we address that issue first.
registration of a mark on the principal register of the uspto creates a rebuttable presumption that a trademark is valid,that is,either inherently distinctive or descriptive with secondary meaning,and therefore,protectable under federal trademark law.a providing that registration on the principal register shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark.because lwc possesses a descriptive mark,its registration must have been on the basis of the uspto determination that its mark had obtained a secondary meaning see packman chicago tribune,cir once a mark is registered,the act affords a plaintiff one of two presumptions that her registered trademark is not merely descriptive or generic or that if descriptive,the mark is accorded secondary meaning.the effect of the statutory presumption contained in a is to shift the burden of proof to the alleged infringer,in this case b r,to prove the absence of secondary meaning.see,at.
the district court conclusion that lwc mark had not acquired secondary meaning is reviewed for clear error.see ashland oil,olymco,wl,cir.in its september ruling,the district court considered the secondary meaning question in the context of discussing the strength of lwc mark.the court recognized that lwc leelanau cellars mark was entitled to a presumption of secondary meaning under the lanham act.it went on to observe,however,that lwc actually sought a determination that relevant consumers understand that the use of the term leelanau in connection with the sale of michigan wine refers to lwc as the source of the wine rather than to the wine itself.it concluded that b ecause leelanau alone is solely geographically descriptive and is not lwc registered mark,the statutory presumption did not apply,because there is no basis to conclude that the united states patent and trademark office determined that leelanau alone had obtained secondary meaning in connection with lwc use of leelanau cellars in its sales of wine.the district court finding that lwc mark was descriptive but lacking in secondary meaning should have ended its analysis,as a descriptive mark without secondary meaning is not entitled to trademark protection.see two pesos,at.
the district court erred in determining that lwc was not entitled to the benefit of a statutory presumption of validity because it did not register the word leelanau alone.in,our court confronted a similar factual situation,where the holder of a registered trademark for the term appalachian log structures sought to have appalachian log homes,enjoined from the use of the phrase appalachian log homes.at.there,the court deemed the trademark holder entitled to the statutory presumption of validity under a,despite the holder failure to register the word appalachian with the uspto.id.at.we believe that lwc was likewise entitled to the presumption afforded under.
lwc mark has not achieved incontestable status,see and b r was thus free to attempt to rebut the presumption of secondary meaning.having denied lwc the benefit of the presumption of secondary meaning,the district court failed to assess the evidence in the record to determine whether the presumption had been rebutted.we note that there is strong evidence in the record tending to undermine lwc claim of secondary meaning.as the district court noted,the leelanau peninsula has been a region since.that designation has spawned the leelanau peninsula vintner association lpva,consisting of wineries,including chateau de leelanau and leelanau cellars.the government recognition of the leelanau peninsula as a source of wine for more than years as well as the existence of the lpva would seem to undermine lwc contention that leelanau is necessarily associated with wine products coming from leelanau cellars.we ultimately decline to resolve this issue,as we think it outside our purview as an appellate court to weigh evidence never properly considered by the district court.however,as explained infra,we nevertheless affirm the district court judgment on the ground that lwc has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of confusion created by b r use of its mark.

the strength of a mark is a factual determination of the mark distinctiveness.daddy junky music stores,at.a stronger mark is accorded greater protection and encroachment upon a strong mark is deemed more likely to produce confusion among buyers.champions golf club,at.the district court deemed lwc geographically descriptive mark to be weak because leelanau is also the name of an ava,rendering lwc use of the word leelanau in its mark unremarkable.lwc attacks this conclusion,citing its use of the term leelanau in its advertising,the success of its winter white product,and the increase in its sales,going from approximately cases in to nearly cases in.this evidence,while relevant to the question,is not sufficient to demonstrate clear error on the part of the district court.lwc possesses a descriptive mark,which is,in the spectrum of distinctiveness,weaker than an arbitrary or fanciful mark,for instance.see daddy junky music stores,at.in addition,the district court was correct that the federal designation of the leelanau peninsula as an ava substantially decreased the possibility that a potential consumer would,upon seeing the mark,necessarily think of lwc product.

the sixth circuit evaluates the relatedness of goods by assigning the dispute in question to a place within a tripartite system.autozone,tandy,cir.if the parties are in direct competition,confusion is likely if the marks are sufficiently similar.id.at.if the goods are somewhat related,but not competitive,the likelihood of confusion determination will turn on one of the other seven factors.id.if the products are unrelated,a likelihood of confusion is highly unlikely.id.services and goods are related not because they coexist in the same broad industry,but are related if the services are marketed and consumed such that buyers are likely to believe that the services,similarly marked,come from the same source,or are somehow connected with or sponsored by a common company.daddy junky music stores,at internal quotation marks omitted.
b r and lwc produce the same product in a shared geographical region.while there is very limited overlap in their distribution channels,as discussed infra,to the extent that their wines are sold in the same locations,they are in direct competition.because b r and lwc do not possess similar marks,however,this factor weighs against a finding of a likelihood of confusion.
similarity of marks is a factor of considerable weight.daddy junky music stores,at.in assessing similarity,a court should consider the pronunciation,appearance,and verbal translation of conflicting marks.autozone,at.
lwc urges the court to ignore the words cellar and chateau de in evaluating the similarity of the relevant marks.discarding these elements in assessing similarity,however,would run contrary to the rule that courts must view marks in their entirety and focus on their overall impressions,not individual features.autozone,at referencing rule internal quotation marks omitted citing,thermoscan,cir.lwc cites inductotherm,cir,in support of its proposed approach.however,the court there held,in assessing the similarity of the marks inducto and,that differences in spelling,number of syllables,the use of hyphens,and sound and visual appearance were slight and unlikely to prevent confusion.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court did not dismiss substantial differences in the marks at issue,the effect of lwc request.moreover,the court did not set forth any rule establishing the more deconstructed approach lwc recommends.
here,the similarities between leelanau cellars and chateau de leelanau vineyard and winery begin and end with the use of the word leelanau.while the remaining words in the marks are terms often associated with wine producing,they are different words,and part of the remainder of b r mark is in french.further,b r mark contains far more syllables than lwc.the marks are also visually dissimilar.the chateau de leelanau mark,which appears in italics,is accompanied by a cluster of grapes.lwc uses a number of images with its mark,which is composed of all capital letters.many of those images depict nature scenes or ships.despite the marks shared use of the word leelanau,these differences are sufficiently significant to conclude that the marks are not so similar that they would produce a likelihood of confusion among purchasers.see autozone,at noting that competing marks had some visual and linguistic similarities,but ultimately their differences outnumber their similarities such that the likelihood of confusion is small.
evidence of actual confusion is undoubtedly the best evidence of likelihood of confusion.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.on the issue of actual confusion,lwc,on remand from this court,produced a consumer survey conducted by parikh at four malls throughout michigan two in detroit,one in grand rapids,and one in traverse city.in the study,interviewees were taken into a room and shown an advertisement for leelanau cellars wine.interviewees were then asked to put the advertisement away and look at five bottles of chardonnay,all of which originated in michigan.the study included a test cell and a control cell.the test and control cells both contained turner road,julian,wilhurst,and zafarana wines.in the test cell,the fifth wine was chateau de leelanau.in the control cell,the fifth wine was bel lago.participants in the study were,after viewing the advertisement and the wines,asked,do you believe there is or is not a bottle of wine in this display that is the same as,or comes from the same source,that is,the same winery that puts out the wine in the advertisement that you just looked at of those subjected to the test cell,percent responded in the affirmative to the proposed question,and percent identified chateau de leelanau as the wine they believed matched the ad.of those who selected chateau de leelanau,percent justified their belief on the basis of the use of the name leelanau in both the leelanau cellars ad and on the chateau de leelanau bottle.among the individuals who did not identify a match between the wine in the ad and a wine in the display,percent nevertheless believed that there was a relationship,sponsorship,or association between the winery in the ad and the winery producing one of the bottles in the display.eight percent of those individuals identified chateau de leelanau only as the associated wine.by contrast,only percent of those individuals exposed to the control cell identified bel lago as coming from the same or a related source as leelanau cellars and reached that conclusion based on similarities in the labels.after adjusting her results for survey noise or guessing,parikh concluded that,the net confusion level ranged between percent and percent.
the district court permitted the admission of the parikh study,but refused to give parikh survey significant weight,citing three reasons the universe of respondents was overbroad and failed to include individuals who were potential purchasers of b r wines the survey did not replicate conditions that consumers would encounter in the marketplace and the survey questions were suggestive and misleading.these were legitimate bases for declining to rely heavily on the findings of the parikh study.the district court correctly recognized that the study failed to limit the respondent population to those persons likely to purchase defendant products.see scott fetzer house of vacuums,cir stating that in a trademark infringement action where a survey is used,the appropriate universe should include a fair sampling of those purchasers most likely to partake of the alleged infringer goods or services internal quotation marks omitted.although the study included adults who had or were likely to purchase a bottle of wine in the to price range,there was no attempt to survey only those people who would purchase moderately priced wines produced in the state of michigan,undoubtedly a distinct group.nor was the survey limited to wine purchasers who acquire wine through wine tasting rooms,the primary distribution source of b r.the district court was also correct in concluding that the study failed to replicate actual market conditions.b r sells its wines almost exclusively through its tasting rooms.thus,it is unlikely that a purchaser of chateau de leelanau would find herself faced with the need to distinguish among various wines or,having walked into a b r tasting room,erroneously believe that she was in fact at leelanau cellars.
these deficiencies undermine the persuasiveness of the parikh survey.where a survey presented on the issue of actual confusion reflects methodological errors,a court may choose to limit the importance it accords the study in its likelihood of confusion analysis.see borinquen biscuit trading,cir noting as to a consumer survey submitted in trademark litigation that the small sample size and large margin of error combined to cast considerable doubt on its statistical integrity ashland oil,wl at it is the trial court responsibility to determine the probative value of a consumer survey,and it is appropriate for the tri
