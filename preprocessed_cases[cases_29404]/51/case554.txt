following a bench trial,the court found that rights to the trademark zankou chicken were validly assigned to two trusts,and that the trusts properly and effectively directed the distribution of the trademark rights to the three adult children of the trustor.we affirm the trial court order.
factual and procedural background 
rita iskenderian brought a petition under probate code section,seeking a determination concerning the ownership of the trademark or trade name zankou chicken.she alleged that a trust created by her late,markrid iskenderian,purporting to distribute the rights to the trademark equally among her markrid three children,was ineffective because the trademark was not the property of the trust.she alleged her late husband mardiros,markrid son,held all rights to the trademark at the time of his death,and she rita is now the exclusive owner of the mark.
a bench trial elicited these facts.vartkes and markrid iskenderian opened a chicken restaurant called zankou chicken in beirut,lebanon,many years ago.vartkes and markrid had three children a son mardiros and two daughters,dzovig and haygan.we refer to members of the iskenderian family by their first names for sake of clarity.in the early,the iskenderians vartkes,markrid,mardiros and rita emigrated from lebanon to the united states,and dzorig and haygan eventually joined them.
when they came to the united states,the family opened the first zankou chicken restaurant in hollywood dubbed by the family as zankou in honor of the original restaurant in beirut.the business filed taxes as a partnership from to,the father with a percent interest and the son with a percent interest.no written partnership agreement existed.the mother markrid,who created the garlic sauce for which zankou chicken is known,worked in the hollywood restaurant along with her husband and son.in april,the partnership registered the zankou chicken trademark with the state of california.
mardiros wanted to expand the family business by opening restaurants in other locations,but his parents did not wish to do so.as a result,the partnership was dissolved in september or october of.according to the family accountant,ara baltazar,vartkes paid his son mardiros for his share of the partnership.after the dissolution,the parents continued to operate the hollywood restaurant,and mardiros obtained his parents blessing to open additional restaurants of his own.beginning in,mardiros opened zankou in glendale,followed later by zankou chicken restaurants in van nuys,anaheim and pasadena.mardiros retained the profits from the additional restaurants,and his parents retained the profits from the hollywood location.vartkes died in,and his widow markrid continued to operate the hollywood restaurant.
in september,mardiros applied to register the zankou chicken service mark in the united states patent and trademark office,declaring in the application he was the owner of the mark and no other person had the right to use it.the mark was registered as of may.baltazar testified mardiros mother was very disturbed when she later found out about mardiros action.the registration of the mark was canceled on december.
the zankou chicken enterprise continued to be operated cooperatively after the dissolution of the partnership.mardiros coordinated his operation of the newer locations with the hollywood location operated by his mother.logos and signage were consistent among all stores,with menus at one location listing contact information for all other zankou locations.all the restaurants served the same basic fare,including the signature zankou garlic sauce,which a single family member prepared at the hollywood location and supplied to all the other zankou restaurants.mardiros sister dzovig worked as manager of mardiros zankou in glendale.according to his widow rita loyal but testimony,mardiros developed various innovations and improvements that were also adopted at the hollywood venue.all zankou restaurants purchased chicken from the same source under the same contract.
after vartkes death in,his wife markrid created a living trust trust.she conveyed her sole ownership interest in the hollywood restaurant to the trustees of the trust,the beneficiaries of which were her two daughters,dzovig and haygan.in,she amended the beneficiaries to include her son mardiros,but still later,on august,amended the trust to benefit only dzovig and haygan.on the same date,she wrote and notarized a letter to mardiros,explaining that he had reaped the benefits of his parents fortune,that she had passed on everything we have to you and have not considered much for your sisters,and that since he mardiros had four zankou chicken stores of his own,she felt she should designate the hollywood zankou chicken store for his sisters.
on february,markrid created a second trust trust.the trustees of the trust markrid and dzovig assigned to the trustees of the trust all of her right,title and interest in the restaurant business,the trade name,service mark,or trademark commonly known as zankou chicken.markrid trust provided for the distribution of specific gifts,including the hollywood zankou chicken store to dzovig and haygan,and a ll rights to the name zankou chicken to be divided equally among mardiros,dzovig and haygan,share and share alike.
meanwhile,the zankou chicken enterprise continued in the fashion described above for more than a decade after vartkes death,until tragedy struck in.mardiros,who had been diagnosed with cancer in,shot and killed his mother markrid,his sister dzovig,and himself on january.
on august,mardiros widow rita filed a petition asserting her exclusive ownership of the zankou chicken mark.rita alleged both haygan mardiros surviving sister and dzovig sons who succeeded to dzovig interest as a beneficiary of the trust agreed that rita owned the mark.she sought an order determining the mark was not property of the trust and directing the trustee to execute a quitclaim of the zankou chicken mark to her.haygan and dzovig sons opposed the petition.
at the bench trial,rita testified that after the partnership was dissolved in,her husband mardiros told her that he gave away the hollywood restaurant to his parents in return for exclusive rights to the zankou chicken trademark.the trial court did not believe rita,observing that her testimony was indistinct and,and no other evidence existed to support her claim mardiros and his parents made an exclusive trademark deal,which was illogical and improbable and unseen and unheard by any witness.further,the court stated and why would parents who had devoted their lives to building a business forfeit all their rights to the trademark embodying their lifelong work the evidence suggested no sensible reason,and i conclude that none existed.the event did not occur.
the trial court found the dissolution of the partnership was not a break or rupture in the business,and did not transfer exclusive business or trademark control from the parents to mardiros,but rather marked both a realignment of individuals duties and the beginning of a successful expansion of a single successful family business.the evidence showed a generally unified and cooperative family enterprise that operated cooperatively for decades until the tragedy in.the court concluded ownership of the mark zankou chicken remained with the unified and cooperative family enterprise on the day markrid iskenderian died.the court further found both trusts markrid created were proper and she validly transferred her rights to the zankou chicken mark to the trusts.consequently,the court gave effect to the provision in the trust stating that all rights to the zankou chicken mark were to be divided equally among mardiros,dzovig and haygan.
rita filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
rita argues the trial court order must be reversed because the trademark was not an asset of the trust,trademark law prohibits the joint ownership of a trademark,the trust transfer of the mark was an invalid assignment in gross because it was not accompanied by the goodwill of the business,and the evidence showed mardiros owned the trademark and his parents merely had an implied license from him to use the mark.we reject these contentions and affirm the trial court order.
a.the trademark was an asset of the trust.
rita asserts the trial court finding that the unified and cooperative family enterprise owned the trademark was unsupported by any evidence.she says it is undisputed that until the partnership dissolution in,the partnership owned the mark thereafter,either vartkes or mardiros must have owned it,not the family and the evidence showed mardiros owned it.rita argument founders at several points.most importantly,the court expressly found,as a matter of fact,that the mark was not transferred to mardiros when the partnership was dissolved.therefore,ownership of the mark either remained with the family enterprise as the trial court described it or with vartkes alone as the partner who retained the mark.in either case,on vartkes death,markrid succeeded to his rights and necessarily had community property rights of her own in the mark,and had the authority to transfer those rights to the trust.
rita resists the conclusion that mardiros did not own the trademark by adamantly asserting no unified family enterprise existed after.she claims no family enterprise could have existed because a joint enterprise requires the parties to it to share profits and losses,and mardiros and his parents did not do so the parents owned and retained the profits from the hollywood store,and mardiros owned and retained the profits from the four stores he opened.rita is mistaken.we know of no rule requiring a joint enterprise to share profits and losses equally among each participant in the enterprise.a joint enterprise exists when there is an agreement between the parties under which they have a community of interest,that is,a joint interest,in a common business undertaking,an understanding as to the sharing of profits and losses,and a right of joint control.connor great western sav.loan cal d,citation omitted.the family plainly had an understanding as to the sharing of profits and losses,namely that the parents would take the profits from zankou in hollywood,and mardiros would take the profits from the other stores he opened.substantial evidence supported the trial court implicit conclusion that all parties had a joint interest in and joint control of the zankou chicken enterprise as a whole,as well as an understanding as to profits and losses.no basis exists in law for reversing the trial court finding of a unified family enterprise in short,a family or joint enterprise existed.even in the absence of a joint enterprise,no legal basis exists for reversing the trial court factual finding that mardiros did not in any event obtain exclusive rights to the mark when the partnership dissolved.
rita next asserts that the trust,as a matter of law,had no interest in the zankou chicken mark to transfer to anyone.she contends that even if vartkes,rather than mardiros,acquired the mark when the partnership dissolved,the undisputed evidence establishes that the trademark was not an asset of the trust the trustees of which transferred it to the trust.for this proposition,rita points to the fact that the schedule of assets for the trust lists only an assignment executed by markrid,and the assignment merely conveys to the trust markrid interest in the hollywood restaurant,without expressly mentioning the trademark.as to this,rita is mistaken.a person interest in a business she owns necessarily includes the good will of the business,and it is well settled that a trademark is merely a symbol of good will.good will and its trademark symbol are as inseparable as siamese twins who can not be separated without death to both.mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,release,mccarthy.to suggest that markrid transfer of the hollywood restaurant to the trust did not include the good will in the necessarily the trademark that symbolizes that good contrary to both common sense and the law.see also callmann on unfair competition,trademarks and monopolies,may update,because a trademark can not be assigned without the good will to which it relates,a trademark will follow an assignment of the goodwill and pass under a general conveyance of all the assets and effects of a business,even though it is not specifically designated in the assignment.the trial court did not err in concluding markrid validly transferred her interest in the zankou mark to the trust.
b.the trial court order does not violate trademark law.
rita next asserts that,if this court concludes as we do that rita is not the sole owner of the trademark,we should reverse the trial court order with directions to conduct further proceedings to determine which party should have exclusive ownership of the mark,because the law does not permit joint ownership of this trademark.she also asserts markrid transfer of the mark was an unlawful assignment in gross.we disagree on both counts.
joint ownership of the mark is not unlawful.
the law does not prohibit joint ownership of a trademark.indeed,federal law expressly permits concurrent registrations of marks under certain circumstances,including when a court has finally determined that more than one person is entitled to use the same or similar marks in commerce.d.rita correctly points out that scholarly authorities have suggested that multiple ownership of rights in a single mark appears to be directly contrary to the basic definition of a mark as identifying and distinguishing a single seller goods or services,and that i f more than one unrelated person is selling goods under the same mark,such multiple,fragmented use can lead to customer confusion and deception.mccarthy,supra.however,mccarthy also observes that,o n the other hand,every other property right is capable of joint ownership by discrete entities,and that corporations,partnerships,joint ventures and marriages are combinations of individual persons.ibid.the determination of trademark joint ownership issues should be resolved,mccarthy suggests,by a balancing of two policies.these policies are the protection of customers,which requires that fragmented,multiple ownership of marks be avoided and prohibited where likelihood of confusion exists,and the contractual expectation policy,which requires that when parties create a contractual framework of joint ownership,their legitimate expectations should be honored.ibid.thus,even the scholarly authorities do not suggest that three or more family members can not jointly own a trademark.indeed,mccarthy observes 
one method of balancing is to presume that the parties contractual agreements will prevent confusion of customers.such a presumption would rest on the assumption that it is in the best of the parties to avoid fragmentation of their trademark image.in adopting such a presumption,the trademark trial and appeals board stated considering that the joint applicants for trademark registration here have a strong interest in protecting the validity and integrity of their marks and presumably would not engage in activity detrimental to the long established rights therein that confusion in trade would be inimical to their best interests and that the agreement reflects a joint effort governing the use of their marks,including a viable effort to avoid confusion,we can only conclude that confusion in trade is unlikely to occur,quoting in re diamond walnut growers,wl.
in this case,the policy of honoring the legitimate expectations of multiple family members owning the trademark would clearly outweigh any risk of customer confusion,as all members of the family have a strong interest in protecting the validity and integrity of the zankou chicken mark,and presumably would not engage in activity detrimental to their rights in the mark.ibid.
in short,rita assertion that joint ownership of the mark is expressly prohibit ed by trademark law is mistaken.accordingly,because joint ownership of a mark is not illegal,no basis exists for reversing the trial court order and directing the court to determine which party should have exclusive ownership of the mark any such proceeding would be,at best,premature.as the trial court concluded,despite the unhappiness within the iskenderian family,no evidence
