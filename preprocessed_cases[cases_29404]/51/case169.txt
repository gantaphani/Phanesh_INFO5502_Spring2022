the defendant appeals his conviction and sentence for six counts of trafficking in counterfeit goods,in violation of.for the following reasons,we affirm his convictions as to five counts,vacate his conviction as to the sixth count,vacate his sentence,and remand for resentencing.
facts and proceedings 
zheng xiao yi zheng owned xyz trading xyz,a discount retail store in houston,texas.in july,immigration and customs enforcement ice agents at the arrival port in norfolk,virginia,conducted an inspection of a container shipped from china and intended for xyz.ice agent stephanie mckinney thought that the stated value of the enclosed goods reflected on the invoice did not justify the high costs of shipping the container a full inspection showed that the container contents did not match the invoice.agent mckinney suspected that some of the goods in the container might be counterfeit,so she photographed them and sent the pictures to the respective trademark owners,gillette and underwriters laboratories ul the trademark owners indicated that the goods were not made by them,and agent mckinney seized the shipment on august.agent mckinney determined that another shipment from china to xyz would arrive in a few weeks,and she designated that shipment for interception.this second shipment,which also was determined to contain counterfeit goods,was seized on september,
because of the discovery of the counterfeit goods in the august shipment,ice agent jacqueline irwin,posing undercover as the owner of a party store,visited xyz on august.a salesperson named anna showed her around the store and answered her questions regarding several products,including batteries and extension cords.anna told agent irwin that the batteries were not as good as the real ones and not to sell them in the party store because she could get in trouble.anna said that most of xyz customers sold the batteries in flea markets because they were less stricter sic over there.anna told agent irwin that the extension cords were safe to use.agent irwin purchased several of the items,at a cost of cents to each,and delivered the items to another ice agent,steven lopez.agent irwin,again undercover,visited xyz a second time on september,and noticed several of the same items for sale.
agent lopez applied for and was granted a search warrant,which was executed on november.agent lopez and other agents seized batteries,extension cords,other products,toys,and business records identifying zheng as xyz original incorporator and sole shareholder.agent lopez also discovered two letters sent one week before the search from gillette and ul to xyz,addressed to zheng.the search did not uncover any counterfeit nike sandals or any letter from nike.
prior to the search,because the seized goods originated in china,agent lopez had suspected that illegal chinese immigrants may have been on the premises.accordingly,agent jerry liu,an ice agent fluent in mandarin chinese,accompanied the search party.during the execution of the search warrant,agent liu asked zheng for identification zheng had no documentation permitting him to be in the united states,and a computer check revealed that zheng had been ordered deported in.agent liu immediately placed zheng in custody.after reading zheng the proper miranda warnings,agent liu translated questions from agent lopez to zheng.both agents lopez and liu testified that zheng admitted that he knew the stuff that he was importing was fake.zheng also admitted that he was the owner of xyz and that he had received the letters.
at some point during the search,after seeing agent liu walk back inside from a cigarette break,zheng asked agent liu if he could have a cigarette.agent liu then took zheng outside where zheng,according to agent liu testimony,offered a bribe if agent liu would release him.agent liu also testified that zheng again admitted that some of the goods in his store were fake or counterfeit and that zheng said he would continue in this business any more if agent liu let him go.
subsequently,zheng was indicted on six counts of trafficking in counterfeit goods,in violation of during zheng trial in july,agents mckinney,irwin,lopez,and liu all testified.additionally,the government called as witnesses representatives from the companies,gillette,marvel,nike,and ul.the representatives identified various features of the seized goods that,in their view,violated the companies registered trademarks.additionally,the representatives testified as to why preventing counterfeiting was important to their businesses.the government also called as a witness ice agent nicole palestina,an import specialist,who testified to the retail value of the actual goods that the counterfeits mimicked.at the close of the government case,zheng moved for a judgment of acquittal,which the district court denied.the defense then rested without presenting any evidence.
the jury convicted zheng on all six counts of the indictment.the jury also made supplemental findings that the infringed goods had a retail value of and that the offenses related to the goods in counts four and five,bearing the ul symbol,involved a conscious or reckless risk of bodily injury.in february,after the supreme court decision in united states booker,d,the district court adopted the recommendations of the report psr and sentenced zheng to months imprisonment,the top of the applicable guideline range.
ii.discussion 
zheng appeals his convictions,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict and that the district court erroneously admitted various testimony.he also appeals his sentence,arguing that the district court erred in its interpretation and application of united states sentencing guideline.
sufficiency of the evidence 
standard of review 
since zheng timely moved for a judgment of acquittal,he preserved his sufficiency argument for appeal.see united states gonzales,cir,cert.denied,d.therefore,so long as a rational jury could have found the elements proven beyond a reasonable doubt,this court must uphold the jury verdict.united states adair,cir.this court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the government with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in support of the jury verdict.gonzales,at.the intent necessary to support a conviction can be demonstrated by direct or circumstantial evidence that allows an inference of an unlawful intent,and not every hypothesis of innocence need be excluded.united states aggarwal,cir.
zheng was convicted on six counts of violating a,which punishes w hoever intentionally traffics or attempts to traffic in goods or services and knowingly uses a counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods or services to prove a violation of the statute,the government must establish the defendant trafficked or attempted to traffic in goods or services such trafficking,or the attempt to traffic,was intentional the defendant used a counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods or services and the defendant knew that the mark so used was counterfeit.united states hanafy,cir.see also united states sultan,cir.
on appeal,zheng argues that the government did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt the fourth element,zheng knowledge of the counterfeit nature of the mark zheng presented the following evidence at trial through,which he argues proves he had no knowledge of any counterfeiting the vast majority of merchandise in the store was legitimate the counterfeit items were offered for resale at xyz in the same condition zheng had purchased them all counterfeit markings had been placed on the goods prior to arrival at xyz some or all of the real versions of the products were manufactured in china,where the counterfeit products originated some of the items had indications of legitimacy,such as safety warnings the letters from gillette and ul were written in english,a language that zheng neither read nor wrote he did not receive letters from marvel or nike the undercover visits and search of xyz did not uncover any items similar to the nike sandals and he was never given the option to inspect the second container seized by ice,which contained the counterfeit nike sandals.
in support of the jury verdict,the government points to the evidence tending to show zheng knew he was involved in the sale of counterfeit merchandise zheng declined to physically inspect the first of the seized containers prior to the execution of the search warrant,gillette and ul sent zheng letters,which he admitted receiving zheng employee,anna,told agent irwin that the batteries were not as good as the real ones and that she might get in trouble if she sold them in a retail store zheng admitted that he knew the stuff that he was importing was fake zheng admitted that he was the sole owner of xyz and zheng attempted to bribe agent liu and stated,if you let me go,i would continue in this business any more.though the government does not make the argument,the obviously poor quality of some of the goods tends to show that zheng knew those goods were counterfeit.
with respect to the first five counts of the gillette,ul,and marvel admissions and bribery attempt are particularly probative,and a jury could rely on them alone in determining his intent to traffic in certain counterfeit goods.the noticeably poor quality of most of the goods,purchased in a store owned by zheng,provides further support.as well,with respect to the letters,a jury could infer that,since zheng admitted receiving the letters,he also was able to determine their content.the jury,acting rationally,relied upon the specific and general evidence detailed above to convict zheng on five counts.therefore,the evidence is sufficient to support the jury verdict with respect to those counts.see gonzales,at.
however,no rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that zheng was guilty of the sixth count of conviction,attempting to traffic or trafficking in counterfeit nike sandals.zheng was a wholesale importer,with a warehouse and a store.the quantum of counterfeit items represented only a small percentage of his overall products.during the earlier undercover visits by agent irwin,no nike sandals or similar items were found.when agents executed the search warrant,the counterfeit goods in the store were batteries,flashlights,extension cords,hair clippers,and toys the store contained no counterfeit nike sandals,which would have been at least an indication that zheng knew what he was importing in the second container.it is undeniable that zheng knew some of the items in his store were counterfeit he admitted as much to government agents during the search,and he tried to bribe his way to freedom.however,given that zheng admission and bribe attempt came at the time his store was searched,the inferences of guilt that arise from his statements only reasonably pertain to the goods in his store in november to the counterfeit nike sandals seized at the customs depot on september.
the only evidence the jury heard regarding whether zheng might have known of the contents of the second container is that an invoice,found at xyz during the search,identified the contents as rubber slippers with a product identification number of.there is no record evidence indicating what that number description means the government simply failed to find out or put forth such evidence.
with such,at best,weak and attenuated circumstantial evidence,no rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that zheng attempted to traffic or trafficked in the counterfeit nike sandals.see united states alvarez,cir the government attempts to cobble together inferences from the testimony presented in support of the verdict while a rational jury might make the chain of inferences in support of the verdict a reasonable jury could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the elements of the crime have been proven.accordingly,we vacate this count of conviction 
rule b objections 
standard of review 
this court reviews for abuse of discretion a district court decision to admit or exclude evidence.united states cantu,cir.in a criminal case,rule b evidence must be strictly relevant to the particular offense charged.united states,cir internal quotation omitted.even if the district court abused its discretion,this court will not overturn a conviction unless the defendant was prejudiced by the erroneous admission of evidence.united states coleman,cir.
rule b prohibits evidence of other acts to prove the defendant conformity therewith.see fed.evid.b.however,the rule permits evidence for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident id.admission of rule b evidence must follow a test incorporating rules and the extrinsic evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant character and must have probative value that is not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect on the jury.see united states beechum,cir en banc.see also united states redd,cir.
rule b,however,only applies to extrinsic evidence and does not prohibit intrinsic evidence.this circuit has defined intrinsic evidence 
evidence of acts other than conduct related to the offense is intrinsic when the evidence of the other act and the evidence of the crime charged are inextricably intertwined or both acts are part of a single criminal episode or the other acts were necessary preliminaries to the crime charged.
united states freeman,cir internal quotations omitted.such evidence is admissible to complete the story of the crime by proving the immediate context of events in time and place.coleman,at.intrinsic evidence is permissible so that the jury may evaluate all the circumstances under which the defendant acted.united states royal,cir internal quotation omitted.
immigration status 
the government raised zheng immigration status several times at trial most conspicuously,in its rebuttal closing argument,the government mentioned that zheng,upon previously going through removal proceedings,was given the privilege of voluntarily leaving the united states.instead of doing so,he absconded.he took the easy way out.he ran.zheng counsel objected,and the district court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the comment.it not evidence in any way in this case.
zheng contends that introduction of his status as an illegal alien violated rule b because it was irrelevant and enormously prejudicial.zheng argument regarding the alleged prejudice rests on his belief that t here is strong public sentiment against illegal immigration in this country,especially in light of the september attacks.zheng cites no authority that would apply this generalized contention to his own case.
the government reasonably argues that the immigration arrest and the counterfeit charges arose from a single criminal episode.freeman,at internal quotation omitted.the government similarly contends that the jury was entitled to know the full context of zheng arrest,including why the arresting officer in this counterfeiting case was an immigration enforcement agent.prior to trial,in denying zheng in limine motion,the district court agreed to allow the prosecutor to mention zheng immigration status as the reason he was arrested.the district court did so because,at the time of the arrest,no warrant had been issued for zheng in connection with the counterfeiting charges,and he was initially taken into custody on the immigration violation.under this view,zheng immigration status would be intrinsic evidence not subject to rule b.
even applying rule b,though,the evidentiary admission does not require reversal.while zheng status as an illegal alien does not enjoy strong relevancy,any prejudice from the evidence was insubstantial.some hallmarks of highly prejudicial evidence include violent acts,acts greater in magnitude than the charged crimes,and acts that occupy more of the jury time than the evidence of the charged offenses,at citing united states fortenberry,cir.during voir dire,the district court extensively warned jurors against potential prejudice or bias.during the government closing argument,the district court sustained zheng objection when the government mentioned zheng immigration status and gave a limiting instruction to the jury,ordering it to disregard the government comment.we presume that the district court instructions limited,if not eliminated,any prejudicial effect.see adair,at t he district court mitigated any prejudicial effect by giving the jury a limiting instruction.ultimately,it can not be said that introduction of zheng immigration status is the type of information that is of a heinous nature,likely to incite the jury to an irrational decision.united states mcmahon,cir.accordingly,even if the district court abused its discretion,which we hold it did not,the lack of identifiable prejudice defeats zheng argument in favor of reversing his convictions.
bribery allegation 
at trial,agent liu testified that zheng offered a bribe if agent liu would allow him to escape.zheng contends that the district court decision to permit agent liu to testify to the uncharged attempted bribery violates fed.evid.b.we conclude it does not.
in united states posey,citing rule b,this court held that evidence of a attempted bribe of an arresting officer is permissible to establish guilt of the underlying crime charged,cir the trial court admitted testimony that on his way to jail the defendant offered a county sheriff to let him out of the car.this attempt to bribe a government official in order to escape shortly after arrest was clearly admissible as evidence of guilt.see also united states paccione,cir these statements by the defendant,which the jury was plainly free to interpret as offering bribes,were relevant to show a consciousness of guilt and thereby to cast doubt on his defense.united states,cir collecting cases and citing posey.here,zheng main argument,on appeal as at trial,is that he did not know the goods were counterfeit.his bribery attempt is relevant and highly probative of intent,knowledge,and absence of mistake.since the bribery attempt was properly admitted under rule b,the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to exclude it.
hearsay objections 
standard of review 
as previously discussed,a district court evidentiary decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion.cantu,at.such decisions include admission of statements under rule d d.united states sudeen,cir.even if the reviewing court holds that the district court abused its discretion,the decision is reviewed for harmless error.united states ragsdale,cir united states summers,cir employing harmless error analysis in refusing to reverse a conviction even though the district court erred under rule d d.
anna statements 
at trial,agent irwin testified that anna,an xyz employee,made several statements tending to show that anna knew the goods at issue were not of regular merchantable quality.zheng objected,arguing that the statements were testimonial hearsay inadmissible under crawford washington,d.the government argued in favor of admissibility under rule.the district court,relying on rule d d overruled the objection on the basis that the statement is not hearsay because the statement is one that this party,who is an agent of your defendant,is permitted to make and permitted to make within the scope of her employment.
assuming that rule d d survived crawford the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting agent irwin testimony regarding anna statements.anna statements fall squarely within rule d d and are admissible.assuming,however,that error occurred,we must determine whether any constitutional error resulting from admitting anna statement was harmless.
to determine whether the confrontation clause error was harmless,we consider the importance of the witness testimony in the prosecution case,whether the testimony was cumulative,the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points,the extent of otherwise permitted,and of course,the overall strength of the prosecution case.
united states edwards,cir quoting hafdahl johnson,cir.anna statements spoke directly to her own knowledge,not to zheng,of the inferior quality of some of the goods sold at xyz.the statements only corroborated the other physical evidence tending to show that the counterfeit items were visibly inferior to the actual items.since agent irwin testimony regarding anna statements was not particularly important to the government case,was cumulative to other evidence,and was corroborated by other evidence,any error in admitting the testimony was harmless.
reference to terrorism 
when describing how consumers are harmed by counterfeit goods,gillette trademark counsel testified about how counterfeit goods hurt consumers generally 
well,consumers a re not getting the benefit of their bargain,certainly.they not buying what they expect to get.they not getting any backup from the company if,in fact,something is problematic with the product.the product has a likelihood that it a health,safety or an environmental hazard.
in the case of batteries,batteries typically that are counterfeited contain mercury that been subsequently added in,which is a health and environmental hazard.they,also,are not typically made to proper specifications.they are not vented.they are an explosion hazard typically.
in addition,you hurt are not being paid by people who are dealing with counterfeiters so,your taxes are going to be increasing.evidence is increasing ly clear that the source of counterfeits is a money source for organized crime in terrorism.these ties have been made in the congress through interpol testimony.so,there is sic a lot of reasons why it not a victimless crime.
zheng immediately objected at trial on both hearsay and relevancy grounds.the district court overruled the objection,and the prosecutor moved on to another question without further comment.on appeal,zheng contends that this terrorism reference,in the current war on terror climate,is so prejudicial as to require reversal.zheng cites no authority in support of his conclusory contention.
as the government notes,and as a review of the transcript proves,nowhere else in the trial did anyone reference terrorism the government did not reference it even in closing arguments.the entirety of this small portion of the witness testimony,furthermore,shows that the witness was listing general reasons why counterfeiting hurts consumers.the witness discussed health,safety,environmental,and tax reasons before mentioning a possible terrorism connection.at no point did the witness attempt to connect zheng specifically with international terrorism or conclude that sales of chinese counterfeits in particular aid terrorists.assuming that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the testimony,zheng fails to show any prejudice from the isolated comment.
since we vacate a conviction that contributed to zheng sentence,we necessarily must remand this case for resentencing.with that fact in mind,it is not strictly necessary for us to review any other sentencing errors.nonetheless,to prevent the district court from again erroneously applying the guidelines on remand,we address zheng sentencing arguments as they relate to the five counts of conviction we affirm.see united states,cir addressing additional sentencing issues i n the interest of judicial efficiency and to provide guidance on remand.

infringement amount 
b requires the district court to increase a defendant base offense level pursuant to the infringement amount.the infringement amount is the retail value of the infringing item,the sale price of the counterfeit item itself,except in certain enumerated situations that call for using the retail value of the infringed item,the sale price of the legitima
