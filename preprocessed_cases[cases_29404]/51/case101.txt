opinion of the court 
we decide whether the district court abused its discretion in declining to award attorneys fees to a prevailing party in an unfair competition suit.this is a discretionary decision,and it turns on whether the court believes that the case is,in the words of the lanham act,exceptional.in holding that the court did not abuse its discretion here,we emphasize that the term exceptional is not,as the plaintiff seems to suggest,a throwaway.rather,it calls for a district court to determine whether it finds a defendant conduct particularly to alter the general american rule that parties to litigation pay their own attorneys fees.we therefore affirm.

greg fornario and tyler green sports 
greg fornario ran a business called tyler green sports.a former bartender at a sports bar,fornario decided in the late to start a sports handicapping business.handicappers are the stock analysts of the sports gambling world they provide information to sports bettors.according to fornario,he saw this as an easy way to make money,and so he acquired an number,took out an ad in the paper,and waited for the calls to come in.there was a,however,with his number,and so he discontinued the business after running the advertisement for only one day.he had no financing and was in no position to advance the business additional money from his personal assets.
fornario did,however,market this venture as tyler green sports.he testified that the business was never affiliated with anyone named tyler or green.rather,he purportedly came up with green because handicapping businesses,he said,typically have some reference to money in their names.green is,of course,the color of money,so it fit.fornario then tried to come up with something catchy to put with green.he settled on tyler,he claimed,because he is an aerosmith fan,and stephen tyler is the group lead singer.thus,tyler green sports.he testified that at the time he had never heard of tyler green the baseball player.he admitted,however,to being a fan of all sports except hockey.the philadelphia teams have no allure for him,as he is a new york native.he described himself as a diehard yankees fan.while all of this is more than a mite shaky,it is fornario story,and he is sticking to it.
in,fornario,his handicapping business long defunct,resumed using the name tyler green sports in trade.this time,he used it as the name of an entertainment promotion company.specifically,the company made money by coming up with event ideas,putting them together,and selling them to venues.for example,it promoted a number of philadelphia eagles pep rallies by lining up player appearances,taking care of decorations and advertising,and selling the events to sports bars.it also did traditional party planning.the company used the website to advertise its services.fornario incorporated the company in pennsylvania,and registered to it the name tyler green sports.before registering the name,he testified that he engaged an attorney to do a trademark search.according to fornario,this search revealed that the name tyler green sports was not registered to any business or person.tyler green sports never achieved significant commercial success.
c.this litigation 
in october tyler green agent rex gary discovered that a local business was using the name tyler green sports.after investigating its activities,he phoned the company and spoke to fornario.he confirmed that the business was not affiliated with anyone named tyler or green,and on that basis demanded that fornario cease trading under the name.when fornario declined,green attorneys sent formal cease and desist letters in february and march following the second letter,fornario offered to stop using the name in return for.according to green attorneys,fornario represented that this figure corresponded with the money he had spent on tyler green merchandise.fornario,on the other hand,contends that it was merely an opening settlement offer.the evidence shows that fornario did not spend even ten percent of that amount on merchandise.green balked at the offer and filed suit in the district court.
in his answer,fornario denied liability and asserted a counterclaim of libel against green and his attorneys.specifically,fornario alleged that accusing him in the february letter of using tyler green name to sell alcohol and sex libelously insinuated that he was involved in,to be euphamistic,warren profession.green responded with a rule motion,and fornario withdrew the counterclaim.within two weeks of the answer,fornario signed a consent decree in which he agreed to stop using the name tyler green in trade.the action continued on the issues of damages,costs,and attorneys fees.
green proceeded with discovery,but his efforts trailed off,and the district court dismissed the case for failure to prosecute in january.on green motion,the court reinstated it and,on the basis of the record evidence,awarded costs.the court refused,however,to award attorneys fees,and green appeals that denial to us 
ii.whether this case is exceptional 
though as the law that regulates trademark infringement,the lanham act,also prohibits other forms of unfair competition specifically,creates civil liability for misdescribing goods in commerce,importing mislabeled goods,diluting the value of a famous mark,and cybersquatting a d.here,green asserted claims of misdescription,dilution,and cybersquatting.
the lanham act allows a prevailing plaintiff to recover costs,along with damages and profits,as a matter of course.a.but it allows a recovery of attorneys fees only in exceptional cases.a the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.
determining whether a case is exceptional is a process.first,the district court must decide whether the defendant engaged in any culpable conduct.ferrero,ozak trading,cir.we have listed bad faith,fraud,malice,and knowing infringement as examples of the sort of culpable conduct that could support a fee award.see also securacomm consulting,securacom,cir.moreover,the culpable conduct may relate not only to the circumstances of the lanham act violation,but also to the way the losing party handled himself during the litigation.securacomm,at.second,if the district court finds culpable conduct,it must decide whether the circumstances are exceptional enough to warrant a fee award.see ferrero,at noting that the court may consider factors other than the defendant culpable conduct,such as the closeness of the liability question and whether the plaintiff suffered damages.in sum,a district court may not award fees without a finding of culpable conduct,but it may decline to award them despite a finding of culpable conduct based on the totality of the circumstances.
here,green alleges two basic categories of culpable conduct fornario knowing infringement,and his failure to stop at green request.we deal with each in turn.
knowing infringement 
green alleges that fornario knew his name and intentionally used it to profit from green goodwill.fornario,of course,denies this,and in its memorandum opinion the district court was unwilling to infer fornario culpable knowledge and intent from green regional recognition.that
