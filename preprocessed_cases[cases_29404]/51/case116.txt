on november,the acpa became law,making it illegal for a person to register or to use with the bad faith intent to profit from an internet domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to the distinctive or famous trademark or internet domain name of another person or company.see d supp.the act was intended to prevent cybersquatting,an expression that has come to mean the bad faith,abusive registration and use of the distinctive trademarks of others as internet domain names,with the intent to profit from the goodwill associated with those trademarks.see,wl,at.under the acpa,successful plaintiffs may recover statutory damages in an amount to be assessed by the district court in its discretion,from to per domain name.see d supp.in addition,successful plaintiffs may recover attorneys fees in exceptional cases.see id.at a.

in deciding whether to grant a permanent injunction,the district court must consider whether the moving party has shown actual success on the merits the moving party will be irreparably injured by the denial of injunctive relief the granting of the permanent injunction will result in even greater harm to the defendant and the injunction would be in the public interest.see aclu black horse pike reg l bd.of,cir.
to succeed on his acpa claim,shields was required to prove that joe cartoon is a distinctive or famous mark entitled to protection zuccarini domain names are identical or confusingly similar to shields mark and zuccarini registered the domain names with the bad faith intent to profit from them.see d a sporty farm sportsman market,cir 
under d a ii i and ii,the district court first had to determine if joe cartoon is a distinctive or famous mark and,therefore,is entitled to protection under the act.the following factors may be considered when making this inquiry 
a the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark b the duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the goods or services with which the mark is used c the duration and extent of advertising and publicity of the mark d the geographical extent of the trading area in which the mark is used e the channels of trade for the goods or services with which the mark is used f the degree of recognition of the mark in the trading areas and channels of trade used by the marks owner and the person against whom the injunction is sought g the nature and extent of use of the same or similar marks by third parties.
shields runs the only joe cartoon operation in the nation and has done so for the past fifteen years.this suggests both the inherent and acquired distinctiveness of the joe cartoon name.in addition to using the joe cartoon name for fifteen years,shields has used the domain name as a web site since june to display his animations and sell products featuring his drawings.the longevity of his use suggests that joe cartoon has acquired some fame in the marketplace.the new york times ran a page one story that quoted shields and cited joe cartoon.see andrew pollack,show business embraces the web,but cautiously,times,at.
joe cartoon have been sold across the country since at least the early,and its products appear on the web site of at least one nationally known retail chain,spencer gifts.shields has advertised in an online humor magazine with a circulation of about million.the joe cartoon web site receives in excess of visits per month,bringing it wide publicity.according to shields,also generates considerable interest in the joe cartoon site.shields trades nationwide in both real and virtual markets.the web site gives joe cartoon a global reach.shields cartoons and merchandise are marketed on the internet,in gift shops and at tourist venues.the joe cartoon mark has won a huge following because of the work of shields.in light of the above,we conclude that joe cartoon is distinctive,and,with hits a month,the web site qualifies as being famous.therefore,the trademark and domain name are protected under the acpa.
under the act,the next inquiry is whether zuccarini domain names are identical or confusingly similar to shields mark.the domain.com,and resemble,with a few additional or deleted letters,or,in the last domain name,by rearranging the order of the words.to divert internet traffic to his sites,zuccarini admits that he registers domain names,including the five at issue here,because they are likely misspellings of famous marks or personal names the strong similarity between these domain names and persuades us that they are confusingly similar.shields also produced evidence of internet users who were actually confused by zuccarini sites.see,pltf exh,at copy of an email stating,i tried to look up you r website yesterday afternoon and a protest page came up.will i have trouble entering the site at times because of this.
on appeal,zuccarini argues that registering domain names that are intentional misspellings of distinctive or famous names or typosquatting,his term for this kind of conduct is not actionable under the acpa.zuccarini contends that the act is intended to prevent cybersquatting,which he defines as registering someone famous name and trying to sell the domain name to them or registering it to prevent the famous person from using it themselves.this argument ignores the plain language of the statute and its stated purpose as discussed in the legislative history.
the statute covers the registration of domain names that are identical to distinctive or famous marks,but it also covers domain names that are confusingly similar to distinctive or famous marks.see d a ii i,ii.a reasonable interpretation of conduct covered by the phrase confusingly similar is the intentional registration of domain names that are misspellings of distinctive or famous names,causing an internet user who makes a slight spelling or typing error to reach an unintended site.the acpa legislative history contemplates such situations 
c ybersquatters often register marks to prey on consumer confusion by misusing the domain name to divert customers from the mark owner site to the cybersquatter own site,many of which are pornography sites that derive advertising revenue based on the number of visits,or hits,the site receives.for example,the committee was informed of a parent whose child mistakenly typed in the domain name for,expecting to access the content of the walt disney home page,only to end up staring at a screen of hardcore pornography because a cybersquatter had registered that domain name in anticipation that consumers would make that exact mistake.
wl,at emphasis added.
although zuccarini sites did not involve pornography,his intent was the same as that mentioned in the legislative history register a domain name in anticipation that consumers would make a mistake,thereby increasing the number of hits his site would receive,and,consequently,the number of advertising dollars he would gain.we conclude that zuccarini conduct here is a classic example of a specific practice the acpa was designed to prohibit.the district court properly found that the domain names he registered were confusingly similar.
the final inquiry under the acpa is whether zuccarini acted with a bad faith intent to profit from shields distinctive and famous mark or whether his conduct falls under the safe harbor provision of the act.section d b i provides a list of nine factors for us to consider when making this determination 
i the trademark or other intellectual property rights of the person,if any,in the domain name ii the extent to which the domain name consists of the legal name of the person or a name that is otherwise commonly used to identify that person iii the person prior use,if any,of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering of any goods or services iv the person bona fide noncommercial or fair use of the mark in a site accessible under the domain name v the person intent to divert consumers from the mark owner online location to a site accessible under the domain name that could harm the goodwill represented by the mark,either for commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or disparage the mark,by creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source,sponsorship,affiliation,or endorsement of the site vi the person offer to transfer,sell,or otherwise assign the domain name to the mark owner or any third party for financial gain without having used,or having an intent to use,the domain name in the bona fide offering of any goods or services,or the person prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct vii the person provision of material and misleading false contact information when applying for the registration of the domain name,the person intentional failure to maintain accurate contact information,or the person prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct viii the person registration or acquisition of multiple domain names which the person knows are identical or confusingly similar to marks of others that are distinctive at the time of registration of such domain names,or dilutive of famous marks of others that are famous at the time of registration of such domain names,without regard to the goods or services of the parties and ix the extent to which the mark incorporated in the person domain name registration is or is not distinctive and famous within the meaning of subsection c of this section.
zuccarini conduct satisfies a number of these factors.zuccarini has never used the infringing domain names as trademarks or service marks thus,he has no intellectual property rights in these domain names.see id.at b i i.the domain names do not contain any variation of the legal name of zuccarini,nor any other name commonly used to identify him.see id.at b i ii.zuccarini has never used the infringing domain names in connection with the bona fide offering of goods or services
