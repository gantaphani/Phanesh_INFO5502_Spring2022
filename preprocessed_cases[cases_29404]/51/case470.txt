applicants pamela geller and robert spencer appellants appeal from the trademark trial and appeal board board refusal to register the mark stop the islamisation of america in connection with the recited services of understanding and preventing terrorism.the board found the mark contains matter which may disparage a group of persons in violation of a of the trademark act.because the board finding is supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law,this court affirms.
background 
in february,appellants filed an application to register the mark stop the of america in connection with p roviding information regarding understanding and preventing terrorism.the examining attorney refused the application on january,on the ground that the mark may be disparaging to american muslims pursuant to a of the trademark act,a.appellants filed an appeal to the board,which affirmed the a refusal.in reaching this conclusion,the board considered the likely meaning of the mark,and then determined whether that meaning was likely to disparage a substantial composite of the referenced group.quoting in re lebanese arak.
the board found the term islamisation,as used in the mark,had two likely meanings the conversion or conformance to islam the religious meaning,and a sectarianization of a political society through efforts to make it subject to islamic law the political meaning,alteration in original.the religious meaning was supported by dictionary definitions and evidence of how the term was used in the marketplace,and the board found this meaning was more reflective of the public current understanding of the term.the political meaning of islamisation,in turn,was supported by various publications by professionals,academics and religious and legal experts.such evidence was less widely available and not necessarily reflective of the general public understanding of islamisation.nevertheless,the board found it established a second meaning of islamisation,at least to academic,professional,legal and religious experts.
the board determined the mark may be disparaging to american muslims under both meanings of islamisation.with respect to the religious meaning,the board found the mark was disparaging to american muslims because t he admonition in the mark to stop sets a negative tone and signals that islamization is undesirable and is something that must be brought to an end in america.moreover,the board found appellants proposed use of the mark for understanding and preventing terrorism resulted in a direct association of islam and its followers with terrorism.because the majority of muslims are not terrorists and are offended by being associated as such,the board determined the mark was disparaging under the religious meaning of islamisation.
the board also found the mark would be disparaging under the political meaning of islamisation.it determined that even this narrower definition does not mandate the use of violence or terrorism,so the application suggestion that political islamisation must be stop ped to prevent terrorism would be disparaging to a substantial composite of american muslims.the board accordingly affirmed the examining attorney refusal to register the mark under a of the trademark act.
appellants filed this timely appeal.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a b.
discussion 
on appeal,appellants argue there is no substantial evidence to support the board finding that the proposed mark may be disparaging in violation of a of the trademark act.they contend the board improperly relied on arbitrary and anecdotal evidence in determining the mark meaning and in finding that meaning may disparage american muslims.appellants br.
section a of the trademark act provides that the board may refuse an application when the trademark c onsists of or comprises matter which may disparage persons,living or dead,institutions,beliefs,or national symbols,or bring them into contempt,or disrepute.a emphasis added.although neither party was able to identify a prior case in this court or its predecessor setting forth the legal analysis for a a refusal based on disparagement,all parties agree the proper inquiry was set forth by the board in in re lebanese arak 
what is the likely meaning of the matter in question,taking into account not only dictionary definitions,but also the relationship of the matter to the other elements in the mark,the nature of the goods or services,and the manner in which the mark is used in the marketplace in connection with the goods or services and 
if that meaning is found to refer to identifiable persons,institutions,beliefs or national symbols,whether that meaning may be disparaging to a substantial composite of the referenced group.
in re lebanese arak,at see also harjo pro football,rev on other grounds,d.a mark may disparage when it dishonor s by comparison with what is inferior,slight s,deprecate s,degrade s,or affect s or injure s by unjust comparison.pro football,harjo,d,quoting harjo,at.
the determination that a mark may be disparaging is a conclusion of law based upon underlying factual inquiries.in re mavety,applying that standard with respect to whether a mark is scandalous under a.the board factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence,while its ultimate conclusion as to registrability is reviewed de novo.in re fox.
the first prong of the disparagement test determines the likely meaning of the matter in question.in re lebanese arak,at.the board found the term islamisation used in appellants mark has two likely meanings the religious meaning and the political meaning on appeal,appellants argue the board ignore d the overwhelming evidence in the record that the term islamisation has only been used in the public domain to refer to a political and military process replacing civilian laws with islamic religious law.appellants br.emphasis added.
to the extent appellants argue the political meaning of islamisation is the sole likely meaning under prong one,they are incorrect.the board relied on three separate types of evidence in support of the religious meaning.first,it considered dictionaries that listed the primary definition of islamize as to convert or conform to islam.quoting,islamize,as retrieved on,j.islamize,yourdictionary,http as retrieved on,see also the definitions indicate that islamization is the noun form of the transitive verb islamize.next,the board considered certain essays posted on appellants website,which were featured immediately underneath the website stop the islamization of america banner.two of these essays opposed construction of mosques in the united states,and another essay discussed an ad campaign to provide assistance to muslims considering leaving the islamic faith.finally,the board considered readers comments posted on appellants website as reflect ive of the website message of stopping the spread of islam in the united states.
appellants do not challenge the board reliance on online dictionaries,but instead assert error in the remainder of the board analysis of islamisation.they argue the board improperly relied on irrelevant essays and arbitrarily selected anonymous comments posted to appellants blog.appellants br.
appellants contend the essays posted on their website do not advocate suppression of the islamic faith,but only oppose political islamisation.the board disagreed,as do we.the first essay they discuss is titled stop the islamisation of america mosque manifesto all mosques are not created equal,a handy guide to fighting the muslim brotherhood.appellants characterize this essay as merely opposing islamist muslim brotherhood groups that use as a political tool to accomplish islamisation.appellants br.at.this is an overly narrow interpretation of the mosque manifesto essay,which provides tips for opposing huge monster mosque s proposed in people communities.although portions of the essay refer to political forces such as the muslim brotherhood,the article as a whole implicates islam more generally.see,quoting a source that of american mosques were controlled by extremists as we have been reminded time after time after grisly islamic terror plots have been exposed,there is always
