carefirst of maryland,a health maintenance organization associated with blue cross blue shield,brought this trademark infringement and dilution action against first care,a small group of family care physicians located in southeastern virginia.the district court granted summary judgment to first care.we affirm.
the carefirst mark first appeared in,when metropolitan baltimore healthcare began marketing prepaid health care plans under the carefirst name to approximately of its maryland members.in the of the carefirst mark registered carefirst as a trademark,service mark,and collective membership mark with the united states patent and trademark office.blue cross and blue shield of maryland acquired the carefirst mark in.approximately members then held carefirst plans,but by that number had declined to.
in late,blue cross and blue shield of maryland agreed with other blue cross blue shield affiliates to operate jointly and collectively under the carefirst mark.this umbrella organization has spent millions of dollars advertising its mark in all of its advertisements,it denominates itself carefirst bluecross blueshield,often accompanied by the distinctive blue cross blue shield logo.by the time carefirst initiated the present action in march,carefirst had become the largest health maintenance organization in the states with million members.at least eighty percent of these members reside in carefirst direct service area,which consists of maryland,delaware,the district of columbia,and northern virginia.
first care is a virginia professional corporation of primary care physicians.in late,it registered its corporate name with the state.since,first care has operated using the first care mark.first care offers traditional family medical services in portsmouth and chesapeake,virginia,which are close to but outside of carefirst direct service area.approximately carefirst members reside in first care trade area.first care currently consists of eleven physicians operating out of seven offices at its height,it had twelve physicians and nine offices.
first care name and a description of its services appeared several times in a series of trademark search reports commissioned by carefirst from january through november.carefirst,however,took no action against first care until,when first care submitted a deposition in a separate trademark infringement suit that carefirst was pursuing against another party.
on february,after determining that at least ninety carefirst members had received medical services from first care,carefirst sent first care a letter.when first care refused to give up use of its mark,carefirst brought this action,alleging that since first care had infringed on and diluted carefirst trademark,see,a,c,and seeking million in damages.in april,first care applied for state registration of its mark in virginia.
after extensive discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to first care.see carefirst of,first care,d.the court found that carefirst had failed to show that a likelihood of confusion existed between the firstcare and carefirst marks and so rejected carefirst infringement claim.id.additionally,the court concluded that carefirst had failed to offer evidence that its mark was a famous and distinctive mark prior to,when first care began operations,and for this reason rejected carefirst dilution claim.id.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.thus,although first care argues otherwise,we need not defer to factual findings rendered by the district court.see patsy brand,realty,cir seamons snow,cir.
to demonstrate trademark infringement under the lanham act,a plaintiff must prove,first,that it owns a valid and protectable mark,and,second,that the defendant use of a reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of that mark creates a likelihood of confusion.a petro stopping,james river petroleum,cir.indisputably,carefirst has established the first element because more than five years have passed since its registration of the carefirst mark with the united states patent and trademark office,the protectability of its mark has become incontestable.see,b park n fly,dollar park fly,d.only the second of disputed here.
likelihood of confusion exists if the defendant actual practice is likely to produce confusion in the minds of consumers about the origin of the goods or services in question.kp permanent,lasting impression i,d see also,l l wings,cir.in conducting the analysis,a court does not indulge in a prolonged and minute comparison of the conflicting marks in the peace and quiet of judicial chambers,for this is not the context in which purchasers are faced with the marks.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed hereinafter mccarthy.rather,we look to how the two parties actually use their marks in the marketplace to determine whether the defendant use is likely to cause confusion.of,whataburger,cir 
to determine if a likelihood of confusion exists,we look to the strength or distinctiveness of the plaintiff mark as actually used in the marketplace the similarity of the two marks to consumers the similarity of the goods or services that the marks identify the similarity of the facilities used by the markholders the similarity of advertising used by the markholders the defendant intent and actual confusion.pizzeria uno temple,cir.not all of these factors are of equal importance,nor are they always relevant in any given case,at.however,evidence of actual confusion is often paramount in the analysis,lyons,morris costumes,cir.it certainly is of critical importance in the case at hand,as evidenced by the attention given to it by the parties.accordingly,we turn first to analysis of that factor.
carefirst concedes that the only evidence it has proffered of actual confusion is a survey by myron helfgott,which carefirst commissioned for this litigation the helfgott survey interviewed people by telephone,drawn from a list of carefirst members in or near first care place of business.in the unaided portion of the survey,the surveyors asked the respondents whether they had heard of first care,whether they thought first care was related to or affiliated with another health organization,and whether they thought first care needed permission from another health organization to use its name.the surveyors then repeated these unaided questions,focusing on carefirst on this second pass.in the aided portion of the survey,the surveyors asked the respondents whether they thought first care and carefirst were related to or affiliated with each other.
the helfgott survey does not supply evidence of actual confusion.at best,it shows merely a de minimis level of confusion.only two of the respondents had both heard of first care and thought that it was related to or affiliated with carefirst.one additional respondent had not heard of first care but,judging by its name alone,thought that it might be affiliated with carefirst.assuming that all three of these respondents were confused,the survey only shows a confusion rate of percent,hardly a sufficient showing of actual confusion.
carefirst argues that two other groups of respondents should also be considered actually confused respondents who stated that first care was affiliated with blue cross blue shield and separate respondents who answered yes when asked in the aided portion of the survey whether carefirst and first care were related.we do not believe that the responses of either of these groups show actual confusion between carefirst and first care.carefirst offers no evidence besides mere speculation that when the respondents indicated that first care was affiliated with blue cross blue shield,they were actually referring to carefirst.indeed,the only evidence on this point suggests the opposite inference at least two other respondents who indicated first care affiliation with blue cross blue shield specified that they were thinking of anthem blue cross blue shield,and both parties agree that first care is part of anthem network.similarly,carefirst offers no evidence that the aided respondents were confused in a way relevant to the analysis.carefirst counsel admitted at oral argument that carefirst covers the expenses of members who receive medical treatment at first care clinics,and we know that carefirst has in fact done so for at least ninety of its members in southeastern virginia.the two entities therefore are related,and no evidence suggests that the aided respondents answers reflect anything other than this not of the relationship between the parties.
because we conclude that the helfgott survey has little probative value,carefirst lacks any evidence of actual confusion.although proof of actual confusion is not necessary to show a likelihood of confusion,the absence of any evidence of actual confusion over a substantial period of,approximately nine a strong inference that there is no likelihood of confusion.see scotch whisky ass majestic distilling,cir.this important factor thus weighs heavily against carefirst.
we next consider the strength of the plaintiff mark,a factor that carefirst emphasizes.the strength of a mark is the degree to which a consumer in the relevant population,upon encountering the mark,would associate the mark with a unique source.the strength of the trademark is evaluated in terms of its conceptual strength and commercial strength,walt disney,cir measuring a mark conceptual or inherent strength focuses on the linguistic or graphical peculiarity of the mark,perini perini,cir,considered in relation to the product,service,or collective organization to which the mark attaches.see search,llc,cir.the inquiry,by contrast,looks at the marketplace and asks if in fact a substantial number of present or prospective customers understand the designation when used in connection with a business to refer to a particular person or business enterprise.see perini,at quoting food fair stores,lakeland grocery,cir.
carefirst focuses on its registered mark carefirst,standing alone,and argues that this mark is both conceptually and commercially strong.the record evidence renders this argument untenable.
carefirst contends that its registered mark carefirst is conceptually strong simply because the text carefirst is assertedly suggestive,as defined by judge friendly classic delineation in abercrombie fitch hunting world,cir.the designation of carefirst as suggestive may or may not be correct,but this designation does not resolve the mark conceptual strength.this is so because many third parties in the health care field have previously used in their own marks the text of the carefirst mark.t he frequency of prior use of a mark text in other marks,particularly in the same field of merchandise or service,illustrates the mark lack of conceptual strength.pizzeria uno,at see also first sav.bank,first bank,cir amstar domino pizza,cir.a strong trademark is one that is rarely used by parties other than the owner of the trademark,while a weak trademark is one that is often used by other parties.universal money,am,cir quoting exxon.motor,cir.
here,the record undeniably reveals substantial use of the words care,carefirst,first,and first care in the health care industry.carefirst own thomson thomson trademark search reports state that many businesses across the country use these marks.in addition,first care has submitted dozens of web page from businesses named carefirst or first care,as well as an investigator report confirming that many businesses with these names are currently active.search,at finding a mark generic,or at most,descriptive based on web page,thomson thomson trademark search reports,media references,and other evidence of common usage.if the carefirst mark were truly a distinctive term,it is unlikely that so many other businesses in the health care industry would independently think of using the same mark or similar variants of it.that so many health care businesses have denominated themselves carefirst or first care indicates that carefirst is not a distinctive or unusual term in the industry,and hence not conceptually strong.
this evidence of extensive use also demonstrates that carefirst mark lacks commercial strength in many parts of the country.in addition,we find unpersuasive the other evidence that carefirst has adduced to show the commercial strength of its registered mark standing alone.carefirst points to the million it has spent on advertising in the region over the last decade,its membership of several million individuals,and hundreds of press articles that mention its mark.most of this evidence,however,does not involve carefirst registered mark standing alone.the record reveals that,at least since,company policy has mandated that carefirst registered mark carefirst always appear in public coupled with blue cross blue shield.this joint subject of carefirst publicity campaign for the last several appeared in all advertisements as well as in provider directories and marketing materials.in addition,carefirst registered mark,accompanied by the blue cross blue shield language,is usually presented in a corporate logo with a distinctive and a graphic of a blue cross and shield.this sophisticated logo appears to be the standard configuration that carefirst has used to communicate with the millions of new members it has attracted in the last several years.
carefirst evidence of strength thus consists almost entirely of materials that pair the carefirst mark with the blue cross blue shield language,usually in a sophisticated corporate logo this evidence does not show that carefirst registered mark,standing alone,has conceptual or commercial strength.
the public face of carefirst mark is also relevant in evaluating another similarity of the parties marks.to determine whether two marks are similar,we must examine the allegedly infringing use in the context in which it is seen by the ordinary consumer,at see also restatement third of unfair competition a i.the two marks at issue in this case are mirror images of one another thus,the bare text of the two is similar.but because the analysis looks to the actual use of competing marks,a comparison of the texts of the two marks alone is insufficient if the marks have different appearances in the marketplace.see luigino,stouffer,cir elvis presley,capece,cir.
the two marks at issue here have very different appearances in the marketplace because the carefirst mark is almost always paired with the blue cross blue shield language,while the first care mark is always presented by itself,or at most with the suffix in contrast to the accouterments surrounding carefirst mark in its public appearances,first care presents its mark plainly and without any graphics.
if one of two similar marks is commonly paired with other material,that pairing will serve to lessen any confusion that might otherwise be caused by the textual similarity between the two marks.see,autozone,tandy,cir lang retirement living pub,cir amstar,at.this effect is most significant when,as here,the allegedly infringed mark,carefirst,has little independent strength.because carefirst registered mark is weak,consumers encountering carefirst bluecross blueshield,on the one hand,and first care,on the other,are more likely to focus on the differences between the two,particularly when the most salient addition of bluecross blueshield is itself a prominent mark see mccarthy,supra,duluth mesabi publ g,cir conducting comparison of marks using duluth rather than alone because was a weak mark.thus,the substantial differences in the public presentations of these marks significantly reduce the likelihood of confusion,notwithstanding their textual similarity.see petro,at finding two uses of petro not confusing due to the marks different colors,different accompanying words,and different graphics.
as with the similarity of the marks,we measure the similarity of services with respect to each party actual performance in the marketplace.see,at although this factor does not particularly assist first care defense,neither does it aid carefirst.
the services offered by the parties here are no closer than the services we found dissimilar in petro.the defendant in that case only sold fuel,while the plaintiff offered multiple other services in addition to selling fuel.petro,at
