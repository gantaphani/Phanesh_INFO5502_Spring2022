bose corporation bose appeals from the decision of the trademark trial and appeal board board dismissing its opposition to the application of qsc audio products,qsc to register the mark powerwave for amplifiers and power amplifiers.the board concluded that there is no likelihood of confusion between powerwave and two of bose marks,acoustic wave and wave.bose,opposition,wl ttab.we have jurisdiction over bose appeal under a.because the board erred in several respects in its analysis of the likelihood of confusion between the marks in suit,in particular failing to accord fame to the bose marks,we reverse the board decision.
the bose acoustic wave mark is registered and used for a loudspeaker systems and music systems consisting of a loudspeaker system and amplifier and at least one of a radio tuner,compact disc player and audio tape cassette player and b loudspeaker systems.acoustic wave thus refers to a specific kind of loudspeaker system,one that includes one or more of a radio tuner,compact disc player,and audio tape cassette player.the mark also refers simply to loudspeaker systems without the narrowing reference to a radio tuner,disc player or tape cassette player.
the bose wave mark is registered and used for goods including radios,clock radios,audio tape recorders and players,portable radio and cassette recorder combinations,compact stereo systems and portable compact disc players.
bose also owns its house mark bose that frequently accompanies the acoustic wave and wave marks.for purposes of this litigation,qsc and the board accept that the bose house mark enjoys extensive public recognition and renown and in trademark parlance is therefore famous.
qsc applied to register the mark powerwave for e lectronic audio and video signal processing equipment,namely,amplifiers and power amplifiers.bose opposed qsc application on the ground that permitting qsc to apply the mark powerwave to its amplifiers would lead to a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of the amplifiers,due to the class of bose goods covered by its preexisting acoustic wave and wave marks.where a likelihood of confusion exists as to the origin of goods traveling under a particular mark,that mark can not be registered.see d granting authority to refuse registration to a trademark that so resembles a registered mark as to be likely,when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant,to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive lloyd food,eli.
in re dupont denemours,uspq ccpa,sets out numerous factors relevant to reaching a decision as to whether a likelihood of confusion exists with regard to competing marks.id.at,uspq at.each of the dupont factors presents a question of fact,findings with regard to which we test for substantial evidence when called into question on appeal.see recot becton,citing dickinson zurko,d,in re gartside.the ultimate question of whether a likelihood of confusion exists is,however,a question of law,an issue upon which we apply plenary review.id.citing giant food,nation foodservice,uspq.our precedent establishes that the determination of a likelihood of confusion does not require examination and findings as to each and every dupont factor.see kenner parker toys,rose art,explaining that different dupont factors may play dominant roles in determining likelihood of confusion depending on the evidence in each case.in practice,the scope of examination by the board in any particular case will ordinarily be established by the record presented by the parties.here,the ultimate legal question is framed by the inquiry into four of the dupont factors fame of the opposer mark or marks similarity or relatedness of the goods in question commonality of the channels of trade through which the goods in question pass and comparison for similarity of the marks themselves.the burden of proof rests with the opposer,hoover royal appliance,and thus it fell to bose to produce sufficient evidence to support the ultimate conclusion of likelihood of confusion.
the board decided that bose is not entitled to claim fame for its acoustic wave and wave marks,and that bose had failed to produce sufficient evidence to demonstrate similarity or relatedness of the goods in question.regarding the channels of trade,the board found commonality,but concerning the marks themselves,the board found distinct dissimilarity.on those findings of fact,the board unsurprisingly concluded that bose had failed to prove a likelihood of confusion,and therefore dismissed bose opposition.bose timely appealed to this court.
bose asserts that the board erred in its findings on each of the four dupont factors,save with regard to the channels of trade,and consequently that it merits an outright reversal of the board decision and a judgment that its opposition is sustained.qsc naturally disagrees with bose,arguing on each point in support of the board decision,save with regard to the channels of trade,for the reasons stated by the board.
we first examine the board decision with regard to the alleged fame of acoustic wave and wave,then turn to the issues of similarity or relatedness of the goods,channels of trade,and appearance of the competing marks.
fame of an opposer mark or marks,if it exists,plays a dominant role in the process of balancing the dupont factors,recot,at,at,and f amous marks thus enjoy a wide latitude of legal protection.id.this is true as famous marks are more likely to be remembered and associated in the public mind than a weaker mark,and are thus more attractive as targets for copyists.id.indeed,a strong mark casts a long shadow which competitors must avoid.kenner parker toys,at,at.a famous mark is one with extensive public recognition and renown.id.
direct evidence of fame,for example from widespread consumer polls,rarely appears in contests over likelihood of confusion.instead,our cases teach that the fame of a mark may be measured indirectly,among other things,by the volume of sales and advertising expenditures of the goods traveling under the mark,and by the length of time those indicia of commercial awareness have been evident.see,nina ricci,nina ricci for perfume,clothing and accessories million in sales,over million in advertising over years douglas,uspq,huggies for diapers over million in sales over years,million in advertising in one year specialty brands coffee bean,uspq,spice islands for teas,spices and seasonings million annually in sales for spices,million between and for tea,several million in advertising,in use for years giant food,nation foodservice,uspq,giant food for supermarket services and food products sales over billion in one year,considerable amounts of money in advertising,years use dupont,at,uspq at planters nut chocolate crown nut,uspq,ccpa peanut design for nuts and nut products million in sales,million in advertising over years.as the foregoing precedent illustrates,we have consistently accepted statistics of sales and advertising as indicia of fame when the numbers are large,we have tended to accept them without any further supporting proof.
our precedent has also recognized the interaction of fame and the similarity or relatedness of goods when assessing the likelihood of confusion.in recot,the goods in question edible dog food snacks sold under the mark fido lay,versus human snack food sold by the opposer under the mark were completely unrelated.for that reason,the board discounted the significance of the admitted fame of the mark.we held that the board erred in such discounting,stating,indeed,it is precisely these circumstances which demand great vigilance on the part of a competitor who is approaching a famous mark,for as the present case illustrates,the lure of undercutting or discounting the fame of a mark is especially seductive.id.at,at.
in this case,bose sought to prove the fame of its marks by reference to the volume of sales and advertising expenses of the products it sells and has sold under the acoustic wave and wave marks.it also sought to anchor the significance of those commercial indicia of fame with the record evidence of many critical assessments of the marked products that greeted their arrival in the marketplace and continued thereafter.
with respect to acoustic wave,the uncontested evidence before the board showed over years of use on the products covered by the mark,with annual sales of over million,which translates to approximately units sold annually,given the price per unit of record,and approximately units sold since the product debuted.bose has spent more than million annually to advertise the covered products.the text of virtually every advertisement for the product touts the advanced electronic concepts that produce the rich and full sound amplified from a relatively small device.such text is clearly written for sophisticated consumers who,given the price tag,are likely to appreciate the technological advances represented by the product.the acoustic wave mark appears on the product and its packaging along with the famous bose house mark.
bose has advertised the acoustic wave product nationwide in popular magazines and newspapers and with direct mail promotions sent to consumers.the product is sold directly from bose,from bose outlets and through independent mail order catalog companies such as american express,herrington,and.the record evidence demonstrates that the bose house mark frequently appears in the advertising and promotional materials.the product,however,is itself prominently identified as trademarked in the text of nearly every example of the record evidence.in the direct mail advertising and sales promotion material sent by bose through the mail,the portion of the communication that calls for the order to be placed only refers to the acoustic wave product with its trademark,with no reference to bose as a mark appearing on the order form.the consumer,when placing a order,thus asks for the trademarked product.
we thus are not faced with a record on which substantially every reference to the marked product is joined with reference to the famous house mark.instead,the consumer is presented through the advertising and other promotional material with frequent references to the marked product standing alone and apart from the famous house mark.the distinction between uniform coupling of the famous house mark with the product marks and communication to consumers that typically gives significant independent reference to the product apart from the house mark is important,because in the latter instance the consumer has a basis on which to disassociate the product mark from the house mark.
the acoustic wave product,a loudspeaker music system with amplifier and radio tuner and either tape cassette deck or compact disc player,was greeted with widespread critical attention upon introduction.the record is replete with product reviews,both in the popular daily press in major cities and in a wide variety of magazines that target the audience for audio products.the critical attention focused on the acoustic wave device was nationwide.examples cited in the record come from the boston herald,chicago tribune,metrowest business review,stereo guide,consumer electronics show daily,sound and vision,high fidelity,popular science,the atlantic,and chicago.the radically new product was described as to put it mildly,unique.the acoustic wave product received special attention in,when the inventor of the product was named inventor of the year by the intellectual property owners association.the acoustic wave product was identified as the commercial embodiment of the invention for which the honor was given.the celebrated radio commentator paul harvey,quoted in the widely circulated northwest airlines magazine,stated that amar bose is the thomas edison of our time.the magazine article profiled the inventor and showed a photograph of the acoustic wave product.
the wave product is a radio,which is available with a compact disc player.it sells in the range of,and has been in the marketplace since.this product has enjoyed vast commercial success,with current annual sales of million annual units at each,and sales since inception of million units at each.current annual advertising expenses are over million,with total advertising expenses since of over million.advertising for the wave radio also touts the technological feats of the product it too is directed at the market of knowledgeable consumers.as with the acoustic wave product,the advertising and promotional and sales materials for the wave product frequently use the famous house mark in conjunction with the wave product mark.from the record before the board and this court,it appears that bose follows the same policy in marketing the wave device as it does when marketing the acoustic wave device.the consumer receives information that clearly identifies the wave product as separately marked,and when the consumer purchases directly from bose,the transaction is on a form that identifies only the marked wave product.in nearly every record item of communication to the consumer concerning the wave product,there is prominent separate reference to the marked product.consequently,here again we have a record that supports consumer identification of the marked product apart from the famous house mark.
widespread critical attention comparable to that which greeted acoustic wave followed shortly after introduction of the wave radio.popular science magazine honored the wave radio with its best of what new award in,and business week magazine awarded the wave radio its best new product of.the record also discloses critical assessment of the wave product from many other widespread sources,including the chicago tribune,san francisco chronicle,lexington,radio world,robb report,united features syndicate,middlesex news,the christian science monitor,and the oregonian.in addition to the exposure to the wave product consumers received from these publications,the consumer was reminded of the critical assessments in direct mail communications from bose,which referred to those assessments.
notwithstanding the evidence regarding sales and advertising expenses for the products sold under the acoustic wave and wave marks and the voluminous evidence of nationwide critical notice of the marked products,the board concluded that bose had failed to carry its burden to prove fame for the two marks,and that the marks thus do not earn the broad scope of protection afforded by precedent.the board only referred to the sales and advertising data,and did not give any weight to the vast evidence of public notice given to the marked products.
the board relied on three points to explain its decision on fame.first,the board stated that bose had not introduced any direct evidence of consumer recognition of the fame of the marks.
second,the board stated that the bose house mark is used with the two product marks,and from that fact it concluded that 
absent additional evidence regarding the nature and extent of promotion or consumer perception of the marks wave and acoustic wave apart from the admittedly famous bose mark,we can not conclude that this evidence establishes the fame of these pleaded marks.
bose,slip op.at,wl.
third,the board discounted the sales and advertising evidence for the product marks,standing alone,because those indicia of fame had not been placed in any context from which to determine how substantial the figures are for these types of products.id.we address each of the board grounds separately.
as to the absence of any consumer surveys,we note that a footnote to the board own statement recognizes that direct evidence,such as surveys,is not required in order to determine whether a mark is famous.indeed,as noted above,virtually all of our precedent attributing fame to a mark has done so through indirect evidence of the extent to which a mark has earned fame in the consumer marketplace.the fact that little reference is made in our precedent to public consumer polls or surveys is not meant to suggest that such evidence is not probative.indeed,we think such direct evidence of consumer awareness of products and the marks they bear is preferable to indirect evidence of consumer recognition,from which inferences necessarily have to be drawn.but the absence of such evidence can not,standing alone,establish lack of fame.
