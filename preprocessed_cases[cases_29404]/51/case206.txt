nartron corporation nartron or the plaintiff,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant appellee,stmicroelectronics,st or the defendant on st claim of laches and genericness in nartron action for trademark infringement.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court order granting st motion for summary judgment on both claims,and dismissing nartron complaint alleging federal and state law claims of trademark infringement,dilution,and unfair competition.
background 
nartron is a michigan corporation with its principal place of business in reed city,michigan.nartron develops and produces advanced electronic devices including sensors,acoustic devices,displays,controls,harnesses and connectors,lamps,flashers and switches.
st is a delaware corporation having a principal place of business in carrollton,texas st manufactures and supplies semiconductors or microchips,and competes with numerous companies such as motorola,international rectifier and siliconix in the semiconductor industry.over the years,st has also manufactured products that combine power and intelligence on a single integrated circuit chip.
in april,nartron began using smart power as a trademark and in,it obtained a federally registered trademark for smart power for electrical relay assemblies in combination with electrical logic components and parts thereof.in,nartron broadened the identification of its goods to electrical power circuits in combination with electrical logic circuits and parts thereof.in,pursuant to,nartron filed an affidavit of incontestability with the united states patent and trademark office nartron alleges that over the years,it has expended significant time,effort and money advertising and promoting its smart power mark.as a result,nartron alleges that it has acquired a reputation as a provider of electrical components in connection with the smart power mark.this,according to nartron,distinguishes its products from those of its competitors.
in this action for trademark infringement,nartron alleges that st made infringing use of its smart power mark on several occasions.first,between and,nartron alleges that st made isolated use of nartron smart power mark.nartron asserts that in august,an st employee presented a paper entitled smart power application in multiple systems at a society of automotive engineers sae show.nartron further asserts that in october,st published a manual entitled smart power application manual.finally,in october,nartron claims that st used nartron smart power mark in an st product announcement published in the october,issue of electronic engineering times,and in an article published in the october,edition of electronic design.second,nartron alleges that after,st ran three advertisements,which nartron claims used its smart power mark in an infringing manner.nartron alleges that these ads emphasized the smart power mark,capitalizing or otherwise enhancing the two words.however,unlike previous uses,nartron alleges that these uses were not isolated.
st,on the other hand,alleges that it has always made continuous,use of the smart power mark.furthermore,st claims that it has consistently rejected nartron contentions regarding the validity of nartron smart power trademark.according to st,like the rest of the semiconductor industry,st has only used the term smart power to refer generally to technology that combines power transistors and control circuitry on a single integrated circuit.st alleges that since at least,it has manufactured and marketed products that contain integrated circuits which combine power circuits and logic circuits.st claims that its vipower products are illustrative of products that utilize or embody this smart power technology.st,for example,has described certain of its vipower products as follows the vipower mo process is a vertical smart power technology that allows a rugged power stage to be combined with analog and digital circuitry.see at emphasis added.st says that it uses the federally registered trademark vipower as well as its company clearly inform the reader that st is the source of its vipower products.indeed,claims st,the st name and st logo is prominently featured in the advertising,marketing and sales of st products,including those that fall within the smart power category.
after each of st uses,which nartron alleged infringed its trademark,nartron alleges that it took measures to stop the infringing activity.nartron claims,contrary to st assertions of continuous use,that after each of nartron objections,st ceased use of nartron smart power mark.st disagrees and instead contends that it clearly and unequivocally rejected nartron contentions regarding the legality of st use of the term smart power.
first,st notes,and nartron does not dispute,that with respect to its use of smart power,nartron contacted only sae,not second,in a letter dated april,in response to nartron request that st cease and desist from its use of its smart power mark,st responded that due to significant third party use,smart power had lost any trademark significance it may have had,and,in any case,no confusion was likely.consistent with st response in this letter,st claims it continued to use smart power.in support of its claim of continuous use,st cites the fact that its smart power application manual was circulated through,at least.furthermore,in may of,st cites the fact that it also presented a vipower application note at an international symposium on power semiconductor devices that discussed smart power technologies.as another example of continuous use,st cites the fact that in january,in response to a december letter from nartron president objecting to st use of the term smart power in electronic design october,edition,st informed nartron that its position had not changed from the one expressed in its april,letter.finally,from through,st asserts that it published additional data sheets and application notes referring to smart power as well as a vipower databook containing hundreds of uses of smart power and published ads referring to smart power.
in,nartron commenced an action against st alleging,infringement of its trademark,smart power.nartron filed a complaint in district court alleging that st had i wilfully infringed its federally registered trademark in the mark smart power in violation of ii engaged in unfair competition in violation of a iii caused the dilution of the distinctive and valuable quality of the smart power trademark in violation of c and iv engaged in unfair competition and trademark infringement in violation of michigan common law.the parties were allowed to conduct limited discovery.thereafter,the defendant moved for summary judgment on,amongst other things,the ground that the term smart power is generic and commonly descriptive with respect to its goods,such that the plaintiff is not entitled to prevent the defendant use of the term.the defendant also sought summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff trademark infringement claim,to the extent one did exist,was precluded by laches because of the plaintiff unreasonable delay in waiting eleven years after first learning of the defendant use of the term before bringing the present action.
on its second hearing of the parties summary judgment motions after allowing for additional limited discovery,the district court reversed its earlier rulings on the matter and granted the defendant motion on both grounds.the district court issued no opinion.at the hearing on the motions,with respect to the issue of genericness,the district court concluded that genericness was undisputed in light of the fact that ignorance of the term genericness in the semiconductor industry is all the plaintiff offer ed the court.see at.relying on a chronology produced by the defendant detailing use of the smart power term by the semiconductor industry in trade publications,conferences,symposia,advertisements,third party uses,patents,trademarks and copyrights,the district court concluded that a good showing ha d been made that smart power became a generic term over the years of use in the semiconductor industry.see id.
the district court also reversed its earlier ruling on the laches issue.with respect to laches,at the hearing,the district court stated that the defendant eleven years of constant use of the term smart power,a total rejection of every request to stop,a nd the obviously unchanged attitude of the defendant concerning its right to use this term which it considered generic,all required that the court impose the doctrine of laches here.see at.the district court also concluded that s ubstantial prejudice has occurred in the eleven years it sic taken to sic for the lawsuit to be filed.see id.rejecting nartron progressive encroachment argument to excuse its unreasonable delay in filing suit,the district court concluded that the reason given for the filing of the lawsuit does not hold water.there was no new and more intransigent management.intransigency was the same as it had been for all eleven years.the management was the same,but the initials of two names were combined.see id.
the district court,however,declined to rule on st additional affirmative defenses of fair use and likelihood of confusion the plaintiff now appeals,arguing that,with respect to the issues of genericness and laches,the district court grant of summary judgment in the defendant favor was incorrect because the district court improperly drew inferences in st favor,and weighed evidence in arriving at its decisions on these issues.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.daddy junky music stores big daddy family music center,cir kellogg exxon,cir,cert.denied,d.summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.city management chemical,cir.we consider all facts and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party.id.the central inquiry is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury,or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.nevertheless,the mere scintilla of evidence in support of the position is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.id.the proper inquiry is whether the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the.id.
genericness 
the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of st on the issue of genericness of the term smart power as used in the semiconductor industry in connection with st products,including st vipower line of products.in opposing st summary judgment motion on the issue of genericness,nartron failed to present evidence demonstrating any genuine issues of material fact.a generic term can never function as a trademark.see,technical publishing,cir miller brewing joseph schlitz brewing,cir,cert.denied,d.on the other hand a term that is merely descriptive may be used as a trademark if it has acquired a secondary meaning thus,in considering nartron challenge of st use of smart power as used in connection with st products in the semiconductor industry,including st vipower line of products,the crucial question is whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the term is a generic,common descriptive or merely descriptive term.the district court held that,as used by the defendant in the semiconductor industry,the term smart power is a generic term because it defines a type of technology that the defendants and others in the semiconductor industry develop and market.
we agree with the district court that smart power,as used by st in connection with its vipower line of products,has become a generic term in the semiconductor industry.a generic term is one that is commonly used as the name of a kind of goods unlike a trademark,which identifies the source of a product,a generic term merely identifies the genus of which a particular product is a species.liquid controls liquid control,cir citations omitted see also bath body works,luzier personalized cosmetics,cir.if a mark primary significance is to describe a type of product rather than the producer,it is generic and is not a valid trademark.see,bath body works,at liquid controls,at.thus,the appropriate test for genericness is whether the relevant public perceives the term primarily as the designation of the article.blinded veterans association blinded veterans foundation.to allow protection for generic terms would grant a monopoly,since a competitor could not describe his goods as what they are.ces publ g regis publications,cir see also nestle chester market,vacated,cir.thus,there can be no infringement if the primary significance of smart power as used by st is to describe a type of product,here a type of technology,and not to identify the source of such products 
here,on its summary judgment motion for genericness,st sufficiently carried its burden of demonstrating the absence of any genuine issue of material fact on its claim of genericness.st produced overwhelming evidence,which nartron failed to rebut,that the term smart power,as used by st and other participants in the semiconductor industry,denotes a type of technology,not goods associated with nartron.we are not convinced by nartron argument that the district court improperly applied the summary judgment standard.nor are we persuaded by nartron specious arguments that there remain genuine issues of material fact which should have precluded the district court grant of st summary judgment motion.
we note initially that nartron makes too much of the fact that its mark,pursuant to,had become incontestable.according to nartron,this means,inter alia,the mark must be considered strong and worthy of full protection,see wynn oil thomas,cir,and that it can not be challenged on the basis of being merely descriptive.the mark incontestable status,however,does not protect it from a challenge,as here,premised on a claim that it has become generic.see.nevertheless,because the mark at issue was a federally registered mark,there is a presumption that the term is and the defendant bears the burden of overcoming this presumption.bath body works,at citing thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,b ed,renumbered as ed.in addition to demonstrating the absence of any genuine issue of material fact on its claim of genericness,st also produced evidence sufficient to overcome whatever presumption of nongenericness nartron was entitled to on account of its ownership of an incontestable federally registered trademark.we reject nartron arguments urging that we reach a contrary conclusion.
nartron argues that the district court grant of summary judgment in the defendant favor was incorrect because the district court improperly made inferences in favor of st,and improperly weighed evidence in concluding that the term was generic.in support of its argument,nartron asserts that st i submitted no evidence,survey or otherwise,establishing that the public perceives nartron smart power mark as primarily the designation of an article and ii provided no dictionary evidence to counter nartron submission of six technical dictionaries,none of which contained a definition for smart power or smartpower.nartron arguments are without merit.
the district court did not err in concluding that,as a matter of law,smart power had become generic in the semiconductor industry.nartron assertion that st submitted no evidence that the public perceives the smart power mark primarily as the designation of the article at issue,is simply not supported by the record.ordinarily,it is a term meaning to consumers,not professionals in the trade,that is the test of genericness and descriptiveness for ordinary consumer goods.see,magic wand,rdb,stroh brewery,cir.however,the amendments to the lanham act require that t he primary significance of the registered mark to the relevant public shall be the test for determining whether the registered mark has become the generic name of goods or services on or in connection with which it has been used.see lanham act,emphasis added.the relevant public is a broad term that implies that in an appropriate case it could include professional buyers.see mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,ed.public,in this context,does not necessarily always mean everyone.id.rather relevant public could be composed of a relatively small group of highly trained and knowledgeable professional customers for a particular specialized product or service.id.here,the record before us is replete with evidence submitted by st in support of its claim that smart power,as used in connection with its vipower line of products,is perceived as a generic term by participants in the semiconductor industry including manufacturers,customers,suppliers,vendors and the trade and technical press.
we agree with the district court that st produced enough evidence to overcome the presumption of nongenericness.in deciding genericness,evidence of the relevant public understanding of a term may be obtained from any competent source.in re merrill,lynch,pierce fenner smith,emphasis added.thus,st may properly show that smart power is generic with evidence such as dictionary definitions,newspapers and other publications,generic use by competitors,generic use of the term by the mark owners,and use of the term by third parties in trademark registrations.abercrombie fitch,hunting world,cir in re northland aluminum,tektronix,daktronics,see also,bachman.st did just that.
here,st provided undisputed deposition testimony from participants in the semiconductor industry,including manufacturers and distributors.they provided testimony that manufacturers,customers,suppliers,vendors,and others in the semiconductor industry,including the trade and technical press,use the term smart power generically to mean power devices that have control circuits.in addition to unrefuted admissions by professionals in the semiconductor industry that smart power is generic,st also prepared a chronology from through the present that digested the pervasive uses of smart power to identify devices that utilize a certain type of technology,particularly integrated circuits that combine both power and logic.this chronology provided evidence from a variety of sources including trade journals,newspapers and other publications,and advertisements.in addition,the chronology also set forth evidence from patent,trademark and copyright registrations indicating that even the united states patent and trademark office and the united states copyright office have come to recognize the term as signifying a type of technology in the semiconductor industry.thus,the overwhelming evidence in this case obviates the need for st to have conducted a consumer survey.see,liquid controls,at district court grant of summary judgment on issue of genericness without survey affirmed by appellate court see also barrios american thermal instruments,consumer survey not necessary and dictionaries,newspapers,and other publications may be used to establish that a term is generic suh yang,surveys de rigeur,but not required summary judgment without survey granted expoconsul international,systems,same.this result is compelled where nartron has failed to rebut the proffered evidence,nor provided evidence of its own suggesting that there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the issue of genericness 
also,nartron reliance on st failure to provide any dictionary containing a definition for smart power is misplaced.dictionary definitions are merely one source from which genericness may be proven.the law is quite clear that the absence of a composite term from the dictionary does not end the analysis,because numerous terms have been found to be generic despite their absence from the dictionary.see,liquid controls,at holding that liquid controls is generic national conf.of bar examiners,at holding that multistate bar examination generic technical publishing,at finding that software news probably generic miller brewing heileman brewing,cir holding that light beer is generic,cert.denied,d.on the other hand,st argues that the composite term smart power is nothing more than the composite of its parts smart and power and thus like liquid control,multistate bar examinations,and light beer,smart power too must also be deemed generic.we need not decide the merits of st argument,because it has introduced other evidence tending to show that smart power is a generic term.
finally,we are not convinced by nartron argument that the district court erred in relying on st evidence showing the widespread use of smart power as a generic term.according to nartron,st prevailed by overwhelming the district court with a great number of alleged uses of the term smart power in various areas.this proof,claims nartron,goes only to descriptiveness,not genericness,because the uses in st list are descriptive,not generic.at most,concludes nartron,st list creates an issue of material fact on genericness and the district court could not properly give greater weight to st evidence than nartron evidence.
nartron fails to appreciate the distinction between common descriptive terms and terms considered merely descriptive.some terms on st list,for example smart power management,suggest that smart power was being used descriptively.the majority of the examples,however,clearly demonstrate that,as used in the semiconductor industry,smart power was used as the designation of the article,a wide range of products and technologies all of which implement the function of interfacing logic circuits to power loads.
the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of st on the issue of laches.we are not persuaded by nartron argument that the district court improperly applied the summary judgment standard on this issue.in arriving at this decision,the district court concluded that nartron failed to rebut st evidence demonstrating that,for eleven years,st had constantly and continuously used the term smart power,and totally rejected every one of nartron requests to stop using the term.in addition,in light of nartron inability to justify its delay in bringing suit,the district court surmised that substantial prejudice had occurred in the eleven years that it took for nartron to bring suit.on appeal,nartron argues that the district court weighed evidence and improperly drew inferences in st favor.in support of its arguments,nartron asserts the following i st use of smart power between and october was isolated and no use occurred between october and ii nartron submitted evidence that nartron delayed filing suit because nartron believed st had stopped its prior uses after nartron requested that st cease using the mark iii st use of smart power grew from trivial to significant,hence the applicability of the doctrine of progressive encroachment and iv st failed to demonstrate that it suffered any prejudice.
we too conclude that the doctrine of laches precludes nartron claims for trademark infringement.laches is the negligent and unintentional failure to protect one rights.elvis presley,elvisly yours,cir.a party asserting laches must show lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted,and prejudice to the party asserting it.see.inductotherm,cir.in this circuit,there is a strong presumption that a plaintiff delay in asserting its rights is reasonable as long as an analogous state statute of limitations has not elapsed.elvisly yours,at.in evaluating whether a party has been diligent in protecting its trademark,we look to the statute of limitations for injury to personal property.id.here,under michigan law,that period is three years.see elvisly yours,at.in other words,a delay beyond the statutory period is presumptively prejudicial and unreasonable.the period of delay begins to run when plaintiff had actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged infringing activity.dana ipc.partnership,citing general sciaky,cir.
in this case,st argues that nartron was aware of st use of smart power as early as or,at the latest.in,st used the mark in connection with materials presented at a society of automotive engineers sae conference and exposition on future transportation.at the conference,an st employee presented a paper titled smart power applications in multiplex systems.the record demonstrates that nartron was aware of this use,but nartron only response was to send a letter to sae,not nartron does not dispute that it never contacted st with respect to st use of the term at the sae conference.subsequently,in june,st published its smart power applications manual ed.this extensive manual contained application notes describing st products that utilized smart power technology.the manual,which was in circulation from through,uses the term smart power throughout.nartron did not write to st about the manual until.
in its defense,nartron argues that st use of smart power between and october was isolated and no use occurred between october and.nartron further argues that it delayed filing suit until because it believed st had stopped its prior uses after notification from nartron to cease such use.we disagree.
the record demonstrates that nartron had actual or constructive notice of st use,at least by.furthermore,nartron contention that st made no use of smart power in,and is unsupportable and contrary to the record.it is clear from the record that st continued to circulate its smart power application manual in and.it is also clear from the record that between and,st made numerous other uses of the term aside from those in connection with the smart power application manual.
equally unsupportable and directly contradicted by the record is nartron suggestion that st acquiesced in nartron requests to cease its use of the term smart power.not only did st continuously use smart power,it repeatedly informed nartron that it had no intention of stopping its use.as such,nartron could not reasonably have believed that st acquiesced in its request to cease and desist from using the mark or that st had in fact stopped using the mark.accordingly,st has shown that nartron filed suit significantly more than three years after it knew,or should have known,of the alleged infringement.this delay is presumptively prejudicial and unreasonable,creating a rebuttable presumption of laches.
nartron is unable to rebut the presumption that its significant delay in bringing this suit was both prejudicial and unreasonable.in order to overcome the presumption of laches,plaintiff must rebut the presumption of prejudice establish that there was a good excuse for its delay or show that the defendant engaged in particularly egregious conduct which would change the equities significantly in plaintiff favor.dana.at quoting twm,dura,cir.first,nartron attempts to rebut the presumption of laches by arguing that there was no delay in bringing suit.second,nartron argues that even if there was a delay,the doctrine of progressive encroachment excuses its delay in bringing suit,because st use of smart power changed markedly from until the time nartron commenced its lawsuit in.third,nartron argues that st suffered no prejudice as a result of nartron unreasonable delay in bringing suit.finally,nartron contends that even if its year delay in bringing suit constitutes laches,it is nonetheless entitled to prospective injunctive relief.we are not persuaded by any of nartron arguments.
first,in attempting to overcome the presumption,nartron takes issue with the conclusion that there was an unreasonable delay in commencing its trademark action.according to nartron,there is a question of fact as to whether the laches period started before november,and therefore seeks to conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the unreasonableness of the delay in commencing suit.nartron argues that it had no reason to sue earlier,because st did not begin continuous infringing use of the smart power mark until.in support of this contention,nartron claims that st only used smart power three times between and.furthermore,according to nartron,on each such occasion,it wrote to st to complain about st use of smart power.in return,claims nartron,st acquiesced and stopped using the mark.the record,however,adequately establishes that st not only made significantly more than three uses between the period and,but that st also clearly and unequivocally,in letters to nartron,informed nartron that it refused to refrain from using the mark and that st would not cease and desist from using the mark.
second,nartron posits that even assuming that there was a delay in bringing suit,it is able to overcome the presumption by establishing an excuse for this delay.nartron argues that st use of smart power changed markedly,such that the doctrine of progressive encroachment excuses nartron failure to commence suit earlier.recently,in kellogg company exxon corporation,cir,we explained that progressive encroachment allows the plaintiff to demonstrate that although it might have been justified in bringing suit earlier but did not,certain factors now exist that have prompted it to do so.id.at.progressive encroachment requires something about the defendant use of the mark to have changed significantly.id.at.the court in kellogg analyzed cases in which the defendant made certain changes to the appearance of its mark,expanded its marketing efforts,or entered into new areas of business that directly competed with the trademark owner.id.at.
in kellogg,the plaintiff,kellogg,owned the tony the tiger trademarks for breakfast cereal since.id.at.in,exxon registered its whimsical tiger no opposition from use in the promotion of petroleum products,a product and market with which kellogg had no connection.id.at.kellogg delayed in suing for years,until exxon began using its whimsical tiger in connection with its convenience stores.id.at.we held that there was an issue of fact as to whether kellogg was justified in waiting to sue until exxon expanded its use of its whimsical tiger into the food business.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,we explained that for purposes of determining laches or acquiescence,the point at which exxon established itself in the market was the point at which kellogg knew or should have known that it now had a provable claim for infringement it was at this point that kellogg duty to defend its trademark was triggered,and it was from this point that any delay must be measured.id.
here,by contrast,it is indisputable that st use of smart power has never changed.st use of the mark in was identical to its uses during the period from through and continues to be the same today.st has always used smart power in its generic sense to describe an integrated circuit that combines power and logic on a single chip.unlike the defendant in kellogg,there was nothing about st use of smart power in and that differed from its earlier uses,such that nartron long delay in bringing suit would be excusable.indeed,nartron cease and desist demand arising out of st use of smart power in the title of its smart power application manual was no different than nartron and complaint about st use of smart power in some of st product announcements.we agree with the district court conclusion that there was no progressive encroachment.st activity was the same,exactly the same,and st refusal to cease was exactly the same for the entire period.see at.
nartron argument in support of its contention that st use of the mark changed markedly over the period in question is simply without merit.nartron assertion that there was a change in management at st that resulted in st markedly different use of the term smart power is belied by the record.furthermore,nartron contention that st used a different type size does not constitute progressive is it accurate.both smart power applications in multiplex systems and st smart power application manual capitalized the s and p and the manual often referred to smart power in all capital letters.several of the application notes used smart power in all capital letters.nor is it uncommon for the industry to use smart power in various capitalized letter styles in its purely descriptive sense and not as a designation of a single source.this is far from a case in which st has progressively encroached on nartron trademark.see,herman miller palazzetti imports and exports,cir rejecting plaintiff claim of progressive encroachment to excuse its delay in bringing suit where defendant alleged infringing actions in were no
