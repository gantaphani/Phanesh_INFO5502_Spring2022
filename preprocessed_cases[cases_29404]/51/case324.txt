a party claiming trademark ownership must establish that it was the first to use the mark in the sale of goods or services.this concept is known as trademark priority.one of the ways that a party may establish priority is through the constructive use doctrine known as tacking.tacking allows a party to tack the date of the user first use of a mark onto a subsequent mark to establish priority where the two marks are so similar that consumers would generally regard them as being the same.
we have previously indicated that tacking only applies in exceptionally narrow circumstances,brookfield communications,west coast entertainment,cir,and is properly resolved as a matter of law if reasonable minds can not differ and the evidence permits only one conclusion,one industries,llc jim distribution,cir.nonetheless,the rule in our circuit is that tacking requires a highly inquiry generally reserved for the jury.id.on the facts of this case,we conclude that the jury was entitled to find that the doctrine applied.
the korean word pronounced as hana means number one,first,top,or unity.the parties in this dispute both use the english word hana in their names and offer financial services in the united states.defendant appellee hana bank the bank is a korean entity established in as korea investment finance corporation in,it adopted its current name.presently,it is the fourth largest bank in korea.plaintiff appellant hana financial,hfi is a california corporation that was incorporated on august.
the principals of the two entities were no strangers.the bank chairman,seoung yu kim,and hfi former ceo,charles kim,met for the first time in and met at least once per year thereafter until,when charles kim became seriously ill.during that time period,charles kim affectionately referred to seoung yu kim as big brother.seoung yu kim also knew hfi current ceo,sunnie kim and met with her annually from through.
in,charles kim and sunnie kim were working at an american bank.at that time,the bank was considering offering services to korean americans living in los angeles through a partner.charles kim and sunnie kim met with seoung yu kim to discuss a potential equity investment and strategic alliance.to that end,the companies executed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding.the deal,however,was never completed.it was initially delayed by regulatory issues,and after the los angeles riots,the bank decided it would take a wait and see approach.
in may,the bank acted on its plan to extend its services to the united states,establishing the hana overseas korean club the club to provide financial services to korean expatriates.the club target customer base consisted of korean americans living in the united states,particularly in certain areas,such as southern california,new jersey,chicago,and san francisco.that july,the bank published advertisements for the club in several koreanlanguage newspapers in major cities throughout the united states,including the los angeles edition of the korea times.the advertisements included the name hana overseas korean club in english.the names hana overseas korean club and hana bank also appeared in korean,along with the hana bank logo,which is sometimes called the dancing man.the dancing man logo has not changed since then.the bank subsequently received a number of applications for the club from customers in the united states.the application materials included the name hana overseas korean club in english and hana bank in korean next to the dancing man logo.
hfi came into existence one month later.its articles of incorporation indicated that it could engage in lawful acts other than the banking business.it began using its trademark in commerce the following year,on april.on july,it obtained a federal trademark registration for a pyramid logo with the words hana financial for use in connection with and certain other financial services.hfi advertised in newspapers including the los angeles edition of the korea times,other major newspapers,and on television.its customers were primarily korean americans,but its customer base eventually expanded to include americans,who may have even constituted a majority of its customers at the time of trial.
in,charles kim showed seoung yu kim a copy of his hfi business card.seoung yu kim asked charles kim why he was using the hana mark without permission.charles kim stated that he thought it was a wonderful name.he explained that hfi would only be engaged in factoring and would not be providing banking services,so there would be no overlap in the two companies services.
meanwhile,the bank continued operating the club in the united states.its initial customers included individuals in several states,at least one of whom remained a customer through the time of the trial.from onward,the bank wired money to its customers in the united states almost every day totaling over million between and and accepted over applications.in,the bank changed the club name to the hana world center.
in,the bank sought to register its trademark but was unable to do so,at least in part due to hfi mark.the bank contacted hfi about the issue,but they were unable to resolve it.in,the bank began operating an agency in new york under its own name.
on march,hfi filed its complaint alleging trademark infringement and related claims.in essence,hfi contended that the bank use of its hana bank mark infringed hfi hana financial mark because its use of the word hana in connection with financial services would likely cause confusion.in response,the bank sought cancellation of hfi trademark based on hfi alleged awareness of the bank superior rights,and the bank also asserted the equitable defenses of laches and unclean hands.on january,the district court granted the bank motion for summary judgment on trademark priority.the district court also granted hfi motion for summary judgment on the bank cancellation counterclaim.both parties appealed.
on october,we reversed on priority,finding that the bank advertisements and other exhibits purportedly demonstrating priority were relevant,but were also subject to competing inferences or were not presented in admissible form.hana,hana bank,fed.app x,cir.accordingly,we remanded for trial.id.at.we also affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment on the bank cancellation counterclaim,noting that hfi alleged knowledge of the bank mark was insufficient to establish the requisite element of fraudulent intent.id.
on remand,hfi filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude the club advertisements and related exhibits,arguing that the evidence was irrelevant.specifically,it argued a that the bank mark and the club mark were not virtually identical and therefore,tacking for the purposes of establishing trademark priority was improper and b in the alternative,that the bank had abandoned the mark in or.the district court denied the motion 
the trademark infringement claims were triable by jury and the court also submitted the bank laches and unclean hands defenses to the jury for an advisory verdict.the trial commenced on may.at the close of evidence,hfi moved for judgment as a matter of law arguing that the defendants had presented no evidence on trademark priority,laches,and unclean hands.the district court denied the motion.
in the jury instructions,the district court explained 
a party may claim priority in a mark based on the first use date of a similar but technically distinct mark where the previously used mark is the legal equivalent of the mark in question or indistinguishable therefrom such that consumers consider both as the same mark.this is called tacking.the marks must create the same,continuing commercial impression,and the later mark should not materially differ from or alter the character of the mark attempted to be tacked.
hfi had proposed a similar instruction and did not object.moreover,in its closing argument,hfi argued that tacking was inapplicable because the bank and the club had completely different names.
the jury found that the bank had used its mark in commerce in the united states beginning prior to april,and continuously since that date.it also found,in its advisory capacity,that the bank had proven its laches defense,but not its unclean hands defense.the court subsequently issued findings of fact and conclusions of law,determining,among other things,that hfi claims were barred by both laches and unclean hands.after the district court issued its decision,hfi renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and moved for a new trial,challenging the priority verdict as well as the laches and unclean hands decisions.the district court denied the motion,noting that hfi had failed to cite any supporting legal authority.it also rejected hfi motion on the merits,noting that a we had previously remanded the case for trial on the priority issue b there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict on priority and c the court had given a tacking instruction similar to the one hfi had requested.hfi now appeals,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review the district court decision to deny a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.first mortg.fed.realty inv.trust,cir.in doing so,however,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party in whose favor the jury returned a verdict and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.id.the verdict will be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence,even if it is also possible to draw a contrary conclusion.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
it is axiomatic in trademark law that the standard test of ownership is priority of use.brookfield commc ns,coast entmt,cir quoting sengoku works rmc int l,cir.to acquire ownership of a trademark it is not enough to have invented the mark first or even to have registered it first the party claiming ownership must have been the first to actually use the mark in the sale of goods or services.id.here,the priority issue turns on whether it was permissible for the jury to find that the bank could tack its use of its present hana bank mark to its use of the club mark beginning in.
a trademark user may tack the date of the user first use of an earlier mark onto a subsequent mark to establish priority where the two marks are so similar that consumers generally would regard them as essentially the same.id.at.tacking is permitted because w ithout tacking,a trademark owner priority in his mark would be reduced each time he made the slightest alteration to the mark,which would discourage him from altering the mark in response to changing consumer preferences,evolving aesthetic developments,or new advertising and marketing styles.id.moreover,g iving the trademark owner the same rights in the new mark as he has in the old helps to protect trademarks from appropriation by competitors and thus furthers the trademark law objective of reducing the costs that customers incur in shopping and making purchasing decisions.id.
the fact that a mark contains a portion of an earlier mark is not sufficient to establish tacking a tacking analysis must consider the marks in their entirety to determine whether each conveys the same commercial impression such that they possess the same connotation in context.van dynecrotty,wear guard corp.the commercial impression of a trademark is the meaning or idea it conveys or the mental reaction it evokes.see gideon mark jacob jacoby,continuing commercial impression applications and measurement,marq.intell.prop,citing spice islands,frank tea spice.commercial impression,like most issues in trademark law,should be determined from the perspective of the ordinary purchaser of these kinds of goods or services.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed hereinafter,mccarthy.in determining whether the marks have the same commercial impression,the visual or aural appearance may be instructive.see van dyne crotty,f d at.commercial impression,however,should be resolved by considering a range of evidence,ideally including consumer survey evidence.see mark jacoby,supra,at mccarthy.in our circuit,whether consumers would consider the two marks as being essentially the same is a question of fact one,at.
like our sister circuits,we have indicated that tacking applies only in exceptionally narrow circumstances.brookfield,at.we have explained 
the standard for tacking is exceedingly strict the marks must create the same,continuing commercial impression,and the later mark should not materially differ from or alter the character of the mark attempted to be tacked.in other words,the previously used mark must be the legal equivalent of the mark in question or indistinguishable therefrom,and the consumer should consider both as the same mark.this standard is considerably higher than the standard for likelihood of confusion.

our decisions demonstrate the narrowness of the doctrine.in brookfield,at,we reversed the district court denial of a preliminary injunction based in part on the fact that the plaintiff had failed to make a sufficient showing that it could tack the movie buff movie store onto its later mark.in quiksilver,at,we reversed the district court decision finding that tacking applied and remanded where there was evidence from which a reasonable jury could easily conclude that quiksilver roxy and roxy did not create the same,continuing commercial impression at the time the roxy brand was introduced.in one industries,at,we found that the district court correctly determined that the plaintiff could not satisfy the tacking test where its angular o mark was materially different from its rounded o mark 
further underscoring the limited reach of the doctrine,we have repeatedly cited a group of cases where a court or the trademark trial and appeal board found that the doctrine did not apply.one,at collecting cases brookfield,at collecting cases.this group of emphasizes the narrowness of the tacking doctrine,which is why we previously acknowledged them with approval.they do not,however,support hfi position in this case as strongly as it might appear at first glance.for example,in keycorp key bank trust,d,the court determined that key federal savings loan association,key federal savings bank,and key bank trust were substantially different and the defendant could not rely on tacking to establish priority.the court observed that the defendant had changed its name in order to disassociate itself from the savings and loan scandals of the and indicate changes in its legal status.id.accordingly,the court found the defendant claim that its name changes were not noticeable to customers to be somewhat disingenuous given that at least its first name change was made in the hope that its customers would distinguish its former name from its new one.id.
in contrast,we have cited hess of allentown,national bellas hess,as an example of a case where tacking was appropriate.see one indus,at brookfield,at.in hess,the petitioner had originally incorporated and conducted business as hess brothers,but later changed its name to hess of allentown,while emphasizing and promoting itself as hess or hess.hess of allentown.at.the board found that there could be no question but that hess is the most significant portion of the trade name hess brothers and that it is this portion which petitioner has emphasized throughout the years and that portion by which it has been recognized and referred to within and without its corporate structure.id.at.there could be no distinction for legal or practical purposes between hess and hess,particularly given that the record indicated that the petitioner changed the name to reflect the manner in which the purchasing public had come to refer to and identify its store and operations.id 
here,reasonable minds could disagree on whether the bank marks were materially different.in isolation,the words hana overseas korean club,hana world center,and hana bank seem aurally and visually distinguishable.it is not necessarily clear from their names that these entities offer the same services.moreover,there was no survey evidence indicating that the marks convey the same,continuing commercial impression 
that the evidence could be construed to support hfi position,however,is not enough for it to prevail.as the losing party in a jury trial,hfi must show t
