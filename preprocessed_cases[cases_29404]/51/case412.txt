entrepreneur media,emi,publisher of entrepreneur magazine,contends that scott smith infringed emi federally registered trademark entrepreneur by using the word entrepreneur in connection with his public relations company.the district court,cooper,granted summary judgment in favor of emi on its trademark infringement claims,and smith appeals.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for a trial on the merits.
background 
entrepreneur media.
since,the appellee emi has published entrepreneur magazine,a monthly publication geared towards small businesses and their owners.entrepreneur has a paid circulation of approximately and sells for on newsstands.advertisements in entrepreneur cost the advertiser from to just over per issue.emi also publishes other magazines,books,computer software,and audio and video tapes,and participates in trade shows and seminars,all in connection with the world of small business.
emi has a web site with the domain names and.on the web site,visitors can view versions of entrepreneur magazine,subscribe to the publication,interact with other visitors,and learn about business opportunities.emi uses the web site for marketing and advertising,and also advertises on radio,on television,and in print.additionally,emi promotes small business events and sends complimentary copies of its magazine to other members of the media.
in,emi registered the term entrepreneur as a trademark on the federal principal register in international class for paper goods and printed matter namely magazines,books and published reports pertaining to business opportunities and in international class for computer programs and manuals all sold as a unit.the mark has attained incontestable status for the paper good and computer program categories in,emi registered the term entrepreneur as a service mark for trade show exhibitions,seminars,and workshops.emi has also registered various other marks,including entrepreneur expo,entrepreneur international,entrepreneurial woman,and.
scott smith entrepreneurpr 
in,the appellant smith started a public relations company for small businesses called icon publications.icon produced a publication entitled yearbook of small business icons,containing articles about icon clients,and distributed the yearbook free of charge to various media contacts,with the goal of increasing the clients media coverage.icon also operated a web site,at.
when smith decided to publish the yearbook on a quarterly rather than yearly basis he also decided that name changes were in order.smith hired a firm,had a trademark search performed,and,in,settled on entrepreneurpr as the new name for his company,entrepreneur illustrated as the new name for the yearbook,and as his new web site address.
entrepreneurpr clients pay per year for inclusion in entrepreneur illustrated,distributed to approximately media representatives free of charge.entrepreneur illustrated does not otherwise accept paid advertisements.
procedural history 
emi filed this case in,alleging trademark infringement,unfair competition,and counterfeiting under the lanham act,and unfair competition under the california business and professions code.both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted emi motion on the trademark infringement and unfair competition claims,denied emi motion on the counterfeiting claim,and denied smith motion in its entirety.emi thereupon dismissed its claim for counterfeiting.after supplemental briefing,the court,on august,awarded emi in damages and enjoined smith from using any marks confusingly similar to entrepreneur,including the terms entrepreneur,entrepreneurpr,entrepreneur illustrated,and sic.
smith filed a timely notice of appeal on september.on october,this court denied smith emergency motion to stay the judgment pending appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see interstellar starship,epix,cir.we must determine whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there are any genuine issues of material fact,and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.wendt host international,cir.because of the intensely factual nature of trademark disputes,summary judgment is generally disfavored in the trademark arena.interstellar,at citing levi strauss blue bell,cir.
b.the trademark infringement claim 
the lanham act provides national protection of trademarks in order to secure to the owner of the mark the goodwill of his business and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish among competing producers.park fly,dollar park and fly,d.to achieve these goals,the act allows for civil liability against a ny person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,which a is likely to cause confusion as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of the goods or services.a emphasis added.
the only element of emi trademark infringement claim in dispute is whether smith use of the terms entrepreneurpr,entrepreneur illustrated,and are likely to cause confusion as to their origin,sponsorship,or approval.id.the test for likelihood of confusion is whether a reasonably prudent consumer in the marketplace is likely to be confused as to the origin of the good or service bearing one of the marks.dreamwerks production group,skg studio,cir.
in amf,sleekcraft boats,cir,this court developed an test intended to guide the court in assessing the basic question of likelihood of confusion.gallo winery gallo cattle,cir.the sleekcraft factors,as applied to this case,are 
the strength of emi trademark 
the similarity of the marks 
the proximity or relatedness of the goods or services 
smith intent in selecting the marks 
evidence of actual confusion 
the marketing channels used 
the likelihood of expansion of product lines and,
the degree of care consumers are likely to exercise.
sleekcraft,at.the ultimate question of likelihood of confusion is predominantly factual in nature,as is each factor within the sleekcraft likelihood of confusion test.wendt,at.
although the sleekcraft test plays an important role in the analysis of whether a likelihood of confusion exists,i t is the totality of facts in a given case that is dispositive.rodeo collection,west seventh,cir.after applying the sleekcraft analysis,we agree with the district court ultimate finding of likelihood of confusion as a matter of law only as to the use of the mark entrepreneur illustrated on the cover of entrepreneurpr printed publication.we therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand except as to that issue we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the question whether smith infringed emi trademark by his use of the mark entrepreneur illustrated on the cover of that publication.
overview of the sleekcraft analysis 
the sleekcraft factors are,as gallo says,a guide to,intended to channel the analytical process but not dictate any result.at.since each factor represents only a facet of the single dispositive issue of likely confusion,the factors,not surprisingly,tend to overlap and interact,and the resolution of one factor will likely influence the outcome and relative importance of other factors.for instance,as this case demonstrates,if the trademark holder mark is weak,only if the marks are quite similar,and the goods closely related,will infringement be found.sleekcraft,at.
thus,we do not decide whether confusion is likely by considering mechanically the number of sleekcraft factors that weigh in favor of either party,or by giving the same weight to a particular factor from case to case.brookfield communications,west coast entertainment,cir.to do so would be entirely misleading,as the determination of one factor is often,in essence,only another way of viewing the same considerations already taken into account in finding the presence or absence of another one.rather,as we apply the sleekcraft test,we consider what each factor,the analysis as a whole,reveals about the ultimate question before us the likelihood of consumer confusion as to the origin of the product or service bearing the allegedly infringing mark.
application of the eight factors 
a.the strength of emi mark 
the scope of the trademark protection that we give marks depends upon the strength of the mark,with stronger marks receiving greater protection than weak ones.see miss world uk america pageants,cir.this is so because a strong mark is inherently distinctive,sleekcraft,at,and therefore it is more likely that consumers will be confused by another use of the same or similar mark.since we conclude on this record that emi mark is weak,this factor does not weigh in favor of a likelihood of consumer confusion.
the strength of a mark is determined by its placement on a continuum of marks.gallo,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the strongest is,those which receive the maximum trademark arbitrary or fanciful.id.the weakest marks,entitled to no trademark protection,are generic.id.in between lie suggestive and descriptive marks suggestive marks have the greater strength of the two.id.the issue here is whether emi mark entrepreneur falls within the suggestive or descriptive category 
descriptive marks define qualities or characteristics of a product in a straightforward way that requires no exercise of the imagination to be understood.winery,at emphasis omitted see also brookfield,at descriptive terms directly describe the quality or features of the product.a suggestive mark is one for which a consumer must use imagination or any type of multistage reasoning to understand the mark significance,the mark does not describe the product features,but suggests them.winery,at 
whether a mark suggests or describes the goods or services of the trademark holder depends,of course,upon what those goods or services are.we therefore adjudge a mark strength by reference to the goods or services that it identifies,rodeo collection,at,and as it appears in the marketplace.official airline guides,at.
on the record before us,it is apparent that the mark entrepreneur as applied to emi magazine and to computer programs and manuals falls within the descriptive category the word entrepreneur describes both the subject matter and the intended audience of the magazine and programs an entirely unimaginative,person would understand the significance of the reference.as such,the word describes the qualities or characteristics of emi products,and is not merely suggestive.park fly,at.winery,at see also publ g american aviation,discussing the magazine aviation it is difficult to conceive of a term that would be more descriptive of the contents of the plaintiff magazine.the plaintiff suggests that a descriptive word designates some physical characteristic.but that magazines may be described by their subject matter is too clear to be doubted.citations omitted scholastic,macmillan,the court finds that classroom is no more than a descriptive trademark a consumer of ordinary intelligence would immediately and inevitably conclude that a magazine called classroom dealt with the instruction of students.
the need of others in the marketplace to use the term entrepreneur to describe their goods or services confirms that emi mark is descriptive.see rodeo collection,at.we note initially that if there are numerous synonyms for a common trademarked word,others will have less need to use the trademarked term.we are not aware of,nor has emi suggested,any synonym for the word entrepreneur.furthermore,although english is a language rich in imagery,we need not belabor the point that some words,phrases or symbols better convey their intended meanings than others.new kids on the block news america publ g,cir.in other words,while smith could have used a phrase such as small business innovator illustrated,he would have lost both nuance and economy of language by doing so.
widespread use of a word by others may serve as confirmation of the need to use that word.see sleekcraft,at commenting on the lack of evidence that others have used or desire to use slickcraft the trademarked word in describing their goods american int l group,american int l bank,cir kozinski,dissenting listing the number of times the trademarked words occurred in various phone books as evidence of the mark weakness.smith expert identified at least six other magazines in which the word entrepreneur makes up part of the title numerous companies have registered marks that include the word entrepreneur.over one thousand web site domain names contain the word entrepreneur.smith expert also provided extensive evidence of the frequent use of the word entrepreneur as a common noun 
although the incontestable status of emi trademark entrepreneur gives emi the exclusive right to use its trademark in printed publications pertaining to business opportunities,the common and necessary uses of the word entrepreneur provide strong evidence that emi can not have the exclusive right to use the word entrepreneur in any mark identifying a printed publication addressing subjects related to entrepreneurship.moreover,that the marketplace is replete with products using a particular trademarked word indicates not only the difficulty in avoiding its use but also,and directly,the likelihood that consumers will not be confused by its use.the fact that the term resides in the public domain lessens the possibility that a purchaser would be confused and think the mark came from a particular single source.gruner jahr,at internal citation omitted see also miss world,at discussing a crowded field of marks and stating in such a crowd,customers will not likely be confused between any two of the crowd and may have learned to carefully pick out one from the other.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
we recognize,however,that a lthough a suggestive or descriptive mark is inherently a weak mark,it may be strengthened by such factors as extensive advertising,length of exclusive use,public recognition american int l group,at quoting accuride int l,accuride,cir.the record indicates that emi has used the trademark entrepreneur to identify its magazine since and that emi sells more than a half million copies of entrepreneur magazine monthly,with the total number of readers over two million monthly.
nonetheless,emi has not demonstrated that it has so strengthened its mark as to weigh this factor in favor of finding likely confusion.at trial,emi will have the opportunity to prove that its mark is stronger than it currently appears.for present is,for assessing whether emi was entitled to summary judgment as to the likelihood of credit the entrepreneur mark with only descriptive strength,because on this record emi has demonstrated no more.
similarity of the marks 
obviously,the greater the similarity between the two marks at issue,the greater the likelihood of confusion,walt disney,cir.we have developed three axioms that apply to the similarity analysis marks should be considered in their entirety and as they appear in the marketplace similarity is best adjudged by appearance,sound,and meaning and,similarities weigh more heavily than differences.id.we consider in turn smith three allegedly infringing marks according to these principles 
the title of smith publication entrepreneur illustrated 
emi and smith print on the covers of their publications the words entrepreneur and entrepreneur illustrated,respectively.colors and font styles of the titles of the two publications differ.smith uses font sizes,however,that lessen the effect of the name differences illustrated appears on his publication in a much smaller,perhaps font size than does entrepreneur.see miss world,at world and of the world appear somewhat similar because of the world is designed on letterhead and promotional material in a manner that deemphasizes the of the in the title.moreover,the artwork on two of smith covers included in the record obstructs much of the word illustrated.smith font size and obstructing artwork thus obfuscate the difference in the names of the publications,so that,as the district court concluded,the word entrepreneur is the most prominent visual feature of both publications covers,and consumers are likely to notice only the word entrepreneur on the cover of smith publication.furthermore,although entrepreneur illustrated is not a typical magazine,smith publication does look like a typical magazine,which lends visual similarity to the marks as they appear in the marketplace.for all these reasons,smith use of the mark entrepreneur illustrated on his publication cover is similar to emi use of its trademark,and the district court correctly weighed this to this favor of likely confusion.see hearst.at finding that publishing science digest with the word science given overwhelming prominence infringes science magazine mark.
the terms entrepreneur and entrepreneur illustrated are,of course,used in the marketplace in contexts other than the publication covers.see dreamwerks,at considering the fact that a mark sometimes appears without a logo sleekcraft,at same.both parties,for example,refer to their respective publication titles in textual sentences on their web sites.in this type of use,both marks presumably appear in black,and font type and size simply match the rest of the text.
a reasonable juror could,in this context,find entrepreneur and entrepreneur illustrated dissimilar.entrepreneur illustrated contains an entire word that entrepreneur does not this difference between the marks is a noticeable one because it makes the mark entrepreneur illustrated almost twice as the eye and the the mark entrepreneur.see gruner jahr,at affirming the district court ruling that the magazine title parent digest was not similar to the magazine title parents and noting that the only similarity concerned the use of the word parent mcgraw hill publ g,at finding confusion not probable between american aviation and aviation and relying in part on the fact that american aviation is composed of two words.
thus,in what is perhaps the most obvious appearance of the marks on the parties publication covers included in the reasonable juror would have to find the marks similar.however,when used in other speech and in plain text in which the font size of entrepreneur and illustrated are the same,and neither word is obstructed by artwork a fact finder could reasonably conclude that the marks are dissimilar,because of the noticeable differences between them.
the name of smith business entrepreneurpr 
at first glance,the difference between the two words,entrepreneur and entrepreneurpr,may seem slight.we believe a reasonable juror could,however,find them dissimilar.
the addition of the letters pr to the end of the word entrepreneur does not,it is true,create as great a visual difference between the parties marks as does the addition of the word illustrated.but,as smith expert testified,in judging the likely reaction of readers and listeners,the degree of visual difference is not always decisive.just as readers and listeners notice the in washington as critically distinguishing the capitol city from the state,so the two capital letters pr may serve effectively to signal an important distinction from other uses of entrepreneur.
this possibility is made more likely because the marks are quite dissimilar when sounded out the letters pr constitute two additional syllables.compare dreamwerks,at while we recognize that spelling matters,we not sure substituting one vowel for another and capitalizing a middle consonant dispels the similarity between the marks.even silent readers usually hear words as they read and are likely to notice syllabic differences.
further,the difference between the marks is not arbitrary but suggests a particular difference in meaning entrepreneurpr,presumably meaning public relations for or by a small,independent business owner,has a connotation different from entrepreneur,standing alone.one could not reasonably assert that emi mark entrepreneur implies anything about a public relations function or purpose.
thus,a juror could rely on the expert testimony refuting the alleged similarity between entrepreneur and entrepreneurpr,as well as the actual differences between the marks,and reasonably find the marks dissimilar.
the domain name 
this court,in brookfield,recently analyzed trademark infringement claims within the unique context of the internet,focusing in particular on domain names.at issue in brookfield were the trademark moviebuff and the domain name.brookfield held that the two monikers were for all intents and purposes,identical in terms of sight,sound,and meaning,at,emphasizing that the allegedly infringing domain used exactly the same letters as the trademark,id.at emphasis in original.the precise identity was critical,we noted,because internet users searching for a company web site often assume,as a rule of thumb,that the domain name of a particular company will be the company name or trademark followed by.id.at.
here,smith domain name,entrepreneurpr,is not exactly the same as emi mark,entrepreneur.as a result,a consumer attempting to reach emi web site by typing in its magazine name followed by would not reach smith web site.nor would a simple spelling or typographical error likely lead a consumer attempting to access emi web site to smith web site.this observation concerning the functional similarity of domain names is largely dispositive.but see id.at also comparing the sight,sound,and meaning of the trademark and domain name.similarity of marks or lack thereof are concepts.in the internet context,consumers are aware that domain names for different web sites are quite often similar,because of the need for language economy,and that very small differences matter.
even if we were to look beyond the functional aspects of domain name similarity,however,and consider the domain name as it might appear in is,as an advertisement of the web site or in a newspaper article discussing would still conclude that smith domain name is not as a matter of law similar to emi mark.in the context of his domain name,it is true,smith can not rely on the capitalization of pr,as used in his company name,to show visual dissimilarity between his mark and emi,because web addresses are not and therefore will appear in print without case differentiation.id.the differences in sound and meaning between entrepreneur and entrepreneurpr,however,as discussed in the context of smith company name,still have import in the domain name context.
overall,we conclude that a juror could reasonably find smith domain name dissimilar from emi entrepreneur mark.
relatedness or proximity of the parties goods and services 
we examine the relatedness of the parties goods because the more closely related the goods are,the more likely consumers will be confused by similar marks.the district court found as a matter of law that the parties goods are related and weighed this factor in favor of a finding of likelihood of confusion.b oth parties,noted the district court,print publications that feature small businesses.we agree that,for this reason,the parties goods are somewhat related.nonetheless a reasonable juror would have to find that the relatedness factor does not weigh heavily in favor of a finding of likely confusion.
related goods are those products which would be reasonably thought by the buying public to come from the same source if sold under the same mark.sleekcraft,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in practice,this definition does not necessarily require a close proximity before goods will be found related.for instance,we recently stated that where both companies offer products and services relating to the entertainment industry generally the companies are not properly characterized as.brookfield,at.
in this case,however,the fact that both parties goods relate generally to entrepreneurs or other words,that both parties products relate to the descriptive word emi choose for its carry relatively little weight in determining the likelihood of confusion.this is so because any individual or company using the word entrepreneur as part of the name of its product or service to indicate exactly what the word,independent business likely to do so because that product or service has something to do with the world of entrepreneurs.to weigh this relationship heavily in favor of a likelihood of confusion in any case brought by emi would provide an advantage to emi because emi mark is of both its subject matter and intended would thereby counsel avoidance of such descriptive words in marks.
we therefore apply a sliding scale approach as to the weight that relatedness will carry dependent upon the strength of the trademark holder mark.this approach takes into account the fact that consumers may well recognize that smith uses terms that include the word entrepreneur for what the word means,not because of an association with entrepreneur magazine.a sliding scale is therefore the logical way to connect relatedness of products with likelihood of confusion.such a scale also serves an important balancing function.
while the public and the trademark owner have an interest in preventing consumer confusion,there is also a broad societal interest in preserving common,useful words for the public domain.we do not want to prevent the commercial use of descriptive words to name products,as straightforward names are often the most useful identifiers.an absolute measure of relatedness,in contrast,would discourage use of descriptive words in marks.
in addition to their connection to small businesses,smith and emi companies are both related by their production of print publications.this similarity does not however render the businesses so closely related as to suggest strongly a likelihood of confusion.
emi publication,entrepreneur magazine,is a prototypical magazine.it prints articles written by independent writers and selected by emi staff in the exercise of journalistic judgment.entrepreneur revenue is generated through sales of the magazine itself and sales of advertisements for placement within the magazine.smith publication,entrepreneur illustrated,is distributed free of charge and earns revenue solely by contracting with small business clients to have promotional,articles,either supplied or approved by the client,included in the publication.
in sum,although we agree that the parties goods are related,this factor does not weigh heavily in favor of likely confusion as a matter of law.
smith intent 
while an intent to confuse consumers is not required for a finding of trademark infringement,brookfield,at,intent to deceive is strong evidence of a likelihood of confusion,interstellar,at.when the alleged infringer knowingly adopts a mark similar to another,reviewing courts presume that the defendant can accomplish his purpose that is,that the public will be deceived.sleekcraft,at citations omitted.the point is not that an intent to confuse is relevant as some measure of culpability.rather,the alleged infringer judgment as to what is likely to be confusing is relevant because it may well be accurate.
where an alleged infringer chooses a mark he knows to be similar to another,one can infer an intent to confuse.official airline guides,at.on the present record,that inference may be drawn only as to smith use of entrepreneur illustrated on his publication cover,as that is the only use we have held similar as a matter of law to emi entrepreneur mark the inference from knowledge and similarity,however,does not add much in answering the ultimate question here,likelihood of confusion,as the inference provides no direct evidence of smith judgment concerning likely confusion.
emi did,however,offer evidence that throws a sharper light on smith intentions.there was testimony by a former entrepreneurpr employee that when she informed smith that people seemed to think entrepreneurpr was related to entrepreneur magazine,smith replied,yeah,it great.although smith statement was made after he adopted the mark at issue,that timing does not eliminate the significance of smith remark.true,the inference that can be drawn from an alleged infringer knowing adoption of a similar mark focuses on his intent at that time.sleekcraft,at.smith direct statement is relevant,though,to his intent in continuing to use the mark and,as such,is pertinent to liability for trademark infringement.see a providing for liability for one who uses a mark likely to cause confusion see also sleekcraft,at noting that the alleged infringer designed a distinctive logo after notification of the purported infringement.smith did present evidence,however,of an unsatisfactory business relationship with this employee,bringing her credibility into question.and,of course,it is for the,not the court deciding whether to grant summary judgment,to determine issues of credibility.see transworld airlines,american coupon exchange,cir.
in addition,a former entrepreneurpr client testified that smith business partner,john nixon,told her that the company was going to change its name and stated you familiar with entrepreneur magazine,right well,we going to be entrepreneurpr.although emi argues that this statement demonstrates an intent to confuse,a reasonable juror could find otherwise.nixon may have mentioned entrepreneur magazine only as an example of the common,marketplace use of the somewhat word entrepreneur,not to imply an affiliation with the magazine.this seems especially likely because nixon was speaking to a client who hired the company before it became entrepreneurpr and therefore at a time when there was no arguable reason to assume an affiliation with emi.what implication should be drawn from nixon statement is a factual question that should not be answered on summary judgment.furthermore,smith provided evidence that the client who testified to this statement was involved in a payment dispute with entrepreneurpr,again raising a credibility issue for the to resolve.see id.
finally,an from an entrepreneurpr employee to a potential client discussed the benefits of the publicity that entrepreneurpr could provide and stated we also like to include you in the next issue of entrepreneur.emi argues that this statement means that smith would arrange to have his clients published in entrepreneur magazine,and thus implies an affiliation with emi.this is certainly a reasonable interpretation.we note,however,that the reference to entrepreneur may have been simply an unfortunate choice of shorthand for entrepreneur illustrated.if so,the reference carelessly encouraged confusion as to an affiliation between entrepreneurpr and emi,but does not necessarily prove an intent to confuse.the correct interpretation of this,and the weight it should be given in adjudging smith intent,is best left to the.
nonetheless,based on the inference from smith knowledge of emi mark and the other evidence indicating an intent to confuse,the intent factor weighs in favor of finding a likelihood of confusion,light of the limited relevance of the inference,the timing of smith remark,and the factual questions surrounding the decisively so.we note that,although we have placed this factor fourth in order of importance to this case,a determination on the merits that smith intended to deceive consumers would provide strong evidence of a likelihood of confusion,interstellar,at,and,as a result,could overcome weaker showings by emi in other factors.
evidence of actual confusion 
evidence of actual confusion is strong evidence that future confusion is likely official airline guides,at.a reasonable juror may,however,find de minimis evidence of actual confusion unpersuasive as to the ultimate issue of likelihood of confusion,industries,cir.
emi presented evidence that one of smith clients,phyllis,was actually confused as to whether an affiliation existed between entrepreneur magazine and entrepreneurpr.cesare taie testified to such confusion,and other record evidence supports this testimony.in particular,is the client who received the stating that entrepreneurpr would like to include her business in the next issue of entrepreneur.and,more important to the issue of actual confusion,another shows that cesare taie sent a check to entrepreneurpr made payable to entrepreneur magazine.this check is strong evidence of her confusion.although smith countered with evidence of a business dispute with cesare taie regarding job performance and payment,raising some question as to her credibility,we believe light of the two reasonable juror would have to find on this record that cesare taie suffered actual confusion.
emi also presented the deposition testimony of three other entrepreneurpr clients who asserted that they believed entrepreneurpr was related to entrepreneur magazine.smith rebutted emi proffer,however,with evidence that all three of these customers had business disputes with smith regarding payment and that each began a business relationship with smith before he changed the name of his company to entrepreneurpr,raising questions as to the credibility of the clients assertions of confusion.smith also accurately noted that one of the customers seemed confused about almost everything.this impeachment evidence does throw into substantial question these three clients testimony regarding actual confusion.once again,we confront a credibility question that should not be decided on summary judgment.see transworld airlines,at.
emi also presented the deposition testimony of two former employees of entrepreneurpr.both stated that when making cold calls to solicit business for entrepreneurpr,they were often asked whether there was an affiliation between entrepreneurpr and entrepreneur magazine such consumer questions are some evidence of actual confusion.fuddruckers,doc others,cir.at the same time,on the current record,these questions may simply suggest,because of the descriptive nature of emi mark,consumers in encountering marks using the same term,do not necessarily assume a connection with entrepreneur but instead try to carefully pick out one from the other.miss world,at.whether the questions represented actual confusion or discernment is an issue better left to the trier of fact to resolve.
furthermore,smith presented some evidence that he had an unsatisfactory business relationship with the two former employees and that the two did not mention to other employees with whom they worked that they received such questions.likewise,another employee stated that he encountered such questions on only one or two instances during his long period of employment with entrepreneurpr.this evidence casts doubt on the credibility of the two employees.as we have noted before,deciding the credibility of the witnesses on evidence such as that presented here is not a matter appropriate on summary judgment.see transworld airlines,at.
we believe that the may find the evidence of actual confusion quite significant nonetheless,for purposes of summary judgment,emi has proved only one instance of actual confusion.to constitute trademark infringement,use of a mark must be likely to confuse an appreciable number of people as to the source of the product.int l ass of machinists and aerospace workers winship green nursing,cir t he law has long demanded a showing that the allegedly infringing conduct carries with it a likelihood of confounding an appreciable number of reasonably prudent purchasers exercising ordinary care.citations omitted see also winery,at noting that a significant portion of the general public is not likely to be confused sleekcraft,at in assessing the likelihood of confusion to the public,the standard used by the court is the typical buyer exercising ordinary caution.citations omitted.that there are a few consumers who do not pay attention to obvious differences,and assume common sources where most other people would not,may not demonstrate the requisite likelihood of confusion.
because on this record a reasonable juror would have to find that one of entrepreneurpr clients was actually confused,this factor weighs in favor of summary judgment for emi.we do not believe,however,that this factor weighs heavily in this direction because a reasonable juror could find de minimis,and thus unpersuasive,one instance of actual confusion,and the remaining record evidence involves factual matters subject to dispute.see official airline guides,at upholding the district court determination that de minimis evidence of actual confusion was not persuasive on this factor,at same.
overlap of marketing channels 
the district court relied solely upon the fact that the parties use the internet as a marketing channel to promote their goods and services although it described this evidence as nominal to weigh the overlapping marketing channels factor in favor of finding a likelihood of confusion.some use of the internet for marketing,however,does not alone and as a matter of law constitute overlapping marketing channels.
the proper inquiries are whether both parties use the web as a substantial marketing and advertising channel,at emphasis added,whether the parties marks are utilized in conjunction with products,brookfield,at,and whether the parties marketing channels overlap in any other way.on the current record,it does not appear that either parties use of the web is significant enough to be pertinent.
as to other marketing channels,they do not overlap to any significant degree.entrepreneur magazine is targeted at individuals interested in reading about issues relevant to entrepreneurs its advertisers are businesses seeking to sell products to that audience.smith potential patrons are only a few of the entrepreneurs themselves,in their role not as individual readers but as businesses seeking public relations services.the publications do not compete for subscribers,newsstand purchasers,or advertisers because entrepreneur illustrated is not for sale and does not feature paid advertisements 
this factor,then,can not weigh in favor of granting summary judgment to emi.
expansion of product lines 
the district court weighed this factor neither in favor of nor against finding a likelihood of confusion.the court found no evidence that the parties intended to expand into each other product lines,but noted that it had previously determined that the parties marketing channels overlapped to some extent.
because,as discussed immediately above,the district court erred in finding that the parties marketing channels overlapped as a matter of law and emi presented no evidence of the parties intent to expand into each other product lines,the district court should have weighed this factor against finding likely confusion.on remand,however,the trier of fact should reconsider the issue based on the final record.
degree of consumer care 
as to the final sleekcraft factor,degree of consumer care,we concur in the district court assessment that this factor weighs against a finding of likelihood of confusion,because small business owners seeking public relations services,advertisers and media entities will exercise a moderate degree of care.entrepreneurpr services are expensive,at per year media entities constitute at least a moderately sophisticated class of media consumers and,a s the party opposing the summary judgment motion,smith was entitled to have all inferences of this sort resolved in his favor.american int l group,at.
the overall balance of the sleekcraft factors 
having examined the totality of the facts in the record,we conclude,first,that the way smith has used the mark entrepreneur illustrated on the covers of entrepreneurpr printed publication,as it appears in the record,would likely confuse an appreciable number of reasonably prudent consumers,and thus infringed emi trademark entrepreneur.we reach this result because of the strong visual similarity of the to the small size and the degree of obstruction of the word illustrated and because of smith knowing adoption of this similar mark and other evidence demonstrating smith intent to deceive.see official airline guides,at.likewise,emi mark is strong enough,and the parties print publication products are sufficiently related,to support this conclusion.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to emi on this issue.
as to all other allegations of trademark infringement,emi has not demonstrated on this record that smith has infringed its trademark as a matter of law.a trier of fact could reasonably conclude that none of the eight sleekcraft factors weighs strongly in favor of a finding of likely confusion as to these allegations.perhaps more importantly,the weakness of emi mark alone weighs heavily against finding infringement as a matter of law.consumers will likely recognize that the word entrepreneur as used
