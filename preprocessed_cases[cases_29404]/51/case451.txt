background 
halo is a hong kong private company that designs and sells modern furniture.it is the exclusive owner of design patent nos.s and s,thirteen copyrights and one common law trademark,all relating to of its furniture designs.halo common law trademark,odeon,is used in association with at least four of its designs.halo sells its furniture in the united states,including through its own timothy oulton retail stores.appellee comptoir,a canadian corporation,also designs and markets furniture.comptoir furniture products are produced by manufacturers in china,vietnam,and india.comptoir furniture products are imported into the united states,where comptoir offers its products for sale to consumers directly at various furniture shows and also through several distributors across the country,including in the northern district of illinois.
on october,halo brought suit against appellees in the northern district of illinois,alleging infringement of its design patents,copyrights,and trademark.halo also alleged that appellees had violated illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices statutes.halo accused of appellees products of infringement.of those were the subject of halo copyright infringement allegations.with respect to two products,halo alleged infringement only of its design patents.four of appellees products were also alleged to infringe halo trademark.
appellees moved to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds,contending that canada,where appellees reside,is a far superior forum in which to resolve this dispute.appellees theory was that a copyright remedy would be available in the federal court of canada.appellees only evidence concerning the remedies available in the federal court of canada was a printout of a webpage from the site of the federal court of canada.the webpage explained that the federal court of canada has jurisdiction to adjudicate intellectual property rights,including copyright,industrial design patents and.appellees did not adduce any expert testimony regarding the adequacy of the federal court of canada as an alternative forum.nor did appellees submit any evidence that the canadian courts could provide a remedy for united states infringement.halo opposed the motion,arguing both that canada would not be an adequate forum to resolve its united states intellectual property dispute and that private and public interests militated against dismissal.
the district court concluded that canada would be an adequate forum.it explained that halo could seek relief for its copyright claims under canadian law,because canada,hong kong,and the united states are all signatories of the berne convention.further,even though there was no evidence that the canadian courts would apply united states law,the court reasoned that the united states has recognized the potential of applying the copyright laws of other nations and perhaps canada could do likewise.halo,wl,at.the court did not address halo design patent,trademark,or state law allegations.
the district court then balanced the private and public interests.as for private interests,the district court found that access to proof and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing witnesses weighed in favor of appellees.as for public interests,the district court found that the existence of a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home was neutral,while familiarity with governing law pointed perhaps slightly in halo favor.balancing all of the interests,the district court concluded that they weighed in appellees favor.accordingly,the district court dismissed the complaint.

discussion 
the doctrine of forum non conveniens has a long history.although transfer between federal courts was codified in a,forum non conveniens concerning foreign and state venues has always been a doctrine.piper aircraft,at charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.in,the supreme court recognized that the doctrine applies to suits in federal district court in gulf oil gilbert,and koster american lumbermens mutual casualty.forum non conveniens,the court explained,allows a federal district court to dismiss a suit over which it would normally have jurisdiction if trial in a foreign forum would best serve the convenience of the parties and the ends of justice.koster,at.whether dismissal would promote convenience and justice should be determined by weighing various private and public interest factors.see gilbert,u.at.such private interest factors include the relative ease of access to sources of proof availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling,and the cost of obtaining the attendance of unwilling,witnesses and the possibility of view of the premises.id.public interest factors include congest ion of the courts the burden of jury duty imposed upon a community which has no relation to the litigation a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home and the potential for a conflict of laws.id.at.
the supreme court returned to the doctrine of forum non conveniens in piper aircraft.there the court confronted a wrongful death action arising out of a plane crash in scotland.at.all of the decedents were scottish residents,and their administrator brought suit against the american plane and propeller manufacturers in united states district court,asserting,inter alia,strict tort liability theories.id.at.the district court dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds,but the third circuit reversed,reasoning that strict tort liability theories were unavailable in scotland,and thus dismissal would work a change in the applicable law such that forum non conveniens dismissal was precluded.id.at.
the supreme court disagreed.every forum non conveniens inquiry,the court explained,must begin with a determination of whether there exists an alternative forum that is both adequate and available to hear the case.id.at.an alternative forum is available if the defendant is amenable to process in the other jurisdiction.id.an alternative forum is adequate unless the remedy offered by the other forum is clearly unsatisfactory,as when the alternative forum does not permit litigation of the subject matter of the dispute.id.contrary to the holding of the third circuit,t he possibility of a change in substantive law does not automatically render an alternative forum inadequate.id.at.rather,an alternative forum is inadequate only if the remedy it would provide is so clearly inadequate or unsatisfactory that it is no remedy at all.id.at.if no available and adequate alternative forum exists,forum non conveniens dismissal is not permitted.id.at.if such an alternative forum does exist,district courts must proceed to balance the private and public interest factors described in gilbert to determine whether dismissal is warranted.see id.at.
it is clear after piper aircraft that an alternative forum is not adequate unless it permit s litigation of the subject matter of the dispute.id.at see also kamel hill rom,cir an alternative forum is adequate when the parties will not be deprived of all remedies or treated unfairly.in other words,ad
