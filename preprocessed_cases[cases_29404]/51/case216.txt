allard enterprises,originally brought suit against apr alleging,inter alia,federal trademark infringement.defendant advanced programming resources,filed related counterclaims.both parties sought exclusive rights to use the apr mark.the district court found that defendants used the mark first and issued a nationwide injunction enjoining plaintiff use of the mark.on appeal,the sixth circuit affirmed the district court priority determination as to first use but remanded to the district court to make findings and issue an order granting the appropriate geographic scope of injunctive relief.on remand,the district court cancelled plaintiff federal registration and ruled that defendants had prior common law rights in the mark throughout the state of ohio.plaintiff allard now appeals,alleging that the district court erred in granting a new trial to hear evidence on the geographic scope of the prior use of the mark,permitting defendants to amend their answer to include the counterclaim for cancellation of plaintiff registration,concluding that defendants had superior rights in the mark throughout all of ohio,and finding that plaintiff had not acquired any common law rights in its apr of ohio mark outside of ohio.
for the reasons stated below,we affirm the district court decision to grant a new trial.we reverse the district court decision to permit amendment of defendants counterclaim and we therefore reinstate plaintiff federal registration.we affirm the district court ruling that defendants have exclusive rights to use the mark in central ohio but vacate the district court priority determination as to the rest of ohio and remand to the district court for a priority determination,consistent with this opinion,as to the rights of the parties throughout ohio and throughout the rest of the united states.
the lengthy factual background of this case is laid out in more detail in the district court opinions and in this court previous opinion,but a brief overview follows.in the early,defendant barry heagren owned half of the stock of advanced programming resolutions,old apr,a company that placed employees in computer and data processing jobs and used the mark apr in connection with its services.old apr was bought by a company called ags,and after a two year buyout period,ags discontinued its use of the apr mark in december.heagren and charles allard both worked for ags.on january,heagren incorporated a new company called advanced programming resources,new apr or defendant apr,but continued to work for ags.keane,then purchased ags.charles allard left ags and he and his wife incorporated allard enterprises,allard or plaintiff on january,and registered allard programming resources,as a trade name with the state of ohio.allard unsuccessfully tried to register the name apr but it was already registered to ags.on april,allard successfully registered the trade name apr of ohio with the state of ohio.
heagren,believing incorrectly that new apr owned the rights to the apr mark,advised charles allard by letter that new apr felt that allard use of the mark apr of ohio infringed on new apr protected use of the apr mark.in response,allard filed an application,dated march,with the united states patent and trademark office for federal registration of its apr of ohio service mark,claiming that it first used the mark in connection with its services at least as early as april.on september,the service mark apr of ohio was registered to allard on the principal register of the patent and trademark office.meanwhile,heagren learned that the service mark apr was actually registered to ags,not to new.heagren tried unsuccessfully to register apr and apr of ohio with the state of ohio.
plaintiff allard brought this action in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio,alleging federal trademark infringement,false designation of origin,common law trademark infringement,unfair competition,and deceptive trade practices.defendants heagren and apr counterclaimed alleging false designation of origin,common law service mark infringement,unfair trade practices,and deceptive trade practices under state law.both parties sought injunctive relief preventing the other from using the service mark.
as a result of the original trial in this case,the district court held that defendants had established use of the apr service mark prior in time to plaintiff use and had overcome the presumption established by plaintiff allard federal registration of the mark.as a result,the district court issued an injunction stating that plaintiffs are permanently enjoined from continuing to use the mark apr or the mark apr of ohio in connection with the business of placing temporary or contract personnel with employers.plaintiff allard then appealed that decision to the sixth circuit court of appeals.on appeal,this court affirmed the trial court priority determination,but vacated the injunction on the grounds that it lack ed the requisite findings to support such a injunction,creating a real risk that the injunction proscribes an overly broad range of conduct,allard enterprises,advanced programming resources,cir,and remanded for further proceedings.
on remand,the district court ordered a new trial to hear evidence on the geographic range of defendants prior use of the mark,with instruction to the parties that evidence should not duplicate evidence presented at the original trial but may include additional evidence of defendants use of the mark up to and including september,the date the plaintiff mark was registered.order.during closing arguments in that second trial,defendants requested,for the first time,that the court cancel plaintiff federal trademark registration.the trial judge stated that defendants had to file a motion to amend defendants answer to include a counterclaim for cancellation of plaintiff registration.the trial judge then granted defendants motion to amend.order.in its final order,the trial court granted defendants counterclaim,canceled plaintiff federal trademark registration and held that defendants had prior rights in the apr mark throughout the state of ohio.opinion and order.plaintiff allard now appeals.
plaintiff argues first that on remand an evidentiary hearing was not required to comply with the mandate of this court.plaintiff argues that because defendants counterclaimed and requested an injunction against plaintiffs,defendants should have submitted evidence as to the appropriate extent of the injunction at the first trial.thus,plaintiff argues that review of the appropriate geographic range of the injunction should be limited to a review of the full record of the original trial.
despite the fact that both parties requested injunctions in the first trial,it is clear that the only issue tried in that first trial was priority of use.this court,on the first appeal,concluded that the district court erred in granting a nationwide injunction without the findings to support that geographic range.allard,at.this court also explicitly stated that the record was not sufficient to evaluate the appropriate scope of the injunction.the court held that the record in this case provides inadequate evidence for us to gauge the geographic range of defendants prior use of the mark.allard,at.thus,this court gave the following mandate to the trial court 
w e vacate the injunction and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings.the district court first should make factual findings defining the region where defendants continuously used their apr mark before plaintiff registration,and then should issue an order granting the appropriate scope of injunctive relief.
id.at.on remand,the trial court ordered an evidentiary hearing to determine the appropriate geographic scope of the injunction,stating that i f the record as it exists was insufficient for the court of appeals to make that finding,it is similarly insufficient for this court to do so.
the district court decision to hold an evidentiary hearing is not outside of the mandate provided by this court.under the mandate rule,the district court must act,on remand,in accordance with the decision of a superior court 
t he mandate rule requires lower courts to adhere to the commands of a superior court accordingly,u pon remand of the case for further proceedings after a decision by the appellate court,the trial court must proceed in accordance with the mandate and the law of the case as established on appeal.the trial court must implement both the letter and the spirit of the mandate,taking into account the appellate court opinion and the circumstances it embraces.
united states moored,cir quoting united states kikumura,cir.in the present case,the sixth circuit explicitly remanded for further proceedings to determine the appropriate geographic scope of the injunction.the district court decision to hear more evidence on that issue did not violate this court mandate.
plaintiff also alleges that even if it were not outside of the mandate of this court,the district court decision to hold a new trial was an abuse of discretion because defendants should have presented any evidence relevant to the appropriate scope of an injunction in the first trial,when they first requested an injunction.this court rejected the substance of this argument on the first appeal,however,holding that it could review the breadth of the injunction,regardless of the lack of any discussion of the issue below.this court held that plaintiff failure to raise the issue of the scope of the injunction below was not grounds for waiver.allard,at.because plaintiff did not waive a challenge to the scope of the injunction,the district judge did not abuse his discretion by hearing evidence on the issue.we conclude that the district court acted within the mandate of this court and within its discretion in granting an evidentiary hearing to make factual findings as to the appropriate geographic scope of the injunction.
plaintiff next alleges that the district court erred in granting defendants motion to amend their answer to include a counterclaim for cancellation of plaintiff federal trademark registration.we must first determine whether the district court acted contrary to the mandate issued by this court on the first appeal.as described above,the mandate rule requires that,upon remand from this court,the district court proceed in accordance with the mandate and the law of the case established on appeal.although the trial court must implement both the letter and spirit of the mandate,taking into account the appellate court opinion and the circumstances it embraces,united states moored,cir citations omitted,the trial court may consider those issues not decided expressly or impliedly by the appellate court or a previous trial court.jones lewis,cir.in evaluating whether the district court followed the letter and the spirit of the mandate,however,it is important to determine whether the remand issued by this court to the district court was of a general or limited nature 
r emands can be either general or limited in scope.limited remands explicitly outline the issues to be addressed by the district court and create a narrow framework within which the district court must operate general remands,in contrast,give the district court authority to address all matters as long as remaining consistent with the remand.
united states campbell,cir.
the district court relied on this court statement that the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,to determine that the mandate was a general one.the district court went on to conclude that the sixth circuit decision had not addressed the validity of plaintiff registration.based on its conclusions that the remand was general and that this court had not addressed,either explicitly or implicitly,the validity of plaintiff registration,the district court held that it could evaluate the registration without violating the mandate rule.
contrary to the district court conclusion,however,this court opinion suggests that the remand was in fact limited in scope.this court reversed the district court only as to the scope of the injunction.the relevant language from this court opinion is as follows 
the true deficiency of the order in this case is that it lacks the requisite findings to support such a injunction,creating a real risk that the injunction proscribes an overly broad range of conduct.
sixth circuit cases make it clear that allard enterprises retained the right to use its mark in those geographic regions that defendants had not entered at the time of allard enterprises federal registration therefore,we find that the court order fails to set forth the reasons for its issuance and runs afoul of rule d.moreover,the record in this case provides inadequate evidence for us to gauge the geographic range of defendants prior use of the mark.for these reasons,we vacate the injunction and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings.the district court first should make factual findings defining the region where defendants continuously used their apr mark before plaintiff registration,and then should issue an order granting the appropriate scope of injunctive relief.
allard,at.in the last sentence of the language quoted above,this court provided explicit,limited instructions to the district court regarding the remand.the district court failed to address that sentence when it concluded that this was a general remand.this court restricted the district court action to only that necessary to make sufficient findings of fact and issue an appropriately limited injunction.
thus,we conclude that the district court violated the mandate rule by permitting the counterclaim by amendment as a result,the district court ruling on that counterclaim can not stand and we reverse the district court order canceling plaintiff trade name registration.we reinstate allard federal registration,with the limitations discussed below.
plaintiff also contests the district court determination of its rights and defendants rights to the service mark.at common law,ownership of trademark or service mark rights is obtained by actual use.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed hereinafter mccarthy.the first to use a mark in the sale of goods or services is the senior user of the mark and gains common law rights to the mark in the geographic area in which the mark is used.
ownership rights flow only from prior actual or constructive.federal registration of a trademark or service mark can not create rights and priority over others who have previously used the mark in commerce,but federal registration is prima facie evidence of the registrant ownership and exclusive right to use the mark,b,a,and constitutes constructive use of the mark.mccarthy ed.constructive use means that which establishes a priority date with the same legal effect as the earliest actual use of a trademark at common law.mccarthy ed.in the typical case in which a senior user applies for the federal registration,c onstructive use will fix a registrant nationwide priority rights in a mark from the filing of its application for registration.id.in the case in which a junior user applies for registration,however,the extent of the senior territory is frozen as of the date of actual registration to the junior user.mccarthy,lanham act.
the territorial rights of a holder of a federally registered trademark are always subject to any superior common law rights acquired by another party through actual use prior to the registrant constructive use.thus,in the present case,although allard the junior user filed an application to register the mark on march,and the mark was validly registered on the principal register on september,allard ownership rights are subject to any superior common law rights acquired by apr the senior user prior to registration.the district court has previously determined,and this court affirmed,that apr is the senior user of the apr mark.in other words,the district court concluded that defendant apr used the mark in commerce first,prior to allard first recognized use in its march,mailing.thus,it is clear that apr has some right to the use of the mark superior to allard,despite allard federal registration.the key question here,however,is the correct geographic extent of that
