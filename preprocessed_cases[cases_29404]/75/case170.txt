background 
between september and april,mix worked for d h railway at various railway yards as a laborer,trainer,qualified conductor,and engineer.in november,mix consulted an otolaryngologist,leonard newton,concerning ringing in his ears.mix concedes that,according to newton notes,he complained of reduced hearing for some period of time and that it was especially notable in high pitches during the past years.mix also concedes that newton notes reported a chronic problem with tinnitus,or ringing in his ears,which was occurring of the time.finally,mix concedes that the history notes that he was exposed to loud noises for years as the result of his employment with the railroad.during his deposition,mix testified that he initially noticed the ringing and said,a fter that my hearing just progressively got worse to the point where i at today.in response to the question,at the time you consulted newton did you have some belief that the ringing in your ear s and any problems you were having were related to your work,mix answered,i going to say yes,it just kept getting worse.moreover,mix testified that newton told him that he had a hearing problem.
in august,mix completed a medical history questionnaire when he renewed his engineer license.in response to the question,have you ever worked on a noisy job,mix checked the yes box and wrote years with the railway.in response to the question,have you ever been told or noticed you are hard of hearing,mix checked the yes box and wrote both.in response to the question,do you have any ringing or buzzing in your ears,mix checked the yes box and wrote constant.during his deposition,mix testified that when he wrote that he was hard of hearing,he meant that he was constantly having trouble understanding his wife.however,he testified that his answer on the application was an accurate statement.he also testified that his wife told him all the time that he was having trouble hearing.
between and,mix underwent annual hearing exams administered by both his employer and the state of new york.mix testified that he generally did not receive the results of these hearing tests.in,d h railway representative called mix to inform him that he had failed the hearing test.however,the representative subsequently called him back to inform him that her prior call was a mistake and that he should forget that she had even called.mix testified during his deposition that at the time of this call,he was having the ringing,having a problem hearing,which progressively worsened.mix continued to work for d h railway until april,when he failed his most recent hearing exam and was dismissed from his position.
mix filed the instant suit june,pursuant to the federal employers liability act,et.fela.mix alleged that his hearing loss was caused by his exposure to noisy working conditions and that d h railway did not provide him with a reasonably safe working environment.mix alleged that although d h railway required employees to wear earplugs in certain noisy areas,d h railway should have instructed employees to wear earplugs throughout the entire railroad yard.mix alleged that d h railway failed to make earplugs available at all times during his employment and that he complained to management when they were not available.mix also alleged that he suffered hearing damage,despite the fact that he generally wore ear protection while working as an engineer.

legal standards 
the federal employers liability act provides that n o action shall be maintained unless commenced within three years from the day the cause of action accrued.with respect to gradual injuries those which occur gradually,over long periods of time,due to ongoing exposure to harmful working supreme court has adopted a discovery rule and held that the fela statute of limitations accrues when the injury manifest s itself,taking into account whether the plaintiff should have known of his injury.urie thompson.the court subsequently applied this discovery rule to claims under the federal tort claims act,ftca,holding that a tort claim does not accrue until the plaintiff discovers both his injury and its cause,but that accrual does not await awareness by the plaintiff that his injury was negligently inflicted.see united states kubrick,d.although this discovery rule was refined in the context of ftca cases,the genesis of the rule can be traced to urie and courts apply it to fela cases.see,campbell grand trunk,cir fries chicago northwestern transp,cir albert maine cent,cir townley norfolk,cir dubose kansas city ry,cir.thus,an fela action accrues when the plaintiff in the exercise of reasonable diligence knows both the existence and the cause of his injury.ulrich veterans admin,cir citing kubrick,at.
discussion 
mix injuries prior to june,
we affirm the district court decision to grant summary judgment to d h railway,to the extent that mix claim seeks to recover for injuries he suffered prior to june.the undisputed facts establish that mix knew,or should have known,of the existence of his injury prior to that date.mix consulted newton in november,and he concedes that the doctor notes indicate that he complained of reduced hearing for some period of time.less than one year later,mix completed an application to renew his engineer license.in response to the question,have you ever been told or noticed you are hard of hearing,mix checked the yes box and wrote both.during his deposition,mix testified that he initially noticed ringing in his ears,prompting his visit to newton in,after which his hearing just progressively got worse.
mix argues that he consulted newton for a distinct injury.specifically,he argues that t he problems with tinnitus and hearing loss are separate and distinct medical conditions.even accepting the purported distinction between tinnitus and hearing loss,the record reflects that mix complained of hearing loss prior to june.specifically,he complained of reduced hearing to newton in and admitted to being hard of hearing in.he also testified that his hearing progressively got worse after his initial visit to newton.
mix also argues that he provided contradictory testimony concerning when he had notice of his hearing loss.he cites only one portion of his deposition transcript in which he said the following 
do you remember telling the healthcare provider back in that you had been told that you were hard of hearing or that you noticed being hard of hearing 
yes,my wife tells me all the time.
q.what about back in,were you aware of it then 
somewhat,not to the extent that it is right now.
q.when you say,somewhat,you had noticed that you were hard of hearing back in 
a.this can i put this this is like my wife,she constantly saying things t
