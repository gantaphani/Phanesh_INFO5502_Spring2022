in this municipal annexation dispute,we consider whether a county commissioners court may petition a city to include portions of its county roads within that city extraterritorial jurisdiction i pursuant to the legislature grant of general control over all roads,see.loc.gov t code or ii as agent of the state of texas,see id.b.because we hold that the legislature has neither expressly nor impliedly conferred such power upon a commissioners court under either section or b,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the city of san antonio and the city of boerne stipulated to the relevant facts.on november,san antonio city council passed an ordinance the san antonio ordinance annexing certain property located in san antonio extraterritorial jurisdiction on the december,effective date of this annexation,san antonio extraterritorial jurisdiction expanded to include property that was previously unincorporated by any city.see id.a.
after san antonio passed its annexation ordinance,but before it became effective,a number of property owners in kendall and comal counties petitioned boerne to include their property within boerne extraterritorial jurisdiction.see id.b the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality may expand beyond the distance limitations imposed by section to include an area contiguous to the otherwise existing extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality if the owners of the area request the expansion.however,the property of those petitioning owners was too dispersed to satisfy section b contiguity requirement.to overcome that obstacle,had agreed to coordinate the annexation petitions from kendall and comal county commissioners courts to include various sections of their counties roads within boerne extraterritorial jurisdiction.boerne then passed a number of ordinances the boerne ordinances extending its extraterritorial jurisdiction accordingly.
boerne concedes that,without including county roads,much of the area is insufficiently contiguous to satisfy section b by including these county roads,however,boerne believes it properly acquired jurisdiction over an area that,absent the boerne ordinances,would be within the extraterritorial jurisdiction created by the san antonio ordinance.thus,in contravention of local government code section c,san antonio and boerne effectively claimed authority over the same area.see id.c the expansion of the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality through annexation,request,or increase in the number of inhabitants may not include any area in the existing extraterritorial jurisdiction of another municipality.
in,boerne sued san antonio,seeking a declaratory judgment that the overlapping extraterritorial jurisdiction belonged to boerne,not san antonio.boerne also sought a permanent injunction prohibiting san antonio from asserting jurisdiction over the contested land area.based on stipulated facts,the trial court ruled that the overlapping property was validly within boerne extraterritorial jurisdiction before the san antonio ordinance went into effect.the trial court judgment also provided that as of december,the effective date of the boerne ordinances,boerne had exclusive control over the overlapping extraterritorial jurisdiction.the judgment permanently enjoined san antonio from asserting any jurisdiction or authority,or attempting to enforce its ordinances,rules regulations,over the area declared to be the exclusive extraterritorial jurisdiction of boerne.
san antonio appealed the trial court judgment and argued,among other things,that the kendall and comal county commissioners courts lacked authority to petition boerne to include segments of their counties roads within boerne extraterritorial jurisdiction the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment,holding that county commissioners,as agents for the state,were empowered to petition for inclusion in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of boerne.in this court,san antonio challenges the commissioners courts authority to petition a city to annex county roads pursuant to local government code sections and.we granted san antonio petition for review to resolve this issue.may.

discussion 
san antonio and boerne agree that the issue here is whether a county commissioners court may,either pursuant to powers set forth in local government code section or as the state agent under local government code section b,petition to include portions of county roads within a given municipality extraterritorial jurisdiction.see.loc.gov t code.boerne argues that the legislature reenactment of section to section the legislature intent to give commissioners courts the authority to petition for annexation.san antonio,on the other hand,contends that the statutes are unrelated and that our construction of one should not influence our construction of the other.before analyzing these contentions,we briefly trace the historical background of extraterritorial jurisdiction and annexation in texas and discuss the source of and limitations on a commissioners court power.
extraterritorial jurisdiction 
extraterritorial jurisdiction refers to the unincorporated area that is contiguous to the corporate boundaries of the municipality and is located within a specified distance of those boundaries,depending upon the number of inhabitants within the municipality.id.the purpose of extraterritorial jurisdiction is to promote and protect the general health,safety,and welfare of persons residing in and adjacent to the municipalities.id.
generally,a municipality extraterritorial jurisdiction may not expand beyond legislatively prescribed limits.see id.if the owners of a particular area request an expansion,however,t he extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality may expand beyond the distance limitations imposed by section to include an area contiguous to the otherwise existing extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality.id.b.boerne argues that the commissioners courts petitions bring this case within section exception permitting expansion beyond the legislatively prescribed extraterritorial limits.
municipal annexation and the home rule amendment 
before,the legislature created virtually all cities and municipal corporations.see.const.art.xi,interp.commentary see also robert ashcroft barbara kyle balfour,home rule cities and municipal annexation in texas recent trends and future prospects,mary.at that time,texas permitted annexation under only two circumstances i pursuant to the general law,usually by majority vote of the annexed residents,or ii by special act of the legislature granting or amending a specific city charter.see.const.art.xi,interp.commentary trueman,annexing new territory a review of texas law and the proposals for legislative control of cities extending their boundaries.by adopting the home rule amendment in,texas withdrew the legislature power to grant and change home rule city charters by special laws.const.art.xi,interp.commentary citing state ex rel.wayland vincent,aff.

in,reacting to these widespread annexation wars,the legislature passed the municipal annexation act.stat.the act was designed to curb the virtually unlimited power of home rule municipalities to unilaterally annex territory.laidlaw waste,city of wilmer,sitton city of lindale.the act main provisions limited cities annexation powers by i requiring cities to complete the annexation process within ninety days ii restricting the annexed territory size and shape and iii prohibiting cities from annexing property that was not within the confines of their extraterritorial jurisdiction.stat.these limitations frame our discussion of a commissioners court authority.

turning now to the parties contentions,we must determine whether the legislature,in giving commissioners courts general control over the roads,expressly or impliedly conferred the authority to petition a city to annex portions of county roads.
boerne contends that,in enacting section,the legislature intended to give commissioners courts broad power over all things involving,relating to or applicable to public roads.specifically,boerne asserts that the statute general control language shows that the legislature authorized a commissioners court to voluntarily petition a city to include a county road within its extraterritorial jurisdiction.boerne further argues that,pursuant to local government code section b,a commissioners court can,as the state agent,exercise the state power as owner to petition for annexation.san antonio contends that neither section nor b empowers a commissioners court to petition a municipality to annex county roads.as to section,san antonio argues that the legislature,in giving commissioners courts general control over the roads,intended only to exercise those powers required to serve the traveling public,such as regulating traffic and designing,constructing,repairing,and maintaining public roads.moreover,san antonio contends that,because the state does not own county roads,a commissioners court has no authority under section b to act as the state agent in petitioning for annexation 
general control over roads 
the legislature gave commissioners courts general control over the roads in.see act approved july,ch,laws,reprinted in gammel,laws of texas.at the time the parties dispute arose,the relevant provision specifying a commissioners court power provided 
each commissioners court may establish public ferries whenever the public interest may require lay out and establish,change,discontinue,close,abandon,or vacate public roads and highways build bridges and keep them in repair appoint road overseers and apportion hands exercise general control over all roads,highways,ferries,and bridges in the counties 
loc.gov t code emphasis added.because the legislature did not define general control,we will use tools of statutory construction to determine its meaning.cail serv.motors,if the disputed statute is clear and unambiguous extrinsic aids and rules of statutory construction are inappropriate.citation omitted.
a fundamental rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature intent.state terrell,imperial irrigation jayne.when general words like general control follow specific and particularized enumerations of powers like establish public ferries and lay out and establish public roads,we treat the general words as limited and apply them only to the same kind or class of powers as those expressly mentioned.stanford butler.we employ this rule to construe specific terms no more broadly than the legislature intended.see id.moreover,the meaning of particular words in a statute may be ascertained by reference to other words associated with them in the same statute.county of harris eaton.
applying these canons of construction,we conclude that the legislature grant of general control over the roads does not include the power to petition a city to annex certain portions of a given county road.if,as boerne contends,general control is read to include the power to petition for annexation,then there would have been no need for the legislature to illustrate in subsections one through four the types of specific power a commissioners court may utilize pursuant to section.see spence fenchler,it is an elementary rule of construction that,when possible to do so,effect must be given to every sentence,clause,and word of a statute so that no part thereof be rendered superfluous or inoperative.because a commissioners court power is limited to that which is expressly delegated to it by the texas constitution or legislature,or necessarily implied to perform its duties,we will not read the legislature grant of general control to be more expansive than the type of powers set forth in section.state ex rel.city of jasper gulf states utils,limiting commissioners courts powers to those expressly conferred or necessarily implied.ry.of thomason,writ ref it has long been the rule of the courts to construe exceptions to general rules strictly.section,when construed as a whole,clearly contemplate s that the commissioners court of each county shall regard public transportation as a system,to be laid out,changed,repaired,improved,and maintained,as far as practical,as a whole to the best interest and welfare of all the people of the county.canales,at.therefore,when we construe a commissioners court express power under section,we focus on the statute transportation and safety aspects.in so doing,we hold that the legislature intended to limit a commissioners court authority under section to matters relating to public travel.see.loc.gov t code.
a commissioners court actions are thus sanctioned under section only if related to its duty to protect the public interest in transportation.see canales,at.unless the power to petition for annexation is necessary for a commissioners court to carry out that function,we will not imply that it has such power.see gulf states utils,at terrell sparks.here,the power to petition for inclusion in a city extraterritorial jurisdiction is neither expressly conferred nor necessarily implied to enable a commissioners court to perform its delegated duty to provide safe roads for public travel.accordingly,we reject boerne broad construction of the phrase general control,and hold that a county commissioners court is without authority to petition for annexation of its county roads under section.
