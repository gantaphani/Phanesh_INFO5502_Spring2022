plaintiff michael bilyou bilyou appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york colleen mcmahon,judge granting summary judgment to and dismissing plaintiff claim for overtime pay under the fair labor standards act flsa,et plaintiff is a former delivery driver for defendant dutchess beer distributors,dbd,a wholesale beverage distributor located in poughkeepsie,new york.plaintiff sued dbd for unpaid overtime allegedly accrued during the course of his employment.the district court ruled that he was subject to the authority of the united states secretary of transportation with respect to his qualifications and maximum hours of service and thus exempt from the overtime requirement of the flsa.we affirm the judgment denying plaintiff claim under the flsa.
background 
bilyou worked as a delivery route driver for dbd from june to january,when he was terminated for cause.he claims that during the course of his employment he regularly worked more than hours per week and is thus entitled under the flsa to overtime pay at the rate of one and times his regular rate of pay.
pursuant to a license from the united states bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms,dbd is permitted to receive,sell,and deliver malted beverages in interstate commerce.dbd distributes beer and other beverages to retail outlets in the hudson valley region.percent of its business is beer,and the rest is water and wine cooler products.its customers include bars,restaurants,convenience stores,delis,supermarkets,and beer and soda discount centers.dbd has more than customers,all located within the state of new york.between and,the company grossed more than in sales per year.
dbd runs its distribution operation primarily out of a processing center in poughkeepsie,new york,but it also maintains a warehouse in kingston,new york.next to dbd center in poughkeepsie is a recycling facility operated by aluminum can recycling.is owned by the owners of dbd.facility,which is located on the same parcel of property as dbd,processes exclusively dbd products.dbd uses portions of facility for office and storage space.dbd and lease the property from a real estate holding company that is owned by the owners of dbd and.
dbd obtains most of its inventory from suppliers and breweries.it receives products from breweries in new york,new jersey,new hampshire,texas,california,pennsylvania,mexico,germany,and canada.dbd main supplier of beer products is ab,which provides about percent of its inventory.dbd is the exclusive ab distributor in the hudson valley distribution area.the vast majority of ab products are shipped to dbd processing center in poughkeepsie from breweries in newark,new jersey and merrimack,new hampshire.ab main office in louis,missouri is connected by an electronic communication system to dbd poughkeepsie facility,enabling ab to monitor daily the amount and distribution of its products delivered to dbd customers.if dbd delivers ab products to a retailer in the morning,ab knows by that afternoon exactly what type of product and how much has been delivered.based on this daily sales information,ab determines the amounts and types of products to ship to dbd.ab also communicates directly with several of dbd customers,informing them of promotions and advertisements,but all customers place orders with and make payments to dbd.
dbd basic business operation is as follows products are delivered daily from breweries,mostly out of state,to dbd processing center.dbd takes title to the products upon delivery at its processing center or warehouse.approximately to tractor trailer loads of products are received each week.dbd arranges to receive products from most breweries through contract haulers.dbd own drivers do not transport the products from supplying breweries.the products have not been designated for a final retailer at the time of delivery.most products arrive at the warehouse in stacked pallets,and are then organized and divided in dbd temperature controlled facility by container,brand,and flavor.dbd storage time for beer products varies from two weeks to one month.dbd generally keeps an inventory on hand worth between million.
dbd utilizes its own sales staff.retail customers place orders directly with dbd.after receiving orders from customers,dbd prepares a load sheet for each of its route drivers.the route drivers load their trucks according to the load sheets and deliver the products to various customers.all of dbd deliveries occur within the state of new york.distribution areas include dutchess,ulster,greene,columbia and delaware counties.
upon making product deliveries,dbd route drivers collect empty product containers empties from customers and transport them to either dbd kingston facility or facility in poughkeepsie.empties include aluminum cans,glass and plastic containers,and returnable or refillable containers such as empty barrels,bottles,and pallets.route drivers like bilyou,who drive out of the poughkeepsie facility,deliver all collected empties to drivers working out of the kingston warehouse return aluminum empties to the kingston facility,and other empties to most of the empties are taken to the facility.
as to the glass empties,purchases them from dbd,crushes them,and then sells them to different suppliers.makes all arrangements for the shipment or of the crushed glass,and purchasers of the glass pay directly.ships out or arranges the of the crushed glass in tractor trailers to connecticut or pennsylvania about three times a week.also processes plastic empties,refillable and returnable containers,and some of the aluminum empties.as to the aluminum empties,purchases them from dbd,crushes and sells them,and sends them to connecticut approximately three times per month.
also packages the returnable containers and loads them onto trailers in preparation for their return to the brewery.ab is generally the only vendor to whom returnable containers are sent on a regular basis.ab sends dbd preprinted invoices for the return of refillable empties,designating dbd as the sender of the empties.dbd pays an advance deposit for the refillable empties,and it recoups between and in monthly credit upon returning the containers.several tractor trailers of refillable empties are returned to the breweries each week.dbd contracts with a third party hauler,transport,which picks up the loaded trailers and drops them off at an brewery.
some of the aluminum empties are also taken to dbd kingston facility,where they are flattened and loaded onto a trailer to be picked up by reynolds aluminum.reynolds purchases the processed aluminum empties from dbd and takes them to a recycling plant in connecticut.
proceedings below 
in june,bilyou brought this suit against dbd on behalf of himself and other similarly situated dbd drivers.the amended complaint sought unpaid overtime pay under the flsa and articles and of new york labor law.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of dbd on the basis of the motor carrier exemption to the flsa.see bilyou dutchess beer distributors,wl.it found that dbd was a private motor carrier subject to the authority of the secretary of transportation the secretary to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service for covered employees under the motor carrier act of mca.because employees subject to the secretary power are exempt from the overtime requirements of the flsa,b,the court held that bilyou was not entitled to overtime compensation.
bilyou made two arguments challenging the secretary authority to regulate qualifications and maximum hours of service for dbd drivers.first,he claimed that dbd was not subject to the secretary authority under because it was not engaged in interstate transportation as specified in.the court rejected this argument because even though dbd delivery routes were intrastate,including both new merchandise and empties,dbd carried goods that were in the course of interstate shipment.bilyou,wl at.
bilyou also contended that dbd was exempted from the secretary authority by a,which deprives the secretary of jurisdiction over the transportation of property by motor vehicle when the transportation furthers a primary business other than transportation of the person.bilyou argued that dbd primary business is beer wholesaling,not transportation.the district court rejected this argument,finding that dbd primary business was transportation.bilyou,wl,at.the court concluded that dbd was subject to regulation by the secretary of transportation and was thus exempt from the overtime standards of the flsa.the court dismissed bilyou federal claim under the flsa and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims.this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,bilyou raises three main challenges to the district court decision that the motor carrier exemption relieved dbd from the flsa overtime requirements.he contends first that the delivery routes of dbd drivers are not between a place in a state and a place in another state,with the consequence that the secretary lacks jurisdiction to regulate dbd.see a.second,bilyou argues that because dbd motor vehicle transportation furthers a primary business other than transportation,the secretary is prohibited by from regulating dbd drivers.finally,he claims that dbd failure to comply with several department of transportation dot regulations estops it from invoking the secretary authority to regulate it.
at the outset,we recognize that exemptions to the flsa are narrowly construed against the employers seeking to assert them and their application limited to those establishments plainly and unmistakably within their terms and spirit.arnold ben kanowsky,d.the burden of invoking these exemptions rests upon the employer.id.at.see also martin malcolm pirnie,cir.we conclude nonetheless that the secretary of transportation has the power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service for dbd drivers pursuant to the motor carrier act,and that dbd drivers are therefore exempt from the overtime requirements of the flsa.
i.the application of the motor carrier exemption to dbd 
the flsa requires employers to pay overtime wages to certain employees who work more than forty hours in a week.it provides,in pertinent part 
maximum hours 
a employees engaged in interstate commerce 
except as otherwise provided in this section,no employer shall employ any of his employees who in any workweek is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,or is employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and times the regular rate at which he is employed.
this provision does not apply,however,to employees for whom the secretary of transportation may prescribe requirements for qualifications and maximum hours of service under.the flsa states 
b the provisions of section of this title shall not apply with respect to 
any employee with respect to whom the secretary of transportation has power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of section of title.
pursuant to its authority under the mca,the 
secretary of transportation may prescribe requirements for qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees of,and standards of equipment of,a motor private carrier,when needed to promote safety of operation.
a motor private carrier is defined as 
a person,other than a motor carrier,transporting property by motor vehicle when 
a the transportation is as provided in section of this title 
b the person is the owner,lessee,or bailee of the property being transported and 
c the property is being transported for sale,lease,rent,or bailment or to further a commercial enterprise.
dbd is a person transporting property by motor vehicle.it is not a motor carrier,in that it does not carry for compensation.see the term motor carrier means a person providing motor vehicle transportation for compensation.dbd is the owner of the property being transported,and the property is being transported for sale or to further a commercial enterprise.dbd thus fits perfectly within the definition of a motor private carrier,if the transportation it performs is as provided in of title.
section gives the secretary jurisdiction over transportation by motor carrier if,inter alia,passengers or property are transported by motor carrier 
between a place in 
a a state and a place in another state 
b a state and another place in the same state through another state 
ii.dbd satisfies the interstate commerce requirement of the motor carrier exemption to the flsa 
bilyou contends that dbd carriage of goods does not conform to the requirements of.he argues it is not between a state and a place in another state.even if a carrier transportation does not cross state lines,the interstate commerce requirement is satisfied if the goods being transported within the borders of one state are involved in a practical continuity of movement in the flow of interstate commerce.walling jacksonville paper.see also atlantic coast line standard oil of kentucky.project hope ibn sina,cir noting in the carmack amendment context,which is also governed by the interstate commerce requirement of,the nature of a shipment is determined by the essential character of the commerce,reflected by the intention formed prior to shipment,pursuant to which the property is carried to a selected destination by a continuous or unified movement.quotation marks and citations omitted foxworthy hiland dairy,cir transportation within a single state may remain interstate in character when it forms a part of a practical continuity of movement across state lines from the point of origin to the point of destination.citation omitted reich american driver,cir wholly intrastate commerce satisfies interstate requirement when part of continuing transportation b interstate commerce requirement satisfied where the vehicles do not actually cross state lines but operate solely within a single state,if what is being transported is actually moving in interstate commerce.
whether the transportation is of an interstate nature can be determined by reference to the intended final destination of the transportation when that ultimate destination was envisaged at the time the transportation commenced.project hope,at see also atlantic coast line,at.determining continuity of transportation by examining whether the destination of the goods is arranged for or fixed in the minds of the sellers klitzke steiner,cir whether transportation is interstate or intrastate is determined by the essential character of the commerce,manifested by shipper fixed and persisting transportation intent at the time of the shipment.citation omitted emphasis in original foxworthy,at crucial to a determination of the essential character of a shipment is the shipper fixed and persisting intent at the time of shipment.quotation marks and citation omitted b intrastate transportation can satisfy the interstate commerce requirement of the mca if the shipper has a fixed and persisting transportation intent beyond the terminal storage point at the time of shipment.the intent at the time transportation commences fixes the character of the shipment for all the legs of the transport within the united states.project hope,at.
dbd asserts that two aspects of its business operation satisfy the interstate commerce requirement its distribution within new york state of products and its collection and export of empty containers.we agree that dbd operation involving the transportation of empties is part of the flow of interstate commerce,and therefore find it unnecessary to determine whether dbd intrastate distribution of products also meets the interstate commerce requirement.
in the course of delivering products to retail customers,bilyou regularly picked up glass,plastic,and aluminum empties,as well as refillable containers,and carried them to facility in poughkeepsie for further shipment several times a week to destinations outside the state.although bilyou carriage of the empties took place entirely within the state of new york,his carriage was merely one leg of a route to an destination.his segment of the transportation of those empties was part of the interstate movement of goods.see jacksonville paper,at.a temporary pause in the transit of goods does not mean that they are no longer in commerce i f the halt in the movement of the goods is a convenient intermediate step in the process of getting them to their final destinations,they remain in commerce until they reach those points.we agree with the district court determination that bilyou involvement in this process was part of a continuous movement of goods in interstate commerce.foxworthy,at the and deposit of empty milk crates at a distribution center that were then shipped to an processing plant exempted employee drivers from flsa overtime provisions opelika royal crown bottling goldberg,cir distributor and return of empties to brewery is part of the interstate movement of goods,where it is clear from the moment of that the empties have an intended final destination to a specific brewery.
bilyou argues that dbd handling of the empties is not part of an interstate shipment because it is,not dbd,that processes the empties and arranges for their shipment.assuming bilyou argument might be valid if were an independent entity that purchased the empties at arm length from dbd,that is not the case.and dbd are related entities and are not in an arm length relationship to one another.they have common owners,share the same property,and arrange with one another the allocation of the benefits and burdens of handling the empties.for example,as to the returnable and refillable containers,while packages and loads them onto trailers,it is dbd that receives a credit from for their return.
neither purchases those refillable empties from dbd,nor does it receive payment from ab.the district court found that ab sends dbd preprinted invoices for the shipment of returns the amount dbd is credited for the return is exactly the same as the amount dbd for deposits on the same product when it was originally shipped for distribution.wl at.these invoices designate dbd as the sender of the refillable containers.furthermore,the refillable empties are transported from facility to breweries by a shipper with whom dbd has contracted.thus,from the moment it receives these products,dbd has a fixed and persisting intent to return the refillable containers to breweries.see project hope,at b.
we have considered bilyou remaining arguments contesting dbd involvement in interstate commerce,and we find them to be without merit.we conclude that dbd role in the process of collecting,transporting,and exporting empty containers is part of the continuous movement of those goods in interstate commerce,and that the requirement of a is therefore satisfied.dbd thus satisfies all of the criteria for the application of b,and consequently of the motor carrier exemption under the flsa,b.
iii.does not deprive the secretary of transportation of authority to regulate bilyou qualifications and maximum hours 
attempting to defeat the application of section of title,bilyou argues that under the secretary of transportation is deprived of jurisdiction over dbd because dbd primary business is wholesaling,rather than transportation.the same argument has been presented to two other circuits both have rejected it.see klitzke steiner,cir friedrich computer,cir see also carpenter pennington seed,wl.we reject it also.
bilyou reading is not supported by the text of the statutes or their history.section provides 
a neither the secretary of transportation nor the surface transportation board has jurisdiction under this part over the transportation of property by motor vehicle when 
the property is transported by a person engaged in a business other than transportation and 
the transportation is within the scope of,and furthers a primary business other than transportation of the person.
bilyou contends that because dbd is primarily a wholesaler of beer and other beverages,rather than a transporter,this provision exempts it from dot authority and renders inapplicable the motor carrier exemption to the flsa.while his argument has a superficial appeal,it does not withstand a careful reading of the statutes.
bilyou is correct that covers dbd,because dbd transportation is in furtherance of a primary business other than beer and beverage wholesaling business.but the remainder of bilyou argument falters.on the basis of dbd involvement in another primary business other than transportation,exempts it from the secretary jurisdiction,as specified in this part,over transportation of property by motor vehicle.emphasis added.section is a provision of part b of subtitle iv of title.that part contains provisions authorizing the dot to enact registration and security insurance and bonding requirements for motor carriers,freight forwarders,and brokers.see registration requirements for motor carriers registration requirements for freight forwarders registration requirements for brokers see also bonding and insurance requirements for motor carriers,freight forwarders,and brokers 
section has no bearing on the secretary power,as described in b,to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of section of title.section falls under a different part of title.it falls in part b of subtitle vi relating to motor vehicle and driver programs.the fact that denies the secretary power to prescribe economic and licensing regulations of the sort covered in subtitle iv,part b,in no way contradicts the secretary authority,established in a different part of the motor carrier act,to set qualifications and maximum hours of service for drivers to promote safety of operations.that is the crucial inquiry under flsa b,and,as shown above,dbd satisfies those criteria 
this understanding of the different purposes of and is confirmed by a brief exploration of the history and purpose of precursor provisions in the mca.the mca originally contemplated three categories of motor carriers common,contract,and private.common and contract carriers were known as carriers.see united states drum,d.common carriers offered transportation for property and passengers for the general public,while contract carriers arranged transportation services by contract.see stat,a see also mercury motor express,united states,cir.private carriers transported property of which they were the owner,lessee,or bailee,when such transportation is for the purpose of sale,lease,rent,or bailment,or in furtherance of any commercial enterprise.stat,a.
since the time of its passage,the mca has endowed the interstate commerce commission with the power to impose economic regulations such as licensing,certificate,and permit requirements on common and contract carriers,but not on private carriers.see stat,drum,at.under the mca,a shipper is free to transport his own goods without utilizing a regulated instrumentality,but may not use for compensation or transportation purchased from a person not licensed by the icc amer.trucking ass n,interstate commerce comm n,cir.however,while private carriers were exempt from the economic and licensing regulations established by the mca,the icc retained the authority under that act to prescribe safety of operation requirements relating to maximum hours and qualifications of their employees.see stat,a southland gasoline bayley.noting that all carrier employees are subject to regulation to promote safety of operation under a levinson,at.keller,united states,cir under the motor carrier act,a private carrier is exempt from economic but not safety regulation.frederick porter,federal regulation of private carriers,private transportation of goods by motor vehicle is specifically recognized in the interstate commerce act and is exempted from all regulation by the icc,except for compliance with certain safety provisions of the act.
in order to evade licensing and economic regulations imposed on transportation,common and contract carriers engaged in deceptive schemes,designed to convert them into unlicensed private carriers.for example,carriers often entered arrangements,through which they ostensibly purchased the goods to be transported from the shipper and then sold them to
