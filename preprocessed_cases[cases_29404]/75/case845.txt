teresa zoltanski seeks review of a fine imposed by the administrator of the federal aviation administration faa.the administrator assessed the fine after holding that on october,zoltanski violated,which states,no person may enter a sterile area the area past the security checkpoint at an airport without submitting to the screening of his or her person and property in accordance with the procedures being applied to control access to that area on appeal to this court zoltanski contends that the administrator findings of fact were not supported by substantial evidence and that the administrator erroneously concluded that her conduct violated the regulation.she also raises several contentions relating to the fairness of the administrative proceedings.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm.
background 
in determining the relevant facts the administrator used as her starting point the findings in an initial decision by an administrative law judge alj.the following summarizes those findings,supplemented by some undisputed facts.zoltanski,an attorney,went to denver international airport late in the evening of october,to meet an arriving passenger,the speaker at a seminar she was hosting.she wished to meet her guest at the gate where passengers would be deplaning.at that time nonpassengers were permitted to meet passengers at a gate if they successfully passed through a security checkpoint.the faa called the area beyond a checkpoint a sterile area.once inside the sterile area,zoltanski could take an escalator to the trains that transported visitors to the various concourses and gates.
at the checkpoint zoltanski successfully passed through the metal detector,and her purse passed through the machine without incident.as she retrieved her purse from the end of the machine conveyor belt,stephanee rose,a security screener,asked zoltanski to submit her purse for etd screening,for which she had been randomly selected.rose was an employee of argenbright security,a private company operating under a contract with united airlines,as permitted by the regulatory scheme then in effect.
zoltanski asked how long it would take to test her purse for explosives and expressed concern that it might be damaged.rose explained the process to her and told her that she could refuse to submit her purse for screening,but did not tell her that she would not be able to proceed to the gate if she refused.
the checkpoint screening supervisor,harold avila,observed the interaction between zoltanski and rose.he walked over to them and attempted to explain the process to zoltanski and assure her that her purse would not be damaged.zoltanski insisted that she did not need to submit her purse for etd screening because it had successfully passed through the machine.avila told her that etd screening was faa policy,but did not inform her that refusal to submit would preclude her from proceeding to the gate.zoltanski refused the etd screening in rather rude tones and asked to speak to avila supervisor.
avila told zoltanski to wait,and left to get his supervisor.as he walked away,zoltanski proceeded to the escalators leading to the train platforms.patrick badu,avila supervisor,observed zoltanski on the escalator as he left his office.he loudly called out to her from the top of the escalator to stop and return to the security checkpoint,but she did not respond.the alj concluded that this was understandable because badu spoke accented english and could be difficult to understand.
badu approached zoltanski on the train platform.the alj made inconsistent findings regarding whether badu was identifiable as a security officer.first,the alj wrote,like avila,badu wore a maroon blazer with an airport id badge,vol.ii,doc.at.later in his decision,however,he wrote badu wore a maroon jacket identifiable security personnel wore blue.further,he was not wearing a badge or other marking readily associating him with security.id.at internal citation omitted.in any event,badu told zoltanski that she needed to have her purse screened,but did not specifically mention explosives testing or inform her that she would need to leave the sterile area unless she submitted her purse for further screening.the alj found that zoltanski could have reasonably believed that badu was not associated with security and thus permissibly ignored this admonition.when zoltanski insisted that she had been through screening,badu radioed avila to tell him to contact the police.he continued to follow zoltanski as she boarded the train,traveled to her guest concourse,and disembarked.zoltanski was eventually detained by the denver police,who released her after a search of her purse revealed nothing dangerous.
in response to increasing threats of terrorism,the faa promulgated in.fed.reg.the regulation states no person may enter a sterile area without submitting to the screening of his or her person and property in accordance with the procedures being applied to control access to that area.the regulation defines sterile area as an area to which access is controlled by the inspection of persons and property in accordance with an approved security program a.the background section explaining the regulation contained the following 
nonpassengers entering a sterile area generally understand that they too must be screened in order to ensure the security of the area.
there have been instances,however,in which nonpassengers have refused to be screened and intentionally entered a sterile area.even when these persons turn out to be unarmed and have no intention of hijacking or sabotaging an aircraft,their presence requires an appropriate security response.that need to respond disrupts the orderly conduct of passenger screening and requires the diversion of security personnel from other duties.should another incident constituting a genuine security threat occur at the same time,the ability to respond could be seriously compromised.
fed.reg.section has since been recodified at c in,see fed.reg,july,and then at in,following the creation of the department of homeland security and the transportation security administration.
penalties for violating the regulation are authorized by a,which in stated a person is liable to the united states government for a civil penalty of not more than for violating certain enumerated statutory provisions or a regulation prescribed or order issued under any such provision the faa administrator is authorized by d to impose these civil penalties.
proceedings below 
the faa filed a notice of proposed civil penalty proposing that zoltanski be fined for violating.zoltanski requested a hearing,and the faa filed a written complaint.zoltanski filed an answer denying the faa allegations and requesting that the complaint be dismissed as frivolous.the alj held a evidentiary hearing at which zoltanski,badu,avila,and rose,among other witnesses,testified.after the hearing the parties filed closing briefs,and zoltanski again moved to dismiss the complaint.
in his written decision the alj stated that the faa had not proved its case.the alj prefaced his findings by stating that despite the conflicting accounts provided by the witnesses,h aving observed their demeanor and listened to their testimony,i find that each believed in the truth of what he or she stated,vol.ii,doc,at.the alj found the preponderance of the reliable and probative evidence did not suggest that zoltanski made a deliberate effort to evade screening procedures.having successfully passed through the and magnetometer,she believed that she had been cleared to go to the arrival gate to meet her passenger.id.at.in support of this finding regarding zoltanski subjective belief,the alj said screening officials had explained to zoltanski no more than that an etd screening was optional.she never understood it to be mandatory,and understandably felt that she could proceed to the gates.id.at.despite finding that avila had told zoltanski to wait,the alj also found that she d eni ed that avila had told her to wait,and asserted that no one had told her that she could not continue to the trains.id.at.
the alj appeared to find that zoltanski subjective belief was objectively reasonable.according to the alj,
while the behavior of screening personnel,particularly badu in calling her back and following her,might have reasonably suggested that the screening process had not yet concluded,it was also reasonable for zoltanski to deduce that screening personnel were mistaken or confused because in her mind she had actually cleared.
id.at.the alj concluded that on the evidence before him he could not find that zoltanski knew or should have known that she had not submitted to the entire screening process in effect at the checkpoint after passing through the and magnetometer without incident.id.
the faa appealed the alj decision to the administrator,contending that the alj had erred in concluding that zoltanski conduct did not violate the regulation.zoltanski,but her appeal was dismissed after she failed to file a supporting brief.the faa argued that t he alj improperly found that zoltanski had no reason to know that she was required to undergo etd screening because u nderstood in its proper context,avila testimony provide d ample basis for a reasonable person to be on notice of the procedures involved in etd screening,vol.ii,doc,at.the faa objected to the alj failure to attach any apparent significance to his express finding that avila told zoltanski to wait while he consulted badu regarding zoltanski recalcitrance to undergo etd screening,at,characterizing it as one of several errors that were debilitating to the alj conclusion that zoltanski did not have reason to suspect that she was subject to mandatory etd screening before being allowed access to the sterile area,at.
the faa also contended that the alj had given improper weight to zoltanski testimony,because his conclusion that zoltanski neither knew nor had reason to know that she might be,or in fact was,required to undergo a second layer of screening in order to meet her passenger does not comport with the testimony of rose,and avila and badu.id.at.according to the faa,the record reveal ed that the weight of the evidence support ed the conclusion that zoltanski knew,or should have known,that she was required to submit her purse for etd screening id.in the faa view,once the alj had found the testimony of all witnesses credible,the weight of the credible evidence supported a finding that zoltanski had violated the regulation.
zoltanski countered that she did not violate,and that even if she did,her violation was unknowing and could not be punished.she argued that she lacked notice that etd screening was a required secondary procedure because none of the security personnel informed her that it was mandatory and that she would have to leave the sterile area if she refused to submit to it.according to zoltanski,the administrative law judge found,and the regulatory history of indicates that the agency did not intend the regulation to be a strict liability rule and thus,unknowing violations can not be prosecuted,vol ii,doc,at.she also contended that mandatory etd secondary testing was not being applied the night of october,id.at emphasis deleted,and that the alj correctly weighed the witnesses testimony and reached the correct ultimate conclusion.
the administrator reversed the alj decision.focusing on whether zoltanski alleged subjective belief was objectively reasonable,the administrator ruled 
the alj erred in holding that it was reasonable for zoltanski to conclude that the screening process was over and that she was free to proceed to the gates.in light of the alj factual findings,zoltanski should have known that security personnel were not satisfied that she had completed screening.
vol.ii,doc,at.noting that the alj had found that avila had informed zoltanski that the etd screening was faa policy,and had told her to wait when he went to get his supervisor,the administrator reasoned that although t he alj wrote in his decision that no one specifically communicated to zoltanski that she could not proceed to the gates,g iven that zoltanski had been told to wait,what is more important is that no one told her to proceed.id.at.the administrator also disagreed with the alj finding that zoltanski could reasonably have concluded,given the circumstances,that badu was not associated with security when he told her that she needed to have her purse screened.the administrator concluded that the preponderance of the evidence as recited by the alj himself indicates that the faa successfully bore its burden of establishing that zoltanski violated section,id.at,and fined zoltanski.
ii.discussion 
before applying the law to the specific facts of this case,we address the scienter required for a violation of and then our standard of review.
no scienter requirement appears in or the penalty provision,a.section states merely,no person may enter a sterile area without submitting to the screening of his or her person and property in accordance with the procedures being applied to control access to that area and a stated in a person is liable to the united states government for a civil penalty of not more than for violating the regulation.
thus,on the face of the regulation and penalty provision,it appears that an airport patron could be fined even if she had no idea that she was violating airport security procedures,or even if a reasonable person in her circumstances would not have known that she was doing so.nevertheless,we assume without deciding that a person is subject to a fine for improperly entering a sterile area only if she did not reasonably believe that she had complied with required security screening.in this case the faa contrary to zoltanski contention in her brief has consistently advanced in this litigation that interpretation of the regulation.and zoltanski,although arguing that she can not be fined if she bore no fault,concedes in her reply brief that she has never contended that she could escape liability if she had an unreasonable,subjective belief that she had completed screening.reply br.at.
zoltanski has not argued on appeal that she in fact complied with required security procedures.nor has the faa challenged the alj finding that zoltanski actually believed that she had complied with security requirements.this appeal therefore turns on whether the administrator could properly find that it was unreasonable for zoltanski to believe that she had completed security procedures when she entered a sterile area.
standard of review 
zoltanski contends that the administrator finding that she violated section because she failed to wait at the checkpoint is contrary to the evidence,and the record as a whole.aplt.br.at.in particular,she argues that the administrator failed to afford proper deference to the alj findings of fact and credibility determinations.
on appeal,however,we review the factual findings of the administrator,not those of the alj,and the administrator findings are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence.see c findings of fact by the secretary,under secretary,or administrator,if supported by substantial evidence,are conclusive.our review under this standard is quite narrow.cellular,city of broken arrow,oklahoma,cir.
substantial evidence is such evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the conclusion reached by the decisionmaker.substantial evidence requires more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency findings from being supported by substantial evidence.

although the alj findings are an important part of the record,they are not dispositive.the applicable statute states in an appeal from a decision of an administrative law judge as the result of a hearing the administrator shall consider only whether i each finding of fact is supported by a preponderance of reliable,probative,and substantial ev
