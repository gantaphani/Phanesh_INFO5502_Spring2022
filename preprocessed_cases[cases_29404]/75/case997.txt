air bags have saved thousands of lives since first appearing in passenger vehicles approximately three decades ago.their ability to save some occupants,however,has proven fatal to others,especially children and small women.responding to this problem and to a new congressional directive,the national highway traffic safety administration revised one of its auto safety standards to improve air bags benefits while reducing their potentially deadly risks.in this case,we consider a challenge to one aspect of that new standard the agency decision to set the speed for unbelted vehicle crash testing at rather than thirty miles per hour.because in doing so the agency acted consistently with congress directive and neither arbitrarily nor capriciously,we deny the petition for review.
in,the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa began requiring manufacturers to install air bags in new cars and light trucks.see federal motor vehicle safety standards occupant crash protection,fed.reg,codified at.under nhtsa federal motor vehicle safety standard,manufacturers had to certify that their equipped vehicles would protect occupants in the event of a crash.specifically,auto makers had to show that their vehicles satisfied certain injury criteria limits in simulated rigid barrier crashes at speeds up to and including thirty miles per hour,using both belted and unbelted adult male dummies.see id.at federal motor vehicle safety standards occupant crash protection,fed.reg,may.in plain english,standard required auto makers to show that a test dummy representing an with and without a seat avoid serious injury as defined by the standard when his car slams into a fixed barrier at thirty miles per hour.
air bags installed in response to this mandate saved thousands of lives.because air bags are designed to inflate almost instantly upon impact,however,the force of the inflation can injure,even kill,smaller occupants sitting too close to the deploying bag.see federal motor vehicle safety standards occupant crash protection,fed.reg.as of february,nhtsa had documented crashes in which the force of a deploying air bag had killed a child.id.at.drivers and two adult passengers had also died from induced injuries.id.at.
reacting to these fatalities and to a growing public outcry,nhtsa amended standard in march to encourage manufacturers to redesign air bags quickly to make them inflate with less force.id.at.under the revised rule,manufacturers no longer had to test vehicles using the thirty mile per hour unbelted crash test.instead,they could use a thirty mile per hour sled test a test roughly equivalent to a mile per hour crash measure vehicle ability to protect male dummies.see id.at fed.reg.at.in a sled test,a vehicle placed on a sled is accelerated rapidly backward,but never actually crashed into a barrier.fed.reg.at.as the car moves backward,the test dummies lurch forward,simulating an actual crash the cars air bags are manually deployed at a time.id.by permitting auto makers to certify their vehicles systems through this less stringent safety test,nhtsa made it easier for them to maintain compliance with standard while depowering,reducing the force bag inflation.
although recognizing that depowered air bags could reduce protection for unbelted adults and teenagers,nhtsa concluded that the opportunity to avoid the deaths of a significant number of children who would otherwise be fatally injured by air bags justified its depowering rule.fed.reg.at.the agency maintained that it is not acceptable that a safety device cause a significant number of fatalities in circumstances in which fatal or serious injuries would not otherwise occur.id.indeed,nhtsa found it particularly unacceptable that the vehicle occupants being fatally injured are young children and that the number of those deaths is steadily growing.id.nevertheless,because of the possible safety associated with bag depowering and because expected technological advances could reduce risks to children and small women without diminishing protection for unbelted adults and teens,nhtsa rule provided that the sled test option would terminate in september.see id.at.the agency explained 
t here is no need to permanently reduce standard performance requirements to enable manufacturers to fully address the adverse effects of air bags.this is because there are various alternatives,albeit with longer technological development and implementation leadtimes than depowering,that are already allowed by the standard and that appear likely to result in equal or greater benefits than depowering without creating adverse safety tradeoffs.thus,the agency views depowering as an interim approach,while the vehicle manufacturers develop and implement better solutions.
id.at.responding to the increased flexibility provided by the sled test option,manufacturers began installing what are known as redesigned air bags air bags designed to pass the sled test.see fed.reg.at.although many redesigned air bags deployed with less force than their predecessors,they still inflated with more power than needed to comply with the sled test.id.at.
in june,congress stepped in and directed nhtsa to require manufacturers to install a new generation of air bags known as advanced air bags.in language central to the issue before us,the transportation equity act for the century tea provides 
t he secretary of transportation shall issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to improve occupant protection for occupants of different sizes,belted and unbelted,under federal motor vehicle safety standard,while minimizing the risk to infants,children,and other occupants from injuries and deaths caused by air bags,by means that include advanced air bags.
pub,a,stat,codified at note.advanced air bags incorporate new technologies or designs that either prevent air bags from deploying in inappropriate circumstances or ensure that they inflate in ways.see fed.reg.at.for example,advanced air bags could include a device that senses the weight of the occupant and then prevents the air bag from activating if the occupant is a child.see id.defining occupant weight sensors.
also significant to the challenge before us,tea superseded nhtsa decision to sunset the sled test by september,providing instead that the requirements of of standard prescribing the thirty mile per hour unbelted vehicle sled test shall remain in effect unless and until changed by the rule required by this subsection.tea a.
responding to tea,nhtsa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm in september,proposing a battery of new,complex performance tests.see federal motor vehicle safety standards occupant crash protection,fed.reg.to satisfy tea mandate to improve occupant protection,nhtsa proposed phasing out the prevailing sled test and reinstating the thirty mile per hour rigid barrier crash test for the male dummy.see id.at.nhtsa also proposed among other things requiring manufacturers to satisfy the unbelted and belted rigid barrier crash test with a female dummy representing a small woman.id.at.with respect to tea requirement that the rule minimize risk to infants and children,nhtsa proposed various crash test alternatives.see id.at.for example,to protect infants in child seats,the nprm included two alternative series of tests from which manufacturers could choose tests proving that air bags could deactivate themselves or tests demonstrating that air bags would deploy in a way.id.at.although vehicle manufacturers initially responded to the proposed rule by supporting retention of the sled test,they later expressed their consensus view that the revised standard should include an unbelted crash test with a maximum speed of miles per hour,not thirty.see federal motor vehicle safety standards occupant crash protection,fed.reg.
in november,nhtsa issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking snprm,explaining that t he public comments and the agency research and analysis since our nprm have enabled us to refine and in some cases simplify the proposed amendments that we are considering.id.at.of particular significance,nhtsa proposed two alternative unbelted crash tests instead of the single thirty mile per hour rigid barrier test included in its initial nprm.only one of these alternatives is relevant here an unbelted rigid barrier test with a maximum speed to be established in the final rule within the range of to thirty miles per hour.id.at.as to this alternative,the agency explained that the potential exists for a sequence in which the maximum speed would initially be set at mph to provide vehicle manufacturers additional flexibility when they are introducing advanced air bags,and then increased to thirty miles per hour after a reasonable period of time.id.at.following issuance of the snprm,several transportation safety organizations,including the national transportation safety board,the insurance institute for highway safety,the national safety council,the american trauma society,and the national association of governors highway safety representatives expressed to nhtsa their strong opposition to returning to the thirty mile per hour standard.see letter from james hall,chairman,national transportation safety board,et,to the honorable rodney slater,secretary,united states department of transportation.that standard,they explained,would result in some vehicles airbag inflator power returning to levels that have caused occupant deaths and injuries without increasing the benefits to unbelted occupants in crashes at higher speeds.id.at.
nhtsa then submitted a draft final regulation to the office of management and budget for review.see memorandum from stephen wood,assistant chief counsel for rulemaking,national highway traffic safety administration,to docket no.nhtsa notice at may,hereinafter wood memorandum see also exec.order a b i,fed.reg,requiring agencies to submit certain draft regulations to omb office of information and regulatory affairs.the draft proposed an unbelted rigid barrier test to be implemented in two stages.during the first stage,from september through august,manufacturers would have to test vehicles using a maximum test speed of miles per hour,while in the second stage,from september through august,the maximum test speed would increase to thirty miles per hour.see wood memorandum at.
two months later,nhtsa published an interim final rule,establishing an unbelted rigid barrier crash test with a maximum test speed of miles per hour for the period extending from september through august.see fed.reg.at.nhtsa explained 
the provisions of this rule,particularly the maximum test speed for the unbelted rigid barrier test,reflect the uncertainty associated with simultaneously achieving the twin goals of tea.this uncertainty leads us to take an approach that best assures improved air bag protection for occupants of all sizes,without compromising efforts to reduce the risks of injury to vulnerable occupants,including children and short women seated very close to air bags and occupants.such an approach is one that involves the least uncertainty for the occupants who have been most at risk.as long as the manufacturers improve the already substantial overall level of real world protection provided by current redesigned air bags,the uncertainty associated with the challenge of simultaneously achieving the twin goals of tea is best resolved at this point in favor of minimizing risk.this is especially true in the early stages of the introduction of advanced air bag technologies.
fed.reg.at.
nhtsa final rule also added a wide range of new safety performance tests.among other things,the revised standard requires auto makers to use an entire family of test just the adult male dummy,but also new dummies representing adult females,children,children,and infants.id.at.in addition,the rule includes new and more stringent injury criteria.id.at.
eight petitions for reconsideration were filed,including one by public citizen and several other consumer groups requesting that the agency amend the unbelted rigid barrier test to require a thirty mile per hour maximum test speed for passenger cars while retaining a mile per hour top speed for light trucks,vans,and sport utility vehicles.nhtsa denied the reconsideration petition,reiterating the rationales offered in the final rule.federal motor vehicle safety standards occupant crash protection,fed.reg.
public citizen and others filed petitions for review in the ninth circuit.after addressing various jurisdictional issues,the ninth circuit transferred the petition filed by public citizen and the center for auto safety to this court.pub.citizen mineta,cir.throughout this opinion,we shall refer to petitioners public citizen and the center for auto safety collectively as public citizen.in its petition,public citizen challenges only one element of the revised standard nhtsa decision to set the maximum unbelted crash test speed at rather than thirty miles per hour.public citizen argues that the mile per hour test speed violates tea requirement that standard improve occupant protection for occupants of different sizes,belted and unbelted,and amounts to arbitrary and capricious agency action.we consider each claim in turn.
because public citizen challenges nhtsa interpretation of a statute the agency is charged with implementing,we apply the test of chevron natural resources defense council,d.we thus begin by asking whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,for if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter t he court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.at.if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we then determine whether nhtsa interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.at.
public citizen does not claim that its statutory challenge can be resolved at chevron step one,and for good reason.tea plain nhtsa to improve occupant protection for occupants of different sizes,belted and unbelted,under federal motor vehicle safety standard,while minimizing the risk to infants,children,and other occupants from injuries and deaths caused by air bags,by means that include advanced air bags unambiguously requires only three things standard must improve occupant protection,minimiz e the risk to infants,children,and other occupants from induced injuries,and accomplish these two goals at least partly through the use of advanced air bags.nowhere does tea say anything about the particular requirements nhtsa must adopt,much less the speed the agency must use in its unbelted rigid barrier crash test.
to resolve public citizen claim that nhtsa mile per hour unbelted test speed violates tea requirement to improve occupant protection for occupants of different sizes,belted and unbelted a chevron step two must first answer an antecedent question improve protection compared to what specifically,does tea require improvement measured from the sled test,as nhtsa contends,or from the amount of protection provided by redesigned air bags in use at the time of nhtsa rulemaking,as public citizen argues if we can reasonably read tea to permit nhtsa to use the sled test as the baseline of comparison,then this becomes an easy case,for as public citizen concedes,the mile per hour crash test improves protection over the sled test.in particular,the mile per hour standard tests vehicles at a faster speed than the thirty mile per hour sled test,which has an effective crash test speed of miles per hour.in addition,unlike the sled test,the mile per hour rigid barrier test measures vehicle performance in actual collisions.see fed.reg.at stating that because the sled test does not actually crash the vehicle,it can not measure the performance provided by the vehicle structure in combination with the air bags or even the full air bag system by itself.given these more rigorous testing features,nhtsa estimates that air bags designed to pass the mile per hour crash test would save at least to more lives than air bags designed to pass the generic sled test.id.at.
according to public citizen,however,the sled test can not serve as the standard from which to measure the improvement tea requires because nhtsa,in its rulemaking,made the sled test temporary and because congress,in tea,preserved the sled
