honeywell international,and honeywell intellectual properties,collectively honeywell appeal from the final decision of the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan granting summary judgment of noninfringement of patent in favor of itt industries,itt automotive,tg north america corporation,tg fluid systems usa corporation,and raymond,collectively.honeywell int l,itt,civ.april.because the district court correctly construed the claim limitation fuel system component and determined that the accused products do not meet that limitation,we affirm its grant of summary judgment of noninfringement.we further conclude that under our modified construction of the claim limitation electrically conductive fibers,the accused products do not meet that limitation either,thereby providing a separate ground for affirming the district court grant of summary judgment of noninfringement.
background 
the patent,entitled electrostatically dissipative fuel system component,discloses a fuel filter that is specially made for use in motor vehicles that have electronic fuel injection efi systems.before motor vehicles began using efi systems,the housing of a fuel filter was commonly made of metal or a polymer material.patent,filed july.once vehicles began using efi systems,as the patent written description recognizes,fuel filters with polymer housing began to break down and start leaking.it was discovered that the breakdowns were caused by the contact between the fuel,which flows at a high velocity in efi systems,and the fuel filter polymer housing.the resultant friction strips electrons from the hydrocarbon fuel and traps them in the polymer housing,which leads to an electrostatic charge buildup within the housing of the fuel filter.the charge continues to build up until it finally discharges by arcing onto the vehicle metal frame and becomes grounded.arcing forms microscopic holes in the fuel filter housing,to.when enough microscopic holes are formed,the fuel begins to leak.fuel filters with metal housing avoid the arcing phenomenon because they allow no charge buildup.the conductive nature of metal prevents the electrons from being trapped inside the fuel filter and allows them to pass through to the vehicle frame.fuel filters with housing made of polymer material,however,are more desirable than their metal housing counterparts because of their lower cost and weight.
the patented invention addresses the arcing problem in fuel filters with polymer housing by providing an electrically conductive pathway between the fuel filter and the vehicle metal frame.the electrically conductive pathway prevents the electrostatic charge from building up within the housing of the fuel filter.according to the written description,the electrically conductive pathway is created by incorporating small amounts of a conductive filler material into the polymer housing.the written description further discloses that stainless steel is an ideal conductive filler material because it has high conductivity,allowing it to be used in fibers with a high aspect ratio,to.the written description also notes that stainless steel fibers are ductile,which allows them to better maintain their integrity during.id.the benefits of stainless steel fibers are contrasted in the written description to electrically conductive carbon fibers,which are said to have less desirable characteristics,they must be used in fibers with smaller aspect ratios,are more rigid,and act as stress concentrators.
turning to the prosecution history of the patent in suit,the patent issued from a divisional application of patent application,which issued as patent and was entitled electrostatically dissipative fuel filter.also issuing from a divisional application of the application was patent,also entitled electrostatically dissipative fuel filter.the drawing and written description sections for the,and patents appear to be identical.see honeywell int l,itt,d.the patent examiner for the application issued a restriction requirement in that application because it claimed three distinct inventions a method for preventing breakdown of a fuel filter,the fuel filter itself,and a moldable polymeric material.id.faced with this restriction requirement,the patentee chose the first invention for immediate prosecution,a method for preventing breakdown of a fuel filter,and that became the claimed subject matter of what issued as the patent.the patentee filed divisional applications for the remaining inventions resulting in two other patents,the patent for a fuel filter and the patent for a moldable polymeric material,the patent at issue in this case.
the application,as initially filed,was entitled electrostatically dissipative fuel filter and contained one independent claim directed to a moldable material for fuel system components.the patent examiner rejected the claim on the ground of,inter alia,indefiniteness under.according to the examiner,it was not clear what fuel system components were intended to be constructed of the electrically conductive moldable material.in addressing the indefiniteness rejection,the patentee deleted the moldable material for language so that the claims were directed to a fuel system component.the patentee also argued that the independent claim was not indefinite because,although the specification only referred to fuel filters and fuel lines,it is applicant position that he is entitled to a claim broad enough to cover all fuel system components manufactured of the moldable material disclosed and claimed in the specification.while the application was pending,the title of the application was changed to electrostatically dissipative fuel system component,because,the patentee contended,it more accurately reflect ed the scope of the claims.after an interview between the patentee and examiner,which resulted in the arcing limitation being added,the claims were allowed and the patent issued.following a reexamination proceeding,the sole independent claim was further amended to recite fuel injection system component instead of fuel system component as the subject matter of the claims.
on october,honeywell filed suit against for infringement of the patent.claim of the patent,the patent only independent claim,provides as follows 
fuel injection system component for communicating fuel to the engine of a motor vehicle,said motor vehicle having an electrical plane maintained at a predetermined electrical potential,said fuel system component being made of a composite material comprising a polymer having electrically conductive fibers distributed randomly throughout the material to provide an electrically conductive path through said component between the fuel communicated through said component and said electrical plane,so that at least a portion of the electrically conductive path extends through the component to thereby prevent of electrostatic charge in the fuel and the resultant arcing which causes the breakdown of the polymer material comprising the fuel injection system component.
the products accused of infringement are quick connects manufactured and sold by.quick connects are structures that join the various components of a fuel injection system together,such as a fuel line to a fuel filter.the accused quick connects have polymer housing that is interlaced with carbon fiber.denied the charge of infringement,and the district court subsequently held a markman hearing to construe various limitations of the patent,including fuel injection system component and electrically conductive fiber.
the district court construed the fuel injection system component limitation to mean a fuel filter.in arriving at its construction,the court recognized that the ordinary meaning of the term refers to any constituent part of the fuel injection system of a motor vehicle including,for example,fuel filters,fuel lines,and connectors.honeywell,d at.the court also recognized that the patentee made statements during the prosecution of the and applications that could be interpreted to mean that the scope of the fuel injection system component limitation was broader than only fuel filters,at least in the patentee view.
notwithstanding the ordinary meaning or the prosecution history,the court determined that the written description clearly limited the fuel injection system component to a fuel filter,and that the statements in the prosecution history could not be used to enlarge the content of the written description.id.at.according to the court,on several occasions in the written description,the invention was identified to be only a fuel filter.id.at.moreover,the court explained,t he entire specification of the patent,as well as the sole drawing,describe the elements and operation of a fuel filter with electrically conductive fibers.no other parts are described.id.given the written description,the court concluded that the patentee characterized a fuel filter as the only embodiment of his invention,not merely a preferred version of all possible embodiments.id.at.
the district court also construed the claim term electrically conductive fibers to mean fibers of a material that conducts electricity,including,without limitation,metal and carbon.id.at.according to the court,that was the ordinary meaning of electrically conductive fibers.the court gave the term its ordinary meaning despite a detailed disclosure in the written description why metal fibers were preferable to carbon fibers.id.at.in the court view,the disclosure was not like the clear specification language defining the invention as a fuel filter.id.the court determined that the disclosure distinguishing metal and conductive fibers merely reflected the patentee preferred embodiment.id.at.the court further noted that the written description never stated that carbon fibers could not be used as electrically conductive fibers.id.
after the court issued its claim construction,filed a motion for summary judgment of noninfringement,which the court granted.in concluding that the accused products did not infringe the patent,the court determined that quick connects are not fuel filters,and thus they do not literally infringe.honeywell int l,itt,civ,slip op.at.may.moreover,the court found that quick connects do not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because they are not interchangeable with a fuel filter,and they do not compete commercially with fuel filters.id.the also court determined that honeywell could not invoke the doctrine of equivalents to encompass the accused quick connects in view of the written description identification of a fuel filter as the present invention.according to the court,the patentee knew of fuel system components other than fuel filters,and that because he limited the claims to a fuel filter,all other fuel system components were dedicated to the public,and thus outside the reach of the doctrine of equivalents,slip op.at.
the district court entered final judgment on april.honeywell timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

on appeal,honeywell argues that the district court erred by limiting the fuel injection system component limitation to a fuel filter and including no other component of a fuel injection system.in doing so,honeywell contends that the court imported a limitation from the specification into the claims and thereby improperly limited the scope of the claims to the specification preferred embodiment.according to honeywell,nothing in the specification explicitly limits the claim term to a fuel filter.honeywell relies on a statement contained in the specification referring to the metallic components used in prior art systems,patent,to argue that the term component was meant to be broad.it also cites the patent abstract,which summarized the invention using the term component,and the title of the patent as amended,to further argue that the specification did not limit the fuel injection system component to a fuel filter.
in addition,honeywell points to the prosecution history in assigning error to the district court construction of the fuel injection system component limitation.according to honeywell,the patentee stated during prosecution that the intended scope of the claims was to include all fuel components manufactured of the moldable material disclosed and claimed in the specification.honeywell also notes that the patent examiner issued a restriction requirement during prosecution of the application which also included claims to fuel filters because the fuel system component claims do not specifically require that the component be a fuel filter.
mainly reiterating the points made by the district court in its claim construction decision,responds that the claim term fuel injection system component was correctly limited to a fuel filter.also argues,however,that the court erred in its construction of the electrically conductive fibers limitation.contends that the court should have construed that term to include only metal fibers with a high aspect ratio,not carbon fibers.according to,the written description compared the properties of metal and carbon fibers,and disparaged the use of the latter as an electrically conductive fiber.contends that there was a clear disavowal of carbon fibers from the scope of the claims.moreover,because the accused quick connects are indisputably made with carbon fibers,asserts that there can be no infringement either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.
we agree with the district court that the claim term fuel injection system component is limited to a fuel filter.in phillips awh,en banc,this court recognized that claims must be read in view of the specification,of which they are a part.we further stated that the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis.usually,it is dispositive it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.id.internal citations omitted.here,the written description uses language that leads us to the conclusion that a fuel filter is the only fuel injection system component that the claims cover,and that a fuel filter was not merely discussed as a preferred embodiment.on at least four occasions,the written description refers to the fuel filter as this invention or the present invention 
this invention relates to a fuel filter for use in the fuel line that delivers fuel to a motor vehicle engine.patent.
according to the present invention,a fuel filter for a motor vehicle is made from a moldable material which may be safely used in vehicles equipped with electronic fuel injection system.
this and other advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following descriptions,with reference to the accompanying drawing,the sole figure of which is a view of a fuel filter made pursuant to the teachings of the present invention.
according to the present invention,an electrically conductive path is provided between the fuel within the inlet cavity of the fuel filter and the vehicle body.
the public is entitled to take the patentee at his word and the word was that the invention is a fuel filter.
moreover,the written description does not indicate that a fuel filter is merely a preferred embodiment of the claimed invention.the fuel filter was the only component of an efi system that the written description disclosed as having a polymer housing with electrically conductive fibers interlaced therein.the only other fuel component specifically mentioned in the written description,the fuel line,was not required by the patentee to be made of an electrically conductive polymer material,as the claims require.see,stating that the fuel line may also be made of a material.the written description detailed discussion of the prior art problem addressed by the patented invention,leakage of fuel filters in efi s
