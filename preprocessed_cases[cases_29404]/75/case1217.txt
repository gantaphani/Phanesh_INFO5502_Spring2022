summary judgment 
a motion for summary judgment should be granted if the submitted papers show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact,and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c section.a defendant meets his burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if he shows that an element of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense,subd.p.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact exists.ibid.
in cases where the plaintiff would have the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence,the defendant moving for summary judgment must present evidence that would preclude a reasonable trier of fact from finding that it was more likely than not that the material fact was true,or the defendant must establish that an element of the claim can not be established,by presenting evidence that the plaintiff does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,needed evidence.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.

the complaint 
on november,plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that,at on march,he was injured by a passing union pacific train while he walked on a pedestrian walkway adjacent to train tracks on a railroad bridge that crosses over arcade creek parallel to roseville road.the air blast and suction from the passing train knocked plaintiff down and caused injuries.plaintiff alleged defendant was aware that air blasts and suction from trains posed a danger to pedestrians on the pedestrian walkways,which was not readily apparent to persons unfamiliar with being in close proximity to moving trains.defendant owed a duty to remove the danger or post warnings,and defendant breached the duty by failing to remove the danger,failing to post warnings,and negligently operating a train.
the summary judgment motion 
defendant moved for summary judgment.the notice of motion stated as grounds that defendant acted with reasonable care,and was not a legal cause of plaintiff injuries.the memorandum of points and authorities argued defendant had no duty to warn plaintiff of open and obvious dangers on its property defendant acted with reasonable care to prevent injury to trespassers,and there was no evidence defendant alleged failure to warn of danger was a cause in fact of plaintiff injuries 
the separate statement of undisputed facts asserted 
on the evening of march,plaintiff was walking along roseville road.because the sidewalk narrowed as the road crossed arcade creek,plaintiff was concerned for his safety and decided to use the nearby union pacific railroad bridge to cross the creek.he had an unobstructed view of the train tracks,which ran in a straight line.the metal grid area on the side of the bridge is three feet,inches wide.copies of photographs are attached to this opinion as an appendix.plaintiff walked on the walkway portion of the metal grid area,which is one foot,nine inches wide.plaintiff understood he did not have union pacific permission to use the bridge and it would be hazardous to be on the bridge while a train was crossing it.while plaintiff was on the bridge,a union pacific freight train approached from the opposite direction at a speed of approximately miles per hour which was less than the speed limit.the conductor first saw plaintiff when he was about feet away.the engineer sounded the horn.plaintiff saw the train lights and heard the horn,but he did not take evasive action.as the train passed,it either struck plaintiff or threw him to the ground.plaintiff admitted there was nothing union pacific train crew could have done to avoid the accident.union pacific has a zero tolerance policy towards trespassing on railroad property,responds to reports of trespassing with warnings or arrests when possible,and sponsors community awareness programs about the risks of trespassing on railroad property.standard fences are not an effective deterrent against trespassing.a fence would cost about million per mile and could endanger people in the event of a derailment.
defendant submitted deposition excerpts supporting the foregoing assertions.of specific interest,plaintiff deposition testimony showed 
certainly you knew that it was a hazard to be on the railroad bridge if there was a train,correct 
q.did you view walking on the railroad bridge as a safe pathway 
q.did you view walking on the railroad bridge a safe pathway if there was a train that would be occupying that bridge at the same time you would be on it 
i was sure if that would be safe or not.i used to riding the light rail,and trains pass within that far of me all the time on light rail.so i assumed it would be safe,yes.
plaintiff also testified he did not see the train until it was to feet away.he could not explain why he did not notice the train earlier other than to speculate the track might dip before it reaches the bridge.he said it seemed like one second that the train sounded its horn.when he saw the train t here was nothing i could do.the train was moving at a high rate of speed,so there was time.he did not remember whether he moved to the edge of the bridge.he did not remember if he fell down.he also said he continued to walk upon seeing the train.when asked why he did not hug the railing,he said,there was time.when asked,there was time to continue walking,was there he said he did not remember.when asked if he knew what caused him to fall,he said,no,either the wind blast of the train or being struck by the train.he admitted he was guessing.he did not remember whether he was standing when the train passed him.when plaintiff heard the train whistle,he waved,because when he used to live near railroad tracks the train conductors would beep the whistle and he would wave.when asked whether,in his opinion,there was anything this train crew could have done to avoid the accident,plaintiff said,no,i do think there was.
train conductor patrick marino testified in deposition that the walkway consisted of steel plate grating bolted to the bridge structure and was common on railroad bridges.such walkways are not for pedestrians,but for railroad personnel in case the train breaks down.marino never observed any warning signs or barricades that would prevent pedestrian use.he had observed using similar walkways on other bridges,but not the arcade creek bridge.he first saw plaintiff about or feet from the east end of the bridge and about feet from the train.plaintiff did not react to the horn but just kept walking.when asked if there was anywhere plaintiff could have moved back away from the train to avoid being struck,marino said,no,but then said,he could have laid down,and that was the only thing he could have done to avoid being hit.
union pacific agent blair geddes testified there are no signs on the bridge,he has responded numerous times to reports of trespassers,and there was another incident in which two males were hit by a train on the same bridge as they ran from a confrontation with other men in the creek area.defendant director of police operations,george slaats,estimated in a declaration that more than percent of the trespassers are old enough to be aware of the risks of walking on
