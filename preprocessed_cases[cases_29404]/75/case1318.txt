on december,we granted subaru motion for rehearing.we withdraw our opinion and judgment dated may,and substitute the following in its place.
this case involves the interrelation between a trial court original jurisdiction and the texas motor vehicle board original jurisdiction under the texas motor vehicle commission code the court of appeals held that the legislature granting exclusive jurisdiction to the board abrogates a party claims,and therefore,the code unconstitutionally denies a citizen access to the courts.we agree that the code confers exclusive jurisdiction on the board to initially resolve the claims and issues the code governs.but we do not agree that the code abrogates any claims here.accordingly,we affirm the court of appeals judgment in part,reverse the court of appeals judgment in part,and remand the claims to the trial court for further proceedings.
background 
david mcdavid nissan owned two houston car dealerships along the gulf freeway.its oldsmobile dealership was located inside loop at gulf freeway eight miles farther south stood its subaru dealership,outside loop at gulf freeway.in,mcdavid discussed its desire to switch the two dealerships locations with subaru regional,john gage.although mcdavid alleges that gage orally consented to the relocation,mcdavid did not submit a written request to relocate.instead,relying on gage alleged oral assurances,mcdavid renovated the location,moved the oldsmobile dealership there,and prepared to move the subaru dealership inside the loop.
on november,gage sent mcdavid a letter stating that subaru had just learned that mcdavid planned to relocate its subaru dealership and that subaru would not consent to the move.the letter stated that subaru would not allow any subaru franchise to move inside loop.concerned about its deteriorating relationship with subaru,mcdavid closed its houston subaru dealership as well as its plano and irving subaru dealerships.following the code procedure for benefits,subaru repurchased certain assets from the dealership and paid mcdavid accordingly.the next year,subaru allowed another dealership to relocate inside the the lot adjoining mcdavid proposed site.mcdavid then sued subaru for refusing to allow mcdavid to relocate.mcdavid alleged subaru violated the code provision making unlawful a manufacturer unreasonably denying a application.stat,b.mcdavid also claimed subaru violated the texas deceptive trade practices act and breached its written dealership agreement,its oral agreement,and its duty of good faith and fair dealing.
between january and march,subaru filed three motions,seeking to dismiss all mcdavid claims.subaru asserted mcdavid did not raise its claims before the board and,consequently,could not bring these claims in court.subaru further claimed mcdavid had elected its remedy by terminating the dealership and accepting benefits.subaru also raised various other grounds for dismissing mcdavid contract,dtpa,and claims.
before the trial court ruled on these motions,mcdavid filed a supplemental petition asserting that subaru was equitably estopped from denying its oral agreement with mcdavid.mcdavid also responded to subaru motion.without stating the grounds,the trial court granted a partial summary judgment,specifically excepting only mcdavid claim.subaru filed another motion,claiming that the accord and satisfaction doctrine barred all mcdavid claims and again alleging that mcdavid did not exhaust its administrative remedies.subaru further asserted that promissory estoppel is not a cause of action.in response,mcdavid argued that an exhaustion of remedies requirement would violate its constitutional right to a jury trial and open courts.the trial court granted subaru motion.
the court of appeals reversed the trial court judgment in part.the court affirmed the trial court order dismissing mcdavid dtpa claim and its code claim for breach of written agreement,because these claims fall within the board primary jurisdiction.at.but the court of appeals remanded mcdavid breach of oral contract claims.the court of appeals explained that remanding the oral contract claims was necessary because section b,which states that all aspects of the distribution and sale of motor vehicles shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of this act,abrogated mcdavid claims and,consequently,violated the texas constitution open courts provision.at.the court also concluded that,though mcdavid claim is statutorily created,the code did not require mcdavid to first present this claim to the board.at.
subaru petitioned this court for review.we granted subaru petition to determine the board jurisdiction over mcdavid claims.at the time the trial court and court of appeals considered this issue,section of the code provided 
a the board has the general and original power and jurisdiction to regulate all aspects of the distribution,sale,and leasing of motor vehicles and to do all things,whether specifically designated in this act or implied herein,or necessary or convenient to the exercise of this power and jurisdiction,including the original jurisdiction to determine questions of its own jurisdiction.in addition to the other duties placed on the board by this act,the board shall enforce and administer the terms of chapter,transportation code.
b unless otherwise specifically provided by texas law not in conflict with the terms of this act,all aspects of the distribution and sale of motor vehicles shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of this act.
stat,vernon supp,amended by act of may,ch.laws.
in our original opinion,we concluded that section a conferred on the board to resolve certain code issues raised in mcdavid claims.further,we concluded that section b does not grant the board exclusive jurisdiction because,by its plain language,that subsection only establishes that the code governs this area of law and trumps other laws if they conflict with the code.
however,less than two weeks before we issued our opinion,the legislature amended section a to provide 
a the board has the exclusive,original jurisdiction to regulate those aspects of the distribution,sale,and leasing of motor vehicles as governed by this act and to do all things,whether specifically designated in this act or implied herein,or necessary or convenient to the exercise of this power and jurisdiction,including the original jurisdiction to determine questions of its own jurisdiction.
stat,a emphasis added.the legislature made this amended provision effective immediately after receiving the necessary votes,which occurred on may.see act of may,ch.laws.the legislature did not change section b.we were not informed about the amendment until subaru filed its motion for rehearing.
we granted subaru motion for rehearing to determine whether section current or former version applies,and whether the applicable provision grants the board primary or exclusive jurisdiction.
ii.applicable law 
retroactive application of statutory amendments 
the texas constitution states that n o bill of attainder,ex post facto law,retroactive law,or any law impairing the obligation of contracts,shall be made.const.art.i.a retroactive law literally means a law that acts on things which are past.decordova city of galveston.however,not all statutes that apply retroactively are constitutionally prohibited.a retroactive statute only violates our constitution if,when applied,it takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing law.ex parte abell,mccain yost.a vested right is a property right,which the constitution protects like any other property.middleton texas power light.however,
t hat no one has a vested right in the continuance of present laws in relation to a particular subject,is a fundamental proposition it is not open to challenge.the laws may be changed by the legislature so long as they do not destroy or prevent an adequate enforcement of vested rights.there can not be a vested right,or a property right,in a mere rule of law.
middleton,at.
courts generally presume that the legislature intends a statute or amendment to operate prospectively and not retroactively.abell,at blonstein blonstein,dist,writ denied.however,this general rule does not apply when the statute or amendment is procedural or remedial.city of tyler likes,abell,at phil pierce watkins,blonstein,at.this is because procedural and remedial statutes typically do not affect a vested right.likes,at abell,at exxon brecheen,watkins,at blonstein,at see also baker hughes,keco r d,the rule is well settled that procedural statutes may apply to suits pending at the time they became effective,but even a procedural statute can not be given application to a suit pending at the time it becomes effective if to do so would destroy or impair rights which had become vested before the act became effective.citations omitted.
similarly,the united states supreme court has held that a new statute conferring or ousting jurisdiction applies to existing suits because such laws typically do not affect substantive rights.landgraf usi film.instead,jurisdictional statutes speak to the court power rather than to the parties rights or obligations.landgraf,at.and a jurisdictional statute usually does not take away substantive rights but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case.landgraf,at.quoting hallowell commons.see also southwestern bell.city of kountze,no writ applying statute granting agency exclusive jurisdiction over claim pending on interlocutory appeal,and then requiring trial court to dismiss suit because the statute did not destroy the rights of plaintiff it simply took away from the trial court the jurisdiction to adjudicate the question and confer red the exclusive jurisdiction upon another tribunal,namely,the regulatory commission.
jurisdiction trial court and administrative agency 
our trial courts are courts of general jurisdiction.dubai petroleum kazi.the texas constitution provides that a trial court jurisdiction consists of exclusive,appellate,and original jurisdiction of all actions,proceedings,and remedies,except in cases where exclusive,appellate,or original jurisdiction may be conferred by this constitution or other law on some other court,tribunal,or administrative body.const.art.v.by statute,trial courts have the jurisdiction provided by article v,section,of the texas constitution,and may hear and determine any cause that is cognizable by courts of law or equity and may grant any relief that could be granted by either courts of law or equity.gov t code.courts of general jurisdiction presumably have subject matter jurisdiction unless a contrary showing is made.dubai petroleum,at.
on the other hand,there is no presumption that administrative agencies are authorized to resolve disputes.rather,they may exercise only those powers the law,in clear and express statutory language,confers upon them.key western life ins.state bd.of,railroad comm rowan oil.courts will not imply additional authority to agencies,nor may agencies create for themselves any excess powers.see key western life,at rowan oil,at.
primary versus exclusive jurisdiction 
texas courts have often confused the primary jurisdiction and exclusive jurisdiction doctrines,which are distinctly different doctrines that have different consequences when applied.see,lopez public util.comm n,writ denied.despite similar terminology,primary jurisdiction is prudential whereas exclusive jurisdiction is jurisdictional.see shell pipeline coastal states trading,dist,writ denied.
the primary jurisdiction doctrine operates to allocate power between courts and agencies when both have authority to make initial determinations in a dispute.foree crown cent.petroleum,see also travis,comment,primary jurisdiction a general theory and its application to the securities exchange act,cal.trial courts should allow an administrative agency to initially decide an issue when an agency is typically staffed with experts trained in handling the complex problems in the agency purview and great benefit is derived from an agency uniformly interpreting its laws,rules,and regulations,whereas courts and juries may reach different results under similar fact situations.see cash am.int l bennett,gregg oil,kavanaugh underwriters life ins,writ ref see also united states western pac,d.
if the primary jurisdiction doctrine requires a trial court to defer to an agency to make an initial determination,the court should abate the lawsuit and suspend finally adjudicating the claim until the agency has an opportunity to act on the matter.see central power light public util.comm n,pet.denied roberts express,expert,no writ.
conversely,under the exclusive jurisdiction doctrine,the legislature grants an administrative agency the sole authority to make an initial determination in a dispute.cash,at.an agency has exclusive jurisdiction when a pervasive regulatory scheme indicates that congress intended for the regulatory process to be the exclusive means of remedying the problem to which the regulation is addressed.humphrey,comment,antitrust jurisdiction and remedies in an electric utility price squeeze,chi.whether an agency has exclusive jurisdiction depends on statutory interpretation.see cash,at continental coffee prods.cazarez.
typically,if an agency has exclusive jurisdiction,a party must exhaust all administrative remedies before seeking judicial review of the agency action.cash,at.until then,the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and must dismiss the claims within the agency exclusive jurisdiction.see texas educ.agency indep.sch,texas state bd.of examiners in optometry carp.but because such dismissal does not implicate the claims merits,the trial court must dismiss the claims without prejudice.see ritchey vasquez,crofts court of civil appeals.when exhaustion is required,courts have only limited review of the administrative action.cash,at.
in some instances,however,the statutory scheme may necessitate that an administrative agency with exclusive jurisdiction make certain findings before a trial court may finally adjudicate a claim.under those circumstances,if a party files its claim in the trial court before the agency resolves the issue within its exclusive jurisdiction,but the jurisdictional impediment can be removed,then the trial court may abate proceedings to allow a reasonable opportunity for the jurisdictional problem to be cured.american motorists ins.fodge.
standard of review 
determining if an agency has exclusive jurisdiction requires statutory construction and raises jurisdictional issues.thus,whether an agency has exclusive jurisdiction is a question of law we review de novo.see el paso natural gas minco oil gas,mayhew town of sunnyvale.
in contrast,some texas courts of appeals have applied an abuse of discretion standard when reviewing a trial court decision about whether an agency has primary jurisdiction.see state bar mcgee,christi,no writ simmons danco,writ ref.on the other hand,at least one court of appeals has concluded that whether an agency has primary jurisdiction is a question of law.legend airlines,city of fort worth,worth,pet.denied.despite this split in authorities,implicit in cash america was an understanding that primary jurisdiction questions are questions of law.see cash,at.this is logical because whether an agency has primary jurisdiction requires statutory construction.see,cash,at.thus,we conclude that a trial court decision about whether an agency has primary jurisdiction is also a legal question we review de novo.see el paso natural gas,at mayhew,at.
iii.analysis 
whether amended section applies 
whether an agency has primary or exclusive jurisdiction to resolve an issue determines if a party must first exhaust administrative remedies before a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction over a dispute.see cash,at see also united states philadelphia bank,d.if a trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,it does not have the authority to resolve the claims.texas ass of bus.texas air control.here,the trial court jurisdiction depends on whether amended section a applies and,if so,whether it grants the board exclusive rather than primary jurisdiction.although subaru asks us to remand to allow subaru to argue amended section a effects in the trial court,we exercise our authority to review the jurisdictional issue on rehearing.see texas air control,at.
section a amendments became effective may.because no savings clause exists,we would typically presume the legislature intended that the amendments operate prospectively.abell,at blonstein,at.but this presumption does not apply,because the statute is procedural and remedial in that section a determines what tribunal,the board or the trial court,has the authority to initially decide a code issue or claim.see likes,at abell,at watkins,at blonstein,at.section a also governs whether a party must exhaust administrative remedies before invoking a trial court jurisdiction to resolve a dispute involving code issues.see landgraf,at.city of kountze,at.
additionally,we do not presume that amended section a only applies prospectively,because amended section a does not alter the parties rights or obligations,or remove any remedies already available.see likes,at.the code continues to authorize the board to take certain actions when code violations occur.see.stat.likewise,other code provisions continue to permit a party to seek actual damages in court if the board determines code violations occurred.see.stat,a,e.therefore,amended section a merely determines the tribunal that will first resolve all issues and claims.see landgraf,at.city of kountze,at.and the parties do not have a vested right to choose the tribunal that will make these determinations.see landgraf,at.middleton,at city of kountze,at 
in sum,section a is a procedural and remedial statute that does not affect any vested rights here.see baker hughes,at.accordingly,we conclude that amended section a the version currently in applies retroactively in this case.
section whether it grants primary or exclusive jurisdiction hand how this affects a trial court adjudicating claims 
primary or exclusive jurisdiction 
because we hold that section a current version applies here,we next decide whether that provision grants the board primary or exclusive jurisdiction.we conclude section a now vests the board with exclusive jurisdiction over issues and claims.
section a language clearly expresses the legislature intent for the board to have exclusive jurisdiction over matters the code governs.see continental coffee,at.specifically,this section gives the board exclusive,original jurisdiction rather than general and original power and jurisdiction as the provision previously read.moreover,section no longer gives the board unrestricted jurisdiction to regulate all aspects of the distribution,sale,and leasing of motor vehicles see act of may,leg,ch.laws,amending.stat,a.instead,the current version has limiting language so the board has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate those aspects of the distribution,sale,and leasing of motor vehicles as governed by this act.stat,a emphasis added.this language clearly and plainly evidences the legislature intent that it is a jurisdictional prerequisite that the board resolve issues and claims before a party proceeds in court.indeed,the legislative history shows the legislature intent to change section a meaning the bill a mends section a to provide that the board has the exclusive,rather than general,original jurisdiction to regulate those aspects,rather than all aspects,of the distribution,sale and leasing of motor vehicles senate comm.on state affairs,bill analysis.consequently,we conclude that amended section a grants the board exclusive jurisdiction over claims and issues the code governs.
how does amended section a affect a trial court adjudicating a claim 
the code primary purpose is to regulate motor vehicle distribution and sales for the state economy and the citizens welfare.see.stat.to accomplish this purpose,the code strictly regulates the number and locations of motor vehicle dealerships,establishes the requisites for manufacturer and dealer licenses,and makes certain conduct by or between franchise dealers and manufacturers unlawful.see.stat.also,the code authorizes the board to administer the code provisions,establish licensee qualifications,ensure that motor vehicle distribution,sale,and leasing complies with the code and the board rules,provide for compliance with warranties,and prevent fraud,unfair practices,discriminations,impositions,and other abuses occurring with motor vehicle distribution and sale.stat.
moreover,the code establishes the administrative procedure through which the board conducts hearings to resolve contested cases and issues under the code.stat.the code provides that any party affected by a final board order,rule,decision,or action may obtain judicial review under the substantial evidence rule in a travis county district court or,if removed,in the third court of appeals.stat,a.
the board has the authority to levy penalties payable to the board,issue cease and desist orders,issue injunctions,or bring suit.stat.however,the board can not award damages to remedy harm a code violation causes.instead,an injured party may seek monetary redress in a trial court for code violations.specifically,the code expressly permits a party to bring a dtpa suit and seek damages based on another party violating code provisions,including those governing the relationship.stat,a.further,the code provides that each party to a franchise agreement owes a duty of good faith and fair dealing and makes this duty actionable in tort.stat,e.
accordingly,the code creates a hybrid process by which parties may seek damages for certain code violations.initially,because the board has exclusive jurisdiction under section a over claims and issues the code governs,a party must exhaust administrative remedies to obtain a board decision about code violations,if any,to support a dtpa or claim based on code violations.see.stat,a,e.the board decision is subject to review in a travis county district court or,if removed,in the third court of appeals.see.stat,a.the board decision becomes final and thus a party has exhausted administrative remedies for purposes of a party pursuing damages in a trial court for claims after the time to seek review of the board decision expires,if no affected person seeks such review,se.stat,a b or after an affected person who seeks judicial review exhausts the review avenues,see.stat,a 
when trying a dtpa or claim predicated on code violations,a trial court must give due deference to the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the board contained in a final order which forms the basis of the action.stat,a.due deference means that,once the board finding about an alleged dtpa or claim is final,the trial court adjudicating the damages arising from those claims must treat the board findings as wholly binding.in other words,in finally resolving the dtpa and claims,the trial court can not retry any board findings after they become final.
mcdavid claims 
dtpa claim 
the code expressly permits a person who has sustained actual damages to bring a dtpa claim based on a franchised dealer or manufacturer violating certain code provisions.stat,a.here,the court of appeals render ed the judgment the trial court should have rendered and dismiss ed mcdavid claims for lack of jurisdiction.at.the court of appeals explained that dismissal was required,because the primary jurisdiction doctrine required the board to first decide if any code violations support the dtpa claim.at.
subaru points out that mcdavid did not specifically argue in a cross point to this court that the court of appeals improperly rendered judgment dismissing mcdavid dtpa claim.however,we need not decide if mcdavid abandoned its dtpa claim.that is because,though the court of appeals erroneously relied on the primary jurisdiction doctrine rather than the exclusive jurisdiction doctrine for this conclusion,it correctly determined that the board must initially decide if any code violations exist to support the dtpa claim.
accordingly,under the code hybrid process,mcdavid must first exhaust its administrative remedies to obtain final board findings to support the dtpa claim.then,if the board final findings are favorable,mcdavid may maintain the dtpa action in the trial court.stat,a.in trying the dtpa claim,the trial court shall pay due deference to the board final findings.stat,a.as previously discu
