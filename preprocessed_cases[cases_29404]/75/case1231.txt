plaintiffs brought this personal injury and wrongful death tort action against the department of transportation caltrans after a drunk driver crossed the median on interstate and collided with them.they assert caltrans should be held liable because,at the time of the accident,it had not installed a barrier in the median.while they concede caltrans,at one time,enjoyed immunity for the design at the accident site,they contend caltrans lost that immunity because the design had become dangerous as a result of changed physical conditions.we conclude,as did the trial court when it granted summary judgment in favor of caltrans,that the evidence does not support plaintiffs contention.
ground concerning median barriers 
median barriers result in a.they prevent nearly all accidents,but usually result in an overall increase in accidents and injuries.a median barrier is a fixed object which,when hit,can cause serious injury either by direct impact or by deflecting vehicles back into traffic.in addition,a barrier eliminates half the recovery area for vehicles.based on studies of the effectiveness of median barrier placement,california has developed a median barrier policy.the policy reflects the fact that as traffic volumes rise,the chance that an errant vehicle will cross the median and strike an opposing vehicle increases.but as the median reaches a certain width,it is less likely that those events will occur.with medians feet or wider,regardless of traffic volume,the benefits of preventing accidents and injuries by barrier placement are outweighed by the disadvantages of the accidents and injuries generated by a barrier.the only exception to this rule is at those locations where there is a demonstrable history of excessive accidents an accident rate of fatal or total accidents per mile per year.
the state barriers should be installed on freeways only if the result of striking the barrier is less severe than the result if no barrier reflected in median barrier warrants.there are two types of warrants,traffic width warrants traffic warrants and accident warrants.traffic warrants index traffic volume to median width.accident warrants index the frequency and severity of traffic accidents at a given locale with a state average the fact that a warrant for a particular traffic control or safety device is met is not conclusive justification for the installation of the device.the unique circumstances of each location and the amount of funds available for highway improvements must be considered in determining whether or not to install a traffic control or safety device.
when a freeway is built without a median barrier,the state monitors it annually to determine whether subsequent placement of a median barrier may result in a safety benefit.each year,through its median barrier monitoring system,a sophisticated computer program,the state reviews the entire state highway system and identifies those locations that meet the accident warrant and the traffic warrant.the state notifies each district of the road segments in its area that met either warrant based on data collected the previous year.the district engineers conduct detailed reviews and field investigations and recommend to the state whether or not a barrier should be installed at the identified locations.the state reviews the district recommendations for statewide uniformity and availability of funding and makes a final decision with the district regarding installation of a median barrier at the identified locations.alvarez state of california th,d.
the following facts are contained in the parties separate statements of undisputed and disputed facts.
in the early morning on august,leobardo suarez,while intoxicated,was driving a chevrolet pickup truck southbound on interstate,south of stockton.he crossed the barrierless median and,traveling southbound in the northbound lanes,collided head on with a bmw sedan occupied by the mirzada family.the accident occurred at post mile.najibullah mirzada,roushon mirzada,manush mirzada,abdul ghaffar mirzada,and abdul jabbar mirzada were injured in the accident.mirwaice mirzada died.
the segment of interstate where the accident occurred was designed during to and constructed during to hereafter,the project.it was designed and constructed without a median barrier.at the time of this project,caltrans policy was to install median barriers only if the width of the median was less than feet.the average daily traffic at post mile increased from vehicles in to vehicles in.
in,caltrans changed the warrants for installation of median barriers so that medians up to feet wide could be considered for barriers depending on traffic volume and median width characteristics alone.in january,caltrans recommended a million project to install miles of median barriers along interstate,including at post mile.the barrier was not constructed before the august accident.
additional facts will be recited as they become relevant.
discussion 
a public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury sustained,and the public entity had actual or constructive notice of the condition a sufficient time before the injury to have taken preventive measures,subd.b baldwin state of california cal d,baldwin.
however,a public entity may avoid such liability by raising the affirmative defense of design immunity.a public entity claiming design immunity must establish three elements a causal relationship between the plan or design and the accident discretionary approval of the plan or design prior to construction and substantial evidence supporting the reasonableness of the plan or design.citations.
design immunity does not necessarily continue in perpetuity.baldwin,supra,cal d at.to demonstrate loss of design immunity a plaintiff must also establish three elements the plan or design has become dangerous because of a change in physical conditions the public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition thus created and the public entity had a reasonable time to obtain the funds and carry out the necessary remedial work to bring the property back into conformity with a reasonable design or plan,or the public entity,unable to remedy the condition due to practical impossibility or lack of funds,had not reasonably attempted to provide adequate warnings,baldwin,at.cornette department of transportation cal th,d,cornette,fn.and italics omitted.
at trial,after a defendant has shown the applicability of the design immunity to the plaintiff claims,the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing each of the three elements of the loss of the immunity.cornette,supra,cal th at,d.here,plaintiffs do not dispute the existence of the elements establishing the design immunity.they argue,instead,that the immunity was lost.consistent with their burden at trial of establishing the elements of caltrans loss of the design immunity,plaintiffs bore the burden of production in opposition to the motion for summary judgment to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,with respect to the loss of the design immunity.since it is necessary to establish all three elements of the loss of the design immunity cornette,supra,cal th at,d,plaintiffs needed to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of fact with respect to each of those elements to overcome caltrans motion for summary judgment.
citing baldwin,supra,cal d at page,plaintiffs assert caltrans,in support of its motion for summary judgment,bore the burden of establishing there were no triable issues of material fact relating to the loss of the design immunity.while this may have been the state of the law in,when the supreme court decided baldwin,the law concerning summary judgments changed in and to provide for a shift in the burden of production in cases such as this in which the moving defendant establishes the existence of an affirmative,the design immunity.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,we must determine whether plainti
