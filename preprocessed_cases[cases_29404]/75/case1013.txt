the federal aviation administration revoked charles duchek three airman certificates,basing its action on a finding that duchek had refused to submit to a required drug test.duchek argues that he never refused to submit to a test although he received a letter stating that his name had been randomly selected for testing,the letter did not establish a date and time to report for the test because,in the typical case,it was duchek job to set the date and time for those company employees selected for the unannounced tests.an administrative law judge at the national transportation safety board agreed with duchek that a test must be scheduled before an airman can be deemed to have refused to submit to it,but the board reversed,holding that the faa acted properly in revoking duchek certificates.we hold that the applicable regulations do not support the faa action,and therefore vacate the board order as arbitrary and capricious.
duchek is the operator and the,with his wife,of midwest aeronautical training,a small company in louis,missouri that provides helicopter services,including air taxi service and pilot training.as a provider of commuter and flight services,midwest holds a certificate under part of the federal aviation regulations,codified at part.employers with such certificates must ensure that employees in positions are tested for illegal drugs,see a a separate section of the regulations,appendix i to part,establishes the standards for employers drug testing programs.in addition to and testing,an employer must conduct random testing in any given year,a certain fraction of the company employees generally at least fifty percent must be selected at random for a drug test.see pt,app.i,hereinafter app.i.when an employee has been randomly selected,it is the employer duty to ensure that the employee drug test is unannounced.id.
for a small business such as midwest,which has only two employees aside from duchek himself,the operation of a internal drug testing program could be burdensome.department of transportation regulations which apply in addition to the faa regulations in appendix i,see id.accordingly allow an employer to use a administrator to select employees at random for testing,schedule tests,collect specimens,and arrange for laboratory testing.see,a see generally pt,subpt.q.as both the faa and dot regulations make clear,however,the employer retains the responsibility for compliance with the testing requirements,even when it hires a.app.i c.
midwest hired clinical collection management,ccm as its in august.when the drug testing regulations took their current form in august,see procedures for transportation workplace drug and alcohol testing programs,duchek took on the role of designated employer representative der for midwest.see.midwest random drug testing program thereafter involved two steps ccm would send a quarterly notice to duchek,as der,listing the employees selected for testing,along with an individualized notice to be given to each employee.duchek in his capacity as der would then choose a date and time for each selected employee to report for testing,but would notify the employee only on the chosen date,instructing him to report immediately for testing.the individualized notice forms from ccm thus arrived at midwest with only blank spaces for the specific date and time of the test duchek would fill in a date and time as part of choosing when to spring the drug test on the presumably unsuspecting employee.
on october,ccm selected duchek and another employee,jonathan heslop,from the pool of midwest employees eligible for testing in the fourth quarter of.in heslop case,the system worked as it was supposed to duchek chose october as the date for heslop test and instructed heslop on that day to report promptly to ccm.with regard to himself,however,duchek was somewhat in a bind he was both the der and the person to whom the der was required to give unannounced instructions to report for testing.ccm solution to this problem,its president later testified,was that a der such as duchek should contact ccm immediately upon opening the notification letter to arrange for a test on that day.hr g tr.at.the test could take the form of a visit by ccm to the der workplace,or a scheduled appointment for the der to come to ccm on that day.id.at.in the case of his fall selection,however,duchek failed to contact ccm.he later explained to the faa that a number of disruptive events had occurred in his business at the time and that he just let the notice slip his mind and forgot to follow up.statement of events,at see also hr g tr.at duchek stating that he knew he was supposed to call ccm to schedule a test but he mislaid the notice and forgot to call.
the faa issued an emergency order revoking duchek airman certificates on march.as authority for the revocation,the faa cited b,which states that an airman refusal to take a drug test as required under appendix i is grounds for s uspension or revocation of any certificate,rating,or authorization issued to the airman.b.appendix i,in turn,defines a refusal to submit to a drug test simply as conduct specified in the pertinent dot regulation.app.i ii.that regulation provides,in pertinent part,that an employee has refused to take a test if he 
fail s to appear for any test within a reasonable time,as determined by the employer,consistent with applicable dot agency regulations,after being directed to do so by the employer.this includes the failure of an employee including an to appear for a test when called by a see a.
at the end of the long chain of,a a provision addressed to and other service agents who collect drug testing specimens states 
when a specific time for an employee test has been scheduled,or the collection site is at the employee work site,and the employee does not appear at the collection site at the scheduled time,contact the der if the employee arrival is delayed beyond an appropriate time,you must notify the der that the employee has not reported for testing.in a situation where a has notified an or other individual employee to report for testing and the employee does not appear,the must notify the employee that he or she has refused to test see a.
duchek challenged the revocation order,arguing that he was not called for testing as required by section a and that he could not be held to have refused to take a drug test,because no date and time for the test were ever scheduled.see amended answer.at a hearing on april,an ntsb administrative law judge heard testimony from duchek and two other witnesses the president of ccm and an faa investigator,robert neal.neal testified that for a drug test to be random under appendix i,it must be unannounced.hr g tr.the alj found neal statement highly significant,and concluded that there was no random drug test scheduled for duchek,because if there is an announcement,the test ca be random,if it is open ended.and here it was open ended.id.at.the judge thus ruled that the faa had not established that duchek had violated the regulations.id.at.
the board reversed 
it is true that,in a sense,duchek selection was not unannounced in the same way it was for other employees.it may be that the administrator should reconsider the practices of allowing persons subject to testing also to be ders and not requiring the notice to the der to contain a time and date or period of time for the scheduled testing.without the latter specificity,the rules are open to uncertainty in their application and an element of this important program could be the subject of time consuming and unnecessary litigation.in this case,however,we are satisfied that respondent should be held accountable for failing to ever appear for testing.
administrator duchek,ntsb order no.may,at board order.
the board reasoned that as the der,and owner of the company,duchek had a clear responsibility to comply with the letter and spirit of the antidrug program.id.at.it found that duchek was obliged to present himself for testing as soon as he received notice from ccm that he was among those selected for testing that quarter.id.rejecting duchek proffered explanation of why he did not call ccm to schedule the test,
