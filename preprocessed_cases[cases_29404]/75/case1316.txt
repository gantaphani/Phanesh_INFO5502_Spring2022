mission petroleum carriers,terminated roy solomon,an employee,for failing a random drug test.solomon sued mission,contending that it breached a duty by not exercising ordinary care in the manner it collected his urine specimen for testing.mission claims that this lawsuit is essentially a suit for negligent discharge,which is incompatible with the doctrine of.we granted review because the case presents important questions about whether to impose liability on employers in light of the comprehensive regulation of drug testing outlined in the united states department of transportation regulations.
answering a question we left open in smithkline beecham doe,the court of appeals held that an employer owes a duty to an employee to conduct a drug test with reasonable care.the court of appeals was not writing on a clean slate.a comprehensive set of federal rules and regulations governs collecting and processing urine for drug scheme that is designed both to require the employer to observe collection protocols and to place tools at the employee disposal for invalidating test results.because the regulations adopted by congress adequately balance these interests,we decline to impose a duty on employers who conduct urine specimen collection pursuant to department of transportation dot regulations.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment that solomon take nothing.
mission required its truck drivers to submit to random drug testing pursuant to dot regulations.see,as authorized by these regulations,mission used its own employees to collect the drivers urine samples for testing by outside laboratories.on april,roy solomon,an truck driver at mission beaumont terminal,was randomly selected to provide a urine sample for drug testing.when solomon arrived for the test,his immediate supervisor,terminal manager ed hillebrandt,gave solomon an unsealed collection container that had been sitting exposed on a desk in the terminal dispatcher office.solomon went unaccompanied into an adjacent restroom to provide the specimen.solomon returned to the dispatcher office and set the collection container on the table.he then went back to the restroom to wash his hands,leaving the container behind.
when he returned from the restroom approximately one minute later,hillebrandt divided the sample into two separate containers.solomon then sealed each container,initialed the seals,and placed the containers in a plastic bag.solomon signed an informed consent form confirming the identity and integrity of the sample throughout the collection and testing process.mission sent one of the containers to bayshore clinical laboratories in brown deer,wisconsin for analysis the other was set aside in the event further testing was required.the bayshore laboratory analyzed the specimen and discovered thc metabolite,a chemical produced by the human body after marijuana use.
a medical review officer mro charged with ensuring the accuracy of the test results,informed solomon that he had tested positive for thc metabolite.solomon told the mro that the positive result could not possibly be accurate because he had never used marijuana.solomon denied taking medication or any other product that might have caused the thc metabolite to appear in his sample.he did not,however,suggest that the results might have been compromised by mission faulty collection procedures.following his discussion with the mro,solomon called mission and requested a retest.mission sent the second sample to a different laboratory for analysis.on april,when the second test also confirmed the presence of thc metabolite,mission terminated solomon employment.
the next day,solomon applied for positions at coastal transport and mcx trucking.the dot regulations require a prospective employer to review the applicant test results from previous employers for the preceding two years from the date of the application.f,a,d.consequently,as part of each employment application,coastal transport and mcx trucking asked solomon to sign a consent form authorizing mission to release those drug test results.mission reported solomon test results to coastal and mcx after solomon consented to the disclosure.see id.f see also.employers may only release test results with the informed written consent of the employee.neither coastal transport nor mcx trucking hired solomon.
days after the urine test,solomon passed an independent laboratory test,which was designed to detect marijuana consumption.although there is evidence that hair follicle testing is a scientifically recognized procedure,the test purports only to reveal the persistent use of marijuana over time,not isolated uses.solomon concedes that the test would establish at most that he was not a regular user of marijuana,but could not confirm or refute that he smoked marijuana around the time mission collected his urine sample.
solomon sued mission,first alleging only defamation but later adding claims for business disparagement and negligence.the trial court granted mission motion for summary judgment on the defamation and disparagement claims,and solomon has not challenged that judgment on appeal.the negligence claim proceeded to trial.solomon testified that he had never smoked marijuana.he also presented evidence that mission violated each of the following collection protocols,which are designed to ensure the validity of the drug test result 
dot regulations prohibit an employee s immediate supervisor from collecting the employee s urine sample unless it is impractical for any other individual to perform the collection.d.here,however,solomon immediate supervisor collected the specimen,and solomon presented evidence that employees could easily have performed that task.
both the employee and the collector must be present when the collection container is removed from a sealed collection kit.id.b.in this case,however,the container had been removed from the collection kit before solomon arrived to provide his specimen.
the collector must tell the employee to wash his hands before providing the sample and not again until after the sample is returned.id.f.hillebrandt did not give solomon this admonition.
the collector is required to restrict access to the collection site.id.b.mission collection site,however,was unrestricted.
the collection container must be kept in view of the collector and the employee between the time the employee has urinated and the time the specimen is sealed.id.f.but solomon was separated from the container for at least seconds while he washed his hands.
solomon argued that mission failure to follow these dot protocols resulted in false positive test results.he presented evidence that the test results were the catalyst for a series of adverse consequences,culminating in his inability to find employment as a truck driver.he sought damages for mental anguish and lost wages.
the jury found that mission negligence proximately caused solomon injuries and awarded solomon past and future damages for medical care,loss of earning capacity,and mental anguish totaling.the jury also assessed in exemplary damages on a finding that mission acted with malice.the trial court rendered judgment on the verdict.
the court of appeals affirmed,holding that mission owed its employees a duty of care when collecting urine samples for drug testing.at.it also held that the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the jury finding that mission failure to follow dot testing protocols proximately caused thc metabolite to be present in solomon urine sample.id.the court concluded that mission conduct,coupled with solomon resulting loss of earning capacity,supported the recovery of mental anguish damages.id.at.finally,the court upheld the punitive damages award,concluding that there was clear and convincing evidence that mission disregarded an extreme risk of serious harm.id.
we granted mission petition for review to decide whether an employer owes its employees a duty of care when collecting urine samples for drug testing pursuant to dot regulations.
the parties contentionsa.mission arguments 
mission presents four principal issues.first,mission argues that there is no duty of care owed by an employer in its decision to fire an employee.it asserts that the court of appeals has effectively created a new cause of action in texas for negligent termination.mission contends that this holding jeopardizes the doctrine,which generally permits an employer to terminate an employee for a good reason,a bad reason,or no reason at all.see city of midland.second,mission argues solomon presented no evidence that its mishandling of the urine sample caused solomon to receive a positive drug test result.third,mission asserts that the court of appeals holding regarding solomon mental anguish damages conflicts with boyles kerr,in which we rejected the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress.finally,mission contends there is no evidence of malice to support the jury punitive damages award.
solomon arguments 
solomon disputes that the doctrine is implicated in this case.he observes that the jury was charged on a negligence question,not on particular theories of negligent investigation or negligent evaluation.his primary complaint is not that he was wrongfully terminated,but that mission negligent collection procedures destroyed his prospects for future employment as a truck driver.solomon contends that recognizing a common law duty to use reasonable care in collecting urine samples satisfies the greater houston transportation phillips test because an employee need for protection from a flawed result outweighs the magnitude of the burden of guarding against this injury,noting that when considering whether there is a basis for imposing a duty,courts consider several interrelated factors,including the risk,foreseeability,and likelihood of injury weighed against the social utility of the actor conduct,the magnitude of the burden of guarding against the injury,and the consequences of placing the burden on the defendant 
on the issue of causation,solomon argues that he produced sufficient direct and circumstantial evidence for the jury to find he never used marijuana mission negligence rendered the sample scientifically invalid and the laboratories performing the tests did not contaminate the sample.from these facts,solomon contends that the jury could reasonably infer that mission negligence proximately caused a false positive test result and that he presented legally sufficient evidence to support the trial court mental anguish and exemplary damages awards.
smithkline beecham 
to prevail on his negligence claim,solomon must show that mission owed him a duty,mission breached its duty,mission breach proximately caused his injuries,and damages resulted from this breach.see thapar zezulka.because duty is the threshold issue,we begin by addressing whether an employer owes a duty to an employee to use reasonable care when collecting an employee urine sample for drug testing pursuant to dot regulations.the existence of a duty is a question of law.smithkline beecham,at.when considering whether there is a basis for imposing a duty,we consider various factors,including the risk,foreseeability,and likelihood of injury weighed against the social utility of the actor conduct,the magnitude of the burden of guarding against the injury,and the consequences of placing the burden on the defendant.phillips,at.with these factors in mind,we consider whether solomon has presented a basis for imposing a duty of reasonable care on employers when conducting urine specimen collection pursuant to dot regulations.
in smithkline beecham doe,this court addressed the related question of whether an independent drug testing laboratory,hired by an employer to test prospective employees,owes a duty to warn those employees that certain substances,if ingested prior to a drug test,could cause a positive test result.at.emphasizing that we were deciding only the narrow question presented,we concluded that the testing laboratory owed no duty to warn the person tested or to investigate the reason for a positive result.id.at.we declined to address any duty the employer may owe to an employee and expressly reserved the question whether a laboratory may be liable for performing drug tests negligently.id.at.willis roche biomedical,cir predicting that texas courts would hold,based on smithkline,that drug testing laboratories owe no duty of care to their clients employees.
b.the law in other jurisdictions 
courts in other jurisdictions are split on whether a testing laboratory owes a duty to employees when collecting or analyzing urine samples courts in new york,illinois,and wyoming have utilized balancing tests,applying many of the factors we articulated in phillips,to hold that laboratories obtaining specimens as part of an employer substance abuse testing program owe a duty of care to employees submitting specimens on the other hand,courts in texas and ohio reject a laboratory duty of care,emphasizing generally that companies have a direct relationship only with the employer and not the employee courts in louisiana and pennsylvania are divided each of these cases,however,involves collection of urine for drug testing,an issue not before this court.we must answer,then,whether an employer owes a duty of care when the employer itself collects the employees urine samples.
we are not aware of any cases recognizing the duty that solomon advocates here.in fact,we have located only one case directly addressing what duty an employer owes when the employer itself collects employees urine samples.in bellinger weight watchers gourmet food,ohio app d,an employer terminated an employee for failing a random drug test.the employee claimed that his employer breached a duty to perform the drug test in a competent manner because it failed to follow the company drug and alcohol policy.id.at.the court,however,disagreed.it held that because the plaintiff was an employee,his employer was entitled to discharge him whether or not he was subject to a drug test therefore,the employer did not owe the employee a duty to perform the test in a competent manner.id.at 
other courts have similarly refused to impose a tort duty requiring an employer agent to comply with dot protocol when the agent collects samples for drug testing.in carroll iii federal express,cir,an outside administrator for federal express allegedly violated several dot collection protocols and requirements when collecting the employee urine sample,resulting in a false positive test result.the plaintiff argued that federal express policy created an implied obligation that he would not be terminated except for a positive drug test that was untainted by error.id.the court,however,rejected the plaintiff invitation to recognize an implied obligation to ensure testing.id.
similarly,in graham contract transportation,cir,the eighth circuit held that an employee did not have a claim against his employer when he was terminated for failing a drug test administered by an outside testing center that did not comply with dot regulations.the court reasoned that the employee claim of a faulty drug test was,at most,a claim and thus not actionable under iowa law.id.at.
other courts have refused to hold employers liable for discharging employees based on negligently conducted polygraph tests.see,johnson delchamps,cir hall united parcel serv.of.in finding delchamps not liable,the fifth circuit noted that the doctrine affords employers broad discretion in making personnel decisions.delchamps,at.the court reasoned that,because an employer can terminate an employee for no reason,it has no obligation to ascertain whether a termination was based on correct information after a reasonable investigation.id.
the new york court of appeals in hall refused to recognize a cause of action based on allegations that an employee polygraph test,which was negligently administered,resulted in an innocent employee termination for theft.hall,at.the court deferred to state and federal legislative initiatives as the more appropriate avenue for addressing legitimate concerns about the consequences of an employer use of questionable test results.id.at.moreover,the court noted that the federal employee polygraph protection act of,which creates a private cause of action for certain violations of the act,greatly diminished the need to recognize a new tort remedy for negligently conducted polygraph tests.id.
although these opinions inform our consideration of the issue,they rest largely on analysis of wrongful termination claims.we recognize that solomon does not contest mission right to terminate him.instead,he asserts that mission had a duty not to destroy his future employment prospects.we must consider,then,whether imposing that duty is consistent with the comprehensive federal regulatory scheme already in place and with our common law in related areas.
federal regulations provide avenues for employees redress 
congress has not given employees a private cause of action under the dot regulations at issue here.see parry mohawk motors of,cir drake delta air lines,cir schmeling nordam,cir abate pac.transp,cir.nevertheless,like the polygraph protection act,the dot regulations impose stringent rules for administering and disclosing drug test results and levy civil penalties for violation of these rules.compare violations of polygraph protection act punishable by civil penalties,injunctions,and private actions for damages,with,and b violations of dot regulations punishable by dot fines,loss of insurance,or levy of an unsatisfactory safety rating.
in addition,employees have significant avenues of redress when employers fail or refuse to follow dot protocol in collecting urine samples.under the dot regulations,for example,employers can not require employees to sign consent or release forms with respect to any part of the drug testing,including collection,when the employer fails to follow statutory requisites for collecting the specimen.see.when employers do not follow dot protocol,employees can refuse to initial the seal on the specimen bottle and can refuse to sign the federal drug testing custody and control form.see id.without this form,the medical review officer mro can not verify the drug test.see a,c.
the regulations anticipate that positive test results do not necessarily confirm that the employee is guilty of drug use.id.a a positive test result does not automatically identify an as having used drugs in violation of a dot agency regulation.for that reason,the dot regulations require not only that an independent mro review the test results,but also provide the mro with the authority to examine the procedures by which the sample was collected,including interviewing the employee to determine if positive results can be explained by factors other than drug use.id.see also.gas util.workers union of,cir.
the mro must review the chain of custody to ensure that it is complete and sufficient on its face before certifying a positive drug test result.a.the mro is prohibited from verifying positive results that are not obtained or processed in accordance with quality assurance and control protocols.id.b.and,before verifying a positive test result,the mro must give the employee an opportunity to contend that the result is positive for a legitimate reason.see id.c see also.gas,at.if an employee chooses not to initial or sign the seal or custody and control form,the mro can not confirm the chain of custody and must contact the employee to discuss the positive result.a,c.and even if the chain of custody is confirmed,the mro can not verify a positive test result if aware that the urine sample was not obtained in accordance with the dot protocols.id.b.these protections reduce the risk of harm and likelihood of injury to an employee whose employer negligently collects urine samples for drug testing.solomon did not attempt to utilize these avenues of redress.
on the day solomon was first employed,mission gave him explicit guidelines not only implementing but also supplementing the dot regulations.under these guidelines,solomon could have requested that the positive test result be reported by the mro as negative 
it is the responsibility of the mro to make the final determination of a positive test result.if the report he receives indicates a positive drug test for one or more of the drugs tested,the mro will examine possible alternatives,which may have resulted in this positive finding.he has the authority to check medical records and interview a driver to determine if a positive report has a justifiable reason after talking to the driver or reviewing his medical records,it is possible that the test result will be reported as negative to the employer.
if your test result is positive,and there are no mitigating circumstances,the mro will attempt to talk to you directly.
solomon did not avail himself of these protections.instead,he signed the custody and control form which certified that mission complied with dot regulations pertaining to the integrity of the sample and did not disclose to the mro mission alleged malfeasance during the collection process.if solomon had complained to the mro about mission testing techniques,the mro could have investigated and negated solomon positive test result.as it stood,however,nothing on the face of the sample would have suggested to the mro that the chain of custody was breached indeed,solomon himself certified that the chain of custody was unbroken.see a.
solomon also could have complained and initiated administrative proceedings challenging mission regimen.see,see also.an associate administrator for the federal highway administration is charged with investigating alleged violations of the regulations and determining if employers have complied with the statutory requirements.upon finding violations,the associate administrator has the authority to compel compliance,assess civil penalties,or both.id.
accordingly,had solomon filed a complaint,mission could have been fined up to,lost its ability to obtain insurance,or received an unsatisfactory safety rating.see id.see also b.once given an unsatisfactory rating,a motor carrier is prohibited from transporting hazardous materials and is ineligible for certain federal contracts.see.the dot regulations also give the associate administrator authority to fashion relief to the complainant and assure that the complainant is not subject to harassment,intimidation,disciplinary action,discrimination,or financial loss for having filed the complaint.see also rector labone,d,holding that this scheme provides an adequate remedy to an employee when his employer does not follow drug testing procedures.because employees can thereby protect themselves from harm,we have less incentive to create a duty requiring employers to exercise ordinary care in collecting employees specimens for drug testing.
solomon sued in court rather than pursuing these administrative remedies.we recognize that curtailing drug use in trucking is,as the regulations indicate,a national concern requiring national standards.see.but we are not persuaded that adjudication of collection procedures through tort litigation would serve the broader interest solomon quite properly seeks to protect.
applying the phillips factors here,we agree there is a serious risk that an employee can be harmed by a false positive drug test.however,the risk is reduced by the protection dot regulations afford to the employees.as we have seen,the dot comprehensive statutory and regulatory scheme,coupled with the authority granted to the mro,affords significant protection to employees who are the subject of random drug tests.without these protections,the risk of harm resulting from a negligently conducted urinalysis test would be great.but here,the dot regulations strike an appropriate balance between the need for efficient drug testing and the requirement that each employee have the means to insist on the integrity of the process.while the regulations do not create a private cause of action for an employer breach of dot protocols,employees are entitled to compel compliance by invoking regulations already in place.those regulations serve both as an incentive for employers to carefully abide by those protocols and as a safe harbor for employees whose test results are tainted by unacceptable breaches of collection procedures.we therefore decline to impose a duty on employers who conduct urine specimen collection u
