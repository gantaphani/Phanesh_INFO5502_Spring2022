petitioner jack rondal dillmon accuses the national transportation safety board board of one thing while doing another.dillmon argues the board departed from its prior decisions without adequate explanation when it affirmed the federal aviation administration faa emergency revocation of his airman and medical certificates.we agree with dillmon the board has failed to exhibit the reasoned decision making we require of agencies.we therefore grant his petition for review.
on february,a jury convicted dillmon of ten counts of bribery of a public servant,a felony in the state where he was prosecuted.a month later,on march,dillmon submitted to the faa an application for a third class medical certificate.in filling out the medical application,dillmon had to answer yes or no to question,which asked whether he had any h istory of nontraffic conviction s misdemeanors or felonies.faa form.despite his recent felony bribery conviction,dillmon answered no.in signing the form,dillmon certified his answers were complete and true to the best of his knowledge.id.on may,and march,dillmon again filled out the application to renew his medical certificate.each time he filled out the application,he answered question no.
in august,the faa acting administrator issued an emergency order revoking dillmon medical certificate,as well as his private pilot certificate.the order explained the administrator had concluded dillmon answers to question in,and violated federal aviation regulation far provision a,which states no person may make or cause to be made a fraudulent or intentionally false statement on any application for a medical certificate.dillmon appealed the order to the board and requested a hearing to challenge the faa findings.
at an october,hearing before an administrative law judge alj,the faa submitted evidence of dillmon bribery conviction and his no answers to question on his,and medical applications.after the faa presentation of evidence,the alj denied dillmon motion to dismiss and ruled the faa had made out a prima facie case for the regulatory offense of intentional falsification under far section a.the alj then allowed dillmon to present evidence and testify in his defense.
dillmon explained why he had answered no to question.he said,i have always believed and have always understood any time this question has ever come up was that all the faa was interested in was anything to do with drugs or alcohol.hearing tr.at.dillmon described how the faa aviation medical examiner ame had first informed him of this in.id.at.he testified another ame,van den berg,similarly advised him in and that question was only concerned with drug or offenses.id.at.dillmon submitted two letters from van den berg to corroborate his testimony about their conversations in and.dillmon emphasized,i never would have checked no if this was not the advice i was given by the designated examiner that helped me complete the form.id.at.finally,he testified he was painfully aware his life was an open book when it comes to a criminal conviction,and he was not proud of it,but it was not something he would lie about or try to hide.id.at.
on by the faa,dillmon conceded he had never read the portion of the medical application which provided instructions for completing question until the day before the hearing.hearing tr.at.the instructions stated,letter w asks if you have ever had any other nontraffic convictions,assault,battery,public intoxication,robbery.if so,name the charge for which you were convicted and the date of conviction in the explanations box.faa form.he also admitted that when he filled out the applications in,and,he knew he had been convicted of a offense.id.at.finally,when asked by the alj how he would answer question today,dillmon said,absolutely yes.id.at.
after the hearing,the alj issued his decision.he noted the central question was,what is in the man mind hearing tr.at.of particular importance to the instant petition,the alj found dillmon to be a credible witness my determination is that dillmon was quite forthright and candid in his testimony.to me,there is quite a notable absence of any indication of an intentional falsehood when he signed the no to these questions in the three applications in question.id.at.in light of dillmon testimony and the documentary evidence he submitted,the alj ruled dillmon had successfully rebutted the administrator prima facie case of intentional falsification,concluding,i t is clear to me that there no intention on the part of dillmon to falsify,let alone be fraudulent in setting forth the answers that he did to this question.id.at.the alj therefore reversed the faa emergency revocation order.
the faa appealed the alj decision to the board,which reversed the alj based on two purported errors.administrator dillmon,ntsb order no,wl,at.first,the board concluded the alj erred in determining dillmon had successfully rebutted the administrator prima facie case of intentional falsification.id.relying on several prior decisions,the board rejected dillmon argument that he did not make an intentionally false statement because he believed question was only concerned with alcohol and drug convictions.second,the board determined the alj erred by requiring the administrator to prove dillmon had the specific intent to deceive the faa,rather than the lesser burden of proving intent to falsify.id.the board therefore reversed the alj and affirmed the faa emergency revocation order.dillmon petitioned this court to review the board decision.
we are bound by the administrative procedure act when we review the board decisions.see chritton ntsb.under e and f,we adopt the agency factual findings as conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.the agency factual findings may be supported by substantial evidence even though a plausible alternative interpretation of the evidence would support a contrary view.chritton,at.we also must consider whether the agency action is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.in evaluating agency action under this standard,we defer to the wisdom of the agency,provided its decision is reasoned and rational,and even uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency path may reasonably be discerned.chritton,at quoting bowman,freight,d.
nevertheless,we have held that where an agency departs from its precedent,it must do so by reasoned analysis.ramaprakash faa,see motor vehicle ass of united states,state farm mut.auto.ins,d a n agency changing its course must supply a reasoned analysis.as the supreme court recently explained,the apa does not impose a heightened standard of review upon an agency to justify its departure from precedent.fcc fox television stations,d.to the contrary,an agency is free to alter its past rulings and practices even in an adjudicatory setting.airmark faa.but we do require the agency to display awareness that it is changing position and not to depart from a prior policy sub silentio or simply disregard rules that are still on the books.fox television.at.this permits us to ensure the agency prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed,not casually ignored.ramaprakash,at.reasoned decision making,therefore,necessarily requires the agency to acknowledge and provide an adequate explanation for its departure from established precedent.see fox television.at t he agency must show that there are good reasons for the new policy.applying the corollary of this requirement,agency action is arbitrary and capricious if it departs from agency precedent without explanation.ramaprakash,at.
dillmon argues the board decision diverges from its precedent in two ways first,by reversing the alj decision without addressing his credibility determination and second,by applying an improper standard for the intent element of the offense of intentional falsification.we address these arguments in turn.
dillmon argues the board departed from its precedent when it reversed the alj without addressing his credibility determination in dillmon favor.the board precedent unambiguously requires it to defer to its aljs credibility determinations.as we have observed,the board policy is not to disturb a credibility finding unless there is a compelling reason or the finding was clearly erroneous.chirino ntsb,internal quotations omitted affirming board reversal of alj credibility finding in airman certificate revocation proceeding.consequently,the board has overturned alj credibility determinations found to be inherently incredible or inconsistent with the overwhelming weight of the evidence.id.at.
this deferential standard of review stems from the function the aljs perform in the adjudicative process as we have stated repeatedly,the law judge sees and hears the witnesses,and he is in the best position to evaluate their credibility.daschle taylor,ntsb order no,wl,at,see also administrator exousia,ntsb order no,wl,at,o ur prior decisions make clear that we defer to the credibility determinations of our law judges,who are in the position of observing live testimony and the demeanor of witnesses,unless shown to be clearly erroneous.of relevance to dillmon petition,the board has directed its aljs to assume this role in revocation proceedings for intentional falsification of medical applications w e think that the task facing our law judges is essentially no different from any other adjudication in which a credibility assessment concerning an individual intent must be made.administrator barghelame,wl.
the board adherence to this precedent has been unwavering.for instance,in administrator roarty,ntsb order no,wl,the board reviewed an alj determination that an airman had not intentionally falsified his medical application in violation of far section a.the alj had concluded the airman failure to disclose a prior revocation of his medical certificate when filling out the application was a negligent mistake,rather than an intentionally false answer.id.at.on appeal,the board noted,r esolution of credibility issues,unless made in an arbitrary or capricious manner,is within the exclusive province of the law judge.id.the board declared it may not reverse the law judge simply because,on the appellate record,we might come to a different conclusion.id.citing chirino,at.although the board reviewed the evidence from the hearing and speculated the airman might have intentionally falsified the answer,it was constrained to uphold the alj decision because it had no basis to characterize the law judge credibility determination in favor of respondent as arbitrary or capricious.id.
turning to dillmon petition,we are unable to reconcile the board decision with its precedent concerning its review of an alj credibility determination.there is no question the alj made an explicit credibility finding in dillmon favor.see hearing tr.at my determination is that dillmon was quite forthright and candid in his testimony.dillmon credibility was a central issue at the hearing.in concluding dillmon had rebutted the faa prima facie case,the alj relied heavily on dillmon testimony about what he thought question meant and about his conversations with the ame van den berg in and.but when it reversed the alj,the board did not even acknowledge he had made a credibility finding.
the board silence on this pivotal factual issue leaves us unable to determine whether it acted consistent with its precedent.see,exousia,ntsb order no,at chirino,at.its silence is particularly troubling here because,as in roarty,the alj who presided over dillmon hearing believed his testimony.roarty,ntsb order no,at.in roarty,the board expressed skepticism about the airman defense but admitted it was constrained by precedent to affirm the alj decision.id.the facts in roarty appear indistinguishable from the circumstances in dillmon case,and the board has not offered an explanation for these conflicting results.if a compelling reason for refusing to believe dillmon and rejecting the alj credibility assessment exists,the board has not revealed it to us.because the board departs from its precedent without adequate explanation,its decision reversing the alj without overturning his credibility determination is arbitrary and capricious.see ramaprakash,at see also andrzejewski faa,cir holding the board failure to give the alj implicit credibility determination the requisite level of deference was contrary to the board precedent and,therefore,arbitrary and capricious.
the faa essentially concedes the board deviated from its precedent when it argues,to the extent in so reversing the alj,the board implicitly overturned any of his credibility determinations,the substantial evidence in the record establishes that the board had the requisite basis to do so under the foregoing standard.faa br.at emphasis added.the faa thus admits the board failed to explicitly overturn the alj credibility determination but asserts we should nevertheless interpret its decision to encompass this result.the faa argument is itself inconsistent with the board precedent.moreover,if the board were permitted to overturn the alj credibility finding implicitly,we still would be unable to ascertain whether the board reviewed the finding under the appropriate standard or simply ignored it.see fox television.at an agency must display awareness that it is changing position and not depart from a prior policy sub silentio or simply disregard rules that are still on the books.if we accepted the faa argument,we would have to assume the board had engaged in reasoned decision making without confirming it actually did.this extreme level of deference is not sanctioned by the apa nor our precedent.
the faa offers two reasons why we should not vacate the board order.first,the faa argues the standard of review we should apply to the board decision is found in singer garvey,cir.there the court noted,where the board reverses its alj,this court role is limited to determining whether those factors which influenced the alj should have required the board to reach a decision different from the one it did.id.at.it is unclear to us precisely what singer meant by this statement,but whatever it meant,the faa appears to have taken it out of context.our role is not limited in the manner suggested by this single sentence we review the board decisions under the standards established by the apa,not according to the factors relied on by the alj.singer acknowledges the proper standard of review in the paragraph prior to the one from which the faa quotes.see id.this court may set aside agency action only if it finds it to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or,where there has been a hearing,the agency action is unsupported by substantial evidence.
in any event,singer,while not controlling,is consistent with our holding today.the airman in singer had argued the board departed from precedent by overturning a statement by the alj that the airman contended was a credibility finding.id.the court rejected this argument by noting the board had specifically addressed the alj statement and concluded that it did not amount to a credibility finding.id.the court concluded the board action was consistent with its precedent because it had properly interpreted the alj statement as a legal conclusion rather than a factual finding based upon the witness reliability.id.at the alj did not render a credibility determination.as noted above,the alj statement about dillmon testimony clearly constituted a credibility determination.singer therefore does not resolve the question raised by dillmon petition,and the faa reliance on it is misplaced.
second,the faa argues the substantial evidence in the record provided the board with the requisite basis for overturning the alj credibility determination,and,because the board decision is supported by substantial evidence,it therefore should be affirmed.the flaw in the faa argument is that the board does not cite this same basis for reversing the alj.instead,the board reversed the alj purportedly because he erred by departing from the board precedent in two explanation we will explore below.however,even if the alj had arbitrarily and capriciously departed from the board precedent,this would not,by itself,vitiate his factual findings,including the credibility determination.the faa substantial evidence argument is thus a attempt to rehab
