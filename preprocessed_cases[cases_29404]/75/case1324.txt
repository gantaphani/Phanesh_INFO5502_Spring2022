defendant,wisconsin central railroad wisconsin central,was issued a citation for violating an ordinance enacted by plaintiff,the village of mundelein village,prohibiting obstruction of a grade crossing.following a bench trial,the trial court found wisconsin central guilty of violating the ordinance and imposed a fine of plus costs.the appellate court reversed the trial court judgment and vacated the fine,holding that the village ordinance is preempted by the federal railroad safety authorization act of frsa et.d.for the reasons that follow,we agree that the village ordinance is preempted by the frsa.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the appellate court.
background 
the village charged wisconsin central with violating its ordinance by allowing a train to block a grade crossing for minutes.the village ordinance prohibits obstruction of public travel on a highway at a railroad crossing for more than minutes,except when a train or railroad car is continuously moving or can not be moved due to circumstances beyond the rail carrier reasonable control.prior to trial,wisconsin central filed a brief and offer of proof contending it did not violate the ordinance because the train was stopped due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control.wisconsin central also argued that the frsa preempts enforcement of the ordinance.
at the bench trial,train conductor bernard kareka testified that he and the engineer assumed control of the train in lake villa,illinois.the train had been left there by the previous crew on their way southbound from wisconsin to schiller park,illinois.consisting of locomotive engines and cars,the train had stopped in lake villa for approximately three to four hours.the previous crew departed and left a note stating that the train had bad air,meaning there was a problem with the air brakes.the previous crew had repaired a couple of air leaks by changing the gaskets between the air hoses.based upon the note,kareka believed the previous crew had repaired any problem with the air brakes.
kareka testified that he looked at several cars behind the locomotives to locate the hand brakes while the engineer inspected the locomotives.they released the hand brakes identified as being set in the previous crew report.kareka and the engineer then conducted a job briefing,reviewed reports from the previous crew,and ensured that any cars containing hazardous materials were placed in the proper location in the train.
kareka further testified that federal regulations require verification that the air brakes are in working order before moving the train.the crew,therefore,conducted tests on the air brake system.the crew verified that the air pressure on the rear of the train was within pounds of the pressure on the front as required by federal regulations.the engineer conducted a set and release test to verify that the brakes were in working order and there was sufficient air pressure throughout the brake system.kareka testified that,as a crew taking over operation of a train already underway,they were not required to inspect the entire train or perform any tests beyond those they completed.
after completing the inspections and tests,the train left lake villa heading south toward the village.upon approaching the village,a hot box detector went off,indicating that equipment was dragging from the rear car of the train.the engineer began slowing the train when a sudden loss of air pressure caused the emergency brakes to apply on each car.the train suddenly stopped.
when the crew was unable to restore air pressure in the brake system on the rear of the train,kareka got out to make a visual inspection.he noted that his footing was very bad and he had to hold onto the train cars to keep his balance due to the rough roadbed and the angle of the embankment.in walking the length of the train,kareka discovered that an angle cock was misaligned on one of the cars.kareka explained that an angle cock is a valve that regulates the airflow through the brake line in the cars.he asserted that the angle cock could have been knocked out of position by debris,vibration from the moving train,or sabotage.kareka stated that when the engineer slowed the train to pass through the village,the brakes on the front of the train would have set faster than those on the rear due to the angle cock misalignment.this condition caused the rear portion of the train to collide with the front braking portion.
kareka straightened the angle cock,continued the inspection,and discovered that the drawbar had broken and fallen off the rear of the car,six cars behind the one with the misaligned angle cock.the train had separated and the emergency brakes applied due to the broken drawbar.the drawbar had fallen under the following car,damaging the air hose.
after assessing the damage,the crew positioned the separated rear portion of the train to avoid obstructing any highway crossing.the crew proceeded south with the front part of the train and left the car with the broken drawbar on a spur track.the crew then reversed the train and returned to reconnect with the rear portion left on the track.
when they reached the rear portion of the train,the crew began the process of reconnecting it to the front portion.kareka replaced the damaged air hose and reconnected the train.the crew then conducted brake tests,restored the air pressure to the required level,and moved the train to a location blocking hawley street in the village,where they removed the rear car with the dragging equipment.the crew was then required by federal regulations to perform another air pressure test on the brake system.the crew was unable to restore the brake system air pressure to the required level on the rear of the train.kareka reinspected the train,checking for leaks in the brake system.a crew from another train assisted kareka in inspecting the brake system for leaks.
while the train continued to block the hawley street crossing,a metra commuter train arrived at the village station.the passengers from the metra train could not get to their cars because wisconsin central train was blocking access to the parking lot.the wisconsin central train was then separated to allow the passengers access to the parking lot.when the passengers cleared the tracks,the train was reconnected.however,the crew was still unable to restore the brake system air pressure in the rear portion of the train to the required level.
while kareka and other employees tried to correct the problem,another metra train arrived at the station.the crew again separated the train to allow metra passengers access to the parking lot.at that point,a wisconsin central dispatcher directed the crew to take the front portion of the train to schiller park.the crew verified that the front portion of the train had adequate air pressure and proceeded south to schiller park.the rear portion was later attached to another train and brought to schiller park.the parties stipulated that the train blocked the hawley street crossing for minutes.
after hearing closing arguments by the parties,the trial court asserted that if the crew had completed a visual inspection of the train before leaving lake villa there may have not been a problem.a visual inspection may have revealed the misaligned angle cock and could have prevented the subsequent problems with the train in the village.according to the court,a visual inspection of the train was within wisconsin central reasonable control.therefore,wisconsin central violated the ordinance because the circumstances resulting in obstruction of the hawley street crossing were within its reasonable control.the trial court further found that the village ordinance was not preempted by the frsa.accordingly,the trial court found wisconsin central guilty of violating the ordinance and imposed a fine of plus costs.
on appeal,wisconsin central argued that enforcement of the village ordinance is preempted by the frsa and by requiring a visual inspection of the train before leaving lake villa,the trial court imposed additional duties of inspection in an area of law preempted by the frsa.d at.the appellate court held that the village ordinance is preempted.d at.the appellate court,therefore,declined to address the trial court application of the ordinance to the facts of this case.d at.the appellate court reversed the trial court judgment and vacated the fine.d at.
we allowed the village petition for leave to appeal.a.we then allowed the illinois municipal league to file an amicus curiae brief in support of the village and the association of american railroads to file an amicus curiae brief in support of wisconsin central.
ii.analysis 
on appeal to this court,the village contends that its ordinance is not preempted by the frsa and the trial court did not err in finding that wisconsin central violated the ordinance because the cause of the obstruction was within wisconsin central reasonable control.the united states supreme court has stated that a preemption defense raises a threshold issue.sprietsma mercury marine,d.the court has,therefore,declined to address the merits or viability of underlying claims before considering preemption.sprietsma,at.at,d at.likewise,when a preemption issue has been raised in this court,we have addressed it first before proceeding to the merits of the parties specific claims.see kinkel cingular wireless,llc,stating further analysis of the enforceability of an arbitration clause would not be necessary if the plaintiff claim were preempted by federal law.accordingly,we will first address the parties preemption arguments.
the supremacy clause of the united states constitution provides that t his constitution,and the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,art.vi,cl.state law is preempted under the supremacy clause in three circumstances when the express language of a federal statute indicates an intent to preempt state law when the scope of a federal regulation is so pervasive that it implies an intent to occupy a field exclusively and when state law actually conflicts with federal law.english general electric,d.
the determination of whether state law is preempted turns on the intent of congress.wisconsin public intervenor mortier,d.when interpreting a federal statute pertaining to a subject traditionally governed by state law,courts are reluctant to find preemption unless congress preemptive intent is clear and manifest.csx transportation,easterwood,d,mortier,at.at,d at.whether a federal statute preempts a state or local enactment presents a question of law subject to de novo review.kinkel,at,citing schultz northeast illinois regional commuter.
congress enacted the frsa in to promote safety in every area of railroad operations and reduce accidents and incidents.emphasis added.the frsa grants the secretary of transportation the authority to prescribe regulations and issue orders for every area of railroad safety.a.the frsa explicitly directs the secretary of transportation to develop and implement solutions to safety problems at grade crossings.
the preemptive effect of regulations issued by the secretary of transportation is governed by an express preemption clause in section of the frsa.when a statute contains an express preemption clause,we must construe that provision with a focus on its plain language that necessarily bears the best evidence of congress intent.sprietsma,at.at,d at,quoting easterwood,at.at,d at.section provides that 
laws,regulations,and orders related to railroad safety and laws,regulations,and orders related to railroad security shall be nationally uniform to the extent practicable.a state may adopt or continue in force a law,regulation,or order related to railroad safety or security until the secretary of transportation with respect to railroad safety matters,or the secretary of homeland security with respect to railroad security matters,prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the subject matter of the state requirement.a state may adopt or continue in force an additional or more stringent law,regulation,or order related to railroad safety or security when the law,regulation,or order 
is necessary to eliminate or reduce an essentially local safety or security hazard 
is not incompatible with a law,regulation,or order of the united states government and 
does not unreasonably burden interstate commerce.supp.
by its terms,section applies only to laws,regulations,or orders related to railroad safety or security.supp.the phrase relating to has been given a broad meaning.easterwood,at.at,d at,citing morales trans world airlines,d.the supreme court has interpreted that phrase to mean having a connection with,or reference to,a certain subject matter.morales,at.at,d at.
the village has adopted by reference the provision in the illinois vehicle code code ilcs et west.mundelein municipal code.the ordinance at issue is set forth in section b of the code,providing that 
it is unlawful for a rail carrier to permit any train,railroad car or engine to obstruct public travel at a grade crossing for a period in excess of minutes,except where such train or railroad car is continuously moving or can not be moved by reason of circumstances over which the rail carrier has no reasonable control.ilcs b west.
the plain language of the ordinance applies exclusively to railroad operations,requiring rail carriers to prevent obstructions of highway grade crossings except in certain specified circumstances.section is entitled safety requirements for railroad operations.ilcs b west.the section,therefore,refers to railroad safety requirements.a connection with,or reference to,railroad safety is all that is required for application of section.see morales,at.at,d at.the village ordinance has the required connection with or reference to railroad safety and,therefore,it falls within the scope of section.
having determined that section applies,we must consider whether the secretary of transportation has issued regulations or orders that preempt the village ordinance.section dictates that to preempt state law,a federal regulation must cover the same subject matter,not merely touch upon or relate to that subject matter.norfolk southern ry.shanklin,d,citing easterwood,at.at,d at.the term cover is restrictive,indicating that preemption will be found only if federal regulations substantially subsume the subject matter of the relevant state law.easterwood,at.at,d at.the party advocating preemption has the burden of establishing the preemptive effect of regulations.easterwood,at.at,d at.
the preemption issue here depends on whether regulations issued by the secretary of transportation substantially subsume the subject matter of the village ordinance.the village asserts that the subject matter of its ordinance is the amount of time a standing train may obstruct a highway grade crossing.on the subject matter of a state law,the seventh circuit court of appeals has stated 
the subject matter of the state requirement is the safety concerns that the state law addresses.citation.generally,determining the safety concerns that a state or federal requirement is aimed at will necessarily involve some level of generalization that requires backing away somewhat from the specific provisions at issue.citation.otherwise a state law could be preempted only if there were an identical federal regulation,and,as we noted,easterwood teaches that this is not so.see at.d preemption found through series of related regulations and overall structure of the regulations,although no regulation directly addressed the state requirement see also burlington northern,at fra regulation permitting telemetry device rather than visual inspection preempted state law requiring trains to have a caboose because both were aimed at the safety concern of monitoring brakes and signals at the rear of the train.but with too much generalizing public safety or rail safety our analysis would be meaningless because all fra regulations cover those concerns.burlington northern santa fe ry.doyle,cir.
in a recent preemption case involving a statute,the pennsylvania supreme court rejected an argument similar to the one the village advances on the subject matter of its ordinance.see krentz consolidated.the plaintiffs
