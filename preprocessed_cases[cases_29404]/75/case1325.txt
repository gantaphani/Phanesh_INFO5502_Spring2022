on october,olga buenz was involved in a traffic accident that resulted in her death.twelve separate actions were filed by various plaintiffs and later consolidated.each action named china ocean shipping company americas,cosco,and frontline transportation company frontline as defendants.plaintiff john buenz,olga husband,filed a action alleging negligence on the part of defendants cosco,frontline,and vincente zepeda,frontline alleged employee and the driver of the that buenz alleges caused the accident.
in june,cosco filed a counterclaim against frontline and zepeda.count iv of this counterclaim sought a declaration that frontline be obligated,pursuant to express contractual terms set forth in an equipment interchange agreement,to indemnify cosco for any and all costs,expenses,damages,and liability in the buenz litigation.cosco moved for and was granted summary judgment on this count by the circuit court of cook county.
in addition to granting the motion for summary judgment,the court entered a written finding pursuant to rule a that there was no just reason to delay appeal or enforcement of the judgment.a.subsequently,the court specified that its order applied to all pending consolidated cases.it is undisputed that the meaning and legal effect of the equipment interchange agreement is identical in each case.
after its motion to reconsider was denied,frontline appealed.the appellate court affirmed and remanded.d.frontline then petitioned for and was allowed leave to appeal to this court pursuant to rule.
background 
john buenz complaint alleged that a operated by zepeda,a frontline employee,struck a minibus in which his wife olga was a passenger,causing her death.the complaint further alleged that cosco owned owned a leasehold on,maintained,controlled the trailer container which were part of the tractor trailer driven by zepeda.while the complaint alleged that frontline committed various negligent acts which caused the accident and the death of olga buenz,it also alleged that cosco committed several negligent acts that contributed to the accident.these acts and omissions included cosco permitting the tractor container to be used and operated when it knew or should have known that it was not in safe operating condition permitting the trailer to be used and operated when it knew or should have known that it was not equipped with proper brakes and failing to inspect and repair the trailer.
to defend against these claims,cosco relied on an equipment interchange agreement.this agreement dealt with the relationship between cosco and frontline regarding the use interchange of equipment.in relevant part,the agreement provided 
acquiring carrier defined as frontline responsibility and liability 
d.the acquiring carrier shall be responsible to the line defined as cosco for the performance of this agreement whether such equipment may be in the possession of itself or others,until return of the equipment to the line.
acquiring carrier shall indemnify the line against,and hold the line harmless for any and all claims,demands,actions,suits,proceedings,costs,expenses,damages,and liability,including without limitation attorney fees,arising out of,in connection with,or resulting from the possession,use,operation or returning of the equipment during all periods when the equipment shall be out of the possession of the line.
the parties agree that the interchange agreement described above was in full force and effect at the time of the collision at issue in this case.moreover,there is no dispute that frontline is in the business of providing freight transportation by interstate trucks,including.additionally,frontline has admitted that it had a contractual relationship with zepeda,the driver of the involved in the accident.
frontline contends that cosco is not entitled to indemnification based upon the interchange agreement.specifically,frontline asserts that the phrase any and all,as used in the interchange agreement,is neither explicit nor clear enough to signify the parties intention that frontline indemnify cosco for claims resulting from cosco own negligence.additionally,frontline argues that the negligence claims filed against cosco do not fall within the scope of the indemnity provision because they relate to periods in which the equipment was in,rather than out,of the possession of cosco.
cosco responds that the facts,viewed in conjunction with the explicit language of the interchange agreement,establish as a matter of law that in the underlying litigation frontline is obligated to indemnify and hold cosco harmless for any and all costs,expenses,damages,and liability,including attorney fees.cosco argues that the phrase any and all contained in the interchange agreement establishes the parties intent that cosco be indemnified even against claims arising out of its own negligence.cosco asserts that frontline argument that the negligence claims filed against it do not fall within the scope of the indemnity provision has been forfeited,as it was not raised in frontline petition for leave to appeal.barring forfeiture,cosco asserts that the negligence claims against it do fall within the scope of the conduct described in the indemnity provision.
as noted,frontline asserts that the appellate court improperly affirmed the circuit court grant of cosco motion for summary judgment and subsequent denial of frontline motion to reconsider.this court reviews the grant of summary judgment de novo.forsythe clark usa.reviewing a summary judgment disposition,this court construes all evidence strictly against the movant and liberally in favor of the nonmoving party.forsythe,at.
an indemnity agreement is a contract and is subject to contract interpretation rules.virginia surety northern insurance of new york.the cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to discern the parties intent from the contract language.virginia surety,at.where the contract language is unambiguous,it should be given its plain and ordinary meaning.virginia surety,at.
construction of the equipment interchange agreement 
this court has previously considered whether an indemnity agreement provided indemnification for an indemnitee own negligence.in westinghouse electric elevator lasalle monroe building,an elevator repair company employee was hit by a falling elevator and died.it was conceded that the injury and death were due to the negligence of the building owner employee negligence.the elevator repair company made payments pursuant to the workers compensation act and then sued the building owner to recover the amount paid based on the owner negligence.the parties indemnity contract provided 
the contractor repair further agrees to indemnify and hold the owner,the owner employees and agents,the architects and engineers,and the city of chicago,wholly harmless from any damages,claims,demands or suit by any person or persons arising out of any acts or omissions by the contractor,his agents,servants or employees in the course of any work done in connection with any of the matters set out in these specifications,and the contractor shall carry at his own expense insurance in a company satisfactory to the owner to cover the aforesaid liabilities.westinghouse electric,at.
construing the above language,both the trial and appellate courts found in favor of the elevator repair company.this court affirmed,holding that the contract language was insufficient to indemnify the for the own negligence.
the language of the contract at issue in westinghouse supports this conclusion.the repair agrees to indemnify and hold the owners wholly harmless from any damages arising out of any acts or omissions by the contractor repair.westinghouse electric,at.this clearly refers to and provides indemnity for acts or omissions by the repair.because the negligence at issue in westinghouse was that of the owner,then,it could not be considered an act or omission by the repair company and the indemnity contract could not apply.
this court recognized,however,that in certain circumstances a contract could indemnify a person for that person own negligence.we stated that i t is quite generally held that an indemnity contract will not be construed as indemnifying one against his own negligence,unless such a construction is required by clear and explicit language of the contract citations or such intention is expressed in unequivocal terms.westinghouse electric,at.we then held that,under the facts of westinghouse,to adopt a construction of the contract that would provide indemnity for the would impose on the contractor repair company the duty to indemnify against injuries entirely without his control,and such should not be adopted in the absence of clear language in the contract including injuries arising from the negligence of the owner own servants.westinghouse electric,at.
this court has had occasion to review other contracts that were purported to indemnify an indemnitee for its own negligence.tatar maxon construction,no indemnity for indemnitee own negligence where indemnity clause covered all expenses,claims,suits,or judgments by reason of,arising out of,or connected with,accidents,injuries,or damages,which may occur upon or about the subcontractor work zadak cannon,no indemnity for indemnitee own negligence where language referred to claims arising out of any such work such work being that performed by indemnitor employees under the contract schek chicago transit authority,providing indemnity for indemnitee own negligence where language stated that indemnitor shall indemnify and save harmless chicago transit authority indemnitee from all claims for any such loss,damage,injury or death,whether caused by the negligence of licensor,chicago transit authority,their agents or employees,or otherwise we have also noted,however,that it serve s no useful purpose to attempt to analyze or reconcile the numerous cases interpreting indemnity clauses since each individual case depends upon the particular language used and the factual setting of the case.zadak,at.while these cases,and the others cited below,do not involve the precise language in this case,they do provide guidance for our analysis of the similar language at issue here.
frontline asserts that a review of case law from various appellate districts establishes that the interchange agreement between cosco and frontline does not provide cosco indemnity from its own negligence.chiefly,frontline relies upon karsner lechters illinois,d.frontline acknowledges that the appellate court in this case declined to follow karsner,but frontline contends that the language of the indemnification provision in karsner is similar to the language of the indemnification provision at issue in this case.
in karsner,the plaintiff filed an action against the defendants for injuries he sustained while unloading a trailer containing the defendants merchandise.karsner,d at.the plaintiff claimed that the defendants had negligently loaded the trailer such that when he delivered and unloaded the trailer he was injured.karsner,d at.the defendants filed a indemnity action against the plaintiff employer and its parent company collectively,the employer.karsner,d at.the defendants and the employer had a contract which contained the following provision 
carrier the employer shall indemnify and hold lechters a defendant harmless from and against any and all claims,actions sic damages,liability and expense,including attorneys fees,in connection with loss of life,personal injury,damage to property arising from or out of the,transportation and delivery of the property of lechters by carrier,and the use of any motor vehicle or other equipment by carrier in connection therewith.karsner,d at.
like the agreement in this case,the agreement in karsner broadly provided indemnity from and against any and all claims.
the karsner court,construing the provision quoted above,found that even though the contract states that navajo the employer shall indemnify and hold lechters harmless from and against any and all claims,actions sic damages,liability and expense,this language is insufficient to give lechters indemnity for its own negligence.karsner,d at.supporting its position,the karsner court pointed to this court decision in westinghouse as well as another appellate decision,mcniff millard maintenance service,d.additionally,the karsner court indicated a concern that any interpretation which required the employer to indemnify the defendants for the defendants own negligence would contravene established public policy.
in citing westinghouse,the karsner court pointed out that westinghouse provid ed that the language hold harmless from any damages,claims,demands or suit by any person,arising out of any acts or omissions was not clear and specific language rendering the subcontractor liable for the general contractor own negligence.karsner,d at.what the karsner court did not point out,however,was that the indemnity agreement in westinghouse contained language in addition to that expressed directly above.the agreement in westinghouse,more fully expressed,stated that the indemnitor agrees to indemnify and hold the owner wholly harmless from any damages arising out of any acts or omissions by the contractor indemnitor.emphasis added.westinghouse electric,at.this limiting language clearly indicates that the agreement provided indemnity only for acts or omissions by the indemnitor.
in citing mcniff,the karsner court pointed out that mcniff provid ed that the phrase,indemnify from and against any and all liabilities was insufficient to provide indemnification for the indemnitee own negligence.karsner,d at.the indemnification agreement in mcniff also provided,however,that the indemnification covered any and all claims relating to allegedly or actually arising out of or incidental to the work,including,without limiting the foregoing,all acts and omissions of the officers,employees and agents of contractor the indemnitor or any of its subcontractors.mcniff,d at.the mcniff court finding,then,is specifically supported by limiting language within the contract.
the above analysis makes evident that the karsner court reliance on westinghouse and mcniff is misplaced.the indemnification language in westinghouse is specifically limited to any and all claims arising out of or in connection with the acts or omissions of the indemnitor just as the indemnification language in mcniff is specifically limited to any and all claims arising out of what the mcniff court considered to be the indemnitor work.in karsner,by contrast,no limiting language is evident,as the contract at issue provided that the the indemnitor shall indemnify and hold the indemnitee harmless from and against any and all claims arising from or out of the,transportation and delivery of the property of the indemnitee by the indemnitor,and the use of any motor vehicle or other equipment by the indemnitor in connection therewith.karsner,d at.focusing on this language alone,the indemnitee in karsner was entitled to indemnification,even for its own negligence,as the injury at issue arose from the delivery of the indemnitee property by the indemnitor.this was not,however,the karsner court holding.
frontline points to other cases which it claims have held,like karsner,that the inclusion of the phrase any and all within an indemnification clause is insufficient to indemnify an indemnitee for its own negligence.see,blackshare banfield,d,hankins pekin insurance,d.a closer inspection of blackshare and hankins reveals,however,just as a closer inspection of westinghouse and mcniff revealed,that these cases do not stand for that proposition.as in westinghouse and mcniff,the language of the indemnification agreements in blackshare and hankins contained limiting language expressly restricting indemnification liability.
in blackshare,a power cooperative brought an indemnification action against an electrical contractor based upon a written contract.blackshare,d.the contract provided that the c ontractor shall defend and indemnify and save owner and all of owner employees harmless from any and all claims arising or alleged to arise from personal injuries,including death,or damage to property,occurring during the performance of the work and due to the negligent acts or omissions of the contractor.see blackshare,d at.the blackshare court found crit
