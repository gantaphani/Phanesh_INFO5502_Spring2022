if a trial court grants a motion to quash service of summons due to lack of personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant,does the court have jurisdiction thereafter to rule upon that defendant motion for attorney fees we conclude that it does.
background 
plaintiffs bryan and shelley shisler are california residents.in or about june,plaintiffs saw a car they liked on a web site maintained by defendant sanfer sports cars,a florida corporation.plaintiffs bought the car and had it shipped to california from defendant place of business in florida.when the car arrived,plaintiffs found it was not what they had expected.they sued defendant in california.plaintiffs complaint contained causes of action for fraud,violation of the california consumers legal remedies act clra,et,and violation of the florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act fdutpa.the complaint specified that the action will be governed by florida substantive law.
defendant moved to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction and the trial court granted the motion.after plaintiffs unsuccessfully appealed that order see shisler sanfer sports cars,th,d,defendant,appearing specially,filed a motion for attorney fees under the clra and the fdutpa.the trial court granted that motion on may,awarding defendant attorney fees of.
on june,plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the attorney fees order.plaintiffs argued that since the trial court lacked jurisdiction over defendant the court had no jurisdiction to rule on defendant attorney fees motion,making the attorney fees order void on its face.the trial court rejected the argument.in an order dated august,the trial court ruled that the motion was actually an untimely motion for reconsideration of the attorney fees order and,in any event,that the court did have jurisdiction to make the fee award.the trial court order did not elaborate upon either conclusion.plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on september.
plaintiffs make two arguments on appeal the trial court lacked jurisdiction to make the attorney fees order and defendant was not entitled to attorney fees under either the clra or the fdutpa.in response,defendant argues,among other things,that plaintiffs motion to vacate was really a motion for reconsideration and,as such,is not appealable.morton wagner th,d.
we conclude that plaintiffs have timely appealed from appealable orders.we reject plaintiffs arguments on the merits and affirm the orders.
ii.appealability 
the threshold question is whether plaintiffs have appealed from an appealable order.we disagree with defendant argument that plaintiffs motion to vacate should be characterized as a nonappealable motion for reconsideration.plaintiffs did not style their motion as one for reconsideration.rather,plaintiffs specified that the motion was brought pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision d section,subdivision d allows for a motion to set aside any void judgment or order.since plaintiffs specified that the motion was a motion to vacate under section,subdivision d and argued only that the attorney fees order was void on its face,the motion is properly considered a motion to vacate.an order denying a statutory motion to vacate under section is appealable.generale bank nederland eyes of the beholder th,d.similarly,an order denying a motion to vacate a void judgment is also appealable.carlson eassa th,d carr kamins th,d.since a judgment or order that is void on its face is subject to attack at any time sindler brennan th,d,plaintiffs motion was timely.furthermore,since it was filed within the time allowed for appeal from the attorney fees order,plaintiffs have preserved their right to challenge the substance of that order as well.cal.rules of court,rule c.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
the question of a trial court jurisdiction is a pure question of law as is the determination of the legal basis for an award of attorney fees.accordingly,both issues are subject to our independent review.conservatorship of kane th,d ghirardo antonioli cal th,d,sessions payroll management,noble construction th,d.
jurisdiction to entertain the attorney fees motion 
plaintiffs argue that once a motion to quash is granted,the moving party can not recover fees and costs since the court no longer has jurisdiction to review the merits of the underlying action.it is true that once a motion to quash is granted the court may not review the merits of the underlying action,at least as far as they pertain to the defendant that prevailed on the motion to quash.see nelson horvath d.bergan bergan d.but it does not necessarily follow that the lack of power to rule on the merits of the lawsuit deprives the trial court of jurisdiction to rule upon a collateral motion for attorney fees.gutting globe indemnity,upon which plaintiffs rely,is not to the contrary.in gutting,the plaintiff case was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award costs since it had no power to rule at all.ibid.the present case concerns personal jurisdiction,not subject matter jurisdiction.
the absence of personal jurisdiction is much different than the absence of subject matter jurisdiction.the lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a jurisdictional defect of the fundamental type.a trial court lacks jurisdiction in the fundamental sense where there is an entire absence of power to hear or determine the case.abelleira district court of appeal cal d.p ersonal jurisdiction relates to the power to bind a particular party,and depends on the party presence,contacts,or other conduct within the forum state.donaldson national marine,cal th,d.
there is no dispute that the trial court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of plaintiffs complaint.the sole jurisdictional issue involved the power of the courts in california to make an order or enter a judgment that would be binding upon this florida defendant.plaintiffs argue that resolution of that issue in favor of defendant deprived the court of the power to entertain defendant motion for fees.but plaintiffs offer no authority to support the argument.indeed,no case of which we are aware has expressly considered the jurisdictional question plaintiffs have raised here.one appellate court has recently affirmed an award of attorney fees to a defendant who had successfully moved to quash service for lack of personal jurisdiction.profit concepts management,griffith th,d.the holding implicitly recognized that the trial court had jurisdiction to make that order but the issue was not explicitly considered.
defendant argues that principles of fairness warrant the exercise of jurisdiction over attorney fees motions such as the one before us.defendant argument certainly has intuitive appeal.it seems eminently unfair to allow a plaintiff to sue an defendant in california,force that defendant to the expense required to quash service,then preclude that defendant from collecting attorney fees that would be available had the defendant prevailed on the merits of the case.in our view,a defendant does not forfeit a collateral right to attorney fees by choosing to assert the right to challenge the court in personam jurisdiction.
there is no case directly contrary to our view.an analogous case is frank annino sons construction,mcarthur restaurants,d.frank annino,in which the plaintiffs had dismissed the defendant from the case just before the defendant summary judgment motion was to be heard.the trial court granted the defendant subsequent motion for sanctions under section,rejecting the plaintiffs argument that the defendant was no longer a party and could not file a motion for sanctions.the appellate court held that,although the general rule is that once a party is dismissed from an action the court lacks jurisdiction to conduct any further proceedings as to him,courts have carved out a number of exceptions to this rule in order to give meaning and effect to a former party statutory rights.even after a party is dismissed from the action he may still have collateral statutory rights which the court must determine and enforce.these include the right to statutory costs and attorneys fees and th
