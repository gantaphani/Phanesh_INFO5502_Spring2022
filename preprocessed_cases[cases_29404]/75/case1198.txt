the limousine in this case,while perhaps not up to the standards of stephen king christine,certainly did seem to be possessed.park city services,doing business as ferraro limousine services ferraro,leased it for use in its business in dallas,texas.the limousine was covered by an express limited warranty issued by ford motor company,ford.however,despite the best repair efforts of a highly regarded dallas ford dealership,the rear suspension kept collapsing,the engine kept overheating,and the air conditioner kept blowing hot air.the cooling fan would either stay on when it was not needed or fail to turn on when it was.whenever the limousine was in for repairs,ferraro lost income.some breakdowns left ferraro customers stranded,often in sweltering summer heat.ultimately,the limousine engine simply burst into flames.
ferraro filed this action against ford,asserting a cause of action under the consumer warranty act the act,or the act,et and a cause of action for breach of warranty.a jury awarded the full amount of damages ferraro sought,representing in compensatory damages,trebled pursuant to the act.the trial court awarded an additional in costs,including attorney fees,also pursuant to the act.
ford appeals,contending 
ferraro did not qualify for relief under the act because 
a.it never presented the limousine for repair in california.
b.at all relevant times,a amendment extending the act to vehicles used primarily for business purposes did not yet apply.
c.the act has never applied to a vehicle used primarily for business purposes when,as here,the buyer or lessee has not registered it or any other vehicles in california.
ferraro was not entitled to recover consequential damages,because the warranty excluded them.
there was insufficient evidence to support certain items of damages that the jury awarded.
in the published portion of this opinion,we will hold that a vehicle is not within the scope of the act if it is used primarily for business purposes,it is not registered in california,and no other vehicles are registered to the plaintiff in california.ferraro concedes that no vehicles have ever been registered to it in california.accordingly,it can not recover on a act theory.we need not address ford other contentions concerning the scope of the act.
in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we will hold that ferraro was not entitled to recover consequential damages on a breach of warranty theory.moreover,on this record,we can not tell how much the jury would have awarded ferraro on a breach of warranty theory if it had been told that it could not award consequential damages.accordingly,we must reverse.we need not address the sufficiency of the evidence of the damages.
factual background 
timothy and teresa ferraro lived in dallas,texas.through their closely held texas corporation,park city services,they operated a successful valet parking business.in,they decided to have the corporation go into the limousine business,under the name of ferraro limousine services.
on october,ferraro ordered a limousine from tiffany coachworks tiffany.tiffany purchased a lincoln town car and modified it into a stretch limousine.federated capital services federated then purchased the limousine and leased it back to ferraro.
because tiffany was authorized by ford to modify ford vehicles,the limousine came with a ford limited warranty good for three years or miles.however,the warranty did not cover parts installed by tiffany.one of the limitations in the warranty was that ford and your dealer are not responsible for any time that you lose,for any inconvenience that you might be caused,for the loss of your transportation,or for any other incidental or consequential damages you may have.
in january,the ferraros flew out to california,picked up the limousine,and drove it back to dallas.presumably ferraro registered it in texas.ferraro concedes that it has never had any vehicle registered in california.
the limousine required repairs at least times during the warranty period.repeatedly,the engine would overheat the air conditioner would blow hot air and the relay switch for the cooling fan which was crucial to both the engine cooling system and the air conditioner would either fuse together,so that the fan would keep running until the battery was dead,or blow out,so that the fan would not run at all.there were also repeated problems with the rear suspension and the electrical system.a handful of the repairs were attributable to tiffany rather than ford however,these were largely cosmetic,involving such matters as a ripped vinyl top,a loose ceiling mirror,and leaking window gaskets.all of the repairs were done by the same authorized ford dealership in dallas except the very first,which was done by a different authorized ford dealership in dallas.
every time ferraro had to take the limousine in for repair,it lost jobs it could otherwise have performed.sometimes,the limousine would break down in the middle of a job,leaving ferraro clients stranded.on november,ferraro,through its attorney,gave ford notice that it was seeking repurchase and restitution under the act.ford did not respond.after the warranty expired,in january,the limousine continued to need frequent repairs,which ferraro now had to pay for itself.
on september,a young man hired the limousine to serve as the setting for his proposal of marriage to his girlfriend.ferraro picked the couple up at a park.the limousine had champagne and roses and was decorated with rose petals.once inside the limousine,the young man proposed,and the young lady accepted his proposal.just as they were hugging,flames started coming out of the hood.
all three occupants escaped unscathed.a year later,ferraro drove the couple to their wedding gratis.the limousine,however,required extensive repair.ferraro bought it from federated for,then spent approximately to put it back in working order.according to ferraro expert witness,the fire was caused by a defect in the electrical supply to the cooling same defect that had been causing all of the other overheating,air conditioning,and cooling fan problems.
the limousine as a new motor vehicle within the meaning of the act 
ford contends ferraro is not entitled to relief under the act,for three reasons.first,it argues that the act requires the plaintiff to deliver nonconforming goods to the manufacturer service and repair facility within this state,subd.c,but ferraro never brought the limousine to california for repairs.second,it argues that an amendment in,which made the act applicable to motor vehicles used primarily for business purposes,does not or constitutionally can not apply here.third,it argues that,even under the amendment,the act has never applied to a vehicle used for business purposes if the business does not have any motor vehicles registered in california.
we agree with ford third contention.accordingly,we do not discuss either of the first two.
additional factual and procedural background.
ford brought a motion in limine to bifurcate and try first,without a jury,the issue of whether plaintiff vehicle is eligible for relief according to the motion,the limousine had been shipped to texas,where ferraro had used it primarily for business purposes.it had been registered in texas and not in california.all warranty repairs had been performed in texas it had never been serviced in california.
ferraro opposed the motion on procedural grounds,calling it a summary adjudication motion in disguise.however,it also opposed it on the merits.it did not dispute any of ford asserted facts it simply added that it had purchased the limousine in california and that it owned fewer than five vehicles,all registered in texas.
the trial court granted the motion to bifurcate.however,it immediately proceeded to rule,without taking any additional evidence,that the act did apply.
after the trial,ford filed both a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov and a motion for new trial,arguing in both that ferraro was not entitled to relief under the act.the trial court denied both motions.it explained i nsofar as this court did not rule thereon when deciding defendant motion to bifurcate,defendant should have brought the issue of the applicability of to these facts to the attention of the court and plaintiff in noticed and potentially dispositive motions before the eve of trial,and further should have requested instructions on the issue.it did neither.this court has no reason to change its previous ruling that the act as it read on the date this complaint was filed is the law for this case.

our fundamental task in interpreting a statute is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.we first examine the statutory language,giving it a plain and commonsense meaning.we do not examine that language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.if the language is clear,courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intend.if the statutory language permits more than o
