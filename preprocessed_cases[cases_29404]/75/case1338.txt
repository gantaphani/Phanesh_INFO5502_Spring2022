ford motor company ford appeals the judgment of the superior court affirming the determination by the director of revenue the director that the director may lawfully impose an unapportioned tax on ford receipts from sales of motor vehicles sold to independent dealerships located in delaware.
ford makes four arguments on appeal.first,it contends that the superior court erred in holding that the wholesalers gross receipts tax the wholesalers tax did not violate the commerce clause of the united states constitution as applied to ford unapportioned gross receipts.second,ford contends that under the superior court prior decision in dial director of revenue the location of where title and ownership of the goods are transferred determines whether the wholesalers tax is fairly apportioned with respect to receipts from those goods.third,it contends that the superior court erred in holding that the wholesalers tax law permits the taxation of receipts from sales of vehicles physically delivered outside delaware.fourth,it contends that it is entitled to interest on any refund of the wholesalers tax.we find no merit in ford first three arguments,thereby rendering its fourth argument moot.accordingly,we affirm.
factual background 
ford is a delaware corporation,headquartered in michigan,that manufacturers and sells motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts.all of ford manufacturing activity takes place outside of delaware ford then sells its vehicles and parts to independent dealers for resale to retail customers.there are eleven dealerships located within delaware which purchase ford vehicles along with related products and services.
ford engages in several practices designed to boost its sales to the independent dealers.for each dealership,ford develops a sales plan based on ford production and the dealer expected needs.in addition,ford district and zone managers with offices in new jersey and virginia make frequent visits to dealers in delaware to persuade these dealers to commit to buying certain models and quantities of ford vehicles.ford also enters into with each dealer a sales and service agreement that imposes requirements on the dealers conduct of business that are designed to enhance the ford brand and increase sales of vehicles and parts.these requirements include certain sales practices and inventory guidelines,the performance of warranty and other service work on ford vehicles,the display of ford signage,and the usage of ford trademarks.ford also engages in its own extensive nationwide advertising campaigns,sales,and promotional activities,in addition to contributing to the local dealers advertising funds.
generally,ford delivers vehicles to the dealers by rail from the assembly plant to a mixing center for sorting,then by rail to destination ramps for further sorting,then by truck to dealers.a vehicle is assembled at one of eighteen assembly plants,all of which are located outside delaware.once assembled,it is moved to a drop zone,which is usually near the assembly plant.from there,an employee of one of the rail or motor carriers inspects and drives the vehicle through what is referred to as the gate.it is at this gate release that the parties have stipulated title to the vehicles passes from ford to the dealers to which they are to be delivered.additionally,gate release is the point at which revenue from the sale is attributed to ford,the vehicle appears in the dealer inventory,and the dealer has the right to sell the vehicle.following gate release,vehicles destined for delaware dealers travel to a mixing center in ohio and then to destination ramps located in either maryland or pennsylvania.
ford contracts with various rail and motor carriers to advance the vehicles along this logistical chain,ultimately leading to the purchasing dealer.ford covers the cost of shipping and controls the arrangements made with the carriers.ford also reimburses its dealers for any damage in transitu and carries insurance to cover the cost of repair.in the infrequent event that the damage exceeds,ford repurchases the vehicle from the dealer and either disposes of it or repairs it to be sold as a used vehicle.
between january and october,ford paid a delaware wholesaler tax of on sales of products that were shipped to locations in delaware.ford timely applied for a refund of the tax paid,which the appellate director of revenue denied on may.ford timely filed a protest of the denial with the director under,which the director also denied.ford then filed an administrative appeal which was removed to the superior court pursuant to.on february.the superior court held a bench trial and issued an opinion and order affirming the director denial of ford claim,holding that there was substantial evidence to support the director conclusion that ford was subject to the wholesalers tax and that the wholesalers tax,as applied to ford,did not violate the commerce clause this appeal followed.
standard of review 
we review a trial court construction of a statute de novo we also review an administrative agency interpretation of the law de novo.factual findings of an administrative agency are reviewed to determine whether the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence on the record 
the wholesalers tax requires any entity engaged in business in this state as a wholesaler to pay a license fee and a tax on the aggregate gross receipts attributable to sales of tangible personal property physically delivered within this state gross receipts are defined as total consideration received from sales of tangible personal property physically delivered within this state to the purchaser or purchaser agent under the statute,the determinative factor is the destination to which the seller delivers or causes delivery by common carrier of goods to the purchaser,either inside or outside delaware,not the contractually agreed upon location of title passage ford does not contest that it is a wholesaler or that it receives consideration from the sale of goods ultimately delivered to customers in this state instead it argues that the wholesalers tax is unconstitutional.
the commerce clause analysis 
ford contends that the wholesalers tax,as applied to the proceeds of its sales where title to the product passes outside delaware before being physically delivered to dealers in delaware,violates article i,of the united states constitution the commerce clause specifically,ford argues the tax violates the negative or dormant aspect of the commerce clause that denies the states the power to exact more than their fair share from interstate commerce than would be commensurate with the burden imposed by that activity 
in complete auto transit,brady the united states supreme court laid out a pragmatic approach for applying the dormant commerce clause to a state taxation of interstate commerce.a state tax can be sustained against a commerce clause challenge where it i is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state,ii is fairly apportioned,iii does not discriminate against interstate commerce,and iv is fairly related to the services provided by the state.the test is designed to ensure that those engaged in interstate commerce pay their fair share of the state tax burden on appeal,ford does not contest the superior court determination that the first and fourth requirements of the test are satisfied.at issue is whether the wholesalers tax is fairly apportioned and whether it discriminates against interstate commerce.
the wholesalers tax is fairly apportioned.
a fairly apportioned tax ensure s that each state taxes only its fair share of an interstate transaction.in order for a tax to be fairly apportioned,it must be apportioned in a way that is both internally and externally consistent.internal consistency is preserved when the imposition of a tax identical to the one in question by every other state would add no burden to interstate commerce that intrastate commerce would not also bear external consistency,on the other hand,looks not to the logical consequences of cloning,but to the economic justification for the state claim upon the value taxed,to discover whether a state tax
