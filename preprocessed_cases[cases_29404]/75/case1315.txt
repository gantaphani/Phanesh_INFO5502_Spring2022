on december,we granted ford motion for rehearing.we withdraw our opinion dated july,and substitute the following in its place.
in this case,we determine whether the texas motor vehicle board has exclusive jurisdiction over a prospective car dealership transferees claims that raise an issue about how to construe the texas motor vehicle commission code we conclude the board has exclusive jurisdiction to resolve only those claims and issues the code governs.moreover,we conclude that this exclusive jurisdiction does not extend to the prospective transferees claims here,and thus,they do not have to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing their claims in the trial court.instead,because of the board special expertise in interpreting the code,the trial court should abate the prospective transferees tortious interference and declaratory judgment claims so the board may exercise its primary jurisdiction to determine the code construction issue raised with those claims.we further conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by entering a temporary injunction.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
martin graf is the sole shareholder of graf ford,lincoln,mercury,a dealership in del rio,texas.the dealership agreement with ford provides that if graf ford proposes to transfer the dealership,ford shall have a right of first refusal to purchase the dealership on the same terms and conditions that the proposed buyer agreed to,regardless of whether the proposed buyer is qualified to be a dealer.a ford representative testified that this provision purpose,and the purpose of similar provisions in other standard ford dealership agreements,is to be able to put into business dealers who ford feels are qualified whenever ford has the opportunity.
in,hanan and gil butnaru contracted with graf to buy the graf dealership.they also contracted separately to buy the real property upon which the dealership was located.graf and barton owned the property and executed that contract.graf told the butnarus about ford right of first refusal.additionally,both agreements were expressly conditioned upon approval by ford of hanan butnaru as a sic authorized sales and service dealer and warranted that neither agreement conflicted with any prior agreement to which graf or barton were parties.
in september,graf told ford that he intended to sell the dealership to the butnarus.the butnarus then filed a prospective dealer application with ford,seeking approval as an authorized dealer.a month later,ford informed graf that it intended to exercise its right of first refusal and offered to pay the butnarus reasonable expenses incurred in negotiating the purchase and sale agreements.on the same day,ford assigned its right of first refusal to an existing ford dealer.ford and graf agreed that ford would indemnify graf against damages arising from ford exercising its right of first refusal and that graf would cooperate with ford in defending any action challenging the right.
anticipating their breaching the purchase and sale agreements,the butnarus sued graf,graf ford,and barton for breach of those agreements.the butnarus also sued ford for tortiously interfering with the agreements.they alleged ford tortiously interfered because ford right of first refusal violates a code provision that prohibits a manufacturer from denying or preventing a dealership transfer to a qualified applicant.see.stat,b c,b.thus,the butnarus sought a declaration that ford right of first refusal was unenforceable and a declaration about the parties rights and obligations under the agreements.finally,the butnarus requested a temporary injunction to prevent ford or its assignees from exercising its right of first refusal during the suit.ford opposed this request and filed a plea to the jurisdiction.ford argued that the board has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a manufacturer has violated the code provisions.the trial court denied ford plea and granted the injunction.
ford sought interlocutory review of the trial court temporary injunction.see at.the court of appeals first noted that the legislature did not confer any rights on prospective transferees under the code to seek relief for the code violation the butnarus allege.then,the court of appeals held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the butnarus claims,to the extent their claims are based on violations of the code,because the code grants the board exclusive jurisdiction over alleged code violations.at.the court also held that the code does not violate the texas constitution open courts provision,which prohibits the legislature from unreasonably abrogating claims.the court explained that the code merely confers new statutory rights on motor vehicle dealers and leaves all others in the same position they previously occupied.at.therefore,the court concluded that the butnarus can sue ford for tortious interference with contract,breach of contract,and declaratory relief.they simply can not base those causes of action on code violations at.the court of appeals then remanded the claims not based on code violations and,holding that the butnarus did not establish an inadequate legal remedy,dissolved the trial court temporary injunction.at.
the butnarus petitioned this court to review the court of appeals opinion.typically,jurisdiction over an order granting or denying a temporary injunction is final in the courts of appeals.see.gov t code b.however,because the court of appeals decision here conflicts with another court of appeals decision,this court has jurisdiction.see.gov t code c.specifically,the court of appeals holding that the code does not violate the texas constitution open courts provision conflicts with david mcdavid nissan,subaru,affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded on rehearing.in david mcdavid nissan,the court of appeals held that the code abrogated the plaintiff claims without reasonably substituting another remedy and thus contravened the open courts provision.at.we granted the butnarus petition,as well as the petition in david mcdavid nissan,to resolve this conflict.
at the time the trial courts and courts of appeals here and in david mcdavid nissan determined whether the board had exclusive jurisdiction,section of the code provided 
a the board has the general and original power and jurisdiction to regulate all aspects of the distribution,sale,and leasing of motor vehicles and to do all things,whether specifically designated in this act or implied herein,or necessary or convenient to the exercise of this power and jurisdiction,including the original jurisdiction to determine questions of its own jurisdiction.in addition to the other duties placed on the board by this act,the board shall enforce and administer the terms of chapter,transportation code.
b unless otherwise specifically provided by texas law not in conflict with the terms of this act,all aspects of the distribution and sale of motor vehicles shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of this act.
stat,vernon supp,amended by act of may,ch.laws.
in our original opinions in this case and in david mcdavid nissan,we concluded that this provision granted the board over code issues and claims.moreover,we concluded that section b does not grant the board exclusive jurisdiction because,by its plain language,that subsection only establishes that the code governs this area of law and trumps other laws if they conflict with the code.
however,only weeks before we issued our opinions,the legislature amended section a to provide 
a the board has the exclusive,original jurisdiction to regulate those aspects of the distribution,sale,and leasing of motor vehicles as governed by this act and to do all things,whether specifically designated in this act or implied herein,or necessary or convenient to the exercise of this power and jurisdiction,including the original jurisdiction to determine questions of its own jurisdiction.
stat,a emphasis added.the legislature made this amendment effective immediately after receiving the necessary votes,which occurred on may.see act of may,ch.laws.the legislature amendment did not change section b.
today,we determine whether section current or former version applies,whether the applicable provision grants the board exclusive jurisdiction and how this affects the trial court jurisdiction here,and whether the trial court abused its discretion by issuing a temporary injunction.
ii.applicable law 
david mcdavid nissan.retroactive application of section 
today,in david mcdavid nissan,we held that section current version constitutionally retroactively applied to the pending claims a licensed motor vehicle dealer had raised against a manufacturer.david mcdavid nissan,at.we explained that this jurisdictional provision is procedural and remedial and did not affect a vested right.david mcdavid nissan,at citing landgraf usi film.baker hughes,keco,r d,city of tyler likes,ex parte abell,mccain yost,middleton texas power light,blonstein blonstein,dist,writ denied southwestern bell.city of kountze,no writ.
exclusive versus primary jurisdiction 
furthermore,in david mcdavid nissan,we explained the significant differences between the primary and exclusive jurisdiction doctrines.david mcdavid nissan,at.we held that,unlike its former version,section a current version expressly confers exclusive jurisdiction on the board to initially determine issues or claims that the code governs.david mcdavid nissan,at.we based our decision on the provision plain language,and the legislature intent when it amended the provision to include the express exclusive jurisdiction language.david mcdavid nissan,at.citing cash am.int l bennett,continental coffee prods.cazarez,senate comm.on state affairs,bill analysis.
open courts challenge 
in david mcdavid nissan,we also concluded that,as applied to the motor vehicle dealer in that case,the code did not violate the texas constitution open courts provision.david mcdavid nissan,at see also.const.we explained that the board exclusive jurisdiction over issues and claims the code matters derived from the code and not the common not abrogate any of the motor vehicle dealer rights.david mcdavid nissan,at citing texas ass of bus.texas air control.
temporary injunctions 
a temporary injunction purpose is to preserve the status quo of the litigation subject matter pending a trial on the merits.walling metcalfe,electronic data.powell,no writ.a temporary injunction is an extraordinary remedy and does not issue as a matter of right.walling,at.to obtain a temporary injunction,the applicant must plead and prove three specific elements a cause of action against the defendant a probable right to the relief sought and a probable,imminent,and irreparable injury in the interim.walling,at sun oil whitaker.an injury is irreparable if the injured party can not be adequately compensated in damages or if the damages can not be measured by any certain pecuniary standard.canteen republic of,no writ.
whether to grant or deny a temporary injunction is within the trial court sound discretion.walling,at state walker.a reviewing court should reverse an order granting injunctive relief only if the trial court abused that discretion.walling,at walker,at.the reviewing court must not substitute its judgment for the trial court judgment unless the trial court action was so arbitrary that it exceeded the bounds of reasonable discretion.johnson fourth of appeals,davis huey.
iii.analysis 
whether amended section retroactively applies 
in david mcdavid nissan,we concluded that section a,a jurisdictional provision,is a procedural and remedial statute that applied retroactively because it did not affect a vested right in that case.see david mcdavid nissan,at citing landgraf,at.likes,at abell,at phil pierce watkins,middleton,at blonstein,at city of kountze,at.however,section a still may not constitutionally retroactively apply in this case if it affects a vested right.see baker hughes,at middleton,at.
the butnarus do not allege that section a affects any vested right.instead,they contend that the legislature did not expressly make the amendment to section a retroactive,and therefore,we should apply the code construction act to conclude section a current version does not retroactively apply.see.gov t code a statute is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless expressly made retrospective,t he amendment of a statute does not affect the prior operation of the statute or any prior action taken under it.
but the butnarus misplace their reliance on the code construction act.that statute applies only to each code enacted by the or subsequent legislature as part of the state continuing statutory revision program.gov t code.when the legislature recodifies a statute under texas continuing statutory revision program,the statute will indicate this.see.local gov t code this code is enacted as a part of the state continuing statutory revision program.and,though we refer to the motor vehicle code as the code,nothing in the code language or legislative history shows that it is part of our state continuing statutory revision program.gov t code robbins chevrolet motor vehicle,pet.denied see also knight int l harvester credit.
section a is a jurisdictional statute that,in this case,does not alter the parties rights or obligations or remove any remedies already available.see david mcdavid nissan,at likes,at.this provision merely determines the tribunal that must initially resolve all issues and claims the code governs.see landgraf,at.david mcdavid nissan,at city of kountze,at.the parties do not have a vested right in choosing what tribunal will do this.see landgraf,at.david mcdavid nissan,at middleton,at city of kountze,at.accordingly,we conclude that amended section a constitutionally applies retroactively in this case.
applying section current version to the butnarus claims 
ford contends that section current version grants the board exclusive jurisdiction,and thus,the board has the sole authority to make the initial determination about the alleged code violation here.the butnarus,on the other hand,argue that section does not oust the trial court jurisdiction because the board does not have authority to award damages for their claims.therefore,the butnarus assert that the board only has primary jurisdiction to decide whether ford right of first refusal violates the code.
the butnarus pleadings currently reflect four claims,the first two of which are based on ford allegedly violating the code.first,the butnarus seek a judicial declaration that ford right of first refusal violates the code.second,the butnarus allege that ford tortiously interfered with the purchase and sale agreements by attempting to exercise its allegedly invalid right of first refusal.third,the butnarus seek a declaration about the parties rights and obligations under the purchase and sale agreements.fourth,the butnarus claim that graf and barton have breached or are about to breach the purchase and sale agreements by permitting ford to exercise its right of first refusal rather than requiring ford to determine the butnarus eligibility under the code for the dealership transfer.
the court of appeals,after analyzing section former version,concluded that the board has exclusive jurisdiction however,it held that the butnarus do not have standing as prospective car dealership transferees to seek relief from the board for the code violation they allege.the court of appeals further determined that the butnarus lack of standing to obtain relief from the board did not give them a right to seek damages for the alleged code violation in the trial court.at.accordingly,the court of appeals held that the butnarus could maintain their breach of contract and tortious interference claims however,the butnarus could not base those causes of action on code violations.at.
as discussed above,we disagree that section former version granted the board exclusive jurisdiction.but we conclude that section a current version,which applies here,grants the board exclusive jurisdiction over issues and claims the code governs.thus,we must determine if the butnarus claims fall within the board exclusive jurisdiction.
because motor vehicle distribution and sales affects our state economy and citizens welfare,the code primary purpose is to insure a sound system of distributing and selling motor vehicles through licensing and regulating manufacturers and dealers of those vehicles.see.stat.to accomplish this,the code strictly regulates conduct by or between franchise dealers and manufacturers.see.stat.for example,the code establishes how a dealer must request a transfer,assignment,or sale of its franchise agreement.stat,under that process,the code also determines the circumstances under which a manufacturer may withhold its consent to the dealer request.see.stat,b c.
specifically,to transfer a dealership the dealer must file a written application with the manufacturer to transfer the dealership.the application must identify the prospective transferee and any pertinent agreements about the proposed transfer.see.stat,b a.the manufacturer must timely advise the dealer in writing if the prospective transferee is qualified or if the transferee is not acceptable.stat,b b.the code prohibits a manufacturer from unreasonably withholding its consent to a dealer transfer application if the prospective transferee is of good moral character and otherwise meets the manufacturer predetermined,written standards,if any,about a transferee business experience and financial qualifications.stat,b c.further,the code makes it unlawful for a manufacturer to fail to give effect to or attempt to prevent any sale or transfer of a dealership except as provided by section.stat,b.
additionally,the code provides a dealer a remedy if the manufacturer unreasonably denies a dealer application to transfer its franchise ownership.the code definition of dealer includes licensed dealers but not prospective transferees.see.stat.the dealer may file a protest with the board.stat,b d.the issue would be whether the prospective transferee is qualified,and the manufacturer must prove the prospective transferee inadequacy.stat,b d e.if the board determines the prospective transferee is qualified,the board shall enter an order reflecting this,and the manufacturer must accept the transfer.stat,b e.
here,the court of appeals analysis presumes that the butnarus trial court claims simply seek monetary damages based on their allegation that ford exercising its right of first refusal and denying the dealership transfer violated section b.but the butnarus trial court claims involve something different.the butnarus seek relief for ford alleged tortious interference,and this claim,in turn,raises a code construction issue.to establish their tortious interference claim,the butnarus must show a contract exists between graf,graf ford,barton and the butnarus ford willfully and intentionally interfered with that contract the interference proximately caused the butnarus damage and the butnarus suffered actual damage or loss.see texas beef cattle green,holloway skinner.but ford may defeat liability by proving the affirmative defense that its conduct was privileged or long as that conduct was not illegal or tortious.see prudential ins.of am.financial review,acs investors,mclaughlin,texas beef cattle,at.it is the butnarus position that ford does not have a justification defense,because rights of first refusal contravene certain code provisions and,accordingly,are void and unenforceable.see.stat,b c prohibiting a manufacturer from unreasonably denying a dealership transfer.stat,making an agreement to waive the code terms void and unenforceable.the butnarus also request that the trial court enter a declaratory judgment that rights of first refusal violate the code.
we conclude that the butnarus tortious interference and declaratory judgment claims fall outside the purview of the board exclusive jurisdiction.in david mcdavid nissan,we held that the board exclusive jurisdiction under section a required the dealer in that case to exhaust its administrative remedies to obtain a final board finding to support its dtpa,bad faith,and oral contract claims.david mcdavid nissan,at.in concluding that the board exclusive jurisdiction applied to the dealer dtpa and claims,we explained that the code provides a hybrid process by which a dealer or manufacturer may seek damages for certain code violations.david mcdavid nissan,at discussing.stat,a,e.based on this process,we held that the dealer had to exhaust its administrative remedies under the code to obtain supporting board findings before a trial court could finally adjudicate the dealer damages request for its claims.see david mcdavid nissan,at.additionally,in requiring the dealer to obtain a board finding before pursuing its oral contract claims,we relied on a code provision mandating that a dealer obtain the board approval and a license before operating a franchise in a certain area.see david mcdavid nissan,at discussing.stat,c,a e.
here,however,no code provision extends the board exclusive jurisdiction to resolving the butnarus tortious interference and declaratory judgment claims so that they must exhaust any administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief.in fact,the code failing to establish any procedure through which the board may resolve a prospective transferee claim that a manufacturer unlawfully refused to accept a dealer transfer with the board inability to award monetary the contrary.thus,this case is analogous to cash america,in which we held that the plaintiff did not have to exhaust administrative remedies under the pawnshop act because nothing in the statutory scheme indicate d that the legislature intended to replace a pledgor remedies with the replacement remedy available under the statute.cash,at.similarly,because the code does not indicate the legislature intent to replace the prospective transferees remedies here,the butnarus do not have to exhaust any administrative remedies before suing ford for tortious interference or declaratory relief.
but our inquiry does not end here.though the legislature did not confer exclusive jurisdiction on the board to resolve the butnarus claims,we still must decide whether the board has primary jurisdiction to resolve the code construction issue that those claims raise.see,cash,at recognizing that,though an agency does not have exclusive jurisdiction,the policies underlying the primary jurisdiction doctrine may require the agency to initially decide an issue.in david mcdavid nissan,we explained that the primary jurisdiction doctrine requires trial courts to allow an administrative agency to initially decide an issue when an agency is typically staffed with experts trained in handling the complex problems in the agency purview and great benefit is derived from an agency uniformly interpreting its laws,rules,and regulations,whereas courts and juries may reach different results under similar fact situations.david mcdavid nissan,at citing united states western pac,d cash,at foree crown cent.petroleum,gregg oil,kavanaugh underwriters life ins,writ ref travis,comment,primary jurisdiction a general theory and its application to the securities exchange act,cal.we noted that,when the primary jurisdiction doctrine requires a trial court to defer to an agency to make an initial determination,the court should abate the lawsuit and suspend finally adjudicating the claim until the agency has an opportunity to act on the matter.david mcdavid nissan,at citing central power light public util.comm n,pet.denied roberts express,expert,no writ.
we conclude that the primary jurisdiction doctrine applies in this case.the butnarus tortious interference and declaratory judgment claims raise a code construction issue that is within the board special competence and expertise.see cash,at.as discussed above,the legislature has specifically authorized the board to resolve disputes between a manufacturer and dealer when the dealer alleges that the manufacturer violated section b by unreasonably withholding consent to transfer a dealership.see.stat,b d.the board expertise in construing section b in these disputes,and the state interest in a uniform interpretation of the code,requires the trial court to abate the lawsuit and suspend finally adjudicating the tortious inter
