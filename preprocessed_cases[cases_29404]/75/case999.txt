petitions filed by two alien pilots challenge certain aviation regulations adopted in the wake of the september,terrorist attacks.from the establishment of the transportation security administration tsa in november to the promulgation of the challenged regulations in january,aviation security has undergone a fundamental transformation.the pilots contend that the new procedures resulting in the revocation of their airman certificates issued by the federal aviation administration faa violated the administrative procedure act apa and the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.specifically,they contend that the january regulations were unlawfully promulgated without notice and comment,that the revocations were not supported by substantial evidence in the record,and that they were denied meaningful notice of the evidence against them and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.
congress has delegated broad discretion to the federal aviation administration faa to prescribe regulations and standards for safety in air commerce and national security.see a.the faa may at any time reexamine the issuance of an airman certificate and issue an order modifying,suspending,or revoking a certificate if the administrator determines that such action is required for safety in air commerce and the public interest.a,b.with regard to issuing airman certificates to qualified individuals,congress distinguished between citizens and aliens,conferring broad discretion to the faa regarding alien pilots.see id.e.after the september,terrorist attacks,congress established the transportation security administration tsa on november,and transferred much of the responsibility for civil aviation security from the faa to the tsa.see id.d,f.
this case concerns alien pilots only citizens and resident alien pilots have challenged the applicable regulations in coalition of airline pilots ass ns.faa,and,wl.june.the two pilots,jifry and zarie,are citizens of saudi arabia who have used their faa certificates to pilot flights abroad,but have not operated saudi arabian airlines flights to the united states in the past nine and four years,respectively.on august,the tsa sent letters to the faa requesting that captain jifry and captain zarie have their airman certificates revoked,stating that b ased upon information available to us,they presented a security risk to civil aviation or national security.the faa notified jifry and zarie by letters of august,that their airman certificates would be revoked because the acting under secretary of transportation for security,pursuant b a and c,had determined that they presented risks to aviation or national security.the faa revoked the pilots certificates,see b,and the pilots appealed the revocations to the national transportation safety board ntsb.id.d.an administrative law judge alj held a telephonic conference on january,and ordered that the faa and the tsa provide a privilege log and that depositions of key witnesses take place by.
a week later,on january,the faa dismissed the revocation actions against jifry and zarie,and in conjunction with the tsa,published,without notice and comment,new regulations governing the suspension and revocation of airman certificates for security reasons.see.the new faa regulation,provides for automatic suspension by the faa of airman certificates upon written notification from the tsa that the pilot poses a security threat and,therefore,is not eligible to hold an airman certificate.the tsa simultaneously promulgated,which establishes the procedure by which the tsa initially and finally notifies aliens who hold or apply for faa certificates that they pose a security threat,and requires the tsa to notify the faa once the tsa has determined that a pilot is a security threat.upon finding that a pilot poses a security threat,see c,the tsa assistant administrator for intelligence issues an initial notification of threat assessment initial notice to the individual and serves that determination upon the faa.see id.e.the faa then suspends the pilot certificate.see b.no later than days after service,the pilot may make a written request for copies of releasable materials upon which the initial notice was based.see e.the tsa must respond not later than days after receiving the request,and the pilot may submit a written reply within days of receiving the tsa response.see id.e.at that point,the tsa deputy administrator must review the entire record de novo to determine if the pilot poses a security risk.id.f.if the deputy so determines,the tsa serves a final notification of threat assessment final notice,id.f,and the faa revokes the certificate.see c.the pilot may appeal the certificate revocation to the ntsb.see d.upon exhaustion of these administrative remedies,the pilot may seek review in the court of appeals,which may review the case on the merits.see id.f.
on january,the tsa also served an initial notice of threat assessment designating jifry and zarie as security threats,and the faa suspended their certificates.the pilots appealed the initial notice,and requested the materials upon which the initial notice had been issued.the tsa provided the releasable materials,but did not include the factual basis for tsa determination,which was based on classified information.the pilots then appealed the suspension of their certificates to the ntsb.the alj granted the tsa motion for summary judgment,ruling that the only question was procedural whether the pilots had been duly advised by the tsa,in writing,that they posed a security threat,and finding that they had.upon the pilots appeals,the ntsb affirmed the alj order in favor of the tsa.jifry and zarie then filed replies to the tsa initial notice,stating that the lack of evidence and information about the basis for the determination contained in the tsa response made it impossible for them to specifically rebut the tsa allegations,and denying that they were security threats.on may,the tsa deputy administrator,upon de novo review of the administrative record,denied the pilots challenge to the initial notice and issued a final notice based on finding that jifry and zarie posed security threats.see c.the faa then revoked the pilots airman certificates.on august,the ntsb denied the pilots appeal of the revocation of their certificates for the same reasons it had denied their challenges to the suspensions,and affirmed the alj grant of summary judgment to the tsa and the emergency orders of revocation.
the pilots make three challenges to the revocations of their faa airman certificates first,that the january regulations were unlawfully promulgated without notice and comment second,that the revocations were not supported by substantial evidence in the record and third,that the procedures provided by the january regulations violated their due process rights under the fifth amendment to the constitution.we address each in turn.
section of the administrative procedure act apa requires an agency to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking and to afford an opportunity for interested persons to participate in the rulemaking.see b,c.the good cause exception,however,provides that when the agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable,unnecessary,or contrary to the public interest,the agency need not engage in notice and comment.id.b b.the pilots contend that the regulations of january are invalid because they were unlawfully promulgated without notice and comment,and there was no rational basis for eliminating the right to a meaningful appeal before the ntsb.they maintain that the good cause exception does not apply because notice and comment had not been impracticable,unnecessary or contrary to the public interest inasmuch as the faa already had the authority to immediately suspend or revoke a certificate upon finding that safety in air commerce or air transportation and the public interest required such an action.see,amended by,stat.
contrary to the position of respondents tsa,faa,and the ntsb,the pilots apa challenges to the faa regulation,are not mooted by the enactment of the vision century of aviation reauthorization act act,on december.the act provides that the faa administrator shall issue an order suspending,or revoking any part of a certificate if the administrator is notified by the under secretary for border transportation security of the department of homeland security that the holder of the certificate poses,or is suspected of posing,a risk of air piracy or terrorism or a threat to airline or passenger safety.a.the respondents maintain that through,congress approved the process embodied in the faa regulation by expressly commanding the faa to suspend or revoke certificates if requested by the tsa.the respondents have not shown a lack of a live controversy,however,because the effects of remain very real for alien pilots like jifry and zarie.the faa has applied this regulation against the two pilots,and it remains in effect notwithstanding the act.the pilots therefore retain a legally cognizable interest in the outcome,powell mccormack,d,of their apa claims.
generally,the good cause exception to notice and comment rulemaking,see b b,is to be narrowly construed and only reluctantly countenanced.tennessee gas pipeline ferc,quoting new jersey epa.the exception excuses notice and comment in emergency situations,am.fed of gov t employees block,or where delay could result in serious harm.see hawaii helicopter operators ass faa,cir.the latter circumstance is applicable here in examining the tsa determination that t he use of notice and comment prior to issuance of th e january regulations could delay the ability of tsa and the faa to take effective action to keep persons found by tsa to pose a security threat from holding an airman certificate,and was necessary to prevent a possible imminent hazard to aircraft,persons,and property within the united states.
the pilots contend that the good cause exception does not apply because the faa already had unlimited power to revoke a certificate immediately if it believed an airman to be a security risk,see,and the tsa was already authorized to make security assessments under f.while true,the pilots fail to acknowledge that at the time the challenged regulations were adopted,the faa power to suspend or revoke certificates was permissive only.see.congress had not yet enacted,which formalized the requirement that the faa shall suspend,modify,or revoke a certificate if notified by the tsa that an individual posed a security risk.as the respondents explain,the january regulations mandated a streamlined process by which an individual pilot certificate would be automatically suspended or revoked by the faa upon notification by the tsa that a pilot posed a security threat.the tsa and faa deemed such regulations necessary in order to minimize security threats and potential security vulnerabilities to the fullest extent possible.given the respondents legitimate concern over the threat of further terrorist acts involving aircraft in the aftermath of september,see declaration of tsa deputy administrator stephen mchale hereinafter mchale decl.at,the agencies had good cause for not offering advance public participation.see utility solid waste activities group epa.
on the merits,the pilots apa challenge fails.the court review of agency rulemaking is highly deferential,limited to determining whether the agency has considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.united states air tour ass faa,quoting motor veh.mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.in bellsouth fcc,the court observed that w hen an agency is obliged to make policy judgments where no factual certainties exist or where facts alone do not provide the answer,the reviewing court role is more limited we require only that the agency so state and go on to identify the considerations it found persuasive.
contrary to the pilots position,the regulations are not arbitrary and capricious for bearing no rational connection to the problem identified by the faa.it is that the regulations are related to the tsa and faa goals of improving the safety of air travel.nor is the court in a position to the respondents judgment that imposing stricter procedures for coordinating security risks and restricting individuals who pose security threats from holding airman certificates was necessary to further that goal.see bellsouth fcc,at.moreover,the pilots contention that the risk posed by the certificate holders alleged to be security threats was not remedied by providing fewer procedural protections to the certification holders and narrowing their right to ntsb review is to no avail because produces the same result.section makes no provision for ntsb review even for citizens,and the conference report states that aliens have the right to the appeal procedures that tsa has already provided for them.conf.rpt.at.in addition,a requires the faa to respond automatically to tsa threat assessments,providing that the faa shall issue an order amending,modifying,suspending,or revoking any part of a certificate issued under this title if the administrator is notified by the department of homeland security that the holder of the certificate poses,or is suspected of posing,a risk of air piracy or terrorism or a threat to airline or passenger safety.a.accordingly,if these pilots retain any right to ntsb review at all,it is no broader than the review for procedural regularity that they have received,and they would therefore garner no benefit from a remand.indeed,an additional ground for rejecting the pilots challenge to the promulgation of the faa regulation without notice and comment exists precisely because now provides an express statutory authorization for the automatic revocation that was previously predicated on the regulations alone even were the court to invalidate the regulations for lack of notice and comment,the statute would compel the faa to honor the tsa notification and take immediate action against the pilots certificates.
the scope of the court review of the pilots challenges to the tsa actions is limited to determining whether the actions were arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.under this standard,the court must consider whether those actions were based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.citizens to preserve overton park volpe,d overruled on other grounds.see motor veh.mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.the court must affirm the agency findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence and there is a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.burlington truck lines,united states,d.substantial evidence is simply such relevant evidence as a reasonable person might accept as proof of a conclusion.see universal camera nlrb.quoting consol.edison nlrb.
in contending that the revocations of their airman certificates are unsupported by substantial evidence in the record,the pilots do not challenge the definition of security threat under the tsa regulations.an individual poses a security threat if the individual is suspected of posing,or is known to pose a threat to transportation or national security a threat to air piracy or terrorism a threat to airline or passenger security or a threat to civil aviation security.c.consistent with camp pitts,d,where the supreme court stated that when an agency official fails to adequately explain its decision,the agency should submit either through affidavits or testimony,such additional explanation of the reasons for the agency decision as may prove necessary,the affidavit of tsa deputy administrator stephen mchale provides an adequate basis for the tsa determination that jifry and zarie each posed a security threat within the meaning of c.the unsealed affidavit recounts that the deputy administrator affirmed the tsa determination on the basis of classified intelligence reports,combined with reports from the intelligence community that aircraft would continue to be used as weapons of terrorism,and consideration of the ease with which an individual may obtain access to aircraft in the united states once he or she has a pilot license.mchale decl.
