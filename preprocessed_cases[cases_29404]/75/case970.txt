background 
in march the union petitioned for a representation election at repair facilities in henderson and las vegas,nevada.when the election was held that may,ballots were cast,for the union,against the union,and that were challenged.
filed objections to the election,arguing that the union had 
promised to waive the initiation fees for employees who joined the union before the election 
misrepresented the extent of its support among employees by forging signatures on a petition and making last minute representations to employees in the form of a document erroneously guaranteeing the company could not lawfully close or threaten to close the shop if the union won the election 
created the appearance that the board favored the union when an active union supporter greeted the board agent overseeing the election like a friend and 
engaged in unlawful electioneering when the union election observer smiled at and made gestures to voters in the polling place,and when union officials conversed with six or seven voters in a parking lot near the polling place immediately before they went in to vote.
the company also objects that,even if no one of the foregoing activities was sufficient to upset the laboratory conditions necessary for a valid election,in the aggregate they surely were.see shoe,nlrb,holding representation elections should be held in laboratory conditions as nearly ideal as possible,to determine the uninhibited desires of the employees,enf,cir.
a hearing officer,after taking testimony,recommended that the board overrule objections and certify the union as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees.filed exceptions with the board,which rejected them,adopted the findings and recommendations of the hearing officer,and certified the union.
when thereafter refused to bargain,the union filed an unfair labor practice charge alleging the company had violated sections a and of the act,a.the general counsel filed a complaint,which answered with the argument that it had no obligation to bargain because the election was invalid.the general counsel moved for summary judgment,which opposed on the grounds that the hearing officer was biased and this case should have been consolidated with another proceeding involving the union,the company,and its parent,international.
the board concluded the hearing officer was not biased and the general counsel had not abused his discretion because the other proceeding against involved separate and distinct violations.accordingly,the board held the company had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of section s a and and ordered to cease and desist from refusing to bargain and to bargain with the union upon request.
ii.analysis 
in its petition for review,renews its arguments that the general counsel abused his discretion by failing to consolidate this proceeding with the other unfair labor practice case against the company the company did not unlawfully refuse to bargain because the election was invalid for each of the reasons epitomized above,and the hearing officer was biased to the point of depriving of due process.

consolidation 
argues in limine that the board should have dismissed the complaint with which the general counsel initiated this case because he abused his discretion by arbitrarily fail ing to consolidate contemporaneous charges against the company.the board rejected that argument on the ground that under service employees,local cresleigh mgmt,nlrb,consolidation is required only in situations where the general counsel is attempting to twice litigate the same act or conduct as a violation of different sections of the act,or to relitigate the same charge in different cases.the charges at issue in the two cases against are distinct the instant case involves technical refusal to bargain after the union was certified as the bargaining representative of the employees,which the company claims was justified by misconduct on the part of the union.the other proceeding,in contrast,involves various alleged unfair labor practices on the part of,for which the general counsel is seeking a remedial bargaining order pursuant to nlrb gissel packing,d,on the ground that the company irremediably destroyed the possibility of holding a valid second election.in addition,the board pointed out that consolidation would unnecessarily delay disposition of the case,see cresleigh,nlrb at,until the more complicated complaint is resolved.
for the reasons given by the board,we conclude the general counsel did not abuse his discretion in pursuing the complaints against in separate proceedings.accordingly,we turn to the merits of arguments for setting aside the election.
waiver of the union initiation fee 
burden is to show that union misconduct interfered with the employees exercise of free choice to such an extent that it materially affected the election,krehbiel,at.to that end,the company argues first that the union promise to waive initiation fees for employees who joined the union prior to the election is objectionable,as it creates the false impression of employee support and a sense of obligation to the union,see nlrb savair,d.
this argument rests upon the faulty premise that the union offer was conditioned upon the employee joining the union prior to the election.the hearing officer specifically found the union offered,in writing and orally at meetings,to waive the initiation fees for,as stated in a union flyer,all employees who join in a newly organized shop,not only for those who joined before the election.this put the union offer squarely within the category deemed permissible in savair,at.see majestic star casino,llc nlrb,under judicial and board precedent,an offer to waive initiation fees in not impermissible unless it is conditioned upon an employee demonstration of support for the union.
substantial evidence supports the hearing officer finding that the waiver of fees was not conditioned upon the employee demonstrated support for the union.several employees testified that one or another union supporter told them the fee waiver was conditioned upon support for the union.the hearing officer,however,found that none of the testimony credibly supports that claim and,although there was testimony suggesting that one employee,don collette,who was an enthusiastic union supporter,made such statements to two other employees,the hearing officer found collette denial more credible than the conflicting testimony.the hearing officer reasoned it was inherently implausible that collette was making statements to other employees that contradicted the plethora of documents that the union was using during the organizing campaign as well as what the union officials stated at meetings.
a hearing officer credibility determinations may not be overturned by the reviewing court absent the most extraordinary circumstances such as utter disregard for sworn te
