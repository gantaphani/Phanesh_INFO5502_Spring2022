the federal aviation administration authorization act of faaaa preempts state laws related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.c.this provision borrows from the airline deregulation act of ada,which preempts state laws related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier,b,but it adds the important qualification,with respect to transportation of property.
pelkey brought suit in new hampshire superior court,alleging that dan city used cars dan city,a towing company,took custody of his car after towing it from his landlord parking lot without pelkey knowledge,failed to notify him of its plan to auction the car,held an auction despite pelkey notice that he wanted to reclaim the car,and eventually traded the car away without compensating pelkey for the loss of his vehicle.in disposing of his car,pelkey further alleged,dan city did not meet the requirements contained in chapter of the new hampshire revised statutes annotated,which regulates the disposal of abandoned vehicles by a storage company.dan city misconduct,pelkey charged,both violated new hampshire consumer protection act and breached the towing company statutory and duties as a bailee to use reasonable care while in possession of a bailor property.the court granted summary judgment to dan city,concluding that the faaaa preempted pelkey claims.the new hampshire supreme court reversed.it held the faaaa preemption clause inapplicable because pelkey claims related to dan city conduct in disposing of his car,not to conduct concerning the transportation of property,or a towing company service.
held section c does not preempt claims stemming from the storage and disposal of a towed vehicle.
a where congress has superseded state legislation by statute,this court task is to identify the domain expressly,lorillard tobacco reilly,focusing first on the statutory language,csx,easterwood.in rowe new hampshire motor transp,this court reading of c was informed by decisions interpreting parallel language in the ada preemption clause.thus,the court held,the phrase related to embraces state laws having a connection with or reference to carrier rates,routes,or services,whether directly or indirectly.ibid.at the same time,the breadth of the words related to does not mean that the preemption clause should be read with an uncritical literalism.new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins.the court has cautioned that c does not preempt state laws affecting carrier prices,routes,and services in only a tenuous,remote,or peripheral manner.rowe,at.
b pelkey claims escape preemption because they are related to neither the transportation of property nor the service of a motor carrier.although c otherwise tracks the ada preemption provision,the faaaa formulation one conspicuous alteration addition of the words with respect to the transportation of property significantly limits the faaaa preemptive scope.it is not sufficient for a state law to relate to the price,route,or service of a motor carrier in any capacity the law must also concern a motor carrier transportation of property.title defines transportation,in relevant part,as services related to th e movement of property,including arranging for storage and handling.b.pelkey consumer protection act and negligence claims are not related to th e movement of his car.chapter regulates the disposal of vehicles once their transportation here,by towing has ended.pelkey seeks redress only for conduct occurring after the car ceased moving and was stored.dan city maintains that because b definition of transportation includes storage and handling,pelkey claims fall within c preemptive ambit.but storage and handling fit within b definition only when those services relat e to th e movement of property.thus temporary storage of an item in transit en route to its final destination qualifies as transportation,but permanent storage does not.here,no storage occurred in the course of transporting pelkey vehicle.
pelkey claims are also unrelated to a service a motor carrier renders its customers.the transportation service dan city removal of pelkey car from his landlord parking lot did involve the movement of property,but that service ended months before the conduct on which pelkey claims are based.because chapter,on which pelkey relies,addresses storage compan ies and garage owner s or keeper s,not transportation activities,it has neither a direct nor an indirect connection to transportation services a motor carrier offers its customers.see rowe,at.
the conclusion that claims regarding disposal of towed vehicles are not preempted is in full accord with congress purpose in enacting c,which was to displace a state direct substitution of its own governmental commands for competitive market forces in determining the services that motor carriers will provide.at.the new hampshire prescriptions pelkey invokes hardly constrain participation in interstate commerce by requiring a motor carrier to offer services not available in the market.nor do they freez e into place services that carriers might prefer to discontinue in the future.ibid.
c dan city additional arguments in favor of preemption are not persuasive.dan city contends that because none of pelkey claims fit within the exceptions to preemption detailed in c,and,his claims must be preempted.but exceptions,while sometimes a helpful interpretive guide,do not in themselves delineate the scope of the rule.here,the exceptions identify matters a state may regulate when it would otherwise be precluded from doing so,but they do not control more than that.
dan city also maintains that pelkey claims are related to its towing service because selling pelkey car was the means by which dan city obtained payment for the tow.if such claims were preempted,no law would govern resolution of a dispute arising from a towing company disposal of a vehicle previously towed or afford a remedy for wrongful disposal.no such design can be attributed to a rational congress.see silkwood.

dan city used cars,dba dan city auto body,petitioner robert pelkey 
on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of new hampshire 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
this case concerns the preemptive scope of a provision of the federal aviation administration authorization act of faaaa or act applicable to motor carriers.codified at c,the provision reads 
a state may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.
robert pelkey brought suit under new hampshire law against dan city used cars dan city,a towing company.pelkey alleged that dan city took custody of his car after towing it without pelkey knowledge,failed to notify him of its plan to auction the car,held an auction despite pelkey communication that he wanted to arrange for the car return,and eventually traded the car away without compensating pelkey for the loss of his vehicle.
disposal of abandoned vehicles by a storage company is regulated by chapter of the new hampshire revised statutes annotated.see stat.ann.to c west and west cum.supp.dan city relied on those laws to dispose of pelkey vehicle for nonpayment of towing and storage fees.according to pelkey,however,dan city failed to comply with new hampshire provisions governing the sale of stored vehicles and the application of sale proceeds.pelkey charged that dan city disposal of his car without following the requirements contained in chapter violated the new hampshire consumer protection act,west,as well as dan city statutory and duties as bailee to exercise reasonable care while in possession of a bailor property.
we hold,in accord with the new hampshire supreme court,that claims stemming from the storage and disposal of a car,once towing has ended,are not sufficiently connected to a motor carrier service with respect to the transportation of property to warrant preemption under c.the new hampshire law in point regulates no towing services,no carriage of property.instead,it trains on custodians of stored vehicles seeking to sell them.congress did not displace the state regulation of that activity by any federal prescription.
the airline deregulation act of ada,stat,largely deregulated the domestic airline industry.in keeping with the statute aim to achieve maximum reliance on competitive market forces,at,congress sought to ensure that the states would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own.morales trans world airlines.congress therefore included a preemption provision,now codified at b,prohibiting states from enacting or enforcing any law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier.
two years later,the motor carrier act of,stat,extended deregulation to the trucking industry.congress completed the deregulation years thereafter,in,by expressly preempting state trucking regulation.congress did so upon finding that state governance of intrastate transportation of property had become unreasonably burden some to free trade,interstate commerce,and american consumers.columbus ours ga rage wrecker service,citing faaaa a,stat.borrowing from the ada preemption clause,but adding a new qualification,c of the faaaa supersedes state laws related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.stat,now codified at c emphasis added the act exempts certain measures from its preemptive scope,including state laws regulating motor vehicle safety,size,and weight motor carrier insurance and the intrastate transportation of household goods.c a b.also exempted from preemption are state laws relating to the price of vehicle transportation by a tow truck,if towing occurs without prior consent of the vehicle owner.c c.
this case involves the interaction between the faaaa preemption clause and the state of new hampshire regulation of the removal,storage,and disposal of abandoned motor vehicles.chapter of the new hampshire revised statutes annotated establishes procedures by which an authorized official or the owner of any private property on which a vehicle is parked without permission may arrange to have the vehicle towed and stored.stat.ann.to,a i.it generally makes the owner of a towed vehicle responsible for reasonable removal and storage fees.see i reasonable removal and storage charges shall be a lien against the vehicle which shall be paid by the owner ii owner entitled to recover vehicle after payment of all reasonable towing and storage charges a ii owner of a vehicle towed from a parking lot or parking garage is responsible for removal and storage charges when the lot or garage conspicuously posts notice of parking restrictions.
under chapter,the custodian of a car that remains unclaimed for days following a tow may dispose of the vehicle upon compliance with notice requirements.a i,ii.a garage owner or keeper must post notices of an impending sale in public places and provide mail notice to the vehicle owner whenever the owner address may be ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence.if a towed vehicle is not fit for legal use,its custodian need not provide individual or public notice prior to disposal,and sale of the vehicle may occur upon written notice to and approval from new hampshire department of public safety.a iii 
on compliance with the statutory requirements,the custodian of a stored vehicle may sell the vehicle by public auction at its place of business.the storage company may use the sale proceeds to pay the amount of the liens and the reasonable expenses incident to the sale.west.remaining proceeds are payable to the vehicle owner if claimed at any time within one year from the date of sale.ibid.
the landlord of the apartment complex in which pelkey lived required tenants to remove their cars from the parking lot in the event of a snowstorm,so that the snow could be cleared.pelkey honda civic remained in the lot during and after a february snowstorm.at the landlord request,dan city towed and stored the vehicle.confined to his bed with a serious medical condition,pelkey did not know his car had been towed.soon after removal of his car,pelkey was admitted to the hospital for a procedure to amputate his left foot,during which he suffered a heart attack.he remained under hospital care until his discharge on april.
unaware of pelkey identity or illness,dan city sought permission from new hampshire department of public safety to sell the honda at auction without notice.in response,the department identified pelkey as the last known owner of the vehicle.dan city wrote to pelkey,notifying him that it had towed and was storing his car.when the post office returned the letter,checking the box moved,left no address,dan city scheduled an auction for april.meanwhile,in the days following pelkey discharge from the hospital,his attorney learned from counsel for the apartment complex that the car had been towed by dan city and was scheduled to be sold at public auction.on april,pelkey attorney informed dan city that pelkey wanted to pay any charges owed and reclaim his vehicle.dan city nevertheless proceeded with the auction.attracting no bidders,dan city later disposed of the car by trading it to a third party.pelkey was not notified in advance of the trade,and has received no proceeds from the sale.
pelkey brought suit against dan city in new hampshire superior court.he alleged that dan city violated the new hampshire consumer protection act,stat.ann,by failing to comply with chapter requirements for disposal of stored vehicles,making false statements about the condition and value of his honda,and proceeding with the auction despite notice that pelkey wanted to reclaim the car he also alleged that dan city negligently breached both statutory and duties as a bailee to use reasonable care in disposing of the car.granting summary judgment to dan city,the new hampshire superior court concluded that pelkey claims were preempted by the faaaa.
the new hampshire supreme court reversed.it held the faaaa preemption clause,c,inapplicable because pelkey claims related to dan city conduct in disposing of his honda,not to conduct concerning the transportation of property.emphasis deleted.alternatively,the court ruled that,even if pelkey claims could be said to concern the transportation of property,they did not sufficiently relat e to a towing company service to be preempted.at,at.
we granted certiorari to resolve a division of opinion in state supreme courts on whether c preempts a vehicle owner claims against a towing company regarding the company disposal of the vehicle.compare,this case,with weatherspoon tillery body shop,so,c preempts state statutory and claims arising out of storage and sale of a towed vehicle.
where,as in this case,congress has superseded state legislation by statute,our task is to identify the domain expressly.lorillard tobacco reilly.to do so,we focus first on the statutory language,which necessarily contains the best evidence of congress intent.csx,easterwood.
the faaaa preemption clause prohibits enforcement of state laws related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.c.in rowe new hampshire motor transp,our reading of this language was informed by decisions interpreting the parallel language in the ada preemption clause.the phrase related to,we said,embraces state laws having a connection with or reference to carrier rates,routes,or services,whether directly or indirectly.ibid.quoting morales,at emphasis deleted.see also,at ordinary meaning of words related to is a broad one,thus ada use of those words expresses a broad purpose 
at the same time,the breadth of the words related to does not mean the sky is the limit.we have refused to read the preemption clause of the employee retiremen
