the version of federal motor vehicle safety standard fmvss requires,as relevant here,auto manufacturers to install seatbelts on the rear seats of passenger vehicles.they must install belts on seats next to a vehicle doors or frames,but may install either those belts or simple lap belts on rear inner seats,those next to a minivan aisle.
the williamson family and thanh williamson estate brought this california tort suit,claiming that thanh died in an accident because the rear aisle seat of the mazda minivan in which she was riding had a lap belt instead of belts.the state trial court dismissed their claim on the pleadings.the state court of appeal affirmed,relying on geier american honda motor,in which this court found that an earlier version of fmvss which required installation of passive restraint devices a state tort suit against an auto manufacturer on a failure to install airbags.
held fmvss does not state tort suits claiming that manufacturers should have installed belts,instead of lap belts,on rear inner seats.
a because this case involves the same statute as geier,a later version of the same regulation,and a somewhat similar claim that a state tort action conflicts with the federal regulation,the answers to two of the subsidiary questions posed in geier apply directly here.thus,the statute express clause can not the tort action here but neither can its saving clause foreclose or limit the operation of ordinary conflict principles.the court consequently turns to geier third subsidiary question,whether,in fact,the state tort action conflicts with the federal regulation.
b under ordinary conflict principles a state law that stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of a federal law is.hines davidowitz.in geier,the state law stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of a significant federal regulatory objective,namely,giving manufacturers a choice among different kinds of passive restraint systems.this conclusion was supported by the regulation history,the agency contemporaneous explanation,and the government current understanding of the regulation.the history showed that the department of transportation dot had long thought it important to leave manufacturers with a choice of systems.dot contemporaneous explanation of the regulation made clear that manufacturer choice was an important means for achieving dot basic objectives.it phased in passive restraint requirements to give manufacturers time to improve airbag technology and develop better systems it worried that requiring airbags would cause a public backlash and it was concerned about airbag safety and cost.finally,the government current understanding was that a tort suit insisting upon airbag use would stan d as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of these objectives.at.
c like the regulation in geier,the instant regulation leaves the manufacturer with a choice,and the tort suit here would restrict that choice.but in contrast to geier,the choice here is not a significant regulatory objective.the regulation history resembles the history of airbags to some degree.dot rejected a regulation requiring belts in rear seats in.but by,changed circumstances led dot to require manufacturers to install belts for rear outer seats but to retain a manufacturer choice for rear inner seats.its reasons for doing so differed considerably from its reasons for permitting a choice of passive restraint.it was not concerned about consumer acceptance it thought that belts would increase safety and did not pose additional safety risks and it was not seeking to use the regulation to spur development of alternative safety devices.instead,dot thought that the requirement would not be cost effective.that fact alone can not show that dot sought to forbid tort suits.for one thing,dot did not believe that costs would remain frozen.for another,many federal safety regulations embody a judgment.to infer intent from the mere existence of such a judgment would eliminate the possibility that the agency seeks only to set forth a minimum standard.finally,the solicitor general represents that dot regulation does not this tort suit.as in geier,the agency own views should make a difference,at,and dot has not expressed inconsistent views on this subject.

justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
federal motor vehicle safety standard version requires,among other things,that auto manufacturers install seatbelts on the rear seats of passenger vehicles.they must install belts on seats next to a vehicle doors or frames.but they have a choice about what to install on rear inner seats say,middle seats or those next to a minivan aisle.there they can install either simple lap belts or belts.fed.reg.cfr,promulgated pursuant to the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of act,stat,et ed.recodified without substantive change at et ed.
the question presented here is whether this federal regulation a state tort suit that,if successful,would deny manufacturers a choice of belts for rear inner seats by imposing tort liability upon those who choose to install a simple lap belt.we conclude that providing manufacturers with this seatbelt choice is not a significant objective of the federal regulation.consequently,the regulation does not the state tort suit.
in,the williamson family,riding in their mazda minivan,was struck head on by another vehicle.thanh williamson was sitting in a rear aisle seat,wearing a lap belt she died in the accident.delbert and alexa williamson were wearing belts they survived.they,along with thanh estate,subsequently brought this california tort suit against mazda.they claimed that mazda should have installed belts on rear aisle seats,and that thanh died because mazda equipped her seat with a lap belt instead.
the california trial court dismissed this tort claim on the basis of the pleadings.and the california court of appeal affirmed.the appeals court noted that in geier american honda motor,this court considered whether a different portion of an older version of federal motor vehicle safety standard fmvss a portion that required installation of passive restraint devices a state tort suit that sought to hold an auto manufacturer liable for failure to install a particular kind of passive restraint,namely,airbags.we found that the federal regulation intended to assure manufacturers that they would retain a choice of installing any of several different passive restraint devices.and the regulation sought to assure them that they would not have to exercise this choice in favor of airbags.for that reason we thought that the federal regulation a state tort suit that,by premising tort liability on a failure to install airbags,would have deprived the manufacturers of the choice that the federal regulation had assured them,at.
the court saw considerable similarity between this case and geier.the federal regulation at issue here gives manufacturers a choice among two different kinds of seatbelts for rear inner seats.and a state lawsuit that premises tort liability on a failure to install a particular kind of seatbelt,namely,belts,would in effect deprive the manufacturer of that choice.the court concluded that,as in geier,the federal regulation the state tort suit.cal.app,cal.rptr.
the williamsons sought certiorari.and we granted certiorari in light of the fact that several courts have interpreted geier as indicating that fmvss state tort suits claiming that manufacturers should have installed belts,not lap belts,on rear inner seats.carden general motors,roland general motors.app.heinricher volvo car.app.
in geier,we considered a portion of an earlier version of fmvss.that regulation required manufacturers to equip their vehicles with passive restraint systems,thereby providing occupants with automatic accident protection.fed.reg.but that regulation also gave manufacturers a choice among several different passive restraint systems,including airbags and automatic seatbelts,at.the question before the court was whether the act,together with the regulation,a state tort suit that would have held a manufacturer liable for not installing airbags,at.by requiring manufacturers to install airbags in order to avoid tort liability the tort suit would have deprived the manufacturers of the choice among passive restraint systems that the federal regulation gave them.see hillsborough county automated medical laboratories,s tate laws can be by federal regulations as well as by federal statutes 
we divided this basic question into three subsidiary questions,at.first,we asked whether the statute express provision preempted the state tort suit.that statutory clause says that no state may establish,or continue in effect any safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of a motor vehicle or item of equipment which is not identical to the federal standard.d ed.emphasis added.we had previously held that a word somewhat similar to standard,namely,requirements found in a similar statute included within its scope state duties,such as duties created by state tort law.medtronic,lohr,plurality opinion,at breyer,concurring in part and concurring in judgment,at,concurring in part and dissenting in part.but we nonetheless held that the state tort suit in question fell outside the scope of this particular clause.that is primarily because the statute also contains a saving clause,which says that c ompliance with a federal safety standard does not exempt any person from any liability under common law.k emphasis added.since tort law is ordinarily common law,we held that the presence of the saving clause,makes clear that congress intended state tort suits to fall outside the scope of the express clause.geier,at.
second,we asked the converse question the saving clause at least removes tort actions from the scope of the express clause,at.but does it do more does it foreclose or limit the operation of ordinary principles insofar as those principles instruct us to read federal statutes as state laws including state standards that actually conflict with the federal statutes or related regulations ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.we concluded that the saving clause does not foreclose or limit the operation of ordinary principles,grounded in longstanding precedent.at.
these two holdings apply directly to the case before us.we here consider the same statute,et a later version of the same regulation,fmvss and a somewhat similar claim that a state tort action conflicts with the federal regulation.in light of geier,the statute express clause can not the tort action but neither can the statute saving clause foreclose or limit the operation of ordinary conflict principles.we consequently turn our attention to geier third subsidiary question,whether,in fact,the state tort action conflicts with the federal regulation.
under ordinary conflict principles a state law that stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of a federal law is.hines davidowitz.see ibid.federal statute can a state statute cipollone liggett group,federal statute can a state tort suit fidelity fed.sav.loan de la cuesta,federal regulation can a state statute geier,supra federal regulation can a state tort suit.in geier we found that the state law stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of a significant federal regulatory objective,namely,the maintenance of manufacturer choice,at.we must decide whether the same is true here.
at the heart of geier lies our determination that giving auto manufacturers a choice among different kinds of passive restraint devices was a significant objective of the federal regulation.we reached this conclusion on the basis of our examination of the regulation,including its history,the promulgating agency contemporaneous explanation of its objectives,and the agency current views of the regulation effect.
the history showed that the department of transportation dot had long thought it important to leave manufacturers with a choice.in dot required manufacturers to install manual seat belts.geier,supra,at fed.reg.because many car occupants did not buckle up,dot began to require passive protection,such as airbags or automatic seatbelts,but without favor ing or expect ing the use of airbags.geier,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted fed.reg.dot subsequently approved the use of ignition interlocks,which froze the ignition until the occupant buckled the belt,as a substitute for passive restraints.geier,supra,at fed.reg.but the interlock devices were unpopular with the public,and congress soon forbade the agency to make them a means of compliance.geier,supra,at motor vehicle and schoolbus safety amendments of,stat.previously codified at b ed.dot then temporarily switched to the use of demonstration projects,but later it returned to mandating passive restraints,again leaving manufacturers with a choice of systems.geier,supra,at see fed.reg.
dot contemporaneous explanation of its regulation made clear that manufacturer choice was an important means for achieving its basic objectives.the regulation gradually phased in passive restraint requirements,initially requiring manufacturers to equip only of their new fleets with passive restraints.dot explained that it intended its phasing period partly to give manufacturers time to improve airbag technology and to develop other,better passive restraint systems.geier,at.dot further explained that it had rejected an all airbag system.ibid.it was worried that requiring airbags in most or all vehicles would cause a public backlash,like the backlash against interlock devices.ibid.dot also had concerns about the safety of airbags,for they could injure occupants,particularly children,at.and,given the cost of airbags,vehicle owners might not replace them when necessary,leaving occupants without passive protection.ibid.the regulation therefore deliberately sought variety a mix of several different passive restraint systems.at.dot hoped that this mix would lead to better information about the devices comparative effectiveness and to the eventual development of alternative,cheaper,and safer passive restraint systems.at.
finally,the solicitor general told us that a tort suit that insisted upon use of airbags,as opposed to other federally permissible passive restraint systems,would stan d as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of these objectives.at quoting brief for united states as amicus curiae in geier american honda motor,hereinafter united states brief in geier internal quotation marks omitted.and we gave weight to the solicitor general view in light of the fact that it bodie d the secretary policy judgment that safety would best be promoted if manufacturers installed alternative protection systems in their fleets rather than one particular system in every car.at quoting united states brief in geier.
taken together,this history,the agency contemporaneous explanation,and the government current understanding of the regulation convinced us that manufacturer choice was an important regulatory objective.and since the tort suit stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of that objective,we found the tort suit.
we turn now to the present case.like the regulation in geier,the regulation here leaves the manufacturer with a choice.and,like the tort suit in geier,the tort suit here would restrict that choice.but unlike geier,we do not believe here that choice is a significant regulatory objective.
we concede that the history of the regulation before us resembles the history of airbags to some degree.in,dot rejected a regulation that would have required the use of belts in rear seats.fed.reg.nonetheless,by when dot promulgated the present regulation,it had concluded that several factors had changed.fed.reg.
dot then required manufacturers to install a particular kind of belt,namely,belts,for rear outer seats.in respect to rear inner seats,it retained manufacturer choice as to which kind of belt to install.but its reasons for retaining that choice differed considerably from its reasons for permitting manufacturers a choice in respect to airbags.dot here was not concerned about consumer acceptance it was convinced that belts would increase safety it did not fear additional safety risks arising from use of those belts it had no interest in assuring a mix of devices and,though it was concerned about additional costs,that concern was diminishing.
in respect to consumer acceptance,dot wrote that if 
people who are familiar with and in the habit of wearing belts in the front seat find belts in the rear seat,it stands to reason that they would be more likely to wear those belts when riding in the rear seat.fed.reg.
in respect to safety,dot wrote that,because an increasing number of rear seat passengers wore seatbelts,rear seat belts would have progressively greater actual safety benefits.fed.reg.
s tudies of occupant protection from forward show that the safety belts installed in rear seating positions are effective in reducing the risk of death and injury.however,the agency believes that safety belts would be even more effective.ibid.
five years earlier,dot had expressed concern that belts might negatively impact child safety by interfering with the use of certain child car seats that relied upon a tether.but by,dot found that designs had shifted away from tethers.fed.reg.and rear belts could therefore offer safety benefits for children old enough to use them without diminishing the safety of smaller children in car seats,at t he agency believes that this proposal for rear seat belts would offer benefits for children riding in some types of booster seats,would have no positive or negative effects on children riding in most designs of car seats and children that are too small to use shoulder belts,and would offer older children the same incremental safety protection as adults nor did dot seek to use its regulation to spur the development of alternative kinds of rear aisle or middle seat safety devices.see fed.reg.
why then did dot not require belts in these seats we have found some indication that it thought use of belts in rear aisle seats could cause entry and exit problems for occupants of seating positions to the rear by stretch ing the shoulder belt across the aisleway,at.however,dot encouraged manufacturers to address this issue through innovation 
i n those cases where manufacturers are able to design and install belts at seating positions adjacent to aisleways without interfering with the aisleway purpose of allowing access to more rearward seating positions,the agency encourages the manufacturers to do so.fed.reg.
and there is little indication that dot considered this matter a significant safety concern.letter from philip recht,chief counsel,national highway traffic safety,to roger matoba,app.to reply brief for petitioners with respect to your concerns about the safety of shoulder safety belts which cross an aisle,i note that such belts do not in fact prevent rearward passengers from exiting the vehicle.such passengers may g o under or over the belt.they may also move the belt aside 
the more important reason why dot did not require belts for rear inner seats was that it thought that this requirement would not be.the agency explained that it would be significantly more expensive for manufacturers to install belts in rear middle and aisle seats than in seats next to the car doors.ibid.but that fact the fact that dot made a negative judgment about cost effectiveness can not by itself show that dot sought to forbid tort suits in which a judge or jury might reach a different conclusion.
for one thing,dot did not believe that costs would remain frozen.rather it pointed out that costs were falling as manufacturers were voluntarily equipping more and more of their vehicles with rear seat belts.ibid.for another thing,many,perhaps most,federal safety regulations embody some kind of judgment.while an agency could base a decision to on its judgment,we are satisfied that the rulemaking record at issue here discloses no such intent.and to infer from the mere existence of such a judgment that the federal agency intends to bar states from imposing stricter standards would treat all such federal standards as if they were maximum standards,eliminating the possibility that the federal agency seeks only to set forth a minimum standard potentially supplemented through state tort law.we can not reconcile this consequence with a statutory saving clause that foresees the likelihood of a continued meaningful role for state tort law.supra,at.
finally,the solicitor general tells us that dot regulation does not this tort suit.as in geier,the agency own views should make a difference.at.
congress has delegated to dot authority to implement the statute the subject matter is technical and the relevant history and background are complex and extensive.the agency is likely to have a thorough understanding of its own regulation and its objectives and is uniquely qualified to comprehend the likely impact of state requirements.ibid.
there is no reason to suspect that the solicitor general representation of dot views reflects anything other than the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter.at quoting auer robbins.
neither has dot expressed inconsistent views on this subject.in geier,the solicitor general pointed out that state tort law does not conflict with a federal minimum standard merely because state law imposes a more stringent requirement.united states brief in geier citation omitted.and the solicitor general explained that a standard giving manufacturers multiple options for the design of a device would not a suit claiming that a manufacturer should have chosen one particular option,where the secretary did not determine that the availability of options was necessary to promote safety.at see brief for united states as amicus curiae in wood general motors.this last statement describes the present case.
in geier,then,the regulation history,the agency contemporaneous explanation,and its consistently held interpretive views indicated that the regulation sought to maintain manufacturer choice in order to further significant regulatory objectives.here,these same considerations indicate the contrary.we consequently conclude that,even though the state tort suit may restrict the manufacturer choice,it does not stan d as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of federal law.hines,at.thus,the regulation does not this tort action.

as the court notes,this is not the first case in which the court has encountered the express provision and saving clause of the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of,stat,et ed.recodified without substantive change at et ed.and supp.iii.in geier american honda motor,the court concluded that the saving clause like the express provision does not bar the ordinary working of conflict principles,at,and therefore engaged in an implied analysis.the majority and dissent in geier agreed that a court should not find too readily in the absence of clear evidence of a conflict.at.
i agree with the majority resolution of this case and with its reasoning.i write separately only to emphasize the court rejection of an overreading of geier that has developed since that opinion was issued.
geier does not stand,as the california court of appeal,cal.app,cal.rptr,other courts,and some of respondents amici seem to believe,for the proposition that any time an agency gives manufacturers a choice between two or more options,a tort suit that imposes liability on the basis of one of the options is an obstacle to the achievement of a federal regulatory objective and may be.rather,geier turned on the fact that the agency,via federal motor veh
