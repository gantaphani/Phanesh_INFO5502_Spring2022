plaintiff and appellant raquel salazar salazar appeals a judgment following a grant of nonsuit in favor of her former employer,defendant and respondent diversified paratransit,diversified,and her former supervisor,defendant and respondent rudy vokoun vokoun.
the evidence showed salazar,an employee of diversified,repeatedly was subjected to sexual harassment by a client of diversified,and she reported the conduct to her employer which failed to take any corrective action.salazar quit and sued.the trial court granted nonsuit in favor of defendants on the ground the fair employment and housing act feha,et does not protect an employee from sexual harassment by an employer client or customer.
this court,in a decision,upheld that ruling.salazar then filed a petition for review which the supreme court granted.while the matter was pending in the court above,the legislature adopted ab,with the stated intent of clarifying the law and abrogating this court decision in the matter.the supreme court then transferred the matter back to this court for reconsideration in light of the new enactment.we conclude ab is a clarification of existing law and therefore governs this case.accordingly,we remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings,to be guided by the new enactment.
factual and procedural background 
diversified engages in the business of transporting developmentally disabled adults and children from their homes and care providers to day care centers and schools.vokoun supervised operations and employees at diversified long beach terminal.
three male drivers at diversified had filed written reports concerning misconduct by a passenger,one rocha,beginning on october.these reports involved rocha refusal to stay seated on the bus and his refusal to comply with a driver request to relinquish a knife rocha had in his possession.three female drivers filed reports of incidents in which rocha exposed himself to those drivers.thus,vokoun and diversified knew of these three previous incidents involving rocha exposing himself to female bus drivers.
diversified hired salazar as a bus driver in late august or early september.salazar drove a few days with another driver,david,to learn the route.rocha was a passenger on that route.on days when david taught her the route,rocha touched salazar hair and wanted to be by her side.when rocha left his seat,david told salazar to take him back to his seat.she did,and put his seat belt on,but rocha again left his seat.when she again put him back in his seat,he stared at her and made her feel uncomfortable.he called her bonita,meaning beautiful.he grabbed her purse several times and said he wanted money even though david told him not to do that.salazar was scared and felt uncomfortable around rocha from the first day she met him.she nonetheless started driving the bus on the route without david.when she found out rocha was going to be a passenger,she asked the dispatcher if she had to drive him.the dispatcher said,i guess.
when rocha rode on salazar bus,he got out of his seat and caused salazar to have to stop the bus and place him back in his seat and fasten his seat belt.after a few days,salazar reported problems with rocha to david,the dispatcher,and vokoun,and asked for a different route because she did not like how rocha looked at her and wanted to touch her all the time.
salazar filed written reports of two incidents of rocha misconduct.on september,rocha stood up and salazar stopped the bus to put him back in his seat.salazar saw that rocha zipper and belt were down and his genitals were exposed.rocha tried to grab her arms.salazar put him back in his seat and continued on her route.salazar reported the incident in writing to diversified.
after the september,incident,salazar drove the same route with no male assistant.for the next few days,although he did not expose himself,rocha continued to misbehave,which made salazar feel scared and apprehensive.on september,a second incident occurred while salazar had stopped the bus and was waiting to pick up another passenger.looking in her mirror,salazar saw rocha coming toward her.salazar tried to get out of her seat,but rocha attacked her and exposed his genitals.salazar yelled for help from nearby drivers who were waiting for passengers.she hit rocha with her arm to fight against him.rocha touched her all over and tried to put his hands under her shirt and shorts.salazar scratched his face,honked the horn,and tried to kick him.she spoke into the radio,rocha is attacking me.rocha was on top of her.he touched her with his hands and rubbed his face against her face.the attack ended when two male drivers from other buses came onto salazar bus.
salazar telephoned vokoun and told him what happened.vokoun came and drove rocha home.
salazar submitted a written report about this second incident.within two days,salazar decided she could no longer work for diversified and quit.
proceedings.
trial court proceedings.
in the operative complaint,salazar alleged four causes of action against diversified and vokoun sexual harassment in violation of the feha et,and the california constitution cal,art.i,constructive discharge in violation of public policy intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress.
the case was tried to a jury.at the conclusion of salazar case,the trial court granted nonsuit in favor of defendants,ruling the feha does not protect an employee from sexual harassment by an employer client or customer.salazar appealed.
b.this court affirmed,upholding the trial court interpretation of the statutory scheme.
on october,this court,in salazar diversified paratransit,salazar,a decision,upheld the trial court grant of nonsuit,ruling that the feha does not protect an employee from harassment by an employer clientele.
grant of review by supreme court.
on january,the supreme court granted a petition for review by salazar.it specified the issue to be determined was whether it is an unlawful employment practice under the feha f or an employer to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent harassment of an employee by a,subd.k,and accordingly whether an employer is required by the act to take all reasonable steps to prevent such harassment,subd.j.
d.the adoption of assem.bill.
on december,less than two months after the issuance of this court decision in salazar,assem.bill was introduced in the legislature to abrogate the salazar decision.the bill passed both houses,and on october,it was approved by the governor and filed with the secretary of state.
ab amended subdivision j of section to include the following provision an employer may also be responsible for the acts of nonemployees,with respect to sexual harassment of employees,applicants,or persons providing services pursuant to a contract in the workplace,where the employer,or its agents or supervisors,knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.stats,ch.
ab also includes the following declaration of legislative intent it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this act to construe and clarify the meaning and effect of existing law and to reject the interpretation given to the law in salazar diversified paratransit,th d.stats,ch.
e.the supreme court transfer of salazar back to this court in light of assem.bill.
on november,the supreme court transferred the matter back to this court for reconsideration in light of the enactment of chapter of the statutes of.
the question now presented is whether the new enactment is simply a clarification of existing law,so as to apply to the instant case.
discussion 
in this court previous decision,there was a difference of opinion with respect to the interpretation of the amendment to section,declaring it an unlawful employment practice for an employer or any other person to harass an employee.stats,ch.
in direct response to salazar,the legislature amended section,subdivision j,to expressly hold employers liable for sexual harassment of employees by nonemployees,provided the employer knew or should have known of the conduct and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.in enacting this latest amendment,the legislature declared its intent to construe and clarify the meaning and effect of existing law and to reject the interpretation given to the law in salazar.stats,ch,italics added.
following the amendment to section,the supreme court transferred salazar back to this court for reconsideration in light of the enactment of chapter of the statutes of.
the issue therefore presented is the appropriate disposition of salazar in light of the amendment to section and the supreme court transfer order.
general principles.
of assistance in the resolution of the issue is the supreme court decision in western security bank superior court cal th,d,which set forth controlling canons of statutory interpretation.
a legislative declaration of an existing statute meaning is neither binding nor conclusive in construing the statute in that ultimately,the interpretation of a statute is an exercise of the judicial power the constitution assigns to the courts.western security bank,supra,cal th at,d.
however,an amendment which in effect construes and clarifies a prior statute must be accepted as the legislative declaration of the meaning of the original act,where the amendment was adopted soon after the controversy arose concerning the proper interpretation of the statute if the amendment was enacted soon after controversies arose as to the interpretation of the original act,it is logical to regard the amendment as a legislative interpretation of the original formal the presumption of substantial change.citation.western security bank,supra,cal th at,d.here,assem.bill,abrogating salazar,was introduced on december,less than two months after the issuance of salazar.
it is recognized there is little logic and some incongruity in the notion that one legislature may speak authoritatively on the intent of an earlier legislature enactment when a gulf of decades separates the two bodies.citation.nevertheless,the legislature expressed views as here on the prior import of its statutes are entitled to due consideration,and we can not disregard them.western security bank,supra,cal th at,d.
therefore,a subsequent expression of the legislature as to the intent of the prior statute,although not binding on the court,may properly be used in determining the effect of a prior act.citation.moreover,even if the court does not accept the legislature assurance that an unmistakable change in the law is merely a clarification,the declaration of intent may still effectively reflect the legislature purpose to achieve a retrospective change.citation.whether a statute should apply retrospectively or only prospectively is,in the first instance,a policy question for the legislative body enacting the statute.citation.thus,where a statute provides that it clarifies or declares existing law,i t is obvious that such a provision is indicative of a legislative intent that the amendment apply to all existing causes of action from the date of its enactment.in accordance with the general rules of statutory construction,we must give effect to this intention unless there is some constitutional objection thereto.citations.western security bank,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.in sum,when the legislature clearly intends a statute to operate retrospectively,we are obliged to carry out that intent unless due process considerations prevent us.citation,at,d.
the legislature declared intent to clarify existing law stats,ch,application of the principles of western security bank,supra,cal th,d,and the supreme court order transferring salazar back to this court in light of the legislative enactment,inform the resolution of the issue herein.
section previously was somewhat ambiguous with respect to an employer liability for clientele harassment assem.bill clarified the statute to expressly hold an employer liable for harassment by a nonemployee.
in adopting ab,the legislature declared its intent to clarify the meaning and effect of existing law and to reject the interpretation given to the law in salazar.stats,ch.as indicated,ab was adopted swiftly after this controversy arose concerning the proper interpretation of section.therefore,it is appropriate to accept the legislature declaration in ab that rather than effecting a substantive change,it was merely clarifying section.western security bank,supra,cal th at,d.
further,as reflected in the differences of opinion expressed in salazar with respect to the proper interpretation of section,the statute was somewhat ambiguous and in need of clarification.
on the one hand,the preamble to the amendment to section specifically referred to protecting employees from sexual harassment by an employer clientele.stats,ch,italics added.this was a point stressed in justice klein concurring and dissenting opinion when the matter was previously before us.
on the other hand,the legislative history leading up to the amendment provided support for a contrary,more restrictive,interpretation of section.the april,amendment to sb,modifying section,subdivision i,stated it was an unlawful employment practice for an employer,or any other person,because of race,religious creed,color,national origin,ancestry,physical handicap,medical condition,marital status,sex,or age,to harass an employee or an applicant.harassment of an employee or applicant by any person an employee other than an agent or supervisor shall be unlawful if the entity,or its agents or supervisors,knows or should have known of this conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.amend.to bill reg.sess,first italics added,subsequent italics in original.
with respect to the reason for this amendment,senator watson stated in a june,memorandum to her fellow senators regarding bill the bill does not hold an employer responsible for outside harassment.this was amended out of the bill in the senate industrial relations committee.italics added.
the lead opinion in salazar also relied on a june,letter from senator watson to michael breining,legal counsel for the california manufacturers association,stating your letter expresses concern over employer responsibility for customer harassment.this provision has been amended out of the bill.
the lead opinion in salazar focused on these statements by senator watson in concluding section did not protect employees from customer harassment.
obviously,there was a glaring inconsistency between the preamble specific reference to protecting employees from sexual harassment by an employer clientele stats,ch,and senator watson assertions that protection from outside harassment or customer harassment had been amended out of the bill.the lead opinion in salazar treated the clientele language in the preamble as a drafting error and adopted senator watson understanding of bill.
conversely,the concurring and dissenting opinion in salazar placed particular emphasis on the preamble,gave no weight to senator watson personal views,and concluded section held an employer liable for sexual harassment of an employee by the employer clientele.the concurring and dissenting opinion in salazar reasoned that any conflict between the watson legislative memorandum and the subsequently enacted statute must be resolved in favor of the statute because it is the language of the statute itself that has successfully braved the legislative gauntlet.people snook cal th,d.
the legislature then weighed in on the issue and clarified section to eliminate this ambiguity.it expressly abrogated the salazar majority interpretation of section and amended the statute to specify that an employer is liable for sexual harassment of an employee by a nonemployee under certain circumstances.
we conclude assem.bill is nothing more than a clarification of section.thus,an employer may be held liable under the feha for sexual harassment by clients or customers.because assem.bill is a clarification of section,rather than a substantive change,it applies to this case.therefore,the matter shall be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings,guided by the legislature clarification of the statute.
disposition 
the judgment and postjudgment orders re attorney fees and costs are reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.salazar shall recover costs on appeal.
i respectfully dissent.
in,rocha,a client of defendant diversified paratransit,sexually harassed plaintiff salazar.diversified paratransit and its employees did not sexually harass salazar.in,the legislature rejected a proposed amendment to government code section the statute at issue here,which would have made employers like diversified paratransit liable for sexual harassment by clients like rocha.therefore in,when rocha sexually harassed salazar,the law gave no notice to diversified paratransit that it could be liable for rocha actions.although the legislature stated that assembly bill merely clarified existing law,abundant evidence shows that assembly bill made significant,substantive changes in the law,expanding the scope of employer liability and the scope of a plaintiff cause of action against an employer for sexual harassment by its clients under the california fair employment and housing act.the legislature can not change the rules of the game to make employers liable for past sexual harassment of employees by,customers,or clients.indeed,the legislature disregarded its own recognition of this principle in section,subdivision j.for these reasons assembly bill should apply prospectively only,should have no effect on this appeal,and should not alter this court decision filed on october.the judgment for defendants should be affirmed and the order awarding attorney fees to defendants should be reversed.
assembly bill did not clarify the law and the legislature did not attempt to make assembly bill retroactive.the substantive changes in assembly bill should apply prospectively only 
as relevant to his appeal,assembly bill added two sentences to subparagraphs in subdivision j of section and added an uncodified statement of legislative intent as section,chapter of the statutes of 
the question is whether assembly bill applies to conduct occurring in,or whether the amendment applies only to conduct occurring after january,the date assembly bill became effective.i find the latter assembly bill applies only prospectively.
rules governing prospective or retroactive application of statutory amendments and the interpretation of a legislative declaration that an amendment construes and clarifies existing law 
the legislature stated that assembly bill construed and clarified the meaning and effect of existing law.the legislature did not declare any intent to make assembly bill retroactive.
a retroactive law affects rights,obligations,acts,transactions,and conditions which exist or are performed before the statute takes effect.a statute which increases a party liability for past conduct is a retroactive statute.myers philip morris companies,cal th,d.
the theory against applying a statute retroactively is that parties affected have no notice of a new law affecting conduct already past.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d.the california supreme court has stated that the principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal.myers philip morris companies,supra,cal th at,d,quoting landgraf usi film products,d.california courts presume that statutes operate prospectively unless the legislature clearly manifests its contrary intent.the presumption of prospective application of a statute will govern unless the statute contains an express retroactivity provision or extrinsic sources make it very clear that the legislature must have intended retroactive application.myers philip morris companies,supra,cal th at,d.
a corollary to these rules is that a statute that merely clarifies,rather than changes,existing law does not operate retrospectively even if applied to transactions predating its enactment.western security bank superior court cal th,d,italics omitted.such a legislative act has no retrospective effect because the true meaning of the statute remains the same.ibid.where an unmistakable substantive change in the law has occurred,however,the court is not bound to accept a legislative statement that an amendment merely clarifies and restates the original statutory terms.riley hilton hotels th,d,citing california emp.com.payne cal d,jarvis cory cal d,w here a declaration is in irremediable conflict with a statute substantive provisions,courts will not blindly bow to the legislature stated interpretation.
the question in this case is whether the legislature,in enacting assembly bill,construed and clarified the meaning and application of existing law or substantively changed it.
b.the presumption that statutory amendments have prospective effect governs this appeal 
assembly bill substantively changed section,subdivision j by expanding the scope of employer liability for sexual harassment 
abundant evidence shows that assembly bill did not construe and clarify existing law,and instead substantively revised section,subdivision j to expand the scope of employer liability for sexual harassment.
the two new sentences in assembly bill derive from an equal employment opportunity commission eeoc regulation concerning sexual harassment.e.in,the legislature incorporated other parts of this eeoc regulation into section,subdivision j the legislature amendments,however,did not incorporate the two sentences from the eeoc regulation which assembly bill has now added to section,subdivision j.those two sentences did not appear in subdivision j until assembly bill added them,and previous versions of subdivision j provided no basis for inferring their presence.that the legislature rejected the option of incorporating these two sentences in,and did not incorporate them into the statute until it enacted assembly bill in,constitutes evidence that assembly bill substantively changed the statute rather than merely clarifying and construing it.
in addition,a bill proposed to the legislature in would have made an employer liable for harassment of an employee or applicant by any person,not just by or supervisors.bill,as introduced,italics added.an amendment to the proposed bill,however,specifically narrowed an employer potential liability,and the legislature ultimately enacted an amended version of the bill prohibiting h arassment of an employee or applicant by an employee.stats,ch,italics added.notably,the author of the statute,senator diane watson,specifically acknowledged that the statute enacted did not make employers liable for customer harassment.in,assembly bill broadened employers liability by specifying that pursuant to subdivision j,an employer may now be responsible for the acts of,with respect to sexual harassment of employees.italics added.by adding sexual harassment of employees by,such as customers and clients,to section,subdivision j,assembly bill newly expanded the scope of employer liability.
assembly bill significantly revises section,subdivision j in another way.former section,subdivision j and did not distinguish between various forms of harassment.these statutes made it an unlawful employment practice for another employee,or for an employer,to harass an employee because of race,religious creed,color,national origin,ancestry,physical disability,mental disability,medical condition,marital status,sex,age,or sexual orientation.by comparison to this broad liability for any form of prohibited harassment by an employer or an employee,assembly bill singles out sexual harassment and makes an employer responsible only for a nonemployee sexual harassment of an employee.former section,subdivision j did not treat sexual harassment differently from the numerous other forms of prohibited harassment assembly bill does,and thus does more than simply construe and clarify existing law.by imposing new duties and obligations on employers,assembly bill added a new basis of employer liability for sexual harassment by a,such as a client or customer.
assembly bill also added new conditions which apply only to employer responsibility for nonemployees sexual harassment of employees.assembly bill did not apply
