the department of motor vehicles the dmv suspended darrell morgenstern license to drive following his arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol dui based on results of a breath test showing that his concentration bac was in excess of the legal limit.the superior court granted morgenstern petition for writ of administrative mandamus and ordered the dmv to set aside its suspension order because the arresting officer failed to sign the portion of the sworn arrest report certifying that he obtained morgenstern breath test samples in the regular course of his duties,that he was qualified to operate the equipment and that he administered the test in accordance with applicable regulations.the dmv appeals,arguing evidence code section creates a presumption that the officer properly administered the breath test with properly operating equipment,which presumption was not rebutted here,or alternatively,that the officer sworn testimony at the hearing was sufficient to establish the foundational requirements for the reliability of the test results.we agree that the statutory presumption applies and,even if it did not,the dmv evidence was sufficient,and thus reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
in the evening of may,california highway patrol officer thomas eglin stopped morgenstern after observing the latter weaving and driving in between the lanes on northbound interstate.all other dates are in except as otherwise noted.while speaking with morgenstern,eglin smelled alcohol and morgenstern admitted that he had been drinking with coworkers.at eglin request,morgenstern got out of the car and eglin could see that morgenstern had bloodshot eyes,slurred speech and an unsteady gait.morgenstern failed a series of field sobriety tests,and a preliminary test indicated he had a bac of percent.
officer eglin arrested morgenstern for dui.while transporting morgenstern to jail,eglin informed him that he was required to submit to a chemical test to determine his bac.morgenstern chose to submit to a breath test that showed he had a bac of percent.eglin filled out a sworn statement on dmv form ds,setting forth the facts on which he relied as probable cause for the stop and for the arrest.the sworn statement also contained a section relating to the results of the chemical test,which eglin filled out to indicate that morgenstern tested twice as having a bac of percent.eglin neglected,however,to sign the breath test operator certification,which provided 
i certify under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of california,that the above breath test sample results were obtained in the regular course of my duties.i further certify that i am qualified to operate this equipment and that the test was administered pursuant to the requirements of title of the california code of regulations.
eglin did sign a statement at the bottom of the ds form certifying under penalty of perjury that the information on both sides of the officer statement is true and correct.he also served morgenstern with a suspension order and temporary driver license,which indicated in part that morgenstern breath test results showed a bac of percent or more.
morgenstern requested an administrative hearing on the suspension order.at the july hearing,the dmv presented officer eglin sworn statement and his unsworn dui investigation report of the circumstances surrounding the arrest.morgenstern stipulated that eglin had probable cause to stop and arrest him,but objected to the sufficiency of the sworn statement as evidence of his bac in light of the lack of the operator certification.eglin testified that in his rush to fill out the sworn statement,he neglected to sign the certification,but that he could have truthfully signed the certification at that time.
the administrative hearing officer issued a decision finding that officer eglin had reasonable cause to believe morgenstern was driving under the influence,that he had lawfully placed morgenstern under arrest and that morgenstern bac was percent or higher.morgenstern sought departmental review of the hearing officer decision,and the dmv affirmed the suspension of his license.
morgenstern filed a petition for administrative writ of mandamus in the superior court,alleging that the hearing officer acted arbitrarily,made a determination that was not supported by competent evidence,erroneously interpreted the law and exceeded its authority in suspending his license.morgenstern contended that officer eglin failure to sign the operator certification rendered the sworn report invalid as evidence of his bac at the time of his arrest,and thus the hearing officer finding regarding his bac was unsupported in the record.
the trial court agreed,finding that the evidence code section presumption was inapplicable in light of the officer failure to sign the certification,and that because the statutory scheme required the officer to fill out the form ds at or near the time of arrest,the dmv could not rely on the officer sworn testimony at the hearing to establish matters omitted from the form.it entered judgment granting morgenstern writ petition and ordering the dmv to set aside its suspension order.the dmv appeals.
