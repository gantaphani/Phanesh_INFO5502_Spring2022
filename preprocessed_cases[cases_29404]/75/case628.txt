this is the third time we have been called upon to address disputes related to the norman branch,a stretch of railroad in southwestern arkansas.on may,after extensive administrative proceedings and subsequent to our decisions in caddo antoine and little missouri railroad company united states,cir caddo antoine and gs roofing products company surface transportation board,cir gs roofing i,the surface transportation board board consolidated and issued rulings on three cases involving the norman branch.first,pursuant to the feeder line provisions now found in,the board ordered the arkansas midland railroad company amr to sell the norman branch to the caddo antoine and little missouri railroad company caddo antoine,a noncarrier subsidiary of the dardanelle russell railroad company,and set the purchase price at the net liquidation value of the entire line the feeder line case.second,the board set compensation for trackage rights on the southernmost three miles of the norman branch at per car the compensation case.finally,the board found amr liable to two shippers for damages in the amount of the damages case.in this consolidated petition,we review each of the board holdings.we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
background 
relevant facts 
our recitation of the relevant facts relies heavily on our opinions in caddo antoine and gs roofing i,as well as on the board summary of the background of this case in its may,decision.
amr acquired the norman branch line from union pacific railroad in.the line extends from milepost,near gurdon,arkansas,to milepost,near birds mill,arkansas.the principal shipper on the line,international paper company international paper,is located approximately miles from gurdon,where the line connects at its southern end with union pacific main line.the line also serves gs roofing products company,gs roofing,hanson aggregates west,previously known as company,and bean lumber company and curt bean lumber company bean lumber collectively,the shippers.the shippers are all located on the northern part of the norman branch.
on or about december,a severe storm caused washouts at mileposts and of the norman branch.on december,amr announced that the resulting poor track conditions required it to embargo service to gs roofing and to bean lumber.amr extended the embargo to on february.it continued to provide service to international paper company,however,over the southern section of the line.
after the embargo was imposed,the shippers entered into negotiations with amr and union pacific in an attempt to restore service on the norman branch.although union pacific offered financial assistance in excess of million to aid in service on the line,amr concluded that it required at least an additional to rehabilitate the norman branch and accordingly refused to make repairs or restore service.in february of,amr indicated its intention to abandon the entire norman branch.shortly thereafter,however,amr determined that it would continue to provide rail service to international paper by continuing to operate only the southernmost section of track.
the prospect of discontinuance of rail service to the shippers precipitated three related actions before the interstate commerce commission icc first,at the request of the shippers,caddo antoine filed a feeder line application under formerly to acquire the entire norman branch and resume service to the shippers the feeder line case.second,caddo antoine requested that the icc issue a directed service order pursuant to former that would allow it to begin immediate operations over the entire norman branch the compensation case.third,the shippers filed a complaint against amr seeking damages for injuries allegedly resulting from the embargo the damages case.
after extensive administrative and judicial proceedings,as described below,the board directed the parties to work with an administrative law judge in an attempt to reach a negotiated resolution of the three cases.on january,the shippers notified the board that mediation attempts with the alj had failed and requested that the board rule on the three pending cases.accordingly,the board consolidated the three cases and,on may,issued the decision giving rise to this appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a and.
procedural history 
the feeder line case 
the staggers rail act of,now codified at,was enacted to address concerns about the deteriorating rail service provided on some of the secondary railroad lines throughout the country.caddo antoine,at.in furtherance of this goal,congress authorized the board,under particular circumstances,to force the sale of a railroad line at its constitutional minimum value to a financially responsible person.b.the act further provides that the constitutional minimum value of a particular railroad line shall be presumed to be not less than the net liquidation value of such line or the going concern value of such line,whichever is greater.b.
on march,in response to amr service embargo,caddo antoine filed a feeder line application for the forced sale of the norman branch.while this application was pending,amr entered into a lease and option to purchase agreement with glenwood southern railroad company for the northern portion of the line,the section providing service to the shippers.after the icc disallowed this action,glenwood southern filed a competing feeder line application for forced sale of the norman branch,which the icc also denied.thereafter,on april,the icc partially granted caddo antoine feeder line application,forcing the sale of the northern portion of the norman branch,but refusing to direct the sale of the southern section of track that amr was continuing to operate to provide service to international paper.caddo antoine declined to acquire only part of the norman branch and petitioned for judicial review of the board decision.on september,we reversed the board attempt to bifurcate the line and remanded for further consideration of caddo antoine application to purchase the entire norman branch.caddo antoine.
accordingly,the board reopened the feeder line proceedings and directed the filing of additional evidence related to caddo antoine application to purchase the norman branch,including updated information on the constitutional minimum value of the line.in august of,the board granted caddo antoine feeder line application for the sale of the norman branch,setting the purchase price at,which was the sum of the net liquidation value nlv of the northern portion of the line and the going concern value gcv of the southern portion of the line.
amr subsequently sought administrative reconsideration of the purchase price,arguing that the board had underestimated the gcv of the southern segment of the line.the shippers also urged reconsideration,arguing that our holding in caddo antoine foreclosed the use of nlv for the northern part of the track and gcv for the southern portion of the line and,alternatively,that the board had erred in calculating the gcv of the southern portion of the line.
in its may,decision,the board reconsidered the purchase price of the norman branch and concluded that its initial calculation of the gcv of the southern portion of the line was inaccurate.the board furthermore concluded that the supplemented record did not contain sufficient information to calculate an accurate gcv for the southern section of the norman branch.the board also questioned the propriety,in light of our holding in caddo antoine,of combining the nlv of the northern part of the norman branch with the gcv of the southern portion of the line.accordingly,the board revalued the norman branch at the nlv of the entire line,setting the purchase price at.
the compensation case 
in march of,the icc denied caddo antoine request for directed service over the norman branch pursuant to former,finding that caddo antoine had failed to satisfy the statutory requirements.instead,the commission issued a service order authorizing caddo antoine to provide voluntary interim rail service over the northern portion of the norman branch,contingent on amr agreement and pursuant to former a.the icc also authorized caddo antoine to contract with amr to operate overhead trackage rights on the southern portion of the norman branch,thereby allowing caddo antoine to connect with the union pacific line and operate over the southern section of the tracks still owned and operated by amr.the icc ordered caddo antoine to compensate amr for these trackage rights at a commercially reasonable rate.
caddo antoine began operations in april of and continued until august of,when the east texas central railroad company took over service.the railroads have been unable,however,to agree on a commercially reasonable rate of compensation for the trackage rights over the southern three miles of the norman branch.initially,caddo antoine offered per car,and subsequently it increased its offer to per car.amr sought payment of per car.eventually,at the urging of the icc,caddo antoine petitioned the icc to determine the commercially reasonable rate to be paid for trackage rights.
in june of,the icc directed the parties to submit evidence on the commercially reasonable value of trackage rights over the southern tip of the norman branch and determined that it would apply its standard formula in addressing the issue.in june of,the board,acknowledging that the evidence in the record was not entirely sufficient,set compensation at per car.caddo antoine filed an administrative appeal,which the board denied in september of.subsequent to our decision in caddo antoine,the board reopened and stayed its orders in the compensation case.finally,in its may,decision,the board reaffirmed the use of its standard formula for determining trackage rights,but reduced compensation from to per car,the amount originally requested by amr.
the damages case 
as common carriers,railroads have an obligation to provide rail service upon reasonable request.a.this obligation is not absolute,however.gs roofing i,at.a valid embargo,defined as an emergency measure placed in effect because of some disability on the part of the carrier which makes the latter unable properly to perform its duty as a common carrier,id.at,will relieve a carrier of its obligation to provide rail service,id.to be valid,an embargo must be reasonable.id.if the board determines that an embargo is unreasonable,a rail carrier may be liable for damages pursuant to b.
the shippers filed a complaint against amr on march,seeking damages resulting from the embargo on the norman branch that were incurred from december,through april.in march of,the board rejected the claims for damages,finding that amr had acted reasonably in suspending service after the washouts and that it was reasonable for amr not to repair the line.
on petition for review,we reversed the board decision regarding the reasonableness of amr actions.gs roofing i,at.although we agreed with the board that the initial embargo on the line was reasonable in light of the flooding and washouts,we concluded that amr failure to repair the track was unreasonable and that amr was accordingly liable to the shippers for damages.id.at.we therefore remanded the case so that the board might calculate the amount of damages owed to the shippers.
on remand,the board concluded that amr was liable for damages that occurred from december,the date that amr should have resumed service on the norman branch,through april,when caddo antoine began providing service on the line.although the shippers sought damages totaling,plus interest,the board determined,inter alia,that claims for lost profits were too speculative and that it had no authority to award compensation for attorney fees.the board accordingly limited damages to those related to alternate transportation utilized during the embargo and the cost of the construction of an interim loading facility.specifically,the board awarded,plus interest,to bean lumber,and,plus interest to gs roofing.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
our scope of review in this matter is narrow.gs roofing i,at.we are required to give considerable deference to the board interpretation of the statutes and regulations it is entrusted to administer,grain and feed ass united states,cir,and we will not disturb the board decision absent compelling indications that the board interpretations were incorrect.caddo antoine,at.we may ask only whether,in those cases in which congress has not directly addressed the precise question at hand,the board action is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.notwithstanding this narrow standard of review,we are nevertheless obligated to ensure that proper legal standards were correctly applied.city of cherokee icc,cir.
b.the feeder line case 
although amr does not contest the board decision to force the sale of the norman branch,it petitions for review of the board calculation of the constitutional minimum value of the line.amr argues that the board violated by failing to calculate a gcv and instead setting the purchase price at nlv.from amr perspective,the plain meaning of requires the board to calculate both a nlv and a gcv figure for a line.the board was therefore obligated,amr contends,to calculate gcv or to explicitly conclude that a line has a gcv of zero.stated otherwise,amr contends that the board obligation under the statute is to find two values and then pick the highest.because in this instance the board simply concluded that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate gcv,amr argues we owe no deference to the board decision and that the purchase price of must be set aside.
as previously discussed,b directs the board to set the purchase price for the forced sale of a rail line at not less than the constitutional minimum value,which is defined as not less than the net liquidation value of such line or the going concern value of such line,whichever is greater,b.contrary to amr contentions,we conclude that the statute does not require the board to calculate a gcv when the board reasonably concludes,as it did in this case,that the evidence is insufficient to establish an accurate figure.here,the board reached this conclusion only after receiving two rounds of evidence on the constitutional minimum value of the norman branch.to require the board to calculate gcv under these circumstances would either obligate the board to base its gcv figure on unreliable evidence,which we are confident the statute does not require,or would obligate the board to consider potentially endless submissions of unreliable evidence,a no more plausible procedure.we conclude that congress intended neither of these alternatives and that therefore does not require the board to calculate gcv when it concludes that the evidence is insufficient to enable it to do so.we have reviewed the board analysis of the valuation evidence,and we conclude that it acted reasonably in finding that the evidence was insufficient to establish a reliable gcv for the norman branch.we furthermore conclude that the board decision to establish the purchase price for the norman branch at the nlv of the entire line was entirely reasonable given the lack of evidence establishing gcv.
amr also contends that the board arbitrarily misapplied its traditional burden of proof rules in this case and that we must accordingly set aside the board purchase price.according to amr,the board feeder line regulations and case law place the burden of proof on all valuation issues on the feeder line applicant.amr therefore argues that caddo antoine bore the burden of producing evidence on the constitutional minimum value of the norman branch.amr furthermore contends that because caddo antoine failed to satisfy its burden,the board was obligated to utilize amr gcv values in determining the constitutional minimum value of the line.
in our view,the record supports the board contention that it does not,as a rule,impose upon the appellant the burden establishing the constitutional minimum value of a line,although we acknowledge that certain of the cases cited by amr suggest that the board may have done so in certain past situations.see,cheney railroad,v aluation disputes are resolved according to the burden of proof.the burden is on the offeror as proponent of the relief requested.sand
