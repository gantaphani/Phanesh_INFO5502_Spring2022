this appeal presents the pointed question of whether particular regulations promulgated pursuant to the federal aviation act the faa or the act create a private right of action.because we find that recent supreme court precedent forecloses the implication of a private right of action here,we affirm the district court entry of judgment for the defendants.
we marshal only those facts necessary to understand and resolve the issue before us,extracting those facts from the second amended complaint.we urge the reader who hungers for additional background to consult the lower court opinion.see bonano caribbean airline,d.
miguel bonano contracted with east caribbean airline corporation for air transportation and related travel services between ponce,puerto rico and other destinations in the united states.east caribbean was to furnish these services at divers times between september,and january.in,however,east caribbean ceased operations.it thereafter defaulted on its remaining contractual obligations including its obligation to return monies advanced by the appellant.
on july,the appellant brought suit in the federal district court his complaint named east caribbean and a gallimaufry of other defendants.it alleged,inter alia,violations of the regulations promulgated under the act.see,f k,these allegations comprise the sole basis of federal subject matter jurisdiction.
the case progressed at a snail pace.during this evolutionary process,the appellant obtained a default judgment against east caribbean the district court dismissed several defendants,including banco popular de puerto rico and citibank alleged to have been depositories for certain funds that east caribbean had agreed to escrow and the court bid farewell to east caribbean chief executive officer,benny rosado,due to a failure of service of process.none of these orders has been appealed.
the operative pleading appellant second amended a slightly refined version of the same claims against a subset of defendants.these defendants include the puerto rico ports authority the local licensing agency for aeronautical matters,herman sulsona and h√©ctor rivera officials of the authority,miguel casillas general manager of the mercedita airport,royal insurance company,and royal and sun alliance the latter two defendants are allegedly east caribbean insurers.acting on that pleading,the district court dismissed the case against all these defendants.bonano,d at.
because this order of dismissal provoked the instant appeal,we trace the anatomy of the district court decision.the court first found that it had jurisdiction over the claims asserted in the appellant second amended complaint.id.at.it then determined that the regulations promulgated in pursuance of the act afforded an aggrieved party,such as the appellant,a private right of action.id.at.the court nonetheless found that the claims were barred by the applicable rule of timeliness.id.at.
the defendants have not appealed from the lower court determination that a private right of action existed.but this determination is the linchpin of federal jurisdiction in this case the appellant premises jurisdiction on claims that supposedly arise under federal law,a,and without a cause of action under the act or the regulations,no such jurisdiction would attach.see,sam majors jewelers abx,cir statland am.airlines,cir see also templeton bd.of sewer comm rs am.tissue mills of,cir.because arguments that affect a court subject matter jurisdiction are not waivable,see united states horn,cir,we consider ourselves to determine first whether a private right exists.
this conclusion brings us face to face with the question of whether congress intended private enforcement of the faa.that is a question of statutory interpretation and,thus,engenders de novo review.see,strickland comm r,me.dep t of human,cir see also rolland romney,cir.
we begin with the obvious congress,with a single exception not applicable here,but discussed infra,has not explicitly provided for private enforcement of the act.consequently,if a private right of action exists,it must be implied.in recent years,the supreme court has clarified the principles that must be used to determine the existence vel non of an implied private right of action.see gonzaga doe,d alexander sandoval,d.those clarifying decisions necessarily guide our analysis.
a private right of action,like substantive federal law itself,must be created by congress.see sandoval,at.the judiciary task is to interpret the statute that congress has enacted in order to determine what the statute reveals about congress intentions.transam.mortg.advisors,lewis,d.
for a court to find the existence of a private right of action,it must affirmatively answer two inquiries.the first involves whether congress intended to create a private right.gonzaga,at.the second involves whether congress intended to create a corresponding remedy.id.at.the latter inquiry sometimes is superfluous if a statute does not grant a private right,an inquiring court need go no further.see id.at.
the district court premised its determination that an implied private right of action existed largely on providing an enforcement scheme for part,see supra note.bonano,d at.but the language of the regulation itself does not appear to contemplate private enforcement.in terms,the regulation provides that in the case of any violation of the act the violator may be subject to a proceeding pursuant to the act before the department or a district court to compel compliance therewith or for civil or criminal penalties pursuant to the provisions of the act.this language,read naturally,does no more than confirm the statutorily authorized rights of those rights do not include private rights of action.in all events,a regulation,on its own,can not create a private right of action.see sandoval,at.the source of any such right must be found in the text of the statute.see id.
we turn,then,to the act,examining its text with an eye toward determining whether it manifests congressional intent to create a private right of action.in that exercise,we are mindful that a statute ought not be read to create a private right of action unless its text is phrased in terms of the persons benefited.gonzaga,at.quoting cannon of,d.if a statute does not cede private rights to an identifiable class,it fails on the first prong of the test.sandoval,at.
the act cedes no such rights.congress originally enacted the faa in.see pub,stat.the purpose of the legislation was to establish a new federal agency with powers adequate to enable it to provide for the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace,reprinted in.as this makes clear,the act is regulatory in private rights of action should rarely be implied where a statute core function is to furnish directives to a federal agency.see statland,at.
moreover,the act,fairly read,comprises a general regulation of activities and does not focus on a benefited class.such a regime is precisely the kind of general ban which carries with it no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.california sierra club,d.when congress designs regulatory legislation to benefit the general public,rather than any particular class,that configuration suggests that the legislation is likely to be infertile territory for the implication of a private right of action.see id.at.airways,hope,cir.indeed,for a statute to create private rights of action,its text must be phrased in terms of the class protected.gonzaga,at.emphasis supplied internal quotation marks omitted.
to cinch matters,the scheme of enforcement actually spelled out in the act counsels persuasively against implying a private right of action.for one thing,under,the secretary of transportation has power to conduct investigations,prescribe regulations,and issue orders.other provisions of the act share this emphasis on official involvement.see,id.noting that a person may file a complaint in writing with the secretary of transportation about a person violating this part or a requirement prescribed under this part and providing further that the secretary shall investigate the complaint if a reasonable ground appears
