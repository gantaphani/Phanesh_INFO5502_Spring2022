determination of property tax for south carolina property 
this case concerns the differences between how ad valorem taxes are determined in south carolina for railroad property and how they are determined for most other commercial and industrial property.for each group,the determination is a process.
in the first step,all property subject to taxation in south carolina is appraised for assessment purposes at its purported true value,which is fair market value.code.the methods used for such appraisals vary,however.see,code b.south carolina law specifically provides that railroads are assessed under the unit valuation method.see code b.under that method,an appraiser values the operating properties of an interstate company as an integrated whole without regard to the value of its component parts.south carolina generally calculates railroad system values based on the income the property is earning once the total value of all of a railroad real and personal property throughout the united states is determined in this fashion,the next step in the unit valuation process is to allocate the portion of the system value that represents the value of the railroad property in south carolina finally,property that has already been taxed or that is is subtracted,yielding an appraised value.
once south carolina has determined the appraised value of a taxpayer property in the state,the next step in the process is the application of a statutory assessment ratio.see code.the south carolina general assembly has established statutory assessment ratios that apply to various types of property,and for railroad property,the ratio is.see code g.applying the statutory assessment ratio to the appraised value of a taxpayer property yields the assessed value,against which the property tax rate is generally applied and property taxes are levied and collected.
however,in the case of property owned or leased by transportation companies for hire,including railroads,there is an additional step that precedes the application of the property tax rate.to the assessed value of such property,south carolina applies an equalization factor,which is a reduction that these companies receive to help negate disparities between the fair market valuation of their properties and those of other and manufacturing properties.see code g.once the appropriate equalization factor is applied,the resulting assessed value is distributed to the various south carolina counties and cities in which the company operates and these entities in turn apply their local tax rates to determine the taxes the railroad must pay.
the primary focus of this appeal is the south carolina real property valuation reform act scva,which the south carolina general assembly enacted in.see code et.the scva generally limits increases in appraised values of commercial and industrial real properties to within a particular period see code b.the scva does not apply,however,to r eal property valued by the unit valuation concept.code d.because railroad property is valued by that method,railroads do not benefit from the cap.it is that difference between the way south carolina law treats railroad property and the way it treats other commercial and industrial property that is the subject of the present case.
in,congress enacted the act to restore the financial stability of the railway system of the united states,among other purposes.a,stat.in order to achieve this goal,congress targeted state and local taxation schemes that discriminate against railroads.see burlington oklahoma tax comm n.the portion of the act at issue here,now codified at,bars states and localities from engaging in four categories of conduct.

facts procedural history 
csxt is a common carrier by railroad operating in states,including south carolina.csxt brought this action in federal district court against the south carolina department of revenue and its director collectively,the state.csxt complaint alleges that the state calculated the unit value of its property,applied the appropriate equalization factor,and arrived at an assessed value of for the tax year.csxt alleges that in the period between the and tax years,south carolina appraisal of csxt real operating property has increased approximately.csxt claims that because csxt is not allowed to benefit from the scva caps that apply to other commercial and industrial real property,the property taxes imposed for the tax year will discriminate against csxt.csxt complaint requests a judgment declaring that excluding csxt from the benefit of the scva caps violates b b,which prohibits the imposition of another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.it also requests preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the assessment,levying,or collection of taxes based on appraised values for csxt real property that have increased more than during a period.
on the same day that csxt filed its complaint,it also filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the assessment,levy,or collection of taxes based on an assessed value for its property for tax year that was greater than the amount the act allowed.the state opposed csxt motion,contending that the scva cap was actually an exemption and thus that,under the reasoning of department of revenue acf industries,acf,the cap could not be challenged as discriminatory under b.however,after a hearing,the district court granted csxt motion for a preliminary injunction,concluding that acf was factually distinguishable from the current case and that csxt had presented sufficient evidence to give the court reasonable cause to believe the state had violated the act.
the state then moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on the basis that b,under which csxt brought its challenge,does not apply to property taxes.see fed.civ.b.the district court denied the motion,and the case proceeded to a bench trial.
following the trial,the district court granted judgment against csxt on the basis that csxt had not shown that it was challenging the imposition of a tax,within the meaning of b.see csx,south carolina dep t of,wl june.the court reasoned that csxt was challenging the scva,which does not impose a tax but only caps increases in appraised values within the context of an tax scheme.id.at.the court added that although csxt is precluded from challenging the scva under b,b provides an avenue for challenging an overall,unfavorable tax assessment.id.at.indeed,the court suggested that it was the possibility of a b challenge that had justified its earlier grant of preliminary injunctive relief.see id.
in the end,however,the court concluded that csxt failed to meet its burden of proving discrimination under subsection b because b may not be used to challenge the cap.id.having rejected csxt b challenge on that basis,the court did not address the state arguments that csxt had not proven a b violation,including arguments that the scva limit was essentially an exemption that could not be challenged under the act and arguments that csxt had not suffered discrimination see id.
ii.legal analysis 
in an appeal arising from a bench trial,we may set aside findings of fact only if they are clearly erroneous,but we review legal conclusions de novo.williams sandman,cir.
csxt maintains that the district court erred in concluding that csxt failed to challenge the imposition of a tax within the meaning of b.we agree.
as we have noted,b bars states and divisions thereof from i mpos ing another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.b.because the words impose and tax are not defined in the act,we look to the ordinary definition of those words see csx,alabama dep t of csx i,noting that tax is not defined in act and thus giving the word its ordinary meaning.here,it was undisputed that property taxes were to be imposed for the tax year based on the assessed value of csxt property.the district court observation that the scva does not itself impose taxes is immaterial.see id.at explaining that railroad challenged the imposition of taxes within the meaning of b when the railroad claimed the imposition of the taxes discriminated against it because other taxpayers were exempted from having to pay the taxes see also burlington huddleston,cir.holding that property tax violated b when intangible personal property such as computer software was generally exempt from taxation but was not so for railroads,overruled in part on other grounds by alabama dep t of csx,csx ii,burlington bair,cir.holding that property tax violated b because vast majority of taxpayers received significant reductions in their assessed values for personal property but railroads did not noting that t his type of de jure discrimination clearly falls within the prohibition of b.csxt action plainly challenged the imposition of a tax.
assuming that csxt did actually challenge the imposition of a tax,the state argues alternatively that csxt was required to bring its challenge under b and was precluded from challenging the tax under b.the state argues that because b specifically concerns property tax assessment values while b scope is more general,reading b to apply to the tax would make b superfluous.the state also claims that the supreme court reasoning in acf and certain language in csx i favor adopting its narrow interpretation of b.the state suggests in fact that this reasoning was the driving force behind the district court judgment against csxt and urges that we affirm the judgment on this basis.
csxt,on the other hand,argues that while it is possible that refusing to apply the scva cap to csxt property may also violate b,that potentiality has no bearing on the viability of its b claim.indeed,csxt maintains that b is the proper avenue for its challenge given the facts that csxt alleges.csxt points out that the basis for its challenge is not that the state regime has produced the result that the railroad property is assessed at a higher percentage of its true value than is other commercial and industrial property the circumstance b addresses.rather,csxt alleges that the south carolina tax scheme on its face singles out railroad property for less favorable treatment than other commercial and industrial property.thus,csxt argues that b,which prohibits discrimination,is the proper vehicle for its challenge.
we agree with csxt.as we will explain,the type of conduct b prohibits is significantly different from that which the other three b subsections address.for that reason,b is not a general subsection that encompasses the more specific other three b subsections.and there is no danger that construing b to cover the discrimination alleged here would render the other three b subsections superfluous.thus,if csxt can prove that the tax imposed was discriminatory,it will have demonstrated a b violation.and,as we will explain,neither acf nor csx i suggests otherwise.
we begin with the state argument that b should not be read to cover discrimination based on differences concerning assessments because b specifically addresses that subject and would be rendered surplusage if b were construed to apply.
consideration of this argument requires a close examination of the b and b prohibitions.initially,we note that the current language of b is the result of a recodification by congress that included some technical amendments.see csx i,at.because the amendments were not intended to change the statute meaning,we refer to the original language of the act for purposes of statutory interpretation.see richmond,fredericksburg potomac department of taxation,commonwealth of richmond,cir.clinchfield lynch,cir.the only word change that has much relevance to this appeal concerns b.in the act as originally enacted,the subsection now codified as b forbade the imposition of any other tax which results in discriminatory treatment of a common carrier by railroad subject to this part,pub,stat.emphasis added,whereas the current version forbids the imposition of another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier,b emphasis added.recognizing that congress did not intend its alteration of the language to effect any substantive change,the supreme court has treated the current another tax language as synonymous with the original any other tax language.see csx i,at.
this housekeeping behind us,we now turn to the substance of b and b.as we have recited,b prohibits assess ment of rail transportation property at a value that has a higher ratio to the property true market value than the ratio between the assessed and true market values of other commercial and industrial property in the same taxing jurisdiction.csx,georgia bd.of equalization,quoting b alterations omitted.if the railroad ratio exceeds the ratio for other property by at least five percent,the district court may enjoin the tax.id.citing c.accordingly,what b prohibits,practically speaking,are assessment outcomes.if the total assessment of rail transportation property divided by the true value of that property produces a higher ratio than does the total assessment of other industrial and commercial property divided by the true value of that property,b has been violated.the reason for the difference in ratios,including the legitimacy of any policy justifications for treating these classes of property differently,does not matter.nor does the fairness of comparing railroad property to other commercial and industrial property rather,as is also true of b and b,it is simply the comparison of the very specific values those subsections describe that controls whether the provisions have been violated.
subsection b,on the other hand,is a different animal entirely.we interpreted the scope of b in richmond,a case involving a challenge to a state corporate net income tax.in that case we emphasized b breadth,observing that it would be difficult to imagine statutory language that would be less needful of construction than the any other language.at alteration omitted.in contrast to b,b,and b,which pertain only to property taxes and prohibit only particular assessment and outcomes,b,we concluded,was intended as a catchall provision designed to prevent discriminatory taxation of a railroad carrier by any means and that on its face,b clearly and unambiguously prohibits all forms of discriminatory taxation of railroads.id.emphasis added.given b wide scope,we rejected the interpretation of the district court in that case that the any other tax language include d only state and local property taxes and any other taxes enacted in lieu of the discriminatory property tax es prohibited by b.id.at see id.at.
the supreme court,too,has emphasized b breadth and contrasted b with the other,more narrowly focused b subsections.for example,the supreme court has noted that unlike b,which contain three specific prohibitions directed towards property taxes,csx ii,at,b is a for taxes discriminating against railroads,at see id.explaining that b speaks both clearly and broadly.in csx ii,the court also observed that b broadly targets all types of tax discrimination against railroads.see at.the court explained that discrimination in this context means unjustified differences in treatment between similarly situated taxpayers.see id.at.and,the court explained that,in c
