plaintiff robert martin hamilton hamilton appeals from the denial of his petition for writ of mandate,by which he sought to set aside a suspension of his commercial driving license privilege imposed by the department of motor vehicles dmv upon his conviction of driving a vehicle with a content of percent or more,subd.b,all further unspecified statutory references are to this code.
we find the dmv exceeded its jurisdiction in taking away hamilton commercial license for one year,because the statute under which it purported to act,subd.a does not authorize that penalty for the offense of which hamilton was convicted.we will reverse the judgment with directions to grant the writ.
background 
on august,all unspecified calendar references are to that year,hamilton was issued a misdemeanor traffic citation for violating section,subdivision d d,driving a commercial vehicle with a level of percent or higher.the citation indicated on its face that hamilton was driving a peterbilt dump truck,a commercial vehicle.a printout of the breathalyzer test administered by the officer showed that hamilton registered a content bac of percent.
on september,a criminal complaint was filed in superior court,charging hamilton with violating section d.three days later,the district attorney filed an amended complaint,alleging two different offenses than the one for which hamilton was cited 
count i section,subdivision a driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and 
count ii section,subdivision b driving a vehicle with a bac greater than percent.
on october,as the result of an apparent plea bargain agreement,the district attorney dismissed count i and hamilton entered a no contest plea to count ii,driving a vehicle with a bac of percent or more.
on november,the clerk of the court sent an abstract of hamilton conviction record to the dmv.the record included documents indicating that he was driving a commercial vehicle at the time of the offense.
based on the records transmitted from the clerk,the dmv took two separate and independent administrative actions against hamilton it suspended his privilege to operate a motor vehicle for six months from october,to april,see,subd.a,and it disqualified him,for a period of one year,from operating a commercial vehicle.the commercial disqualification order recited that the dmv action was taken under the authority of section,subdivision a,which mandates a suspension for a conviction of d riving a commercial motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol 
hamilton filed a petition for writ of mandate in superior court,challenging only the suspension of his commercial driving privilege.he argued that the dmv incorrectly interpreted section,since the offense to which he pleaded guilty,driving a vehicle with a bac of percent,was not a conviction for d riving a commercial motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,as specified in subdivision a of that statute.
the trial court denied the petition.this appeal ensues.
ievidence re meaning of commercial vehicle 
hamilton argument as set forth in his opening brief is uncomplicated section only permits a suspension of his commercial license upon conviction of driving a commercial motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol.although he was cited for driving a commercial vehicle with a bac of percent or above d,hamilton conviction was for driving a vehicle with a bac of percent or greater,subd.b.pointing out that he was clearly not convicted of driving a commercial motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol italics added,hamilton asserts that the dmv does not have jurisdiction to go beyond the conviction of vehicle code section b which did not specify the type of vehicle being operated by the petitioner 
the dmv takes the position that,when all pertinent statutes are read together and reasonably,hamilton conviction for driving with percent bac or more should qualify as a conviction under section,because the dmv in reviewing the conviction may consider evidence from the court records indicating that the vehicle in which the violation occurred was a commercial vehicle.
the initial question is whether the dmv may look behind the conviction itself and review the entire court record in determining whether the vehicle driven was a commercial one for purposes of applying section.resolution of this issue is one of statutory interpretation,a question of law which is reviewed de novo on appeal.shippen department of motor vehicles d.the fundamental goal of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,we first look to the words of the statute themselves,giving the language its usual,ordinary import.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.kerollis department of motor vehicles th,d.

section bans driving under the influence of alcohol drugs.however,the statute contains several subdivisions describing discrete offenses.the three which concern us here are quoted below 
a it is unlawful for any person who is under the influence of any alcoholic beverage or drug,or under the combined influence of any alcoholic beverage and drug,to drive a vehicle.
b it is unlawful for any person who has percent or more,by weight,of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a vehicle.
d it is unlawful for any person who has percent or more,by weight,of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a commercial motor vehicle,as defined in section.italics added.
section,subdivision a requires the dmv to immediately suspend or revoke,or record the suspension or revocation of,the privilege of any person to operate a motor vehicle upon receipt of a duly certified abstract of the record of any court showing that the person has been convicted of a violation of section if any offense specified in this section occurs in a vehicle defined in section commercial vehicle,the suspension or revocation specified below shall apply to the noncommercial driving privilege.the commercial driving privilege shall be disqualified as specified in sections to,inclusive.italics added.
section thus requires the dmv to take administrative action upon its receipt of a record of a section conviction from the court,and to section for the commercial license penalty.section mandates a disqualification of the commercial driving privilege upon the driver conviction of d riving a commercial motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol the disqualification follows automatically from the record of conviction there is no opportunity for an administrative hearing.see draeger reed th,d a person is not entitled to a hearing i f the action by the department is made mandatory by this code.
the above statutory scheme is seemingly straightforward,except that no subdivision of section describes an offense entitled driving a commercial motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.there are only two plausible candidates for the offense which the legislature had in mind when it enacted section commercial penalty a conviction under section,subdivision a,driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol where the vehicle involved was a commercial vehicle,or a conviction of section d,the separate offense of driving a commercial vehicle with a bac of percent or above.
we are convinced section sanction applies to the first candidate.the administrative suspension described in section,subdivision a follows upon receipt of a duly certified abstract of the record of any court showing that the person has been convicted of a violation of section italics added.this statute must therefore be read in conjunction with the code sections dealing with the duties of the clerk of the court in reporting criminal vehicular convictions to the dmv.
section,subdivision a provides,every clerk of a court in which a person was convicted of any violation of this code,shall prepare within days after conviction and immediately forward to the department at its office at sacramento an abstract of the record of the court covering the case in which the person was so convicted.section,subdivision a describes in detail the data to be furnished the abstract shall be made upon a form furnished or approved by the department and shall contain all necessary information to identify the defendant,including,but not limited to,the person driver license number,name,and date of birth,the date and nature of the offense,the license plate number of the vehicle involved in the offense,the date of hearing,and the judgment,the abstract shall also indicate whether the vehicle involved in the offense is a commercial motor vehicle,as defined in subdivision b of section,italics added.
the clerk reporting of whether the violation occurred while operating a commercial vehicle dovetails with section,subdivision a which provides that if any offense specified in this section occurs in a commercial vehicle the suspension or revocation specified below shall apply to the noncommercial driving privilege.the commercial driving privilege shall be disqualified as specified in section a commonsense construction of the foregoing provisions yields the inference that if a commercial licensee is convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol while operating a commercial vehicle,his noncommercial driving privilege shall be suspended under the penalty provisions of section,whereas the administrative consequences to his commercial privilege shall be as prescribed by the provisions of section.
when all pertinent statutes are read together and harmonized,we believe the disqualification of the commercial license applies to offenders who suffer a conviction of driving under the influence,subd.a while operating a commercial vehicle.moreover,whether a commercial motor vehicle was involved is to be determined by the dmv from the records received from the court clerk pursuant to sections and 
we reject the other possibility,that section,subdivision a penalty was intended to apply to a conviction of section d driving a commercial motor vehicle with a bac content of percent or greater,for two compelling reasons.first,as will be made clear,infra,driving under the influence the exact phrase used in section,subdivision a and driving with a specified bac percentage are not equivalent.driving with a bac level in excess of the maximum specified in a statute is an independent offense which does not require a showing that the driver abilities were impaired by alcohol.burg municipal court cal d,burg.more importantly,section was added to the code in,prior to the enactment of section d obviously,the legislature could not have intended the dmv to impose an administrative sanction for the conviction of a crime that did not yet exist.
our determination that the dmv may examine the court record in order to determine whether the violation occurred in a commercial vehicle does not,as hamilton asserts,have the effect of allowing clerks of the court to start conducting their own investigations and supplementing court convictions with information and facts not admitted by the defendant or asserted by the prosecution in the criminal case.capitalization in original.under sections and,the only duty of the clerk is to compile information and transmit it to the dmv.the interpretation and evaluation of that information is the function of the dmv.
we conclude that the dmv action was not infirm for the reason that the code section to which hamilton pleaded guilty did not specify that the violation occurred in a commercial vehicle.the dmv had the authority to review all of the records from the convicting court in determining whether the vehicle was a commercial one for the purposes of applying sections and 
application of section,subdivision a to hamilton conviction 
although we have determined that the dmv had jurisdiction to determine that the vehicle operated by hamilton was a commercial one in taking the administrative action it did,this conclusion does not complete our inquiry.
we asked the parties to submit supplemental briefing on whether the dmv had jurisdiction to impose the suspension prescribed by section,subdivision a,based on a conviction of section,subdivision b driving a vehicle with a percent bac,where that offense lacks the element that the driver be under the influence of alcohol at the time of the violation.for the reasons which follow,we conclude the answer is no.
we start with the principle that the burden of proving facts necessary to support the suspension of a license rests with dmv.mcnary department of motor vehicles th,d.
section,subdivision a was the sole statutory authority under which the dmv acted to suspend hamilton commercial driving privilege.that section states no driver of a commercial motor vehicle may operate a commercial motor vehicle for a period of one year if the driver is convicted of a first violation of any of the following driving a commercial motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol italics added.
driving while under the influence of alcohol dui,which is prohibited by section,subdivision a,is defined in the following terms a person is under the influence of an alcoholic beverage when as a result of drinking such alcoholic beverage his her physical or mental abilities are impaired to such a degree that he she no longer has the ability to drive a vehicle with the caution characteristic of a sober person of ordinary prudence under the same or similar circumstances.mcdonald department of motor vehicles th,d,citing caljic,italics added.in a dui prosecution,the question whether a person was under the influence of an intoxicating liquor is one of fact to be determined by the court or jury from all the circumstances of the case.mcdonald,supra,at,d,citing people weathington d.
hamilton,however,was never convicted of dui.instead,his conviction was for violating section,subdivision b,which states it is unlawful for any person who has percent or more,by weight,of alcohol in his or her blood to drive a vehicle.italics added.this section is not interchangeable with dui,nor does it establish a conclusive presumption that a defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol.people ireland th,d.instead,it defines and establishes a new and separate offense burg,supra,cal d at,that of driving with a specified reading.people bransford cal th,d.
of crucial importance here is that to obtain a conviction under section,subdivision b,the prosecution has no burden to prove that the defendant driving ability was impaired.the trier of fact need not determine whether a defendant was driving under the influence,only whether he had the specified bac level.burg,supra,cal d at.a conviction for driving with a percent bac level thus neither entails nor requires a finding of impairment.see kuwatch,cal.drunk driving law ed.
by the time section was enacted in,the legislature had already made driving with a minimum bac level a separate and distinct crime from dui,while retaining the old dui statute.burg,supra,cal d at.it must be presumed that the legislature was aware of the distinction between the two offenses.florence western medical clinic bontá th,d.had the legislature intended to impose the penalty on the operator of a commercial vehicle who drove with a specified bac level,it could easily have so stated.yet section plainly requires that the commercial penalty be based on a conviction of driving under the inf
