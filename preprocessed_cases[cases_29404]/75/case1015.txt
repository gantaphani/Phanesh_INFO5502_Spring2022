this case concerns an easement held by georgetown university on property owned by the washington metropolitan area transit authority wmata.in,william and barbara fowler,georgetown,sold a strip of their land in the district of columbia to the washington and great falls electric railway company,wmata.the deed conveying the property reserved an easement for the fowlers and their successors for a private of not less than twelve feet in width.it is undisputed that,at the time of this conveyance,the private was feet in width on an existing road called fowler road.
in,georgetown requested and obtained a permit from wmata to relocate the easement and pave a road on fowler road.since,fowler road has been wide.in,georgetown announced a plan to widen the roadway again,from feet to feet.this time,wmata did not consent.wmata then filed this trespass action against georgetown.the district court granted summary judgment for georgetown and denied summary judgment to wmata,holding that nothing in the language of the deed prohibits georgetown from unilaterally widening fowler road so long as georgetown does not interfere with roads on wmata property.on appeal,wmata argues that the district court erred in its judgment,because nothing in the deed permits georgetown to widen the road unilaterally.we agree.we hold that georgetown proposed widening of the road amounts to a relocation of the easement,which is not permissible under district of columbia law without the mutual consent of the parties.therefore,we reverse the district court grant of judgment to georgetown and remand the case for entry of judgment in favor of wmata.
background

on august,the washington and great falls electric railway company,wmata,obtained the property by deed for from william and barbara fowler,georgetown predecessors.the property consisted of two parcels of land,referred to by the deed as parcels number two and three.the railway company planned to build a bridge on the property for the running of railway trains.the fowlers owned property on both sides of the parcels that they sold to the railway company.they reserved three easements on the deeded property as follows 
the perpetual right to pass and over any and all parts of the aforesaid parcels numbers two and three,to and from and between the lands lying on either side thereof 
the absolute right to locate and dedicate,at any time in the future one or more public streets or highways across the said parcel number two of a width of not less than sixty feet nor more than one hundred and twenty feet each provided,only,that the exercise of the said several rights hereby reserved shall not interrupt nor interfere with the proper running of the cars of the party of the second part,its successors or assigns upon the railway to be laid and constructed by it or them on the lands hereinbefore conveyed or the operation and maintenance of its road when the same shall have been completed,nor with the proper use of the said lands in and about the construction of said road or railway

deed,joint appendix ja.
this case concerns the third easement referenced in the deed.fowler road is the private right of way to which it refers.the road lies at the eastern end of the property.as the deed indicates,the fowlers right to use the property in the second easement was limited the use could not interfere with the running of the railroad cars upon the railway to be constructed.the fowlers right to use the property in the third easement was subject to the railway company right to build a bridge.in turn,the railway company right to build a bridge was limited it was required to leave the fowlers a private of not less than twelve feet.
by,georgetown had acquired the fowlers land,and the capital transit company was the to the washington and great falls railway company.in,georgetown sought a permit from the capital transit company to pave fowler road and widen the to feet.capital transit agreed and,on september,the parties executed a revocable permit which allowed georgetown to build the proposed roadway.see revocable permit to cross transit,ja.pursuant to the permit,georgetown paved a road that measured feet wide on fowler road.fowler road currently serves a portion of the university campus on which georgetown is constructing several new buildings.
on march,alan brangman,the university architect for georgetown university,informed the general manager of wmata in writing of georgetown interest in purchasing or leasing a portion of the wmata property.letter from brangman to white of,ja.however,the parties were unable to agree to terms for the sale or lease of the land.subsequently,on july,the university wrote wmata indicating a desire to reconfigure part of the university roadway leading from canal road to the main campus,purportedly pursuant to georgetown easement rights under the deed.letter from brangman to denton kent,wmata director of property development and management,ja.georgetown planned to expand the road width from feet to feet.on september,wmata provided written notification to georgetown indicating that it did not consent to georgetown plans for the widening of fowler road.the letter also stated that georgetown has no legal right to unilaterally relocate an easement.letter from kent to brangman of,ja.on november,georgetown informed wmata that it would be undertaking site grading and curb and gutter work within the easement area,and that it would restore any property disturbed by the construction to its previous condition.letter from brangman to kent of,ja.georgetown undertook and completed this work in march.
on march,wmata filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief and a motion for a preliminary injunction in the united states district court for the district of columbia.wmata sought to enjoin georgetown from trespassing on its property by relocating fowler road.georgetown and wmata each filed motions for summary judgment,on which the district court held a hearing.
on december,the district court denied wmata preliminary injunction and summary judgment motions and granted summary judgment for georgetown.the district court held that the plain,unambiguous language of the deed granted georgetown the right to undertake the activity at issue.washington metro.area transit auth.georgetown,d,hereinafter wmata.the district court held that,since the deed only specified a minimum width for fowler road,without specifying a maximum width,the deed did not prohibit georgetown from widening fowler road as long as georgetown activity does not interfere with roads on wmata property.id.at.the court held further that georgetown widening of the road was a reasonable use of the easement.id.at.
ii.analysis 
choice of law 
this litigation is properly maintained in federal courts because the interstate compact between the district of columbia,maryland,and virginia creating wmata confers original jurisdiction to the united states district courts concurrent with the courts of those states in all actions brought by or against wmata.see section,washington metropolitan area transit authority compact.wmata chose the united states district court for the district of columbia as the venue for this action,because,among other reasons,the property that is the subject of this litigation is located in the district of columbia.complaint,ja.in addressing the parties claims,the district court applied district of columbia contract and property law.neither party has objected to the application of district of columbia law,and we find no error in the district court choice of law.therefore,we too apply the law of the district of columbia in addressing the parties claims on appeal.see nello teer washington metro.area transit,applying the same law as that applied by the district court where parties did not brief the choice of law issue nor object to the district court choice of law,and no error found in trial court choice of law lee flintkote,noting potential unfairness of invoking a body of foreign law that neither side has considered applicable.
standard of review 
the interpretation of the plain language of a contract is a question of law subject to de novo review.see kiska const.washington metro.area transit,cert.denied,wl quoting ltv gulf states steel,cert.denied,d.we therefore review the district court interpretation of the deed de novo.
c.the language of the deed 
on appeal,wmata argues that the district court erred in interpreting the plain language of the deed as granting georgetown the unilateral right to widen its easement on fowler road.under district of columbia law,d eeds,like contracts,are construed in accordance with the intention of the parties insofar as it can be discerned from the text of the instrument.found.for the of historic georgetown arnold,quoting simmons rosemond.if the deed language is unambiguous,the court need only apply the meaning of the words.if the language is ambiguous,the court must determine the parties intent as to the scope of the easement in light of the circumstances surrounding its execution.arnold,at see also steinkamp hodson.the parties agree that there is no applicable parol or extrinsic evidence of the parties intent arising from the execution of the deed.rather,each side argues that the deed is unambiguous,but they present two competing interpretations of the deed language.wmata has the better of the argument.
this case is largely controlled by carrollsburg anderson,a decision that was not considered by the district court because carrollsburg did not issue until after the trial court had rendered its judgment.under carrollsburg,courts must look to the language of the deed and the subsequent acts of the parties to determine the intent of the parties with regard to the scope of an easement 
in the great majority of jurisdictions,the rule is,that,once the location of an expressly deeded easement is established,whether by the language of the instrument creating the easement or by subsequent acts of the parties fixing on the ground the location of a general grant of a right of way,the site location may not be changed thereafter by either the owner of the dominant estate or the owner of the servient estate,unless both parties consent to the relocation,excepting,however,where the document creating the easement also contains an express or implied grant or reservation of power to relocate.
carrollsburg,at quoting davis bruk,me.
in concluding that a servient estate condominium association could not relocate an easement held by neighboring property owners on its property,carrollsburg relies on the rule of davis bruk,while noting that the restatement rule,allowing relocation by the servient estate in limited circumstances,would dictate the same result.see carrollsburg,at.under the rule,neither the servient nor the dominant estate may relocate an easement without the other consent once its location is fixed.since georgetown,the dominant estate,is attempting to relocate the easement,the rule relied on by carrollsburg is fully implicated in this case.carrollsburg also holds that,even when the location of an easement is not clearly defined by a deed,the location may be subsequently fixed by an express agreement of the parties,or by an implied agreement arising out of the use of a particular way by the grantee and acquiescence on the part of the grantor.see carrollsburg,at quoting taylor solter.
it is clear from the language of the deed that georgetown obtained a right of passage over a particular way.the parties do not dispute that the deed established the location of the easement on fowler road,a road that existed at the time that the deed was executed.see appellant br.at appellee br.at.the deed description of the width of the road as not less than twelve feet did not specify the exact boundaries of the easement.but the deed language leaves no doubt that the easement referred to an existing road,whose boundaries established the location of the easement.the deed described the road as the private right of way leading from the public road known as the canal road,to the house of said william fowler.deed,ja.it stated that the road shall remain a private right of way as it is at present.id.this language as it is at present has clear content,because it indicates that the easement was located on an existing roadway.and neither the roadway nor its width are in dispute in this case.in other words,the original easement was in a clearly fixed location.once an easement is fixed on the ground in a particular location,such as on an existing road,neither party can relocate it without the other consent unless the instrument creating the easement clearly indicates that it may do so.see carrollsburg,at.
appellee argues that the deed not less than twelve feet language implicitly,if not explicitly,gives georgetown a right to widen the easement without wmata consent.see appellee br.at.the district court agreed with this interpretation in holding that georgetown could widen the road as long as georgetown activity does not interfere with roads on wmata property.wmata,d at.this interpretation is superficially appealing,but it raises nonsensical possibilities.under the district court construction,georgetown would be free to act unilaterally to relocate the easement to a width beyond the granted pursuant to the permit but nothing in the deed or the permit would prohibit wmata from counteracting any such unilateral action taken by georgetown.thus,for example,if georgetown paved a road without wmata consent,wmata could unilaterally act to build property on the newly constructed road so long as georgetown was left with a pursuant to the terms of the deed.this makes no sense and there is nothing in the record to suggest that this is what the parties intended.
wmata provides a more plausible interpretation of the not less than twelve feet language that is supported by the terms of the deed.the third easement explicitly conferred on wmata predecessor the right to build a bridge the fowlers was subject to the erection and maintenance of a bridge by said party of the second part across the same.deed,ja.in building the bridge,it was understood and agreed that the railway company had to leave feet or more for the fowlers private.in light of the language establishing the railway company right to build a bridge,the not less than twelve feet language was clearly intended to protect the fowlers from being narrowed to under feet by the railway company construction activities.the limitation on the railway company right to build a bridge is the import of that language.therefore,the phrase not less than twelve feet can not be read as the unambiguous grant of a unilateral right to the fowlers and their successors to expand the road beyond feet.
appellee points to the deed specification of both a minimum and a maximum width for the second easement as evidence that the parties intended the width of the third easement to be unlimited.based on the language of the second easement,appellee argues that had the parties intended a maximum width for the fowler road easement,they would have explicitly identified one.georgetown concludes that in omitting a maximum width for the private,the parties intended to grant the fowlers and their successors the right to widen the roadway beyond feet.appellee br.at.georgetown argument proves far too much.
