five aggrieved railroad employees of the union pacific railroad union pacific or the carrier filed claims through their representatives on the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen the organization in each case contesting a discharge or discipline imposed by the carrier.rather than resolving the dispute over the propriety of the discipline,the national railroad adjustment board nrab or board concluded that the organization had failed to submit conclusive evidence that the parties had held a conference to attempt to resolve the procedural prerequisite to thus the board determined that it was required to dismiss the claim for lack of jurisdiction.the district court agreed.although we agree with the district court that it has always been clear that the parties must conference,and that they must submit evidence of that fact,it heretofore has not been clear when and how that evidence must be presented.we find that the board denied the organization due process by requiring evidence of conferencing to be presented in the record,a requirement not clearly enunciated in the statutes,regulations,or the collective bargaining agreement of the parties.consequently,we reverse.
grievance procedures for resolving disputes between railroads and their employees are regulated intricately under the railway labor act rla or act.under the act,railroad employees with grievances against their first attempt to resolve those grievances through an internal process before turning to the courts.the procedure for dispute resolution is set forth in the parties collective bargaining agreement and begins with investigations,hearings,and appeals that take place on the railroad property and are generally referred to as proceedings.if one of the parties is dissatisfied with the result,the dispute is submitted to a conference.second.if the parties fail to resolve their differences in conference,an aggrieved party may initiate an arbitration proceeding before the nrab.first i.
in and,union pacific discharged or disciplined five locomotive engineers whose claims form the basis of this litigation.the organization filed grievances and sought reinstatement,back pay,and removal of the discipline for the five engineers.the organization then proceeded through the process in the manner dictated by the collective bargaining agreement between the parties.each aggrieved party had an hearing before an investigating officer or superintendent of the carrier.in each case the hearings were recorded and transcribed with exhibits attached.the carrier declined each of the claims.the parties then met in a conference in a effort to settle the case.when those efforts failed,and the organization did not prevail,it sent letters of intent to the nrab to initiate arbitration proceedings.in its original submission,the organization included the record which contained the notices of discipline,the hearing transcript,all of the exhibits,and all of the evidence used in the grievance procedure below relating to the merits of the underlying discharge or discipline.the organization did not,however,include any written documentation that the parties had met in conference.the carrier raised no objection to the organization submission and,in due course,presented its own on the merits of the dispute.it did not mention the organization failure to include evidence that a conference had occurred.
after the parties filed their submissions,they met on march,for a hearing before the nrab.each arbitration panel of the board consists of an equal number of members chosen by the carrier and by the labor organization.where the panels are deadlocked,a neutral person known as a referee sits with the panel to make an award.first l.as a practical matter,therefore,the outcome is usually determined by the referee.see united transp.union gateway,cir.just prior to the start of the oral argument,the carrier representative on the panel requested an executive session of the nrab panel,out of the presence of the organization representative.during that session,the carrier representative informed the referee that the organization submission to the board did not contain any evidence of conferencing.without such evidence,the railroad argued,the board must draw the inference that the conferences had not occurred.the carrier did not argue that conferencing had not,it that the organization had failed to offer any evidence of it in the record submitted to the board.
the organization advocate offered to submit documentation that the conferences had occurred and the referee gave the organization time to do just that.the organization did eventually proffer proof that a conference had occurred,which included phone logs,informal notes,and other documents.the majority of the panel consisting of the neutral member and the carrier representative,however,voted not to allow this later submitted evidence,and voted to dismiss all five of the appeals for lack of jurisdiction.
in the five nearly identical decisions,the board concluded that without evidence in the record that the conference had occurred,it had no jurisdiction to consider the organization claims.at,ex.a,award,all at app.at.the board further concluded that it could not consider evidence not contained in the record.id.app.at.the organization representative filed a dissent in each of the five awards.
the organization sought review in the district court of all five of these identically reasoned awards pursuant to first q.in appealing to the district court to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim,the carrier argued as a preliminary matter,that the nrab decisions were evidentiary rulings,which could not be set aside absent misconduct or bad faith by the arbitrator.it then sought to convince the district court that the conference is a mandatory precursor to arbitration,and that without written evidence of the that could not be added to the record board had no jurisdiction to hear the claim.the organization countered that neither federal law nor the cba required conferencing and that even if conferencing were required,no rule dictates that conferencing must be proved by evidence in the record.consequently,the organization argued,the board failed to conform to its jurisdiction and violated due process.
the district court concluded that conferencing is indeed required before parties can refer their disputes to the nrab and that the nrab did not violate due process by refusing to consider evidence of conferencing outside of the record.consequently,the district court dismissed the organization suit pursuant to.b,concluding that the organization had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.on appeal,the organization has not challenged the district court holding that the rla requires conferencing,but instead focuses on whether the nrab denied due process and failed to act within the scope of its jurisdiction by requiring proof of conferencing in the record.
although presented through both a statutory and constitutional framework,the essence of the conflict boils down to a single question is written documentation of the conference in the record a necessary prerequisite to arbitration before the nrab the district court answered this question affirmatively,and we review the district court dismissal de novo,looking to see whether relief is possible under any set of facts consistent with the allegations set forth in the complaint.pokuta trans world airlines,cir.in keeping with the purpose of the is,to resolve railway labor disputes in an efficient jurisdiction of the federal courts is limited to only the narrowest review of nrab arbitrators decisions.union pac.sheehan,d pokuta,at.under the rla,federal courts may review a board decision only when the board has failed to comply with the requirements of the rla the board has failed to conform or confine itself to matters within the scope of its jurisdiction and the board or one of its members has engaged in fraud or corruption.first q see also,sheehan,at.pokuta,at.this circuit will also review claims of due process violations by the board.see,pokuta,at,bates baltimore ohio,cir morin consol.rail,cir.
in this appeal,the labor organization makes two claims,first,that the board violated its due process rights and second,that it violated the rla by failing to conform or confine itself to matters within the scope of its jurisdiction,as prohibited by first q.the carrier urges this court to consider the statutory claim before the constitutional one.we agree that it is a fundamental rule of judicial restraint that we ought not pass on questions of constitutionality unless such adjudication is unavoidable.zobrest catalina foothills sch,d blackmun,dissenting.in this case,however,once we answer the key question at issue in this case,adjudication of the due process claim is unavoidable.that question is whether the nrab created a new requirement when it held that arbitration could not proceed because the organization had failed to present evidence of conferencing in the record.if it did so,it ran afoul of the due process clause.
answering this key question will also resolve the carrier threshold argument that this case is governed by the review standard of united paperworkers int l union misco,d.the railroad carrier characterizes the board award as a decision to admit or exclude evidence.such decisions,absent bad faith or error,are left entirely to the discretion of the arbitrator.id.at.again,however,the application of this standard depends on the characterization of the board actions.if indeed the board merely precluded the organization from submitting evidence under its interpretation of an already existing rule,then we can not overturn that finding unless we can show that the arbitrator acted in bad faith or that the error was so gross as to amount to affirmative misconduct.id.at.if,however,the board created a new rule which precluded the organization from submitting evidence,then we are no longer evaluating a decision merely to admit or deny evidence.once again,it becomes clear that resolution of all of the issues in this case depends on whether the board created a new question to which we will turn shortly.
the carrier initial approach in the due process arena is to cast doubt on the law of this circuit that allows judicial review of board orders where a party asserts a due process violation.this argument is based on scholarly theories that the only due process protections required are those already provided in the rla itself.see,buck beltzer stephen wichern,judicial review under the railway labor act are due process claims permissible transp,christopher sagers,note,due process review under the railway labor act.the supreme court,however,has stated that unless it can be shown by clear and convincing evidence that congress intended to foreclose judicial review,we must presume that courts may review constitutional questions.califano sanders,d.nothing in section first q of the rla manifests clear and convincing evidence that congress intended to foreclose judicial review of constitutional claims under the act.see edelman airlines,cir.this circuit has pointed out that the decisions of the nrab,are acts of government,and must not deprive anyone of life,liberty,or property without due process of law.elmore chicago.midland,cir.consistent with that position,we have continuously held that we will review due process claims arising from nrab arbitration.see pokuta,at bates,at morin,at steffens of ry.airline and clerks,cir.we have continually and consistently maintained this position despite a supreme court decision that created confusion in some circuits as to the validity of due process review of nrab decisions.see sheehan,at.despite the confusion,several circuit courts,including this one,have concluded that the sheehan decision does not prohibit due process review of nrab decisions.see steffens,at.see also shafii plc british airways,cir hayes weighing inspection bureau,cir armstrong lodge union pac,cir radin united states,cir.we decline to depart from our prior holdings on this issue.
due process requires the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.mathews eldridge,d.that means,of course,that a tribunal may not alter,without warning,the rules for access to it.it is true that the requirements of due process are relaxed when the tribunal is an arbitral tribunal rather than a court.united transp.union,at.in the arbitration context,due process is satisfied so long as the arbitrator provided a fundamentally fair hearing,one that meets the minimal requirements of notice,a hearing on the evidence and an impartial decision by the arbitrator.int l.workers csx transp,cir.it is these minimal requirements,however,that the organization claims that the nrab failed to provide by creating and imposing a new rule,unknown to the organization,that denied it access to a hearing on the substance of the dispute.
this court has considered the predicament created by newly implemented nrab rules once before in chicago rock island and pac.wells,cir.in wells,the railroad drafted a written request for an automatic extension of time to file its reply to wells claim of wrongful discharge.the letter bore a january postage meter date,but a january postmark.wells,at.the board refused the railroad request,declaring that the january postmark was one day too late.id.at the time of the denial,the board had no rule adopting a united states postal service postmark as the criterion for determining timeliness.id.we held that the adoption of a new rule or policy without notice violated due process.id.at.the court noted that the procedural defect of adopting a new rule that the united states postmark determined the timeliness of the request for an extension of time was one of constitutional dimension.id.
it is true that the railroad in wells was denied an opportunity to make any presentation whatsoever to the board,and in this case the organization was permitted to argue its position regarding whether the absence of evidence of conferencing mandated dismissal.in this case,however,imposition of a new procedural rule without adequate notice to the parties denied those parties first,and most importantly,the opportunity to comply with the rule,and ultimately,a fair opportunity to be heard.had the board permitted the organization to submit evidence of the conference for its consideration once the issue had been raised,the organization then could have proceeded to argue that engineers glueck,south,whatley,fosha and pope were not deserving of the discharge or discipline they received.instead,the board allowed the carrier to raise the conferencing issue at a late date,but refused to consider any evidence that the procedural had been met.in this way,the facts and conclusion of wells bear most heavily on this case.
the carrier downplays wells as a case,but nothing in sheehan alters our due process analysis.indeed,as we noted above,this court has issued many decisions since sheehan noting our ability to review claim of due process violations in nrab proceedings.see,pokuta,at bates,at morin,at steffens,at.we can conclude from wells that if the board created a new rule previously unknown and unapplied,this would constitute a violation of due process that prevented the substance of the organization claim from being heard.this is not only an obvious conclusion from wells and from the mandates of due process,but from the fundamental rule of social interaction we all learned on the kindergarten playground.it is unfair to alter the rules of the game.we can now turn to the question of whether,in fact,the board created a new rule.
the crux of the organization principal argument in this case is that the district court combined two discreet rules to announce a new rule not articulated in a statute,rule,or the collective bargaining agreement between the parties.the first of these rules is that,before initiating arbitration,the parties must confer after the carrier highest designated officer has rejected the labor union appeal.the second of these rules is that parties to arbitration must present all of their evidence to the board in the record and that new evidence can not be added on appeal to the board if it was not presented to the railroad during its review.
the carrier leads its argument with proof of the first the rla and the governing regulations require conferencing.indeed second of the rla states that a ll disputes between a carrier or carriers and its or their employees shall be considered,and,if possible,decided,with all expedition,in conference between representatives designated and authorized so to confer,respectively,by the carrier or carriers and by the employees thereof interested in the dispute.second.this same language appears in circular common name given to the series of rules and regulations that the nrab adopted in to govern its internal procedures.b.
although the organization argued below that conferencing was not,in fact,required,it is no longer asserting that position on appeal.consequently,we can assume that parties may not proceed to arbitration until they have held a conference and made a final attempt at resolving their differences.we need not,however belabor this point much.the fact of a conference vel non is not in dispute.the organization adamantly asserts,and union pacific does not deny,that the parties met in conference.we can now focus our review on the more narrow question of when and how a party must prove to the nrab that conferencing has occurred.
union pacific position is that evidence of conferencing must be contained in the record that is,it must be in writing and it can not be presented once the record has been closed and presented to the board.the organization counters that these requirements have been made from whole cloth and are not contained in the rla,in circular one,or in the collective bargaining agreement between the parties.the organization argues that if the carrier may raise,for the first time,the question of jurisdiction after the parties have submitted their materials to the board and the record is closed,then,in fairness,the organization must be allowed the opportunity to present evidence in response.or,the organization argues,the carrier must not be permitted to raise the question after the record has closed.
as support for its position,the railroad carrier cites ten arbitration awards in which the board dismissed cases where there was no evidence of conferencing in the record.see brief of union pacific railroad at.in the bulk of those awards,however,it was either uncontroverted or clear from the record that the parties had not held a conference on the property prior to submitting the dispute to arbitration.see third division award,at,ex.b app.at it is unrefuted that no conference was held on the property.third division award,at,ex.b app.at it is abundantly clear that at no time during the handling of the case was a conference held to attempt to resolve this dispute third division award,at,ex.b app.at the record is clear.a conference at the highest level was not held.third division award,at,ex.b app.at it is clear from the record in this case that the instant claim was not conferenced by the organization on the property.third division award,at,ex.b app.at noting that the carrier submits that no conference was held by the parties on the property prior to this appeal and then finding that no conference was held prior to its submission to the board third division award,at,ex.b app.at no conference was ever held on the property third division award,at,ex.b app.at from the record,it appears that claimant did not further pursue either claim on the property and did not engage in a conference as required.
in three of the awards,the board merely notes that there is no evidence in the record that conferencing occurred at all and thus we can not definitively determine whether the parties failed to meet in conference or whether they met but neglected to submit evidence of that conference.see third division award,at,ex.b app.at in a review of this record we fail to find any evidence that a conference was ever held on the property.third division award,at,ex.b app.at nowhere does the record indicate that a conference was ever held or requested on the property.third division award,at,ex.b app.at the record before the division is devoid of any evidence that a conference was held.consequently,these prior board awards do not indicate whether the board dismissed the cases because conferencing did not occur a fact which would support the organization position or because the parties did not put written evidence of conferencing in the record a fact which would support the carrier position.the organization argues that there is not a single award that says conferences must be proved only by documents that were previously exchanged by the parties and then attached as exhibits to the record.reply brief at.it is true that the railroad has not cited such an award.the district court too admitted that,no board opinion expressly states that the board will not consider evidence of conferencing outside of the record.at.the district court,however,seemed convinced that board precedent on conferencing cites the lack of evidence in the record as the basis for its decision.id.emphasis in original.we do not read the language of the awards in quite the same way.true,the board dismissed each of these awards for lack of jurisdiction it is unclear,however,whether it based its decision on the lack of evidence in the record,as the district court concluded,or rather because it was clear that conferencing,the procedural prerequisite to arbitration,had not occurred.in short,the awards make clear that the parties must conference.but these prior awards are no more illuminating than the rla in articulating how a party must prove that a conference occurred.
moreover,although study of prior arbitration awards is useful,the awards are not conclusive.arbitrators can and do consider the language of other awards in determining the outcome of matters before them,but they are not bound by the outcome of prior decisions in the same way that judges are bound by the doctrine of stare decisis in courts.see ray schoonhoven,fairweather practice and procedure in labor arbitration,ed martin malin robert ladenson,privatizing justice a jurisprudential perspective on labor and employment arbitration from the steelworkers trilogy to gilmer,hastings,timothy heinsz,grieve it again of stare decisis,res judicata and collateral estoppel in labor arbitration,carlton snow,an arbitrator use of precedent,dick.there are myriad reasons for the nature of prior awards.the organization touched on some of them in its reply brief by pointing out that awards are not codified,not wholly accessible to,and contain sketchy accounts of the record.moreover,issues that confront labor arbitrators are often quite fact specific and involve evaluating not only the action leading to the discipline or discharge but also the fairness of the rules established and applied by the employer and the relationships between the parties.see heinsz.at.in any event,the awards only tell us what we already,that parties must conference,and second,that they must demonstrate to the board that they have conferenced.what they do not tell us is how or when a labor organization must prove that a conference occurred.could it not,for example,arrive at the nrab hearing with an audio recording of the conference 
our exploration of prior awards has diverted us from a more relevant statutes and regulations of the rla.the carrier asserts that section second is the key statutory provision governing conferencing.see second.as we noted,however,this section instructs that the parties must conference but offers no guidance as to how proof of conferencing must be presented to the board.according to d,employees must submit to the board a document which clearly and briefly set s forth all relevant,argumentative facts,including all documentary evidence submitted in exhibit form,quoting the agreement or rules involved,if any and all data submitted in support of employees position must affirmatively show the same to have been presented to the carrier and made a part of the particular question in dispute.in other words,an employee must submit to the board everything that the employee used to attempt to convince the railroad not to discipline or discharge her.of course the employee never used the fact of conferencing in
