the appellants are three shipping operators who pay a fee to puerto rico to conduct business out of the port of san juan.the commonwealth supplied each company with technology,required them to scan all of their inbound cargo,and then charged each an additional fee.the question on appeal is whether the dormant commerce clause bars puerto rico from charging the additional fee to defray the costs of the scanning.because the operators have failed to establish that the additional fee violates the constitution,we affirm the magistrate judge decision holding the same.
we draw the facts from the magistrate judge findings following a bench trial.see mcdermott marcus,errico,emmer brooks,p,cir.
this matter stems from the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september,and the concomitant need to augment port security.until,puerto rico port security was predominantly limited to random and manual searches of cargo.to bolster this piecemeal approach,the legislative assembly of puerto rico passed a law calling for improved safety procedures.laws ann.tit,et.the following year,the puerto rico ports authority prpa solicited proposals to implement that law with respect to its busiest port,the port of san juan.in particular,it sought to craft a system where it would be able to scan all inbound cargo at the port.in due course,prpa reached an agreement with rapiscan systems,which assumed responsibility for the scanning.in turn,rapiscan systems transferred its rights and obligations to a subsidiary,services puerto rico,llc services.
in late,prpa promulgated regulation,which required the scanning of all inbound cargo at the port of san juan.the regulation permitted prpa personnel,in the event of undue delay,to reduce the amount of cargo scanned at a given time.through these requirements,prpa aimed to increase the identification of unreported taxable goods and to improve security and safety at the port.services and the puerto rico treasury department were responsible for carrying out this directive.
as of,puerto rico installed scanning technology at the facilities of three shipping operators at the port of san juan crowley,horizon lines,and sea star lines.except during particularly busy times,these three operators were required to scan all containerized cargo though not their bulk cargo and then have two service employees and one treasury agent review those scans.in total,containers have been electronically scanned,an amount substantially higher than the containers manually searched during a prior,analogous time period.
to pay for the scanning,prpa charged all vessels carrying cargo into the port of san juan including cargo carried by operators who did not have access to the scanning facilities an enhanced security fee esf.prpa assessed the esf on top of the existing fees that it already charged operators to utilize the port.the amount of the esf varied based on the weight and type of the vessel cargo.since implementing the esf,prpa billed crowley,horizon lines,and sea star lines with of all costs arising from the scanning procedure.in total,prpa has collected through the esf,and it has used that money to pay to services,million to treasury employees,million to the general security office,and to the office of maritime security.
in response to regulation and the esf,businesses and organizations involved in importing cargo at the port of san juan along with associated trade groups sued the heads of prpa and puerto rico treasury department they attacked both the regulation and the fee.the parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge,and the court conducted a bench trial.the bulk of the evidence at trial centered on the constitutionality of the scanning regulation and the permissibility of the esf as applied to all of the operators as opposed to just the three with access to the scanning technology.
following those proceedings,the court ruled that the scanning procedure implemented by regulation was constitutional but that the esf,as applied to the operators who did not have access to the scanning facilities,violated the dormant commerce clause.the court thus entered an injunction prohibiting the government from collecting the esf from those shipping operators.neither the government nor the plaintiffs appealed those decisions.
the magistrate judge next turned to the constitutionality of the esf as applied to the three shipping operators equipped with the scanning technology.as to these three companies,the court concluded that the esf was constitutional.the three operators timely appealed that decision they continue to argue that the esf violates the dormant commerce clause

the constitution commerce clause serves as both an affirmative grant of power to congress,const.art.i,cl,and a further,negative command,known as the dormant commerce clause.comptroller of treasury of wynne,d.this latter doctrine precludes states from discriminat ing between transactions on the basis of some interstate element,and inhibits economic protectionism between the states,new energy of limbach,d.
a litigant can wield the dormant commerce clause to attack the propriety of a user fee,a charge assessed for the use of a government facility or service.in such cases,we apply a test.see evansville vanderburgh airport auth.dist.delta airlines,d.a user fee is constitutional if it is based on some fair approximation of use of the facilities,is not excessive in relation to the benefits conferred,and does not discriminate against interstate commerce.nw.airlines,cty.of kent,d.those challenging the government action carry the burden of persuasion.see motor transp.ass flynn,cir.
turning to evansville in the context of this case,we first consider whether the user fee is based on some fair approximation of use of the facilities.nw.airlines,at capitol greyhound lines brice.noting that a rough approximation is sufficient.this is essentially a question of allocation we ask whether the government is charging each individual entity a fee that is reasonably proportional to the entity use,and whether the government has reasonably drawn a line between those it is charging and those it is not.see nw.airlines,at.
prpa attempts to assess a fee to these three operators in an amount that is reasonably proportional to their use of the scanning services.prpa requires the operators to scan nearly all of their containerized cargo though their bulk cargo is not scanned,and then charges them an amount corresponding to the total cargo they import comprising both containerized and bulk cargo.while not perfect,the fee was intentionally designed to approximate the operators use of the scanning service.moreover,these three operators are the only ones with access to the scanning service and,given the unchallenged injunction entered by the lower court,the only three that have to pay for it 
despite this conceptually sound approach,we see two potential flaws.first,the operators could be importing so much bulk cargo that the total amount of imports and thus the fee charged is grossly disproportionate to the containerized cargo that is actually scanned.likewise,during particularly busy times,prpa exempts some containerized cargo from the scanning procedures if this occurs with significant frequency,then the fee may not match the operators use of the scanning service.ultimately,though,the burden lies with the three operators to prove that either of these concerns renders the fee improper.see flynn,at.this they have failed to do.specifically,the operators have not produced evidence contrasting the total amount of cargo imported with the amount of cargo actually scanned for these three operators,nor have they provided specific evidence that the bypassing of containerized cargo occurs with such frequency that the esf does not roughly correspond to their use of the scanning technology.while this record leaves us unable to definitively hold that the fee is a fair approximation of the operators use of the scanning service,the operators failure to prove the conve
