plaintiffs sued the state upon allegations that it maintained the street intersection in a dangerous condition,and faulted the lighting configuration,lack of traffic control signals and signs,placement of signs,the type of crosswalk markings,and the grade of the intersection.plaintiff sued pg e for allegedly failing to provide adequate lighting with overhead street lights.
the trial court granted the state and pg e summary judgment.the court found that the intersection was not in a dangerous condition and that there was no duty to provide lighting.plaintiffs filed separate notices of appeal for the state and pg e.we consolidated the appeals for purposes of briefing,argument,and decision.we now affirm the judgments.
on the evening of february,a father and his three children were walking across a street in a marked crosswalk when a motorist failed to yield to the pedestrians and struck one of the children.the father,jeremy mills,had taken his old daughter gabrielle mills and old twin sons tyler and adam mixon to a valentine day dinner.the family was walking home around when they reached the intersection of and r streets in the city of eureka.the intersection has a marked crosswalk but no signal lights and no street lights directly overhead.
the father told the police that the family stopped on the southeast corner of and r streets and waited for traffic on r street to stop before entering the crosswalk.a northbound car stopped and jeremy mills and his children entered the intersection together in front of the stopped car.the family started across r street from east to west.one southbound car passed as they started to cross the street and another southbound vehicle,a pickup truck driven by nicholas harris,approached the crosswalk as the family was walking across the street.mills realized that the pickup truck was not going to stop and reached for his children.his son tyler was walking ahead,and the pickup truck struck the boy.tyler was thrown feet and struck his head on the roadway when he landed.the boy suffered brain damage,broken bones,hearing loss,and other disabling injuries.the driver,harris,told the police i was going to miles per hour.the last thing i saw was someone headlights.then i saw him,he was in the crosswalk.there was a guy to the left maybe his dad.i did even have time to hit the brakes.
ii.discussion 
the question on appeal is whether the state and pg e contributed to tyler mixon tragic accident.the trial court said no and granted summary judgment to the state and pg e.the court concluded that the state public street intersection was not in a dangerous condition that endangered pedestrians and that pg e had no duty to provide lighting at the intersection with overhead street lights.we turn to a consideration of the law and evidence relevant to these issues 
standard of review 
a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.in considering a request for summary judgment by a defendant,the statute instructs that such a party has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.code civ,subd.p.an appellate court reviews de novo a trial court decision to grant a summary judgment motion.cerna city of oakland th,cerna.
general principles concerning a dangerous condition of public property 
government code section provides that a public entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the plaintiff establishes that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the injury,that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous condition,that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred,and either a a negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment created the dangerous condition or b the public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition.
the element at issue here is the existence of a dangerous condition.a d angerous condition is defined as a condition of property that creates a substantial as distinguished from a minor,trivial or insignificant risk of injury when such property is used with due care in a manner in which it is reasonably foreseeable that it will be used,subd.a.the existence of a dangerous condition is ordinarily a question of fact but can be decided as a matter of law if reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion.cerna,supra,th at.
a claim alleging a dangerous condition may not rely on generalized allegations citation but must specify in what manner the condition constituted a dangerous condition.citation.a plaintiff allegations,and ultimately the evidence,must establish a physical deficiency in the property itself.citations.a dangerous condition exists when public property is physically damaged,deteriorated,or defective in such a way as to foreseeably endanger those using the property itself,or possesses physical characteristics in its design,location,features or relationship to its surroundings that endanger users.cerna,supra,th at,italics omitted.a public entity may be liable for a dangerous condition of public property even where the immediate cause of a plaintiff injury is a third party negligent or illegal act,like a motorist negligent driving,if some physical characteristic of the property exposes its users to increased danger from third party negligence or criminality.citation.but it is insufficient to show only harmful third party conduct,like the conduct of a motorist.t hird party conduct by itself,unrelated to the condition of the property,does not constitute a dangerous condition for which a public entity may be held liable.citation.there must be a defect in the physical condition of the property and that defect must have some causal relationship to the third party conduct that injures the plaintiff.citation.p ublic liability lies under government code section only when a feature of the public property has increased or intensified the danger to users from third party conduct.id.at.
c.the intersection was not in a dangerous condition 
the motorist harris traveled along state route from arcata to eureka before reaching the intersection that is the site of the accident at issue here.state route crosses arcata bay on the samoa bridge and ends in eureka,with state route becoming r street.when approaching eureka,a driver on state route passes a traffic sign stating zone ahead,then a sign depicting a traffic signal light and the words signal ahead painted on the roadway.next,a speed limit sign is posted and,soon after,a sign stating end freeway appears.state route becomes r street.farther along,signal ahead is written in the roadway and a driver comes to the r street intersection with street.the intersection is painted with white crosswalk markings on the north side first encountered,then the south side.harris struck plaintiff mixon while the boy was walking with his family in the south crosswalk.a block beyond the site of the accident at street is street,and the location of the indicated signal light.
plaintiffs identify five features that allegedly made the intersection of and r streets dangerous dim lighting at and r streets with brighter lighting before and after it lack of a traffic control signal at street lack of pedestrian crossing warning signs at street and the presence of signal ahead signs for the street intersection that comes after street parallel line crosswalk markings instead of zebra stripes or more visible patterns and a dip in the grade of the intersection.none of these features,considered alone or in combination,creates a substantial risk of injury when the intersection is used by pedestrians and motorists with due care,subd.a.
plaintiffs allege that the lighting at the site of the accident at the and r streets intersection was inadequate and made especially dangerous because the poorly lit intersection contrasted sharply with better lit areas surrounding it.it is undisputed that there was no street light directly above the intersection.the nearest street light was on street,about feet from the intersection.nearby areas were more brightly lit.the police report of the accident notes that the samoa bridge on state route on which harris traveled has overhead lights illuminating the span of the bridge and that the and r intersection a block beyond the site of the accident has overhead street lights and business lights that illuminate the area.in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,an electrical engineer and lighting expert retained by plaintiffs declared the fact that there were lighted areas surrounding the relatively dark subject accident intersection made it harder for a driver coming southbound off the samoa bridge on sr to perceive pedestrians at the subject intersection than would have been the case if none of the areas,not the samoa bridge and neither the nor street intersection had been lighted.it was the bright lighting on the samoa bridge and at the street intersection which made the relatively dark intersection at street a more severe problem and greater danger to persons using the intersection.
plaintiffs argument is a variant of the claim that a public entity is negligent for failing to provide street lights a claim that has long been rejected.a public entity is under no duty to light its streets.antenor city of los angeles d,antenor.in the absence of a statutory or charter provision to the contrary,it is generally held that a municipality is under no duty to light its streets even though it is given the power to do so,and hence,that its failure to light them is not actionable negligence,and will not render it liable in damages to a traveler who is injured solely by reason thereof.d highways.a duty to light,and the consequent liability for failure to do so,may arise only if there is some peculiar condition rendering lighting necessary in order to make the streets safe for travel.antenor,supra,at.in other words,a prior dangerous condition may require street lighting or other means to lessen the danger but the absence of street lighting is itself not a dangerous condition.
several cases are instructive.in antenor,two pedestrians struck by a motorist while crossing a city street claimed the intersection was in a dangerous condition because,among other things,the street lighting was too dim.antenor,supra,d at.the trial court granted a directed verdict to the city and the court of appeal affirmed.id.at.the court of appeal acknowledged evidence that the lighting intensity was below government guidelines but found that the city had no duty to light its streets in the first instance and thus was not negligent for failing to provide brighter lights.id.at.
in plattner city of riverside th,a pedestrian was struck by a motorist in a dark crosswalk with a nonfunctioning city street light.summary judgment for the city was affirmed because the city had no duty to provide street lighting and,therefore,ha d no duty to maintain that lighting,even at a crosswalk.ibid.the court stated plaintiff does not claim and consequently has not shown there was anything dangerous about the crosswalk other than the absence of light.but darkness is a naturally occurring condition that the city is under no duty to eliminate.thus,the fortuity of locating the streetlight at a spot where it illuminates the crosswalk does not render the crosswalk dangerous without the light.nor do we share plaintiff view that by providing a crosswalk and thereby encouraging pedestrians to cross the street at that location the city invited the public to rely on the streetlight and thus created a duty to maintain the light.id.at.the court rejected the plaintiff reliance argument by noting that it is obvious to all when a streetlight is out.therefore,a pedestrian such as plaintiff can not claim she relied on the inoperative streetlight in order to cross the street.moreover,unlike traffic lights and stop signs which are the only means by which traffic is controlled,streetlights are not the only or even the primary means by which streets are illuminated for vehicular traffic.vehicle headlamps are designed and used for that purpose.id.at.
in city of san diego superior court th,the appellate court directed the trial court to grant summary judgment to a city charged with maintaining a dangerous condition on its streets.a vehicle passenger was injured,and others killed,in a collision with a motorist participating in street racing.ibid.plaintiffs claimed the city street used for racing was dangerous because the posted speed limit is miles per hour and there are no traffic controls,speed bumps or natural conditions that deter street racing and t he length of road on which the races occur is poorly lighted at night,which makes it difficult for drivers to see or gauge the speed of approaching racers.id.at.the court rejected the claim.on the lighting issue,the court noted that there was no showing of previous accidents caused by poor lighting and thus no showing of any physical defect in the condition of property creating a duty to provide lighting.id.at.since there was no duty to provide lighting,there was no negligence in failing to provide brighter lighting.
in this case,plaintiffs argue that even if the state had no duty to provide lighting,it may be held liable because it undertook to provide lighting and did so negligently by lighting the surrounding areas more brightly than the and r streets intersection.as noted at the outset of this discussion,plaintiffs argument is no more than a variant of the claim that a public entity is negligent for failing to provide street lights.plaintiffs try to contrast their argument as one faulting the lighting configuration and lighting scheme at the intersection rather than one faulting the lack of lighting,but it all amounts to the same thing.the alleged defect in the the lighting configuration is that the areas before and after the intersection were more brightly lit,making the intersection a more difficult to perceive black hole,according to plaintiffs.the only cure for such a defect is more lighting at the intersection as it is impractical to darken the surrounding areas.the area before the subject street intersection is a bridge span that rises above arcata bay and the area after the street intersection is a busy street that is lit not only by street lights but by private business lights.the lighting configuration at the subject intersection and surrounding area is not unlike many urban areas where there are numerous light sources,public and private,and gradations of light intensity.a public entity,which has no general duty to light its streets,can not be held liable for failing to provide a consistent level of lighting between one street and the next.
traffic control signal 
plaintiffs contend that other features apart from dim lighting made the and r streets intersection dangerous and point to the lack of a traffic control signal.but the legislature has expressly declared that a condition is not a dangerous condition merely because of the failure to provide regulatory traffic control signals,stop signs,yield signs,or speed restrictions signs,as described by the vehicle code,or distinctive roadway markings of parallel dividing lines as described in section of the vehicle code.thus,the statutory scheme precludes a plaintiff from imposing liability on a public entity for creating a dangerous
