rockwell international corporation and arvinmeritor,formerly known as meritor automotive incorporated,collectively,meritor appeal from the final judgment and entry of permanent injunction by the united states district court for the district of delaware in favor of eaton corporation eaton after a jury returned a verdict of patent infringement by meritor.because we disagree with the district court claim construction,we,and,as described more fully in this opinion.
background 
eaton and meritor are competitors in the market for truck transmissions.trucks such as often have ten or more gears,requiring considerable skill by a driver to manually shift.the driver shifts by first depressing a clutch pedal to disengage a master clutch.then the driver manually moves the shift lever out of the present gear and releases the clutch pedal.at the same time,the driver depresses the fuel pedal,causing the gears of the engine to rotate at a speed that will allow the driver,using the shift lever,to smoothly shift into the new gear.an experienced driver can manually shift without depressing the clutch pedal by manipulating the gas pedal so that the gears reach a zero torque point,at which time the driver shifts.
both eaton and meritor have attempted to design transmissions that simplify and improve the shifting process.eaton has developed a transmission that uses automatic shifting in the higher gears and manual shifting in the lower gears.using automatic shifting in only the top gears can permit optimal highway fuel economy while preventing the costs of automating from exceeding the savings from improved fuel economy.one disadvantage of automatic shifting is that an unexpected shift can cause the driver to lose control of the truck,particularly when the truck is traveling on slippery roads.in contrast,meritor has developed a the engine synchro shift ess it characterizes as fully manual,allowing the driver complete control over which gear the truck is in at any time.to operate the ess,the driver senses when to shift and in which direction.the driver pushes a shift intent switch to initiate an engine fuel controller and then moves the gear selection lever to change gears.the driver does not need to depress the clutch pedal or the gas pedal.instead,the system automatically manipulates the fuel so that the gears reach the appropriate rate of rotation for the driver to shift gears.
eaton owns patent the patent for a vehicle drive line shift control system and method.this patent describes and claims a vehicular transmission shift control system for effecting automatic shifting between a group of sequentially related forward gear ratios provided by the transmission patent,abstract.eaton sued meritor for infringement of the patent,alleging that meritor infringed,induced infringement,and contributed to the infringement of claims.claim,the only independent claim at issue,reads 
a multiple step method for controlling an automatic mechanical vehicle driveline system having a engine,a transmission having a plurality of gear ratio combinations selectively engagable between a transmission input shaft and a transmission output shaft,said transmission input shaft being operatively connected to said engine by means of a selectably engagable and disengagable master clutch providing a driving connection between said engine and said input shaft,said automatic mechanical vehicle driveline system comprising an information processing unit having means for receiving a plurality of input signals including input signals indicative of at least one of currently engaged,last engaged and about to be engaged gear ratio of the vehicle driveline an input signal indicative of the rotational speed of the transmission input shaft and,an input signal indicative of the rotational speed of the transmission output shaft,said processing unit including means for processing said input signals in accordance with a program and for generating output signals whereby said driveline system is operated in accordance with said program,and means and associated with said driveline system effective to actuate said driveline system to effect engagement of said gear ratio combinations in response to said output signals from said processing unit,a gear ratio change of said driveline system comprising the sequence of disengaging a first positive clutch and then engaging a second positive clutch,both of said positive clutches comprising a first clutch member,having a rotational speed dependent on the rotational speed of the vehicle engine and a second clutch member,having a fixed rotational speed dependent on vehicle speed said method characterized by 
retaining said vehicle master clutch engaged during the gear ratio shift in said drive train 
urging said first and second members of said first clutch into a disengaged condition while,in sequence,increasing the supply of fuel supplied to the vehicular engine to cause the engine to rotate at a speed sufficient to cause said first member of said first positive clutch to drive the second member of said first positive clutch and decreasing the supply of fuel to the engine to cause the second member of said first positive clutch to drive the first member of the first positive clutch.
a jury found that meritor literally infringed claims of the patent and that meritor infringement was willful.with respect to meritor counterclaims for invalidity and unenforceability,the jury found that the patent was not invalid and the district court,after holding a separate bench trial for meritor counterclaim of unenforceability,found no inequitable conduct.the district court also denied meritor renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative for a new trial or remittitur,entered judgment against meritor in the amount of,and issued a permanent injunction.meritor appeals,arguing that the district court misconstrued claim,it failed to properly instruct the jury regarding claim construction,and that under a proper construction meritor does not infringe.meritor also argues that it is entitled to judgment in its favor,or a new trial,on the issues of invalidity and unenforceability.we have jurisdiction under a.

the district court first considered claim construction when denying eaton motion for a preliminary injunction.in particular,the district court ruled that the preamble of claim is not a limitation of the claim and that the claim language does not require automatic shifting.eaton rockwell int l,dist.lexis.the district court later held a markman hearing,but did not issue a written opinion construing the claims.instead,the court made the following oral ruling on the first day of trial 
with regard to the pending matters of claim interpretation,i have considered the evidence offered at the markman hearing as well as submission of the parties and their contentions with regard to really a relatively limited issue on claim interpretation,and have concluded as follows after considering the claim language and the specifications as well as the contentions of the parties regarding claim interpretation,i have concluded that claim is an independent claim upon which claims through are dependent claim is a method claim which claims an automated or automatic vehicle driveline system the term automatic as used in claim refers to the control of the driveline,not the gear shifting apparatus required to operate the transmission.
in essence,the court has concluded that automatic as contained in claim relates to the driveline and not to any matter of how the gears are shifted on the device.
at the end of trial,the district court instructed the jury as follows 
before you can decide whether the defendants may have infringed eaton patent,you will have to understand the patent claims.the claims are word pictures intended to define,in words,the boundaries of the invention described and illustrated in the patent.only the claims of the patent can be infringed i am now going to define some terms in this patent this is called claim construction or interpretation.in the united states courts,claim construction or interpretation has been determined to be a matter of law.so you are bound to follow the claim construction that i give you with regard to the claims of the patent.
in this case we are considering,as i told you,claims through.i concluded that these claims teach a multiple step method for controlling an automatic mechanical vehicle driveline system.
i construe claim of the patent to mean the following claim is an independent claim,as i told you,upon which claims through are dependent.
i have further concluded that claim is a method claim which teaches or claims an automated or automatic system for the control of fuel.
in this case the plaintiff eaton has alleged that the defendants literally infringed the patent.for the defendants product to literally infringe any one of the plaintiff patent claims,the subject matter of the patent claim must be found in defendants products.in other words,plaintiff patent claim is literally infringed if defendants product includes each and every component,part or method step in plaintiff patent claim.
meritor argues that the district court committed legal error by reducing claim to a statement of intended purpose.according to meritor,the district court should have given the jury particular instructions about the meaning of the terms information processing unit and means and found in the preamble,and about whether the urging step of the method excludes a method in which a driver initiates the shifting process and provides the shifting force.meritor argues that the preamble of claim is a limitation of the claim because many limitations in the body of the claim find antecedent basis only in the preamble and the preamble is necessary to define the invention.meritor also argues that the device described by the the perform the urging step of claim.based on its interpretation of the preamble as a limitation of claim,meritor concludes that the claim as properly interpreted is directed to an automatic mechanical vehicle driveline system in which the engagement and disengagement of the gears is performed automatically,without requiring the manual intervention of the driver.eaton responds that the preamble of claim merely states an intended purpose,and that the structure in the preamble that provides antecedent basis for elements in the body of the claim is not limiting because the preamble is merely providing a reference point as in vaupel textilmaschinen kg meccanica euro italia.
in general,a preamble limits the claimed invention if it recites essential structure or steps,or if it is necessary to give life,meaning,and vitality to the claim.catalina mktg.int l,quoting pitney bowes.a claim preamble has the import that the claim as a whole suggests for it.in other words,when the claim drafter chooses to use both the preamble and the body to define the subject matter of the claimed invention,the invention so defined,and not some other,is the one the patent protects.bell communications research,vitalink communications.when limitations in the body of the claim rely upon and derive antecedent basis from the preamble,then the preamble may act as a necessary component of the claimed invention.see,electro sci.indus.dynamic details,rapoport dement,pitney bowes,at,at.on the other hand,i f the body of the claim sets out the complete invention,then the language of the preamble may be superfluous.schumer lab.computer,squibb ben venue.
claim is for a multiple step method for controlling an automatic mechanical vehicle driveline system having the structure set forth in the remainder of the preamble.the body of the claim has two steps.the first step requires retaining said vehicle master clutch engaged during the gear ratio shift in said drive train.this step refers to structure that is identified and defined in the preamble the vehicle master clutch and a drive train which the parties agree is the same thing as the driveline.from the preamble we know that the drive train to be controlled has,among other things,a transmission with a plurality of gear ratio combinations that are selectively engagable and that the transmission input shaft is operatively connected to said engine by means of a selectably engagable and disengagable master clutch.the presence of these structures permits the performance of the first step of the claimed method,for without a selectively engagable vehicle master clutch operable with respect to a transmission in the drive train as described in the preamble,the step of retaining said vehicle master clutch engaged during the gear ratio shift in said drive train could not be performed.the plain language of the claim requires the operation of this structure as the first step of the claimed method.moreover,the claim language makes clear that not any vehicle clutch or drive train will do.when the body of the claim refers to said vehicle master clutch,and said drive train,it is referring back to the particular clutch and the particular drive train previously described in the preamble.
the first step of the claimed method also requires that it be performed during the gear ratio shift in said drive train.the preamble states that a gear ratio change of said driveline system compris es the sequence of disengaging a first positive clutch and then engaging a second positive clutch by stating that the retaining step is performed during the gear shift ratio,the claim requires this step to be performed during the particular sequence defined by the preamble as the gear ratio shift.
the second step of the method also requires the operation of structure that is first identified in the preamble,including a first clutch,first and second members of said first clutch,and the vehicle engine.without the benefit of the preamble,the members of the first clutch could be any part of the clutch.but from the preamble,we know that the first clutch member refers to first clutch member,having a rotational speed dependent on the rotational speed of the vehicle engine and the second clutch member refers to second clutch member,having a fixed rotational speed dependent on vehicle speed.and,as with the first step of the claimed method,the second step of the claimed method requires the operation of said first and second members of said first clutch,thereby referring to the particular first clutch and particular first and second members previously identified and described in the preamble.
the method steps of claim thus require the manipulation of particular structures that are identified and described only by the preamble,during a particular sequence of events defined only by the preamble.see griffin bertina,consideration of the preamble gives meaning and purpose to the manipulative steps in this case.claim is an example of the claim drafter choos ing to use both the preamble and the body to define the subject matter of the claimed invention,bell communications,at,at,as opposed to a preamble reciting an intended use for an invention that is defined in its entirety by the body of the claim,schumer,at,at.we therefore conclude that the preamble of claim limits the claimed invention.
we do not agree with eaton that the drive line structure in the preamble can be ignored because it merely provides a reference point during one of the claimed method steps.eaton relies on vaupel,at,at,and bard,systems.vaupel construed a method claim for forming a plurality of patterned strips of fabric woven from threads of synthetic material using a broad weaving machine having a sley and a breast beam.at,at emphasis added.the body of the claim recited the step of guiding the woven fabric leaving the position where the sley beats up the fabric to allow movement towards the breast beam of said machine,but not in the opposite direction.id.emphasis added.the accused infringer argued that its weaving machine did not have a breast beam and therefore it could not perform this method step.id.at,at.after considering this argument,as well as the claims,written description and drawings,prosecution history,and expert testimony,the district court concluded that 
in the weaving art today the term breast beam does not necessarily mean a specific loom part and can mean a general area at the front of the loom.the court further finds that as used in the patent the term is used only to fix the direction of movement of the woven fabric on the loom.
vaupel textilmaxchinen kg meccanica euro italia,slip op.at june.on appeal,we conclude d that the district court was correct.breast beam and breast plate are not structural limitations of claims and as used in claims and,they indicate a reference point to fix the direction of movement of the woven fabric from the loom.vaupel,at,at.we did not conclude,as eaton would have us do here,that the term breast beam could be ignored because it appeared in the preamble in fact,the analysis in vaupel has nothing to do with the issue of whether the preamble was necessary to define a complete invention.rather,the issue was the proper meaning of the term breast beam.we agreed with the district court that the term breast beam meant a reference point to fix the direction of movement of the woven fabric from the loom and that this meaning should be applied in the infringement analysis.thus,while we concluded that the term breast beam was not a structural limitation of the claims,it was nevertheless a limitation.
the structural terms in the preamble of the patent are not subject to this same kind of interpretation.the parties do not argue that any limitation in the reciting something that might at first appear to be a nevertheless understood to refer to a direction of movement,as was the case in vaupel.instead,the preamble of the patent recites structures that are indeed understood to be structures.
there is yet another reason why vaupel does not apply in this case.the method claim in vaupel does not require that any step of the claimed method be performed by the breast beam nor does any step of the claimed method require the operation of the breast beam.in contrast,claim of the patent requires the manipulation and operation of structure that is identified and described by the preamble.for example,the first step of the claimed method requires manipulation of the vehicle master clutch at a time when particular components of the drive train are operating in a manner defined by the preamble.the second step of the claim likewise requires the manipulation of the first and second members of said first clutch,thereby leading to a sequence of events defined by the operation of additional structure of the drive train.consideration of the preamble therefore gives meaning and purpose to the manipulative steps of the claim.griffin,at,at.
eaton also relies on bard,which is no more applicable than vaupel.in bard,the claim at issue was for 
a biopsy needle for use with a tissue sampling device having a housing with a forward end,a first slide mounted for longitudinal motion within said housing,and a second slide mounted for longitudinal motion within said housing,said biopsy needle comprising 
a hollow first needle having proximal and distal ends 
a second needle extending through said hollow first needle and freely slidable therewithin,said second needle having proximal and distal ends 
a first head mounted to said proximal end of said hollow first needle,said first head including first flange means associated therewith for coupling said hollow first needle to said first slide for longitudinal motion both toward and away from said forward end of said housing and 
a second head mounted to said proximal end of said second needle,said second head including second flange means associated therewith for coupling said second needle to said second slide for longitudinal motion both toward and away from said forward end of said housing.
at,at emphases added.the preamble of this claim is an example of a statement of intended use of the claimed invention the plain language of the preamble states that the biopsy needle is for use with the structure described by the remainder of the preamble.moreover,the claim is for a biopsy needle,not the combination of the needle and the housing described by the preamble.the emphasized language in the body of the claim,while referring back to the housing structure first identified in the preamble,merely describes what the claimed first head and second head of the needle are for for coupling to the structure in the preamble.the plain language of the claim does not require an actual coupling to this structure,thereby negating the necessity of having this structure as part of the claimed invention.thus,we interpreted the preamble of this claim to recit e the portion and structure of the gun housing into which the needles fit,and to provid e reference points in the gun that aid in defining the needles as set forth in the body of the claim.id.at,at.the structure claim in bard is therefore very different from method claim of the patent,which has a preamble that does much more than state an intended use of the invention,and method steps that require the operation or manipulation of the particular structure identified and described by the preamble.
we therefore conclude that the preamble of claim of the patent is not like the claim language at issue in either bard or vaupel.instead,as in bell communications and griffin,we conclude that the inventor chose to use both the preamble and the body of the claim to define his invention.the preamble therefore limits the claimed invention.as such,claim as properly construed requires an automatic mechanical vehicle driveline system that includes,among other things,an information
