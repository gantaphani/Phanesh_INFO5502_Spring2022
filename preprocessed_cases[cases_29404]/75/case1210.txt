real parties in interest filed a for writ of mandate,injunctive relief,and declaratory relief petition,in the superior court seeking to compel the san bernardino county board of supervisors board to conduct an environmental review before placing a sales tax measure on the november,ballot.alternatively,if the sales tax measure was passed by the voters,to prevent the implementation of the measure.petitioners filed a demurrer to the petition,which the trial court overruled.petitioners now seek a writ of mandate ordering the trial court to reverse its decision and sustain the demurrer.for the reasons discussed below,we grant the petition.
background 
in,the legislature enacted the local transportation authority and improvement act act authorizing each county board of supervisors to create or designate a local transportation authority authority.pub,et,as enacted by stats,ch.the act empowers an authority to impose a sales tax in the county to fund local transportation needs and to issue bonds to be paid from the sales tax.the authority must fulfill three prerequisites before it may impose this sales tax.first,the authority members must adopt a transportation expenditure plan for the revenues expected to be raised by the tax,together with federal,state and other local funds expected to be available for transportation improvements during the period for which the tax is to be imposed.second,an ordinance imposing the tax must be approved by a vote of the authority.third,the ordinance must be approved by a majority of the electors voting on the measure at a special election called for that purpose by the board of supervisors,at the request of the authority ibid.
the board designated the san bernardino associated governments sanbag to serve as the authority under the act.sanbag,a public agency listed in the roster of public agencies,is a joint powers agency,created by agreement of its member agencies.its member agencies are the county of san bernardino county,the towns of apple valley and yucca valley,and the cities of adelanto,barstow,big bear lake,chino,chino hills,colton,fontana,grand terrace,hesperia,highland,loma linda,montclair,needles,ontario,rancho cucamonga,redlands,rialto,san bernardino,twentynine palms,upland,victorville,and yucaipa.sanbag board of directors includes the mayor or a city council person from each member agency,plus the five members of the board and a nonvoting member appointed by the governor.
in may,sanbag circulated the transportation expenditure plan to its member agencies for approval.by june,the required number of sanbag members had approved the expenditure plan.at its board meeting on that date,sanbag adopted ordinance.this ordinance authorized a extension of the existing measure i sales tax,adopted the transportation expenditure plan,and requested that the board call an election for voter approval on the sales tax measure measure to be held on november.on june,sanbag posted a notice of exemption stating that its approval of the measure is n ot a project under the california environmental quality act ceqa and,if it is a project,it is exempt from ceqa.
at its june,meeting,the board passed county resolution,stating that the measure shall be submitted to the voters and placed on the ballot for the november,election.the board posted a notice of exemption on june,stating that its placement of the measure on the ballot is exempt from ceqa under california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision b ceqa guidelines,and public resources code section,subdivision b 
on august,real parties in interest sierra club and allen bartleman collectively sierra club filed their petition for writ of mandate in the trial court the petition alleged that sanbag and the county were required by ceqa to prepare an environmental impact report eir before placing the measure on the ballot.the pleading further alleged that the placement of the measure on the ballot was a discretionary project that will have an ultimate impact on the environment and constituted the inception of a project under ceqa,requiring environmental review.the sierra club requested a writ of mandate,and injunctive and declaratory relief,voiding the placement of the measure on the november,ballot if the measure remained on the ballot and was passed by the voters,the sierra club sought to prevent implementation of the measure until ceqa has been complied with and the matter resubmitted to the voters.
sanbag,the county,and the board demurred to the writ petition.in their demurrer,they argued the sierra club filed its petition after the time limit to challenge the june,posting of sanbag notice of exemption relative to its approval pub.resources code,subd.d and the board,in placing the measure on the ballot,performed a ministerial,rather than a discretionary,act,and thus the board action was not a project subject to ceqa pub.resources code,subd.b,tit.the sierra club argued in its opposition to the demurrer that the action was not because a challenge to sanbag actions prior to the board placement of the measure on the ballot would have been premature,and that its claims did not accrue until the board placed the measure on the ballot.the sierra club further argued that the board action constituted a discretionary project requiring compliance with ceqa.
the trial court agreed with the sierra club and overruled the demurrer.the court ruled that the limitations period had not run because the period within which to file a ceqa action did not begin to run until june,when the board posted its notice of exemption.the trial court based this ruling on the theory that any challenge to sanbag actions would have been premature because there could be no possibility of an environmental impact until the board decided to place the measure on the ballot.the trial court further overruled the demurrer on the ground that the board decision to put the measure before the voters was a discretionary act,not a ministerial act.the trial court found that sections and gave the board discretion to decline to place the measure on the ballot it reasoned that section provides that the taxing agency sanbag is to request that the board place the sales tax measure on the ballot and that there is nothing in the language that mandated that the board do so.therefore,the trial court reasoned,the board had discretion to require sanbag to comply with ceqa.the trial court also concluded that there were sufficient facts alleged in the petition to prove that the measure qualified as a project under ceqa,requiring an eir by the county.
petitioners filed this petition for writ of mandate.
necessity of writ relief 
a writ of mandate may be issued where there is not a plain,speedy,and adequate remedy,in the ordinary course of law,such as w here there is no direct appeal from a trial court adverse ruling,and the aggrieved party would be compelled to go through a trial and appeal from a final judgment code civ,fair employment housing com.superior court th,d.discretionary writ review of an order overruling a demurrer is appropriate where the issue is a matter of public importance and requires immediate resolution.smith superior court th,d.here,the issue is a matter of public importance because the measure of one percent sales tax extension is expected to raise approximately billion between and.the measure states that revenues from the sales tax will be used to widen and improve highways and freeways improve freeway interchanges improve local streets and roads expand transit for seniors and disabled riders and expand metrolink commuter rail.these projects and services,as set forth in the expenditure plan,are of considerable and obvious benefit to the public.the legislative findings and declarations provision at the beginning of the act includes the following relevant statements local highway and transportation improvements and services are an immediate high priority needed to resolve local and regional transportation problems that threaten the economic viability and development potential of counties and cities and adversely impact the quality of life therein.furthermore,regional transportation is a matter of statewide concern,subd.a.in order to deal in an expeditious manner with current and future local transportation maintenance and improvement needs,local agencies need to develop and implement local funding programs,subd.c.based on these factors,we find that writ review by this court is both permissible and appropriate.
standard of review and summary of conclusion 
when reviewing by writ petition a ruling sustaining a demurrer,w here a pure question of law is at issue the appellate court reviews the issue de novo.fair employment housing com.superior court,supra,th at,d.the issues raised in this petition are questions of law,and therefore we review them de novo.see black property owners city of berkeley th,d.
we hold that the demurrer should have been sustained because the board action in placing the measure on the ballot is exempt from ceqa as a ministerial act and a submittal to the voters of a proposal not generated by the board.see friends of sierra madre city of sierra madre cal th,d,sierra madre stein city of santa monica d.stein,tit,subd.b.we further hold that a challenge to sanbag earlier notice of exemption would not have been premature because it is sanbag that exercises discretion in shaping the measure,while the board action in placing the measure on the ballot is solely ministerial.thus,in order to challenge the measure on the substantive ground that ceqa was not complied with,the sierra club should have filed its challenge to sanbag actions within days of sanbag posting its notice of exemption.because it did not do so,to the extent that the petition could be construed as challenging sanbag notice of exemption,it is 
c.the board placement of the measure on the ballot was a ministerial act 
ceqa requires a public agency to study the environmental impact of any project it proposes to carry out that may have a significant effect on the environment.pub.resources code.however,ministerial projects are exempt from ceqa requirements.pub.resources code,subd.b,tit.a ministerial project is defined as a governmental decision involving little or no personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project,tit.conversely,a project is discretionary,and thus by definition not ministerial,when it requires the exercise of judgment or deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove a particular activity,tit.the statutory distinction between discretionary and purely ministerial projects implicitly recognizes that unless a public agency can shape the project in a way that would respond to concerns raised in an environmental impact report,or its functional equivalent,environmental review would be a meaningless exercise.mountain lion foundation fish game com.cal th,d.
on appeal,the sierra club submits three arguments to support the trial court conclusion that the board acted in a discretionary manner in placing the measure on the ballot for voter approval.first,the board participated early on as a member of sanbag in shaping the measure.second,placement of the measure on the ballot was a discretionary decision under sierra madre.third,the word request in section,relative to sanbag seeking to have the measure placed on the ballot,implies that the board has discretion to deny the placement of the measure on the ballot.we reject each of these arguments.
the board early participation as a member of sanbag does not mean that the board exercised discretion when it later placed the measure on the ballot 
the sierra club argues that the county considerable participation earlier in the process as a member agency of sanbag in approving and shaping the expenditure plan means that the board exercised discretion when it later acted on sanbag request to place the measure on the ballot.we disagree.
as described above,the act explicitly authorizes the county and its board members,along with the incorporated cities and their city council members,to work together in their capacities as sanbag member agencies and board members to shape and approve the expenditure plan and to request that the measure be placed on the ballot.however,nowhere does the act suggest that the board has an additional discretionary duty or authority to shape the expenditure plan or reject the request to place the measure on the ballot after these have been duly approved by sanbag.this would be contrary to the procedure that is built into the act,which provides balance between and among the county and cities.
for example,when a county decides to create a new entity to serve as the authority,a majority of the cities having a majority of the population in the incorporated area of the county must consent to the membership of the authority.further,the act specifies that the members of the county board of supervisors may not be the majority of the authority membership.the author of senate bill,by which this statutory scheme was enacted,specified in a statement to the senate transportation committee that the legislation intends to ensure that the broad spectrum of community interests are represented.senator deddeh,author statement on senate bill reg.sess.
the purposefully process for approving the expenditure plan and the requirement for the authority to adopt the sales tax ordinance indicate the legislature intent to prevent the county from exercising its concentrated power over the dispersed and,presumably,less powerful individual cities.this purpose would be poorly served if we were to read into the act a discretionary power or duty on the part of the board to reject or change the sales tax ordinance and expenditure plan after it has been formulated,reviewed,and approved by the authority and its members via a process carefully crafted by the legislature to ensure collective decision making between the county and cities.
finally,the legislature in section et has given sanbag and other local transportation authorities the power to impose a sales and use tax for transportation purposes,but only after obtaining the approval of the voters.however,as with many public entities that are given authority to tax for specific purposes upon voter approval,sanbag does not itself have the power to place such a measure before the electorate.sanbag must do so through the board.if the board is allowed to exercise discretion by either voting to deny sanbag access to the ballot,or modifying the sales tax ordinance or expenditure plan,then the board would be able to effectively deprive sanbag of the specific taxing power and the responsibility for regional transportation planning given to it directly by the legislature.we do not see anything in the language of the act itself or in the legislative history that indicates the legislature contemplated giving counties such power when it enacted the act.
because the board did not generate the measure,placement of the measure on the ballot was not a discretionary act 
the sierra club argues that sierra madre requires that any public agency that places a measure on the ballot must comply with ceqa before doing so.in sierra madre,our supreme court held that the city council of sierra madre could not avoid ceqa review of its decision to remove certain structures from historic preservation status simply by submitting an ordinance to the voters proposing such an action.the city sought to benefit from the ceqa guidelines,which at that time provided that a ceqa project did not include t he submittal of proposals to a vote of the people of the state or of a particular community.the court in sierra madre,supra,cal th,d,found that the city action did not fall within this guideline because the decision to place the measure on the ballot was discretionary therefore,placing the initiative measure on the ballot was not the type of ministerial act contemplated by the guideline.id.at,d.
a close reading of sierra madre does not support sierra club position.the precise holding of the supreme court in sierra madre is as follows ceqa compliance is required when a project is proposed and placed on the ballot by a public agency.sierra madre,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.the city council in that case acted in a discretionary manner because it proposed and generated the ballot measure itself.if it had merely placed the measure on the ballot at the direction of the voters acting through the initiative power,the city council placement of the measure on the ballot would have been ministerial.see id.at,d.in other words,the city council placement of the project on the ballot was not exempt because the city made the discretionary decisions concerning the measure,including the decision to ask the voters to approve the measure.
in the same way,sanbag,not the county,made the discretionary decisions concerning the measure.the county,acting through its board,merely placed the measure on the ballot at the request of sanbag it did not propose or generate the measure.sanbag proposed and generated the measure,and so the burden of ceqa compliance if it falls to any entity falls to sanbag,not the county.while the county did participate in proposing and generating the measure earlier on,it did so solely in its role as a member of sanbag.
in our view,the situation at hand is more analogous to the facts in stein.in that case,the appeals court held that the placement of an initiative measure on the ballot in response to a citizen petition is not a ceqa project.the court reasoned that the city performed a ministerial function rather than a discretionary one because the election was an activity undertaken by the electorate and did not require the approval of the governing body.stein,supra,d at.this is in part because former section of the government code provided that the city shall submit the amendment to the electors if it determined that the initiative petition was signed by the required percentage of voters.id.at.the court found that the city merely acted as the agent for the initiative sponsors when it placed the measure on the ballot.
in stein,it was the citizens group,acting through the petition power,which made the underlying decision to ask the voters to approve that measure.in the same way,the measure was an activity undertaken by sanbag,not by the county.the county,despite its earlier participation as one of many sanbag members,was merely the agent of sanbag when it later placed the measure on the ballot,as provided by section.
use of the word request in section does not make the board placement of the measure on the ballot a discretionary act 
the prerequisites to imposing sanbag sales tax ordinance under the act are described in section a retail transactions and use tax ordinance may be imposed if the tax ordinance is adopted by a vote of the authority and imposition of the tax is subsequently approved by a majority of the electors voting on the measure,or by any otherwise applicable voter approval requirement,at a special election called for that purpose by the board of supervisors,at the request of the authority,and a county transportation expenditure plan is adopted pursuant to section.italics added.the sierra club argues,and the trial court agreed,that the word request implies that the board had discretion to decline to place the measure on the ballot.we disagree.
o ur first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations.where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation.both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent,fair employment housing com.cal d.
in enacting the act,the legislature found that l ocal highway and transportation improvements and services are an immediate high priority needed to resolve local and regional transportation problems that threaten the economic viability and development potential of counties and cities and adversely impact the quality of life therein,subd.a.the state transportation needs,the legislature declared,needed to be addressed in an expeditious manner by developing and implementing local funding programs made available by the act,subd.c.furthermore,i t is in the public interest to allow the voters of each county to establish local transportation authorities and raise additional local revenues to provide highway capital improvements and maintenance and to meet local transportation needs in a timely manner,subd.d.
in light of these expressions of legislative intent,we now look to the words of the statute.the phrase at the request of the authority,appears in the clause describing one of three prerequisites to imposing the tax before the tax can be imposed,it must be approved at a special election called for that purpose by the board of supervisors,at the request of the authority,italics added.although the word request,by itself,often implies that the person to whom the request is made has the power or discretion to grant or deny the request,here the word is part of the phrase,at the request of the authority.this phrase modifies special election,and indicates the source of,or a causal relation with,the special election that is,the required special election is not one that takes place whenever the board decides to call the election,but is one that is called at the request of the authority.the phrase is thus interchangeable with upon the request of the authority,or when requested by the authority.so construed,the request of the authority is merely the event that triggers the calling of the special election as such,it implies no discretion or power in anyone.
the reference to the board of supervisors in the same clause does not alter this interpretation.the phrase,called for that purpose by the board of supervisors,is merely another modifier of the special election phrase.thus,the special election is not only one that occurs at the request of the authority,but is also one that is called for a certain purpose to approve of the tax measure ordinance and by a certain entity the board of supervisors.the language,by the board of supervisors,merely identifies who it is that calls the special election after the authority makes its request.
thus,by giving the words of the statute their usual,ordinary meanings,and giving effect to every word and phrase,the statute can be read as requiring the special election to be called upon the request of the authority,without any implication that the board of supervisors has any discretion or power to deny the authority request.moreover,if the legislature had intended to give the board of supervisors the discretion to reject a request to call a special election,it could easily have made that intent clear.in addition to making such discretion express such as by stating,for example,the board of supervisors shall determine in its discretion whether to call a special election,the legislature could have implied such discretion by providing that the tax be imposed only on the condition that it first be approved by the board of supervisors.indeed,the sierra club argues that the statute use of the word if indicates such a condition.as we construe the statute,however,the conditions introduced by the word if do not include the board approval of the measure,but rather the adoption of the ordinance by of the members of the authority the approval by voters at a special election which is called by the board of supervisors upon the request of the authority and the adoption of a county transportation expenditure plan.the call of the election by the board of supervisors is thus not a condition to the imposition of the tax,but rather a ministerial event that occurs at the request of the authority.
this construction of the statute is consistent with the stated legislative findings and declarations,which emp
