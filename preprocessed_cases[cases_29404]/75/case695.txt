a class of members of racial minority groups who ride buses operated by the costa transit district ac transit,a labor union,and a organization appeal from the district court judgment in favor of the metropolitan transportation commission.claiming state and federal civil rights violations,plaintiffs allege that mtc disproportionate emphasis on rail expansion projects over bus expansion projects in its regional transit expansion plan,also known as the rtep,illegally discriminates against minorities,who constitute of san francisco bay area bus though of rail riders are also members of racial minority groups.
plaintiffs claim that the rtep has a disparate impact on minorities,and that this disparate impact,along with evidence of the history of bay area rail service as predominantly benefitting white riders mtc interactions with its advisory committees representing minority groups and mtc inconsistent application of selection criteria to bus and rail projects,demonstrates that mtc decision to favor rail over bus expansion in the rtep results from intentional discrimination.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of mtc on plaintiffs intentional discrimination claims,but allowed the disparate impact claims to continue to trial.after trial,the district court held that plaintiffs had established a prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination only as to mtc conduct in disproportionately selecting and allocating funding to rail projects,as opposed to bus projects,in the rtep.however,shifting the burden to mtc,the district court held that mtc had shown substantial legitimate justification for its challenged conduct.shifting the burden back to plaintiffs to prove the existence of a less discriminatory,equally effective alternative,the district court held that they had failed to do so.
we agree that plaintiffs disparate impact claim fails,but for a different reason.the statistical measure upon which plaintiffs relied to establish a prima facie case is unsound,and their claim rests upon a logical fallacy.although plaintiffs statistical evidence shows that minorities make up a greater percentage of the regional population of bus riders than rail riders,it does not necessarily follow that an expansion plan that emphasizes rail projects over bus projects will harm minorities.plaintiffs theory forecloses altogether the possibility that mtc could devise any expansion that could benefit minority transit riders,while the evidence shows that bay area minorities already benefit substantially from rail service.without a more precise statistical measure of how the particular projects included in the rtep will serve the bay area transit ridership,no court could possibly determine whether mtc expansion plan will help or harm the region minority transit riders.
because plaintiffs do not establish a prima facie case of disparate impact,mtc is not required to justify its challenged conduct,and we do not address the district court analysis on that point.
plaintiffs failure to provide an appropriate measure of disparate impact also fatally undermines their claim of intentional discrimination.not only does plaintiffs statistical evidence fail to prove discrimination,but their circumstantial evidence does not support any inference that mtc adoption of the regional transit expansion plan was motivated by racial bias.
we affirm the judgment of the district court.
factual background 
the facts of this case are set forth in exquisite detail by the district court in its decision,see darensburg metro.transp.comm n,d therefore,we repeat only those facts pertinent to the issues we address in detail.
mtc is the transportation planning,coordinating and financing agency for the san francisco bay area.mtc is the designated recipient of numerous federal and state funding sources,and is responsible for allocating those funding sources that are within its control to various transit operators and projects.mtc sets policy and makes funding decisions through its board of commissioners.
there are independent transit operators within mtc purview.the operators are independent from mtc and make their own decisions about budgeting and policy,including what services to provide.the operators are funded in part with state and federal money allocated through mtc however,operators also receive a substantial part of their funding from state and local revenue sources,such as local sales taxes,that are outside of mtc control.
plaintiffs rely on ac transit bus service for transportation to and from work,school,shopping,and family and social engagements,among other destinations.plaintiffs allege they have been harmed by cuts in ac transit bus service,fare hikes,failure to make improvements that would make buses more accessible and service more reliable,and failure to increase the reach and frequency of bus service.as a result,plaintiffs claim to have lost out on job opportunities been forced to cut expenses for other necessities to accommodate fare hikes used more expensive means of transportation,including cars and taxis,to work around service shortages and been subject to long waits for buses in unsafe areas.
plaintiffs assert that mtc decisions not to select more and allocate greater funding for bus expansion projects in its regional transit expansion plan has caused,at least in part,the fare hikes,service shortages,and lack of improvement on ac transit bus service of which plaintiffs complain.
ii.transit operators and regional ridership demographics 
seven operators account for over percent of the bay area transit trips.the annual ridership of these seven operators for was approximately as follows san francisco municipal railway muni million riders bay area rapid transit bart million riders ac transit million riders santa clara valey transit authority vta million riders san mateo county transit district samtrans million riders peninsula corridor joint powers board caltrain million riders and golden gate highway and transporation district ggt million riders.the percentage of minority ridership on these operators is as follows ac transit vta samtrans muni bart caltrain ggt.minorities account for approximately percent of the bay area total transit ridership,percent of bus ridership,and percent of rail ridership.
these operators provide different and interconnecting modes of service.ac transit and samtrans provide only bus service.bart and caltrain provide only rail service.muni and vta provide a mix of bus and rail services.ggt provides a mix of bus and ferry services.ac transit connects with nine other bus systems,bart stations,six amtrak stations,and three ferry terminals.bart operates five routes to stations in four counties,including areas served by ac transit.caltrain operates train service in san francisco,san mateo,and santa clara counties,and is run by a consortium of three other operators muni,samtrans,and vta.
iii.the development of the regional transit expansion plan 
mtc is responsible for updating roughly every four years the regional transportation plan,a comprehensive blueprint for the development of mass transit,highway,airport,seaport,railroad,bicycle and pedestrian facilities.a key portion of the regional transportation plan is the regional transit expansion plan,a plan to address regional mass transit needs.
plaintiffs challenge mtc selection of projects for inclusion into the regional transit expansion plan,arguing that mtc favors rail expansion projects over bus expansion projects,and that this preference discriminates against bus riders who are disproportionately minority compared to rail riders.the rtep at issue here was first adopted in,and then amended and updated in.although the actionable conduct at issue arises from the amendment,most of the relevant background arises from the development and adoption of the rtep.
federal guidelines for regional transit planning 
as the federally designated transit planning agency for the bay area mtc is mandated to provide for consideration of projects and strategies that serve a variety of goals,including supporting regional economic vitality increasing the safety and security of the transportation system increasing accessibility and mobility of people and for freight supporting environmental protection,energy conservation,and planned growth and economic development patterns enhanc ing the integration and connectivity of the transportation system,across and between modes,for people and freight promot ing efficient system management and operation and emphasiz ing the preservation of the existing transportation system.h.
the federal transportation agencies have also made equity issues an important consideration in regional transportation planning.in april,the department of transportation issued order requiring the federal transit administration and federal highway administration to consider human health and environmental effects related to transit projects that may have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on minority and populations.the order also requires the establishment of procedures to provide meaningful opportunities for public involvement by members of these populations during the planning and development of programs,policies,and activities including the identification of potential effects,alternatives,and mitigation measures.fr.
criteria for evaluating projects to be incorporated into the rtep 
in april,mtc adopted resolution,a set of financial and performance criteria under which projects proposed for the regional transit expansion plan would be evaluated.resolution identified two primary concerns undergirding the rtep improving mobility in the bay area most congested travel corridors and providing additional transit options for commuter travel.resolution provided different but roughly equivalent criteria under which rail expansion and bus expansion projects were solicited and evaluated.these criteria included whether a project had prior federal,state,and local financial commitments could be sustainably operated and maintained by its operator s once built served high density areas was increased the connectivity of the existing transit system could be easily accessed by transit users and was ready to be implemented.
mtc received proposals for fourteen rail projects and four bus projects.the rail projects included five bart projects,three caltrain projects,and six others,with a total capital cost of billion.the four bus projects had an overall capital cost of billion,including three ac transit proposals with a total capital cost of billion.the three proposals for which ac transit requested funds were leandro bus rapid transit,phase million leandro bus rapid transit,phase million and enhanced transit,miscellaneous corridors project,which included eight service corridors million.
projects included in the rtep 
on december,mtc adopted the regional transit expansion plan as resolution.the rtep included nineteen projects with a total projected capital cost of billion.the projects included all five proposed bart projects with a total capital cost of billion,three caltrain projects with a total capital cost of billion,and two ac transit projects with a total capital cost of million.ac transit request for million for its leandro bus rapid transit,phase project was excluded altogether.ac transit request for million for its miscellaneous corridors service was reduced to million,and scaled back to only three of the proposed eight service corridors.however,the largest bart expansion more than billion warm springs to san jose in fact sponsored by vta the transbay terminal project,containing bus and rail elements,was sponsored by a joint powers board of which ac transit was a member along with muni,ggt,and samtrans and the caltrain projects were sponsored by a joint powers board that included samtrans,vta,and muni.
in,the rtep was amended and updated to include twenty projects with a total project cost of billion.funding for all five bart expansions was increased.one of three caltrain projects was completed,and funding was reduced for the other two.ac transit miscellaneous corridors service was scaled back from three corridors to one,and the funding cut from million to million.funding for ac transit leandro bus rapid transit,phase project was increased from million to million.
procedural background 
plaintiffs filed their class action complaint on april,alleging intentional discrimination claims under the equal protection clause and et title vi of the civil rights act of,and state law claims for intentional and disparate impact discrimination under california government code.the parties stipulated to class certification.
the essence of plaintiffs complaint is that mtc funding decisions disproportionately favor investment in rail service over bus service so as to adversely impact bay area minorities who make up a larger percentage of regional bus ridership than rail ridership.plaintiffs argued that mtc funding practices have both the effect and intent of discriminating against minorities.
both plaintiffs and mtc filed motions for summary judgment.plaintiffs filed a motion for summary adjudication as to their prima facie case of their disparate impact discrimination under california government code section.mtc filed a motion for summary judgment as to all of plaintiffs claims,and challenged the standing of both the individual and organization plaintiffs.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of mtc as to plaintiffs intentional discrimination claims,and denied all other motions.
plaintiffs state law disparate impact discrimination claims proceeded to a bench trial.the district court found that plaintiffs had stated a prima case of disparate impact discrimination,but also found that mtc had met its rebuttal burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a substantial legitimate justification for its challenged conduct,thus shifting the burden back to plaintiffs to articulate an equally effective,less discriminatory alternative.the district court found that plaintiffs had failed to do so.this appeal followed.
standard of review 
the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.see narayan egl,cir.we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs to determine if there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and whether the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.crowe county of san diego,cir quoting miller auker,cir.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,while questions of law and mixed questions of fact and law are reviewed de novo,unless the mixed question is primary factual.see hellgate elem.sch,ex rel.bd.of,missoula county,cir.
discussion 
disparate impact 
california government code section prohibits discrimination under any program or activity that receives any financial assistance from the state.title vi is identical in prohibiting discrimination,but applies to programs sponsored with federal funds.in light of the parallel language of state and federal law,federal law provides important guidance in analyzing state disparate impact claims.see city county of san francisco fair employment housing comm n.thus,the state framework for analyzing disparate impact cases parallels the federal one a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case if the defendant facially neutral practice causes a disproportionate adverse impact on a protected class to rebut,the defendant must justify the challenged practice and if the defendant meets its rebuttal burden,the plaintiff may still prevail by establishing a less discriminatory alternative.id.at.we look to title vii disparate impact analysis in analyzing title vi claims.larry by lucille riles,cir.
a.the percentage of minorities among the san francisco bay area bus and rail ridership is not a proper measure for assessing the impact of the challenged conduct on minorities.
t o make out a prima facie case of disparate impact plaintiffs must employ an appropriate measure for assessing disparate impact.city envtl.justice alliance giuliani,cir citing urban league state of,cir.a district court may not find the existence of disparate impact on the sole basis of a statistic unless it reasonably finds that the statistic would be a reliable indicator of a disparate impact.urban league,at cir.c ourts and defendants are no
