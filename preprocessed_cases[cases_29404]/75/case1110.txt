plaintiff miguel tellez appeals the trial court denial of his motion for class certification in what is essentially a dispute.for reasons that follow,we must reverse the order denying class certification and remand to the trial court for an explanation of the court reasoning in denying the motion.
facts and proceedings below 
it is undisputed that plaintiff is a truck driver who worked for rich voss trucking.
on june,plaintiff filed a putative class action complaint against rich voss trucking,rvt,stevens creek quarry,scq,and richard voss collectively defendants alleging wage and hour violations.specifically,plaintiff contended that defendants were his joint employers and the employers of all similarly situated current and former employees of defendants.plaintiff class action complaint alleged causes of action failure to provide required meal periods,iwc wage order,failure to provide required rest periods,iwc wage order,failure to pay overtime wages,iwc order,failure to pay minimum wage,iwc order,failure to pay all wages due to discharged or quitting employees,failure to maintain required records,failure to indemnify employees for necessary expenditures incurred in the discharge of duties,failure to provide accurate itemized wage statements,and unfair and unlawful business practices bus.plaintiff alleged a tenth cause of action under the private attorneys general act of for a representative action for civil penalties.in the complaint,plaintiff alleged that he was bringing the action on behalf of himself and others similarly situated current and former employees in the state of california collectively plaintiffs of rich voss trucking,rvs,stevens creek quarry stevens creek and does collectively defendants 
on the same day that plaintiff filed his original complaint in the class action lawsuit,he filed a separate complaint the individual complaint against defendants and steve martini.this complaint alleged three causes of action disability discrimination,disability harassment,failure to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination,failure to accommodate,failure to engage in the interactive process,and retaliation,racial discrimination,racial harassment,failure to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination and harassment ibid.and national discrimination,national harassment,and failure to take all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination and harassment ibid.although the two cases were consolidated for trial and plaintiff filed a first amended complaint in both cases,it is only with the denial of class certification and the denial of his motion to amend the complaint to add a new class representative in the class action lawsuit that plaintiff takes issue.
on april,defendants brought a motion to strike the class allegations because plaintiff had failed to file a motion to certify the class defendants asserted that plaintiff was not a suitable class representative because his claims were not typical,as plaintiff worked for rvt only as a truck driver and truck drivers are regulated by the federal department of transportation regulations and are exempt from california overtime rules.further,defendants contended that plaintiff was not an adequate representative because of his impaired credibility since he had lied on his employment application when he told rvt that he had never been convicted of a felony 
plaintiff opposed the motion as an improper attempt to slip through the backdoor with a preemptive opposition to a motion for class certification that ha d not yet been filed plaintiff blamed defendants for his delay in not filing a motion for class certification by not providing documents relevant to the class allegations.in reply,defendants asserted that plaintiff attempt to blame them for the delay in filing the motion for class certification was misplaced and that their motion to strike the class allegations should be granted so the matter could proceed to trial.plaintiff filed an ex parte application for an order to extend the deadline to file his motion for class certification.the court granted the request and extended the time for plaintiff to file the motion until august,
on august,plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint to add christopher hart as the new class representative and a memorandum of points and authorities in support of his motion for class certification.attached to the memorandum of points and authorities were several exhibits including a declaration by keila carrasco who had analyzed time records of the employees of sqc and rvt plaintiff attached over pages of time records as exhibits to the motion.carrasco averred that in reviewing the records she found violations that included missed meal breaks,late meal breaks,missed second meal breaks,unpaid overtime hours after working an hour shift,unpaid overtime hours after working a hour shift,and unpaid double time hours after working a hour shift.
defendants responded to plaintiff motion by claiming that class certification was not appropriate because there were not common questions of law or fact that would predominate.defendants asserted that plaintiff claim for overtime was misplaced because rvt truck drivers are exempt from overtime requirements and because rvt and scq have policies and procedures that fully comply with the california labor code and california wage orders,individualized inquiries would be necessary to prove whether or not the policies were followed.defendants again raised the issue of plaintiff not being an adequate representative because of his credibility issues.defendants argued that they were prepared for trial and by allowing plaintiff to amend the complaint to add a new class representative they would have to reopen discovery,which would allow plaintiff another delay to bring a second motion for class certification and significantly delay the resolution of the case.
at some point the court set the hearing on the motion for class certification on september.
at the hearing on september,after counsel announced their presence for the record,the court noted that it had received no phone call regarding the motion itself.the court asked if counsel wanted to go ahead and set the trial date.plaintiff counsel told the court that he would like to be heard on both the motion to amend and the motion for class certification.the court cut off plaintiff counsel.the court stated that plaintiff counsel had not contacted the court and asked whether he had contacted opposing counsel.plaintiff counsel apologized to the court for not contacting opposing counsel,but explained that he had been out of the office in a mediation and had a trial starting that day.
the court told counsel,we ca hear the argument.you have to talk with opposing counsel.but right now we going to discuss trial setting.plaintiff counsel stated that he had no problem with setting it now.however,when plaintiff counsel pointed out to the court that the tentative decision consisted of one sentence saying that the motion was denied and asked if the court was going to issue a more detailed ruling the trial judge responded,i do intend to.when counsel asked for some kind of findings on the record for purposes of appeal so that on appeal this court would have some basis to know whether there was sic issues with numerosity,capability,commonality,adequacy the court cut off plaintiff counsel and stated that it was not discussing the motion right now.there was no phone call.
the court order on plaintiff motion for class certification states,plaintiff motion for class certification is denied.similarly,the court order on plaintiff motion for leave to amend the complaint states,plaintiff motion for leave to amend is denied.
on appeal,plaintiff contends that the denial of certification can not be affirmed as a matter of law,because it states no valid pertinent reason sufficient to uphold the order 
discussion 
denial of plaintiff motion for class certification 
at the outset we note that the denial of certification to an entire class is an appealable order.linder thrifty oil cal th,linder.this order has what has come to be known as the death knell effect of making further proceedings in the action impractical because of denial of class action status.our supreme court has held that where an order has the death knell effect of making further proceedings in the action impractical,the order is appealable.see daar yellow cab cal d,the legal effect of the order is tantamount to a dismissal of the action as to all members of the class other than plaintiff.it has virtually demolished the action as a class action.if the propriety of such disposition could not now be reviewed,it can never be reviewed.
as our supreme court explained in linder,supra,cal th,c ourts long have acknowledged the importance of class actions as a means to prevent a failure of justice in our judicial system.citations.by establishing a technique whereby the claims of many individuals can be resolved at the same time,the class suit both eliminates the possibility of repetitious litigation and provides small claimants with a method of obtaining redress citation.generally,a class suit is appropriate when numerous parties suffer injury of insufficient size to warrant individual action and when denial of class relief would result in unjust advantage to the wrongdoer.citations.but because group action also has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.citations.id.at.
section of the code of civil procedure authorizes class suits in california when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.to obtain certification,a party must establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.citations.the community of interest requirement involves three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.citation.other relevant considerations include the probability that each class member will come forward ultimately to prove his or her separate claim to a portion of the total recovery and whether the class approach would actually serve to deter and redress alleged wrongdoing.citation.linder,supra,cal th at.
class certification is generally not decided at the pleading stage of a lawsuit.t he preferred course is to defer decision on the propriety of the class action until an evidentiary hearing has been held on the appropriateness of class litigation.citation.however,if the defects in the class action allegations appear on the face of the complaint or by matters subject to judicial notice,the putative class action may be defeated by a demurrer or motion to strike.citation.in re bcbg overtime cases th.
since trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification.the denial of certification to an entire class is an appealable order citations,but in the absence of other error,a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation citation.under this standard,an order based upon improper criteria or incorrect assumptions calls for reversal even though there may be substantial evidence to support the court order.citations.accordingly,we must examine the trial court reasons for denying class certification.any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.citation.linder,supra,cal th at.
despite the great discretion afforded to the trial court,appellate review of orders denying class certification differs from ordinary appellate review.under ordinary appellate review,we do not address the trial court reasoning and consider only whether the result was correct.citation.but when denying class certification,the trial court must state its reasons,and we must review those reasons for correctness.citation.knapp v.at t wireless services,th,knapp accord linder,supra,cal th at we must examine the trial court reasons for denying class certification.
defendants take the position that plaintiff is seeking to overturn the court ruling for his own error.that is,plaintiff failed to request oral argument to contest the court tentative ruling.we are not persuaded by this argument.further,defendants argue that the trial court is not required to state its reasons in the order denying the motion.while defendant is correct that the trial court is not required to state its reasons in the actual order denying the motion,knapp,supra,th at we must be able to discern from somewhere in the record whether the trial court engaged in correct legal analysis.caro proctor gamble company th.
defendants cite walsh ikon office solutions,th walsh,dailey sears roebuck th dailey and ferdinand roten galleries,d,for the proposition that we can infer from the record the reasons upon which the lower court relied in denying class certification.
certainly,california courts have held that even if the trial court order on class certification does not state reasons,or does so without providing detail,it will be deemed sufficient for review purposes so long as the basis for the court ruling may be discerned from the record.see,supra,d,noting that it was obvious from the record the certification dispute turned on the issue of commonality of interest.however,in,the trial court decertified the class without explanation after a jury trial.id.at.accordingly,the court was able to conclude,although the trial court did not state its reasons for the decertification order,it is clear from the record that the dispute over class treatment turned on the issue of commonality of interest in law and fact.defendants moving papers focused on the assertion that defendants liability to each unnamed plaintiff would have to be individually litigated in various respects.defendants relied on weaver pasadena tournament of roses cal d and city of san jose superior court cal d to argue that the facts developed at the trial,nearly two years after the original conditional certification,showed that individual issues dominated the case.it is clear that the trial court decertification order was based on insufficient commonality to justify class treatment.id.at,italics added.
plainly,in,the record consisted of the trial record where the parties arguments and evidence as well as the court own ruling and findings during trial gave the reviewing court sufficient content and context to determine the basis for the court decertification order.there is nothing remotely similar in this case.
in dailey,supra,th,in a brief order,the trial court granted sears motion to preclude and denied dailey motion to certify the class,concluding that the individual facts and issues unique to each member of the alleged class and requiring separate adjudication are more numerous and significant than the common issues.id.at.in dailey,the trial court did state its reasons,the predominance of individual issues and the ability to bring individual claims before the court.id.at.further,the order cited appropriate legal principles relevant to the predominance and superiority analysis.ibid.accordingly,the reviewing court was able to conclude that the trial court order,elucidated by the parties briefing and oral arguments,was sufficient to permit meaningful appellate review in the case.id.at,italics added.
in walsh,supra,th,the trial court granted ikon decertification motion on the ground of insufficient commonality.the court explained common issues of law and fact do not predominate in this matter with respect to the lds account manager class,as the circumstances of each class member employment differs significantly from every other member of the class.as a result,individual hearings on both liability and damages are required for each of the or so class members,as well as the two class representatives,walsh and miller.in these circumstances,and on
