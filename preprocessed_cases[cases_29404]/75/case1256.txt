factual and procedural summary 
our factual recital is taken from the undisputed separate statements of facts and the undisputed evidence offered in support of those facts.
plaintiff was employed by defendant as a construction worker in a project to build a bridge over the dominguez channel in carson,california.the dominguez channel is a flood control channel operated by the los angeles county flood control district.
plaintiff is trained as a pile driver.he is a member of the brotherhood of pile drivers,has never belonged to a maritime organization or seaman union,and has never been licensed by the coast guard.
plaintiff worked on defendant project for three months before his injury.most of that time was spent working on a floating platform called a flexifloat barge.
the barge,which had no independent means of propulsion,consisted of three sections,which could be configured in various ways it was towed from a barge yard in long beach harbor to the job site,some three miles above the los angeles harbor on the dominguez channel.
during much of the construction job,the barge was tied up to piles or anchored to the bottom of the channel by metal cylinders called spuds.the primary function of the barge was to serve as a template to guide pile driving operations,although the barge was also used to store some pile driving equipment.the template function required the barge to be moved around the work site two to three times per week this movement was accomplished using ropes or with the assistance of a crane the crane was used to help separate the sections when it was necessary to do so in order to maneuver them around the bridge piles.
plaintiff was injured when,as the barge was being separated into sections,a heavy load on the section on which plaintiff was standing shifted and the section flipped over,throwing him into the water and causing him to lose a finger.
plaintiff sued for negligence,alternatively as a seaman under the jones act.or a harbor worker under the lhwca b.he also sued for maintenance and cure and unseaworthiness under general maritime law.
defendant moved for summary judgment on the grounds that plaintiff was not a seaman,the barge was neither a vessel nor in navigation,the dominguez channel is not a navigable waterway,and plaintiff was not a maritime worker.the trial court granted summary judgment,finding no triable issues of fact as to whether plaintiff was a seaman on a vessel in navigation in navigable waters plaintiff filed this timely appeal.
discussion 
state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction in jones act,lhwca,and general maritime law cases.state courts apply federal substantive law in deciding such cases.baptiste superior court,supra,d at.stevedoring services prudential lines,d.
on appeal after a motion for summary judgment has been granted,we review the record de novo,considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers except that to which objections have been made and sustained.guz bechtel national,cal th,d.the record reveals no rulings on evidentiary objections.
summary judgment is a mechanism intended to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.a defendant may move for summary judgment on the grounds that an entire action has no merit.code civ,subd.a.
the issues on summary judgment are framed by the pleadings,in this case the complaint.brantley pisaro th,d.a cause of action has no merit if o ne or more of its elements can not be separately established code civ,subd.n.after a defendant makes a showing of no merit,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action,subd.o.summary judgment is required if the moving papers show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,subd.c.
the plaintiff in a jones act case,which allows recovery for personal injuries suffered in the course of employment,must be a seaman.a.the jones act does not define seaman,which is a maritime term of art.mcdermott international,wilander,d.the courts have done so.t he essential requirements for seaman status are twofold.first,an employee duties must contribut e to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission.citation.second,a seaman must have a connection to a vessel in navigation or to an identifiable group of such vessels that is substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature.chandris,latsis,d.
the seaman inquiry is a mixed question of law and fact,and it often will be inappropriate to take the question from the jury.nevertheless,summary judgment or a directed verdict is mandated where the facts and the law will reasonably support only one conclusion.harbor tug barge papai,d.
although stated as two requirements,the chandris test for seaman status can be restated as four elements the employee duties must contribute to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission,the employee must have a connection to a vessel in navigation,the connection must be substantial in its duration,and the connection must be substantial in its nature.there are cases analyzing each of these elements.see,heise fishing of alaska,contribution to function of vessel or accomplishment of mission digiovanni traylor,cir vessel in navigation estate of wenzel seaward marine services,cir vessel in navigation roberts cardinal services,cir.substantial in duration in re endeavor marine,cir substantial in nature.we consider each element in turn.as the elements are conjunctive,if defendant meets its burden of showing that any element is not satisfied and plaintiff fails to raise a triable issue of material fact regarding that element,summary judgment for defendant is proper because the facts and the law would only support the conclusion that plaintiff is not a seaman code civ,subd.o.
that an employee duties must contribute to the function of the vessel or the accomplishment of its mission is a threshold requirement that is very broad a ll who work at sea in the service of a ship are eligible for seaman status.heise fishing of alaska,supra,at.in heise,a worker who was hired onto a fishing vessel after the end of the fishing season to repair its engines and fuel tank did not pass this threshold because his engagement with the vessel was only for the duration of the repairs,and only while the vessel was in port.id.at.the court found the plaintiff was a worker,not a seaman entitled to the remedies of the jones act.id.at.
in delange dutra const,cir,the court distinguished heise in finding that a carpenter who was working as a pile driver and deckhand on a barge functioning as a construction site work platform satisfied the threshold requirement.unlike the worker in heise,the delange plaintiff served on the barge while it was being moved,and performed pile driving from the barge.while the extent to which the pile driving rather than the deckhand work helped push the plaintiff over the threshold was unclear,the court also referred to cabral healy tibbits builders,cir,in which it was held that a crane operator on a barge who also was undisputed ly a worker contributed to the barge function as a crane barge.id.at,delange dutra const,supra,at.
defendant contends that plaintiff was a worker.it is undisputed that he worked as a pile driver on a barge being used for pile driving.because the mission of the barge was to serve as a platform for pile drivi
