we have for review state schuette,so d dca,a decision from the fourth district court of appeal that certified conflict with the decision from the fifth district court of appeal in cheek state,so d dca,on the issue of whether restitution must be ordered for damages arising out of an automobile accident that occurs while the defendant is driving with a suspended license.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.for the reasons that follow,we quash the fourth district decision in schuette,which reversed the trial court order denying restitution,and approve the fifth district decision in cheek.
background 
after an automobile accident that resulted in injuries to the victim,petitioner laurie schuette was charged with and convicted of driving with a suspended license and leaving the scene of an accident involving an injury.see schuette,so d at.during the sentencing hearing,the state requested the trial court to order restitution for the victim injuries.see id.the record indicates only that schuette license suspension resulted from her failure to provide proof of insurance and failure to appear for two traffic court hearings the trial court noted that to order restitution,a nexus must exist between the crime and the injuries.see schuette,so d at.finding that the fact that schuette did not have a valid driver license did not create the victim injuries,the trial court concluded that there was no nexus between the criminal act and the injury suffered and,therefore,the court denied restitution.id.the state appealed,arguing that the offense of driving with a suspended license could and should support an order of restitution.see id.
the fourth district initially stated that i t is undisputed that restitution could not be ordered in sic from the conviction for leaving the scene of an accident,citing to this court decision in state williams,so d.id.at.as to the issue of whether restitution could be imposed for the offense of driving with a suspended license,the fourth district acknowledged that before,the second district court of appeal held that restitution could not be imposed against a suspended driver who caused an accident because the fact that the driver license was suspended was not causally related to the crash.schuette,so d at citing ochoa state,so d dca stewart state,so d dca.however,the fourth district observed that the legislature had amended the restitution statute in in order to expand the criteria for ordering restitution.id.at.
the fourth district also cited to our decision in glaubius state,so d,which required that before restitution may be imposed,the court must find that the loss or damage is causally connected to the offense and bears a significant relationship to the offense.schuette,so d at citing glaubius,so d at.in reversing the trial court order denying restitution,the fourth district concluded that restitution was required in this case because schuette driving without a legal right began the criminal episode during which the accident occurred,and but for her driving with a suspended license,the victim would not have incurred damages.id.at citing glaubius,so d at emphasis supplied the fourth district certified conflict with the fifth district opinion in cheek,which held that restitution could not be imposed for damages arising from an accident in which the defendant was driving with a suspended license at the time of the accident.see schuette,so d at.
in this case,the state sought restitution for the victim medical bills and lost wages arising from an automobile accident that occurred while the defendant was driving with a suspended license.the legal issue presented is whether the trial court is required to order restitution for damages arising out of an automobile accident based on the underlying offense of driving with a suspended license where the state does not present any evidence of a causal relationship between the act of driving without a license and the accident that resulted in damages or loss.
until,the restitution statute,section,provided in pertinent part 
a in addition to any punishment,the court shall order the defendant to make restitution to the victim for damage or loss caused directly or indirectly by the defendant offense,unless it finds clear and compelling reasons not to order such restitution.
stat.supp.in,the legislature amended this subsection of by adding subsection a,so that the current version of the statute provides in pertinent part 
a in addition to any punishment,the court shall order the defendant to make restitution to the victim for 
damage or loss caused directly or indirectly by the defendant offense and 
damage or loss related to the defendant criminal episode,unless it finds clear and compelling reasons not to order such restitution.
a.stat.the state has the burden of establishing causation,see glaubius,so d at,as well as the burden of demonstrating the amount of loss sustained by the victim as a result of the offense.stat.further,the state must establish both causation and the amount of loss or damages by a preponderance of the evidence.see glaubius,so d at.
the second district in ochoa,so d at,reversed an award of restitution for damages caused by the automobile accident where the defendant was charged with both leaving the scene of an accident with injury or death and driving without a valid driver license.the second district reasoned that the damages were not sufficiently related to either of the offenses of which he was convicted.id.emphasis supplied.similarly,in stewart,so d at,the second district vacated a trial court restitution order stemming from the defendant convictions for driving with a suspended license and leaving the scene of an accident.the second district concluded that the suspension of the petitioner license was an existing condition,not the cause of the accident.because the driving with a suspended license was not the cause of the accident,it had no relationship to the damages suffered by the other driver.id.at emphasis supplied.
in cheek,the fifth district quashed a trial court order of restitution for damages arising from an automobile accident because the fact that the defendant license was suspended was not causally related to the crash.so d at emphasis supplied.judge sharp dissented,and relying on our opinion in state,so d,reasoned that as a result of the amendment,the restitutionary obligation was expanded to include damages or loss significantly related to the defendant offense.cheek,so d at sharp,dissenting emphasis supplied.thus,judge sharp concluded that restitution was required because cheek criminal episode began when he started driving without a valid license,and the damages to the other vehicle were significantly related to the criminal episode.id.
in order to resolve the conflict issue presented in this case,we begin by reviewing the case law from this court.the court first addressed the requirements for restitution in criminal cases in state,so d,where the trial court ordered a juvenile defendant to pay restitution for the damage he caused while attempting to steal radio equipment from a boat the court explained that the damage for which the trial court orders restitution need not be directly encompassed within the legal elements of an offense,but it must bear a significant relationship to the convicted offense.id.at emphasis supplied.the court concluded that the damage to the boat,including some severed wires and a hole cut into the hull,was a direct result of the attempted theft of the radio equipment and was necessary for the commission of the crime.see id.therefore,the court held that a significant relationship existed between the damages and the offense,and thus the trial court properly ordered restitution.see id.
in williams,so d at,the court interpreted section a,florida statutes,the predecessor statute to the present statute,which provided that the court shall order the defendant to make restitution to the victim for damage or loss caused directly or indirectly by the defendant offense.in williams,the defendant was convicted of leaving the scene of an accident resulting in personal injury,and the trial court ordered her to pay restitution as a condition of probation.id.although agreeing that damages resulted from the accident,williams argued that no damages were caused,either directly or indirectly,by her offense of leaving the scene of an accident.see id.the state maintained that leaving the scene was just one link in the chain of events in which the injuries took place.see id.consequently,the state argued that the events consisting of an accident in which people were injured,and williams hasty departure,formed a causal chain linking the offense of leaving the scene to the injuries sustained in the accident.see id.
in rejecting the state argument,the court stated 
the damages arising out of the accident would have occurred with or without williams committing the offense of leaving the scene of an accident.those damages transpired independent of that crime.this court,in,allowed restitution in a case where there was a significant relationship between the damages and the offense.this significant relationship test does not replace the causal relationship required by section a.rather,we believe that the significant relationship test enunciated in should work in conjunction with the causation required by the statute.
id.at emphasis supplied.because the damages arising from the accident were not caused by the act of leaving the scene of the accident,and therefore bore no relationship to the crime for which the defendant was convicted,the court approved the lower court decision that struck the restitution award as a condition of probation.see id.at.
in glaubius,so d at,a case decided after the amendment,the court addressed the issue of whether investigative costs incurred by a victim are properly included in an award of restitution.the manager of a retail store ordered an internal investigation of a store employee because the manager suspected the employee of committing theft.see id.the employee was later convicted of grand theft,and as part of his sentence,the trial court ordered the employee to pay restitution for the costs of the internal investigation.see id.although glaubius involved the statute,the court did not discuss the effect of the amendment on its analysis,but instead,referred to our decision in williams,and stated that 
t o order restitution under the statute,the court must find that the loss or damage is causally connected to the offense and bears a significant relationship to the offense.further,under the statute,the state must establish these factors by a preponderance of the evidence.
glaubius,so d at.the court held that there was a causal connection between the defendant offense and the injury because but for the defendant criminal misconduct,the investigative costs would not have been incurred.see id.the court also held that the investigative costs were significantly related to the misconduct.see id.thus,glaubius did not alter the analysis previously applied by this court in the williams and opinions.
likewise,in,so d at,the court once again reviewed the requirements for an award of restitution and reaffirmed the principle articulated in and williams that the significant relationship test works in conjunction with the causal relationship test set forth in section a the court further noted in dicta that the version of section a includes an additional restitutionary obligation for damage or loss related to the defendant criminal episode which was not present in the version of the statute.id.at however,the court did not change the analysis previously adopted in both williams and glaubius.
more recently,although not in the context of restitution,in eversley state,so d,the court explained the application of causation principles to criminal statutes and the relationship between but for causation and proximate cause 
causation consists of two distinct subelements.as legal scholars have recognized,before a defendant can be convicted of a crime that includes an element of causation,the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant conduct was the cause in fact and the legal cause often called proximate cause of the relevant harm.
in order to establish that a defendant conduct was the cause in fact of a particular harm,the state usually must demonstrate that but for the defendant conduct,the harm would not have occurred.a defendant can rebut this showing by demonstrating that the harm would have occurred in any event,regardless of the defendant conduct 
in addition to establishing causation,the state must also demonstrate that the defendant conduct was the proximate cause of the particular harm.florida courts have considered two basic questions in determining proximate cause whether the prohibited result of the defendant conduct is beyond the scope of any fair assessment of the danger created by the defendant conduct and whether it would be otherwise unjust,based on fairness and policy considerations,to hold the defendant criminally responsible for the prohibited result.
citations omitted.
although never explicitly stated in our prior restitution cases,it would appear that the court has equated the significant relationship test with the requirement of proximate causation between the criminal act and the resulting damages because the court has required both a but for causation requirement and a significant relationship requirement.indeed,this is consistent with the analysis employed by the second district in arling state,so d,dca,where the defendant who was convicted of dealing in stolen property challenged the assessment of restitution for attorneys fees incurred by the victim in an interpleader action.judge altenbernd,writing for the second district,explained 
we believe the causation required between the offense and the damage under williams is similar,if not identical,to the proximate causation required in tort between a tortious act and the resulting damage.see.std.jury instr.civ.thus,the victim should be entitled to recover damages through criminal restitution if the causal connection between the criminal offense and the damage is comparable to that proximate causation which would allow the victim to relate comparable damages to a wrongful act in tort.
id.therefore,the second district concluded that restitution was proper because i t is reasonably foreseeable to a person who deals in stolen property that the act of selling stolen property may result in a third party filing litigation.id with these principles in mind,we now turn to analyze their application to the conflict issue presented in this case.
although the fourth district referred to the effect of the amendment,as did judge sharp in her dissenting opinion in cheek,the real conflict between schuette and cheek is with the application of the but for and significant relationship tests to the criminal offense of driving with a suspended license where the defendant is involved in an accident resulting in loss or damages the fourth district concluded that schuette driving without a legal right began the criminal episode during which the accident occurred,and but for her driving with a suspended license,the victim would not have incurred damages.schuette,so d at.judge sharp,in her dissenting opinion in cheek,concluded that the damages from the accident clearly had a significant relationship to the criminal episode of driving with a suspended license.so d at sharp,dissenting.on the other hand,the fifth district in cheek concluded that the damages were not sufficiently related to the offense of driving with a suspended license to warrant the imposition of restitution.see id.at.
the state in this case does not argue that a different result is required because of the amendment,but asserts that the victim injuries were directly related to the criminal offense of driving without a license and would not have occurred but for schuette act of driving.in fact,both schuette and the state rely upon this court decision in glaubius for their respective positions.essentially,the state advocates for a blanket rule of law that would require the trial court to order restitution whenever an accident occurs while a motorist is driving with a suspended license.
we disagree with a blanket rule of law requiring restitution wh
