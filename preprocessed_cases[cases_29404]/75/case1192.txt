george ross,sued the san francisco bay area rapid transit district bart for wrongful termination in violation of public policy and for age and disability discrimination in violation of the fair employment and housing act feha,et he appeals from a summary judgment in favor of bart,asserting that there are triable issues of material fact with regard to each of his causes of action.we find that summary judgment was properly granted and affirm the judgment.
background 
after years of employment with bart,ross retired from his position as a central maintenance supervisor in september.at the time of his retirement ross was years old and on disability leave.bart had notified him in february that it was terminating his employment for dereliction and negligence in the performance of his duties.it later rescinded the termination notice and suspended ross for days to take effect when he returned from his disability leave.ross filed for a voluntary retirement after unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate a stay of the suspension pending arbitration.
in september,ross filed a complaint under feha alleging that he was fired because he was the oldest on his job,had unionized lower management,and was disabled.he received a letter under feha in october.
first amended complaint 
ross sued bart in august.his first amended complaint alleged four causes of action wrongful discharge in violation of public policy age discrimination in violation of feha failure to accommodate his disability in violation of feha and discrimination,failure to reasonably accommodate,and retaliation in violation of public policy.
ross alleged the following relevant facts 
on december,ross was staffing bart trouble desk for part of the day,taking alternating shifts with another supervisor.during the morning,the other supervisor on duty had several confrontations with technicians over a bart directive that they wear orange vests in addition to their regular uniforms,but ross had no such confrontations three mainline technicians left their shifts that morning,claiming to be sick.
ross was interviewed three times concerning the events of december.believing he had done nothing wrong,he refused to sign a prepared admission that he had been untruthful and uncooperative.after bart gave him notice of a termination hearing,ross filed for stress disability.ross did not appear at the termination hearing,believing that he was not allowed onto bart property while on disability leave the hearing officer found that ross was responsible for a work stoppage on december,and upheld bart recommendation that ross be discharged from his employment.because a discharge during disability leave was illegal,bart reduced the sanction from dismissal to days suspension,but refused to stay the penalty or arbitrate ross grievance over the suspension until he first served out a suspension without pay.
ross was terminated,in whole or in part,in retaliation for giving truthful testimony in a disciplinary hearing against one of the technicians who left work on december,and due to his age.
a psychiatrist recommended by bart insurance carrier concluded that ross was partially disabled as the result of job stress arising out of the termination incident.ross disability limited his ability to work at his old job without accommodations,but bart made no effort to investigate his impairment or negotiate appropriate accommodations.ross reasonably concluded that bart would not offer him reemployment in a position commensurate with his background,experience,and mental state.
by,among other things,falsely accusing him of causing a work stoppage,conducting a hearing and firing him while he was on disability leave,and knowingly permitting intolerable working conditions,bart constructively discharged him from employment,and wrongfully discharged him in violation of public policy first cause of action.
bart also discriminated against ross based on his age in violation of feha second cause of action by punishing him for acts and omissions that were not punished when committed by younger workers in the same category filling his position with younger,less qualified individuals and attempting to force him to retire by spreading rumors that he had retired or intended to retire.
bart failed to reasonably accommodate ross disability in violation of feha third cause of action by conditioning his return to work on proof that he could perform his old job and refusing to negotiate accommodations for his disability,convening a hearing during his disability leave,and refusing to stay his suspension.
by acting as alleged,bart also violated the public policies of this state prohibiting age and disability discrimination by employers,requiring employers to make reasonable accommodations for the disabilities of their employees,and prohibiting employers from retaliating against employees for pursuing claims of discrimination,giving truthful testimony in an internal investigation,or organizing unions fourth cause of action.
proceedings on bart summary judgment motion 
bart moved for summary judgment or,in the alternative,for summary adjudication,asserting that there was no triable issue of material fact with respect to the following issues ross first and fourth causes of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy are barred by bart statutory immunity under sections,subdivision b and ross second cause of action for age discrimination in violation of feha has no merit because ross could not establish a constructive discharge or adverse employment action ross second cause of action also fails because bart had a legitimate,reason for its challenged action and there was no substantial evidence that its stated reason was pretextual and ross third cause of action for failure to accommodate his disability is barred because his administrative complaint to the feha enforcement agency,the department of fair employment and housing dfeh,failed to provide adequate notice of this claim,and ross had therefore failed to timely exhaust his administrative remedies.
the trial court granted summary adjudication as to ross second cause of action on the ground that he had failed to come forward with a prima facie showing of age discrimination in response to bart motion.the court denied summary adjudication of ross other causes of action,and denied summary judgment.regarding the first and fourth causes of action,the court found that the immunity afforded to public employees under section was inapplicable there were triable issues of material fact as to whether ross suffered an adverse employment action and there were triable issues of material fact as to whether bart disciplined or retaliated against ross due to his participation in a disciplinary proceeding against another employee,and whether bart actions were based on an improper motive or were pretextual.the court denied summary judgment on ross third cause of action on the ground that there was a triable issue of material fact as to whether ross notation on his feha complaint that he was disabled provided sufficient notice to dfeh to exhaust his administrative remedies as to bart asserted failure to accommodate his disability.
bart petitioned for writ of mandate to this court,seeking an order directing the trial court to grant its motion for summary adjudication of ross first,third,and fourth causes of action.we issued an alternative writ directing the trial court to either set aside its order denying summary adjudication of these causes of action and grant summary adjudication of them,or to show cause why it had not done so.in the alternative writ,we stated that bart was immune from liability on ross first and fourth causes of action under sections and and as a matter of law,ross failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to his third cause of action because his feha complaint did not provide sufficient notice to the enforcing agency of the conduct alleged in that cause of action.
in light of the alternative writ,the trial court vacated the portions of its previous order denying summary adjudication of the first,third,and fourth causes of action,granted summary adjudication on these causes
