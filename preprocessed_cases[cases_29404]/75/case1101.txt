under the federal employers liability act fela,a railroad employee injured by the employer negligence may sue the employer for negligence.the action may be filed in either a state or a federal court.this case raises two questions pertaining to actions brought in california courts.
first,should the trial court tell the jury that the injured employee is not entitled to benefits under california workers compensation law the answer is no,unless a case presents unusual circumstances where the probative value of this information outweighs its prejudicial effect.
second,if the employer rejects the employee pretrial settlement offer and the employee at trial obtains a judgment more favorable than the offer,may the trial court award the employee prejudgment interest under california law the answer is no,because federal law prohibits such an award.
plaintiff ronald lund worked as a trackman for defendant san joaquin valley railroad.in the spring of,he and other employees were replacing worn railroad ties.after replacing those ties with new ones,the workers used a hydrospiker,a machine that drives spikes through the ties and into prepunched holes in tie plates under the rails.the hydrospiker did not drive all the spikes in correctly.plaintiff supervisor then told him to use a spike maul,a sledgehammer with an elongated head,to drive in spikes that the hydrospiker had only partially driven in.while swinging the spike maul,plaintiff tore two tendons in his shoulder.the injury permanently damaged his shoulder,rendering him unable to perform his job.
plaintiff sued defendant for negligence under the fela.he alleged that the spikes could not be driven in with the spike maul because they were too big for the holes in the tie plates,and that defendant should have given him a pneumatic spike driver,or air gun,to accomplish the task.before trial,plaintiff made a settlement offer,which defendant rejected.
at plaintiff request,the trial court told prospective jurors state workers compensation is not available to the plaintiff in this case.at the close of evidence,the trial court reiterated that comment as i instructed you at the beginning of the case the employee does not have the right to workers compensation benefits even though the alleged accident did occur here in the state of california.the jury found defendant negligent,and awarded plaintiff damages of.relying on california law,the court awarded plaintiff an additional in prejudgment interest under civil code section.
the court of appeal affirmed the judgment.we granted defendant petition for review.
ii.the fela et.
in california,injured employees are generally entitled to workers compensation benefits,irrespective of whether the employer was at fault,et but those benefits are not available to railroad employees who suffer injuries their right of recovery is governed by the fela,which permits recovery only if the employer acted negligently.
the fela,enacted by congress in,is founded on concepts of negligence and injury urie thompson.to provide a federal remedy for railroad workers who suffer personal injuries as a result of the negligence of their employer or their fellow employees atchison buell,d.through the fela,congress intended to create uniformity throughout the union with respect to railroads financial responsibility for injuries to their employees norfolk western liepelt,fn,d and to eliminate a number of traditional defenses to tort liability and to facilitate recovery in meritorious cases atchison,supra,at.courts construe the fela liberally to fulfill the act remedial purposes.consolidated rail corporation gottshall,d atchison,supra,at.
as noted at the outset,a fela action can be brought in either federal or state court.when,as here,a fela action is brought in state court,state law governs procedural questions,while federal law governs substantive issues.louis southwestern dickerson,d.state procedure does not apply,however,if it results in the denial of a federal right granted by congress.arnold panhandle,d brown western of alabama.see also wright,law of federal courts ed.state enforcement of federal law,expressing the view that the applicability of state procedure in federal claim cases has become so shrunken as to fall within the maxim de minimis.
iii.trial court instruction on plaintiff ineligibility for state workers compensation benefits 
defendant faults the trial court for telling the jury,at plaintiff request,that as an injured railroad worker plaintiff was ineligible for workers compensation benefits ordinarily available to injured employees under california law.
because defendant had not objected at trial to the challenged instruction,the court of appeal precluded defendant from raising the issue on appeal.a party may,however,challenge on appeal an erroneous instruction without objecting at trial.agarwal johnson cal d,griesel dart industries,cal d,fn,code civ.to support its conclusion that defendant did not preserve the issue,the court of appeal relied on the rule that when a trial court gives a jury instruction that is legally correct but is too general,lacks clarity,or is incomplete conservatorship of gregory th,d,quoting witkin,cal.procedure ed.trial,a party may challenge the instruction on appeal only if it had asked the trial court to give a clarifying instruction.but here defendant does not contend that the instruction was too general,lacked clarity,or was incomplete.rather,defendant argues that the instruction conveyed irrelevant prejudicial information to the plaintiff was ineligible for workers compensation.no objection was necessary to preserve this claim.we therefore address its merits.
ordinarily,the first step in analyzing that issue would be to determine whether the instruction pertained to a state procedure,or instead was a substantive matter,and thus,as noted earlier,governed by federal law.here,however,we need not undertake such an evaluation.under both federal and california law the jury in a fela action should,as a general rule,not be told whether the injured railroad worker action can also seek recovery from any other source,such as workers compensation.because federal and california law on this subject are identical,we need not decide which one controls below,we discuss the pertinent features of both laws.
federal law 
if an injured plaintiff gets some compensation for the injury from a collateral source such as insurance,that payment is,under the collateral source doctrine,not deducted from the damages that the plaintiff can collect from the tortfeasor.see dobbs,law of remedies ed.the collateral source rule is generally accepted in the united states helfend southern cal.rapid transit dist.cal d,see also rest d torts,and the federal courts apply the rule in fela actions eichel new york central,d eichel.
the question whether to tell the jury about collateral compensation is analytically distinct from the collateral source rule itself.but because the two issues are so closely linked,courts often draw no distinction between the two.a recent federal appellate decision observed the case law sometimes confuses these interrelated principles,moving effortlessly from the substantive to the evidentiary strands of the collateral source doctrine,and back,with little differentiation.fitzgerald expressway sewerage,cir.
the united states supreme court held in eichel,supra,d,that in a fela case brought in federal court the jury should not be told that the plaintiff has received benefits from a collateral source.in eichel,the defendant sought to show that the plaintiff had received disability pension benefits under the railroad retirement act of a collateral source,arguing the evidence was relevant to prove that the plaintiff was malingering.the high court held the evidence to be inadmissible,noting that because collateral source evidence is readily subject to misuse by a jury,the likelihood of misuse clearly outweighs the value of such evidence.eichel,supra,at.
often,as in eichel,supra,d,the question whether to tell the jury about a collateral source of recovery arises when the plaintiff can recover collateral benefits.the issue here is slightly the jury should be told that the plaintiff can not recover a collateral benefit.federal courts,however,have reached the same result in both situations ordinarily the jury should not be given that information.
in stillman norfolk western ry.cir,the trial court barred the plaintiff,stillman,from telling the jury in a fela action that he was ineligible for workers compensation benefits.the federal appellate court upheld the ruling.it explained stillman ineligibility for workers compensation benefits was completely irrelevant to the issues presented in this case,and allowing the jury to consider such information could have prejudiced the railroad.citation.moreover,we note that defendants in fela cases are not permitted to inform the jury that a plaintiff has received benefits from a collateral source.citations.we perceive no reason for a different rule when the plaintiff in a fela case seeks to inform the jury of the absence of benefits from a collateral source.id.at.
federal courts,and those state courts that have viewed the question as being governed by federal law,have consistently held that,in general,the jury in a fela action should not be told that the plaintiff can not recover benefits from workers compensation or other collateral sources.stillman norfolk western ry,supra,at weinell mckeesport connecting railroad company cir,kodack long island rail road company cir,snyder lehigh valley railroad company cir,hileman pittsburgh lake erie,applying state and federal law see also csx transportation,whittler so d,citing stillman with approval,but holding that the issue was waived by failure to object kansas city southern ry.stokes,agreeing with stillman without explaining whether it is applying federal or state law parsons norfolk and western ry,harmless error for the plaintiff to tell jury in closing argument that a fela action is the plaintiff only means of recovery.plaintiff here has not cited any decision to the contrary.
california law 
like the federal courts,california has adopted the collateral source rule.hrnjak graymar,cal d,hrnjak helfend southern cal.rapid transit,supra,cal d,but see,partially abrogating the rule in actions against a health care provider based on professional negligence.as we have explained the collateral source rule expresses a policy judgment in favor of encouraging citizens to purchase and maintain insurance for personal injuries and for other eventualities if we were to permit a tortfeasor to mitigate damages with payments from plaintiff insurance,plaintiff would be in a position inferior to that of having bought no insurance,because his payment of premiums would have earned no benefit.defendant should not be able to avoid payment of full compensation for the injury inflicted merely because the victim has had the foresight to provide himself with insurance.helfend,supra,cal d at.
and like the federal courts,california has adopted the closely related principle that,as a general rule,jurors should not be told that the plaintiff can recover compensation from a collateral source.we so held in hrnjak graymar,supra,cal d.there,the trial court allowed the defendant in a personal injury action to introduce evidence that the plaintiff had received insurance benefits,asserting the evidence was relevant to the plaintiff motives in seeking medical help and his credibility as a witness.id.at.we held the trial court abused its discretion under evidence code section in admitting this evidence of collateral source benefits.we explained the potentially prejudicial impact of evidence that a personal injury plaintiff received collateral insurance payments varies little from case to case.even with cautionary instructions,there is substantial danger that the jurors will take the evidence into account in assessing the damages to be awarded to an injured plaintiff.thus,introduction of the evidence on a limited admissibility theory creates the danger of circumventing the salutary policies underlying the collateral source rule.admission despite such ominous potential should be permitted only upon a persuasive showing that the evidence sought to be introduced is of substantial probative value.hrnjak,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
plaintiff here argues the rule should be different when it is the plaintiff who seeks to offer evidence that benefits from a collateral source are not available.he contends,as he did at trial,that unless so told,the jury may well have assumed that he was receiving those benefits in addition to the damages sought under the fela,leading the jury to conclude that he was seeking double recovery for his injuries.in support,plaintiff cites bohme southern pac.d.bohme.
in bohme,a railroad employee sued his employer under the fela for injuries suffered in a fall at work.at trial,both the plaintiff and the trial court told the jury that he was ineligible for workers compensation benefits.the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.on appeal,the railroad argued the jury should not have been told of the plaintiff ineligibility for workers compensation.the court of appeal disagreed.it reasoned that most jurors know that an injured employee can get workers compensation benefits under state law,and unless told that such compensation is not available to the plaintiff,they may wonder why the plaintiff is suing the employer.it is to prevent such speculation,the bohme court said,that a trial court can tell the jury of the plaintiff ineligibility for worker compensation.bohme,supra,d at.
as the bohme court observed,not telling jurors in a fela action of the plaintiff employee ineligibility for workers compensation may lead them to speculate why the injured employee is suing the employer.we note,however,that if jurors are told that the injured employee is ineligible for workers compensation benefits,they may consider it unfair that in a fela action the injured worker can recover only if the employer negligence caused the injury.that concern might,in turn,lead the jury to award damages regardless of fault.
there is an additional reason why the jury in a fela action should not be told of the plaintiff ineligibility for state workers compensation benefits.as defendant amicus curiae,the association of american railroads,points out in its brief,many injured railroad employees can receive compensation for their injuries,regardless of fault,under the railroad retirement act of.that law permits some permanently injured railroad workers,depending on age and years of service,to receive a disability annuity.as noted earlier,the collateral source rule prohibits a defendant in a fela action from telling the jury of the availability to the injured worker of this collateral source of compensation.given that prohibition,it would be unfair to allow a plaintiff in a fela action to tell the jury of the unavailability of workers compensation benefits.
for the reasons given above,we hold that in a fela action brought in state court the jury,as a general rule,should not be told of the injured employee ineligibility for benefits flowing from california workers compensation law or any other collateral source.we disapprove bohme southern pac,supra,d,to the extent that it is inconsistent with this conclusion 
there may,however,be unusual circumstances that would permit such disclosure in a fela action.trial courts may find,in the appropriate exercise of discretion under evidence code section,that the probative value of such evidence outweighs its prejudicial effects.as we have held in the past,evidence that the plaintiff in a personal injury action has received compensation from a collateral source should be admitted only upon a persuasive showing that the evidence sought to be introduced is of substantive probative value.hrnjak,supra,cal d at.that reasoning also applies when,as here,the question is whether to tell the jury that a plaintiff has not received compensation from a collateral source.
federal law,too,grants trial courts discretion not to apply the collateral source rule in those unusual situations where the probative value of collateral source evidence outweighs its prejudicial effects.for instance,in santa maria commuter cir,the federal appellate court noted that the
