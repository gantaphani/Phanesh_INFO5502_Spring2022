this appeal concerns federal motor vehicle safety standard fmvss,a regulation promulgated under the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act et safety act,which authorizes automobile manufacturers to install a seatbelt at the inboard seating positions of a vehicle.the issue is whether the regulation preempts a common law tort action against a manufacturer for not choosing the option to install a seatbelt at such a position.we conclude that under the united states supreme court decision in geier american honda motor company,d and its progeny this claim is preempted because it conflicts with fmvss.
in addition,while plaintiffs alleged other grounds for recovery not barred by federal preemption,in light of their concessions the failure to use a seatbelt was integral to the case,we affirm the judgment dismissing the action.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs delbert williamson,alexa williamson,through delbert as her guardian ad litem,and the estate of thanh williamson sued defendants mazda motor of america,and mazda motor corporation for strict products liability,negligence,deceit,and wrongful death arising from injuries suffered in a motor vehicle collision between their mazda mpv minivan and another vehicle.
according to the second amended complaint,delbert and alexa williamson wore seatbelts at the time while thanh williamson,sitting in the middle seat of the vehicle middle row,wore only a seatbelt or lap belt.the complaint alleged all three occupants suffered injuries in the crash,but thanh injuries were fatal because the forces generated by th e collision caused her body to jackknife around her defective lap belt,causing severe abdominal injuries and internal bleeding.plaintiffs claimed defendants were liable because they designed,manufactured,marketed,and sold a minivan that,among other things,was equipped with inferior lap belts in the middle seating positions,when it should reasonably have been equipped with seat belts as were the vehicle remaining seats,and that defendants knew of the dangers of lap belts,but failed to warn consumers,including plaintiffs,of such dangers.
defendants answered the amended complaint and then moved for judgment on the pleadings.they argued federal preemption barred plaintiffs allegation thanh williamson death was directly attributable to the center seat being equipped with a lap safety belt rather than a lap and shoulder belt because it directly conflict ed with the choice that federal law gave to manufacturers the trial court granted the motion with leave to amend.it agreed federal law precluded a state tort action to the extent the theory of liability was the lap only seat belt,but recognized plaintiffs had sufficiently pleaded other theories of liability as to the decedent death 
the third amended complaint substantially repeated the foregoing allegations.it described the minivan as defective,in part,because defendants equipped it with an inferior and unsafe belt for t he center seating position of the middle bench seat that did not restrain the upper torso of decedent it also alleged defendants breached their duty of care by fail ing to adequately warn about the hazards,risks,and dangers of such defects.capitalization omitted.in addition,it pleaded t he defects and failures alleged were joint and concurrent causes of p laintiff s injuries,such that each defect and failure can not be evaluated and adjudicated separately but must be evaluated and adjudicated together but for the presence of all of these defects,thanh williamson injuries would not have been as severe nor would she have died 
defendants filed a demurrer and a motion to strike,reasserting the federal preemption argument.they noted this pleading conflicted with the trial court prior ruling and also argued plaintiffs had effectively admitted all of their to thanh based on the allegation her death ar ose from the belt,and thus the pleading other theories of liability,including the failure to warn allegation,were preempted as well.
when the hearing began,the court announced it had tentatively decided to overrule the demurrer.the judge acknowledged i have ruled you ca have liability just based on defendant decision to install a lap belt and,to the extent you can find that language in the third amended complaint i do think plaintiffs are going to be able to proceed on that.but the federal preemption claim notwithstanding,the trial judge noted,that does mean that you could state a cause of action for negligen ce in how you hooked it up or negligen ce in how you design the seat that was going to accommodate it,or any other tort theory.
however,at the request of plaintiffs counsel,the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to all of plaintiffs claims arising out of the death of thanh williamson counsel explained that,after the last hearing i thought long and hard after reading all the briefs,considering the court order and being the person that would try this case on behalf of plaintiffs,about w hat evidence can i put on and what evidence will be barred based on the ruling.he answered this question,declaring with the court ruling as it presently stands,i do think i could put on a case on behalf of my clients.i really do.if you strike all these wrong seatbelt option allegations,i am left with nothing t he court ruling is we ca talk about the seat belt.but the seat belt is integral because had thanh williamson had the belt like the two other occupants,she would be here today.they survived.i do want to charge my clients the cost of experts and spend money for a claim that is not going to have any legs if we can not refer to the versus belt.we wo be able to do it.i will be trying a case and you might as well give a.
subsequently,the parties stipulated to a dismissal of plaintiffs remaining claims for personal injuries to dexter and alexa williamson with prejudice.based thereon,the trial court entered judgment for defendants.

federal preemption 
the supremacy clause of article vi of the united states constitution grants congress the power to preempt state law.state law that conflicts with a federal statute is without effect.citations.dowhal smithkline beecham consumer healthcare cal th,d.federal regulations have no less effect than federal statutes.fidelity federal sav.and loan ass de la cuesta,d.since state regulation can be as effectively exerted through an award of damages as through some form of preventive relief cipollone liggett group,d,the principles of law governing federal preemption apply with equal force whether the state law takes the form of a legislative enactment or an award of damages through private suit.citations.carrillo acf industries,cal th,d.
federal preemption can arise in the following circumstances.first,congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law second,in the absence of explicit statutory language,state law is where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively finally,state law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law,either because it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,citation or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.citations.dowhal smithkline beecham consumer healthcare,supra,cal th at,d.it is the latter form of federal conflict preemption that is at issue in this case.

the safety act 
congress enacted the safety act in to reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries resulting from traffic accidents,in part,by prescrib ing motor vehicle safety standards for motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment former.to accomplish this purpose,congress directed the united states department of transportation dot to prescribe motor vehicle safety standards a taking into consideration relevant available motor vehicle safety information,whether a proposed standard is reasonable,practicable,and appropriate for the type of motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment for which it is prescribed,and the extent to which the standard will carry out the declared purposes of this act.b,see also motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins,d.dot subsequently delegated the authority to promulgate these rules to the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa.a motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins,supra,at,fn.
one of the standards promulgated under the safety act is fmvss.it specifies performance requirements for the protection of vehicle occupants in crashes.
originally fmvss declared that,other than the driver side and outboard front passenger seats,a manufacturer could install either a type or type seat belt assembly in each passenger car seat position.in the early,nhtsa received a petition to extend the seatbelt requirement to rear seating positions.nhtsa declined the request,citing compatibility issues between belts and then popular child restraint systems,plus a finding the benefits,if any,to be gained with type belts for adults would not justify the additional cost of requiring the installation of type belts in these positions.
after receiving a second petition,nhtsa reconsidered the issue and in announced a rule change extending the seatbelt requirement to rear outboard seating positions of most vehicles,including multipurpose passenger vehicles.nhtsa supported this rule change by citing the estimate of the costs involved with such a requirement ha d changed substantially because of the significant increase in the number of vehicles voluntarily equipped with rear seat belts,a nationwide increase in seatbelt usage that rendered the benefits of rear seat belts reasonably related to the costs of their installation,and a finding that belts in the rear seat would provide better protection for children restrained in booster seats.
at the same time nhtsa considered,but rejected,a proposal to require belts at rear inboard seating positions.citing the potential need for manufacturers to make structural changes to some vehicles,the increased costs of installing seatbelts,and the limited use of that seating position,nhtsa concluded the small safety benefits resulting from extending the seatbelt requirement to rear center seating positions did not outweigh the resulting technical difficulties and substantially greater costs.thus,when defendants manufactured plaintiffs mpv minivan,fmvss declared all multipurpose passenger vehicles shall meet the requirements of,which authorized either a type or type seat belt assembly,except in rear outboard designated seating position s,which shall be equipped with an integral type seat belt former,b.
fmvss application to this case 
the question presented here is whether fmvss preempts the present lawsuit because a common law action seeking to hold defendants liable for installing a seatbelt at a rear inboard passenger seat conflicts with the safety standard.
the safety act contains a preemption clause,declaring,when a motor vehicle safety standard is in effect under this chapter,a state or a political subdivision of a state may prescribe or continue in effect a standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment only if the standard is identical to the standard prescribed under this chapter.b.but this statute also contains a savings clause that states c ompliance with a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter does not exempt a person from liability at common law.e.
in ketchum hyundai motor th,d,a passenger was injured in a crash while wearing a automatic shoulder belt without a lapbelt.the defendant argued the lawsuit was preempted because the version of fmvss authorized this type of passenger crash protection.describing fmvss as a minimum standard for motor vehicle safety ketchum hyundai motor,supra,th at,d,and citing the safety act savings clause,the court of appeal rejected the preemption claim.in the preemption clause,congress precludes the states from establishing or continuing any motor vehicle safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance.citation.the savings clause citation provides that compliance with a safety standard issued under the safety act does not exempt a person from liability under common law.congress clearly distinguished between motor vehicle safety standards,which are preempted,and common law standards for liability,which are not.this language unambiguously expresses the intent of congress to preserve common law liability actions.id.at,d.
but in geier american honda motor company,supra,the supreme court rejected this approach.there the plaintiff suffered injury in a collision.although the vehicle was equipped with both shoulder and lap seat belts,she sued the defendants alleging the car was defective because it lacked an airbag.the defendants argued the version of fmvss,which made installation of an airbag optional,preempted the lawsuit.
initially,geier rejected the defendants express preemption claim by reconciling the preemption and savings clause provisions a reading of the express provision that excludes tort actions gives actual meaning to the saving clause literal language,while leaving adequate room for state tort law to example,where federal law creates only a floor,a minimum safety standard.citation.geier american honda motor company,supra,at.
geier also announced two further holdings relevant to this case.first,it concluded n othing in the language of the saving clause suggests an intent to save tort actions that conflict with federal regulations geier american honda motor company,supra,at.and thus it does not bar the ordinary working of conflict principles.ibid.
second,geier held a no airbag action like the one before us actually conflicts with fmvss.geier american honda motor company,supra,at.in reaching this conclusion,geier reviewed fmvss history and dot explanation for its decision not to require airbags in all vehicles.id.at.the court rejected the view that fmvss sets a minimum airbag standard the dot comments,which accompanied the promulgation of fmvss,make clear that the standard deliberately provided the manufacturer with a range of choices among different passive restraint devices,that would bring about a mix of different devices introduced gradually over time and fmvss would thereby lower costs,overcome technical safety problems,encourage technological development,and win widespread consumer of which would promote fmvss safety objectives.citation.id.at.
geier thus found the regulation embodies the secretary of transportation policy judgment that safety would best be promoted if manufacturers installed alternative protection systems in their fleets rather than one particular system in every car.citation.petitioners tort suit claims that the manufacturers had a duty to design,manufacture,distribute and sell a motor vehicle with an effective and safe passive restraint system,including,but not limited to,airbags.citation.in effect,petitioners tort action depends upon its claim that manufacturers had a duty to install an airbag when they manufactured the car.such a state,a rule of state tort law imposing such a its terms would have required manufacturers of all similar cars to install airbags rather than other passive restraint systems,such as automatic belts or passive interiors.it thereby would have presented an obstacle to the variety and mix of devices that the federal regulation sought because the rule of law for which petitioners contend would have stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the important federal objectives that we have just discussed,it is.citations.geier american honda motor company,supra,at.
while geier is distinguishable because it dealt with passive restraints,not seatbelts,its analysis of fmvss rejected ketchum approach in determining the preemptive effect of that safety standard.furthermore,subsequent appellate decisions involving tort actions challenging the use of seatbelts have followed geier and held these lawsuits are preempted under fmvss.in hurley motor coach industries,cir,the court ruled a bus driver action against the vehicle manufacturer for installing a seatbelt was preempted.geier noted the controversy over the efficacy and utilization of airbags and seat belts and concluded that fmvss deliberately sought variety by leaving the choice of passenger protection system up to manufacturers.citation.id.at.in griffith general motors cir,the court held fmvss preempted a design defect claim asserted by a plaintiff injured in an accident while seated in the front center seat of a truck wearing a seatbelt.id.at.
more apropos to this case,three other appellate decisions have applied geier approach to hold defective design lawsuits challenging an automobile manufacturer use of a seatbelt at the inboard position of a passenger vehicle rear seat were preempted by fmvss.carden general motors cir,roland general motors,heinricher volvo car.
these decisions considered and rejected many of the arguments raised by plaintiffs in this appeal.for example,citing the statutory definition of a motor vehicle safety standard and language appearing in the nhtsa explanations of its decisions,plaintiffs describe fmvss regulations governing the installation of seatbelts as minimum standards.carden rejected a similar claim a review of the regulatory and rule making history of fmvss supports the conclusion that the nhtsa decision to allow car manufacturers the option to install either or seat belts in the rear center seating position of passenger vehicles was deliberate,and the agency identified specific policy reasons for its decision w hen fmvss was initially promulgated,the dot required either or seat belts in each seating position in passenger vehicles.citation.as technology advanced and seatbelt use became more widespread,seatbelt requirements evolved.in,noting the decreased cost and increased use of seatbelts in rear seating positions,the nhtsa amended fmvss to require the use of seat belts in rear outboard seating.citation.the commentary preceding the final rules indicates that the nhtsa considered comments suggesting that seat belts be required in the rear center seating position as well,but decided to leave manufacturers the option to select between and belts.citation.in excluding the rear center seat from this requirement,the agency explained that there were more technical difficulties associated with any requirement for belts at center rear seating positions,and that belts at center rear seating positions would yield small safety benefits and substantially greater costs,given the lower center seat occupancy rate and the more difficult engineering task.citation.based on this language,it is clear that the agency decision was deliberate and based on managing technological constraints and cost efficiency.carden general motors,supra,at,fns.omitted.
plaintiffs also assert that u nlike geier,this case does not involve airbags,passive restraint devices,or the unique policy judgments made by nhtsa when it promulgated the version of fmvss governing passive restraints.griffith rejected the argument that geier was limited to lawsuits involving a manufacturer choice between passive restraint options.t he supreme court framed the issue as one of intent.in implementing the congressional mandate to reduce the number of vehicular deaths,did dot intend to establish only certain minimum safety standards,beyond which a state would be free to require more,or did it deliberately design a regulatory scheme which provides specific passenger restraint options,no one of which would state law be free to foreclose in geier,the court found that the history of fmvss makes clear that dot saw it not merely as a minimum standard,but as a comprehensive regulatory scheme.citation.dot intended and expected fmvss to produce a mix of restraint devices,both passive and manual,in cars and trucks.citation.dot own contemporaneous explanation of fmvss was that it believed this mix would maximize the likelihood that people would actually use the passenger restraint systems installed in their cars and trucks.citations.griffith general motors,supra,at,fn.omitted see also roland general motors,supra,at nhtsa regulation of seat belt use was motivated by the same policy concerns identified in geier as the basis for the agency decision to permit various passive restraint options safety and consumer acceptance with respect to child restraints,technical difficulties including issues as to anchor locations and possible interference with the rear view mirror,and lowering costs to encourage technological developments.
a third argument plaintiffs assert is that this case is governed by the united states supreme court later decision in sprietsma mercury marine,d.sprietsma arose from the death of a woman after she fell off a boat and was struck by the blades of the boat outboard motor.her husband sued the motor manufacturer,alleging the product was unreasonably dangerous because it lacked a propeller guard.in state court,the defendant succeeded in having the lawsuit dismissed on the ground it was preempted under the federal boat safety act of et because the united states coast guard,which had the authority to issue regulations under the act,had studied the issue and chosen not to adopt a regulation requiring the installation of propeller guards.
the united states supreme court reversed.in response to the defendant claim of implied preemption arising from the coast guard inaction,it noted,the coast guard decision not to impose a propeller guard requirement presents a sharp contrast to the decision of the secretary of transportation that was given effect in geier sprietsma mercury marine,supra,at.thus i t is quite wrong to view that decision as the functional equivalent of a regulation prohibiting all states and their political subdivisions from adopting such a regulation.the decision to take no regulatory action,citation,left the law applicable to propeller guards exactly the same as it had been before the subcommittee began its investigation indeed,history teaches us that a coast guard decision not to regulate a particular aspect of boating safety is fully consistent with an intent to preserve state regulatory authority pending the adoption of specific federal standards.id.at.
as explained in carden general motors,supra,sprietsma involved a complete absence of regulatory action,which was not the case here.as discussed above,the nhtsa identified particular policy reasons for its decision to allow manufacturers the option of selecting between the two seat belt designs,and included this option as a part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme.citation.thus,sprietsma does not control.id.at see also roland general motors,supra,at.
plaintiffs also claim sprietsma stands for the proposition that nhtsa analysis of technical feasibility,costs,and relative safety benefits does not reflect any authoritative message of federal policy against belts in seats.this argument misstates the supreme court opinion in sprietsma.after quoting the coast guard explanation for rejecting a propeller guard requirement and discussing the reasons given by that agency,the court concluded although the coast guard decision was undoubtedly intentional and carefully considered,it does not convey an authoritative message of a federal policy against propeller guards.sprietsma mercury marine,supra,at.thus,sprietsma does not bar a federal regulation from having a preemptive effect simply because the agency employs a analysis to reach its decision.in fact,by statute,dot and nhtsa are re
