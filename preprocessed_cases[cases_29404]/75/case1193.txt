plaintiffs brought a nationwide class action lawsuit alleging an automobile manufacturer breached its express warranties and violated federal and state consumer protection laws,by failing to disclose an engine defect that did not cause malfunctions in the automobiles until long after the warranty expired.the trial court sustained the manufacturer demurrer to the second amended complaint without leave to amend.finding no breach of warranty and no violation of federal or state statutes in the conduct alleged in the complaint,we affirm the judgment of dismissal.
factual and procedural background 
on december,elizabeth daugherty and eleven other plaintiffs collectively,daugherty or plaintiffs filed a nationwide class action lawsuit against american honda motor.and related companies.the putative class consisted of persons and entities in the united states,puerto rico and the virgin islands who purchased or leased accord and prelude automobiles equipped with a type of engine denominated the engine.the suit alleges the engine manufactured by honda had a defect resulting,over time,in the slippage or dislodgment of the front balancer shaft oil seal.according to the suit,the defect causes oil loss and contamination of nearby engine parts and,in severe cases,requires repair or replacement of the engine.the defect may be easily repaired by installing a retainer bracket designed to maintain the oil seal in its proper position.
the second amended complaint complaint alleges that,after the introduction of the engine in the accord and prelude,honda received adverse event reports and actual notice that automobiles equipped with engines were experiencing severe mechanical problems as a direct and proximate result of oil leaking from the front balancer shaft oil seal,and knew or should have known that as a result of the engine defect,the oil seal could slip or become dislodged from the engine block,causing oil to leak onto and damage the nearby timing and balancer belts,and potentially causing further damage to the engine itself.in response to the adverse events reports,honda designed a retainer bracket to prevent dislodgment of the oil seal.
in october,honda initiated a product update campaign,targeting only the model year accord and prelude automobiles and early production runs of the model year automobiles,and issued a press release announcing the details of the campaign.the campaign included an offer for free installation of a retainer bracket.in march,the campaign was expanded to include an offer to replace any dislodged oil seal,contaminated timing and balancer belts,and damaged engines discovered during installation of the retainer bracket.some,but not all,owners of model year automobiles were also offered reimbursement for previous repair costs resulting from the defect.the complaint alleges owners of model year accords and preludes were not notified of the campaign or the defect,even though the defect also affected their automobiles,and adequate notice was not given to a significant number of owners of models.as a result,hundreds of thousands of owners have been or will be forced to pay to repair or replace the front balancer shaft oil seal and for damage to timing and balancer belts and other engine damage.the complaint alleges honda,despite constructive and actual knowledge of the defect,deliberately failed to remedy it and failed to warn the public of the risk of damage by and from the defect.
the named plaintiffs first discovered the defects in their of which were purchased some discovered it in,when the mileage on the cars ranged from to miles one plaintiff alleges his accord suffered an oil leak causing total engine failure in,at miles.three cars owned by four other plaintiffs suffered an oil leak from the front balancer shaft oil seal and malfunctioned,at,and miles,respectively.the remaining seven named plaintiffs do not allege their automobiles have yet suffered any oil leak or malfunction.
based on the facts alleged,daugherty asserted causes of action for breach of express warranty violation of the trade commission improvement act unlawful,unfair and fraudulent business practices in violation of the unfair competition law and violation of the consumers legal remedies act.plaintiffs sought class certification,compensatory and punitive damages,attorney fees and injunctive relief.the injunctive relief sought included an injunction requiring honda to continue the product update campaign begun in october and extend its provisions to include model year accords and preludes notify all owners of its offer to provide free installation of a retainer bracket and replace any dislodged oil seals,contaminated belts and damaged engines found during the installation of the bracket.alternatively,daugherty sought an injunction compelling honda to create a fund available to remedy the defect and requiring honda to bear the cost of notice to class members regarding the availability of funds to remedy the defect.daugherty also sought an injunction requiring honda to disgorge all profits wrongfully obtained through the unlawful,unfair and fraudulent business practices alleged.
the trial court sustained honda demurrers to the original,first and second amended complaints,in the last instance without leave to amend.the trial court observed 
opening the door to plaintiffs new theory of liability would change the landscape of warranty and product liability law in california.failure of a product to last forever would become a defect,a manufacturer would no longer be able to issue limited warranties,and product defect litigation would become as widespread as manufacturing itself.if such a change is to come,another court must be its harbinger.
daugherty filed a timely appeal from the subsequent judgment of dismissal.
discussion 
we agree with the trial court that daugherty failed to state a claim under any of the four causes of action alleged in the complaint,and discuss each cause of action in turn.
breach of express warranty.
honda express warranty to purchasers covered automobiles for years or miles,whichever comes first,and stated honda would repair or replace any part that is defective in material or workmanship under normal use it is undisputed that the defect in the engines did not cause any malfunction in the automobiles of the named plaintiffs within the warranty period,and in many cases still has not done so.daugherty argues,however,that honda warranty does not require discovery of the defect during the warranty period,and that a defect that exists during the warranty period is covered,particularly where it results from an inherent design defect,if the warrantor knew of the defect at the time of the sale.we disagree.
the law governing express warranties is clear.a warranty is a contractual promise from the seller that the goods conform to the promise.if they do not,the buyer is entitled to recover the difference between the value of the goods accepted by the buyer and the value of the goods had they been as warranted,subd.a,subd.a seller may limit its liability for defective goods by disclaiming or modifying a warranty.krieger nick alexander imports,d.the general rule is that an express warranty does not cover repairs made after the applicable time or mileage periods have elapsed.abraham volkswagen of america,cir,abraham.
several courts have expressly rejected the proposition that a latent defect,discovered outside the limits of a written warranty,may form the basis for a valid express warranty claim if the warrantor knew of the defect at the time of sale.abraham,supra,at walsh ford motor,walsh i citing cases.abraham explained 
v irtually all product failures discovered in automobiles after expiration of the warranty can be attributed to a latent defect that existed at the time of sale or during the term of the warranty.all parts will wear out sooner or later and thus have a limited effective life.manufacturers always have knowledge regarding the effective life of particular parts and the likelihood of their failing within a particular period of time m anufacturers can always be said to know that many parts will fail after the warranty period has expired.a rule that would make failure of a part actionable based on such knowledge would render meaningless limitations in warranty coverage.abraham,supra,at.
similarly,walsh i observed that 
t o hold that all latent defects are covered under the written warranty,whether they become apparent to the customer before or after the expiration of the written warranty,would place an undue burden on the manufacturer.the manufacturer would,in effect,be obliged to insure that a vehicle it manufacturers is for its entire life.walsh i,supra.at.
daugherty points to alberti general motors.alberti,which found that the reasoning in walsh i did not apply to a class action claim of breach of warranty for a defective braking system,where of named plaintiffs did not experience any difficulty with their automobiles during the written warranty period.alberti observed plaintiffs alleged the defect was least to the sense that,as each automobile was sold,it exposed the owner and the public to the potential of a loss of vehicle control.id.at,fn.omitted.the court concluded plaintiffs incurred the diminished value of their the time of sale,for it was then that gm broke its warranty that the brakes would function safely,and that the automobiles were merchantable and fit for the purpose of providing the ordinary transportation plaintiffs expected of them.ibid.like the court in abraham,w e do not find the reasoning of alberti persuasive and decline to follow it.abraham,supra,at.as abraham points out,the alberti court apparently confused concepts of express and implied warranty perhaps because alberti also involved implied warranty claims when it concluded general motors breached its warranty that the automobiles were merchantable and fit for the purpose of providing ordinary transportation.alberti,supra.at.daugherty makes no implied warranty claims.alberti also is factually inapposite,because a significant number of the named plaintiffs in alberti alleged problems during the warranty period id.at.
at its core,daugherty claim is that because the language of honda express warranty did not state that the defect must be found,discovered or manifest during the warranty period,the warranty covers any defect that exists during the warranty period,no matter when or whether a malfunction occurs.we agree with the trial court that,as a matter of law,in giving its promise to repair or replace any part that was defective in material or workmanship and stating the car was covered for three years or miles,honda did not agree,and plaintiffs did not understand it to agree,to repair latent defects that lead to a malfunction after the term of the warranty.accordingly,the court properly sustained honda demurrer to daugherty cause of action for breach of express warranty 
ii.violation of the trade commission improvement act.
the trade commission improvement act,sections et,authorizes a civil suit by a consumer to enforce the terms of an implied or express warranty.calls for the application of state written and implied warranty law,not the creation of additional federal law,except in specific instances in which it expressly prescribes a regulating rule.walsh ford motor,walsh ii.accordingly,the trial court correctly concluded that failure to state a warranty claim under state law necessarily constituted a failure to state a claim under.
daugherty asserts she has properly pled a cause of action under,even in the absence of a state law warranty claim.however,the only authority cited in support of this contention is alberti,supra.at.alberti,a class action under,did not discuss whether a warranty claim could be stated under if no claim could be stated under state law.even if it had,the district court opinion in alberti would have been effectively overruled by the circuit court of appeal later decision in walsh ii holding otherwise.moreover,abraham,supra,was likewise a class action suit under,and held,as discussed,that express warranties did not cover automobile defects manifesting themselves after expiration of the time and mileage limits of the relevant warranties.the trial court did not err in finding no claim was stated under.
iii.violation of the consumers legal remedies act.
the consumers legal remedies act clra proscribes specified unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in transactions for the sale or lease of goods to consumers,subd.a.the unlawful acts or practices include 
representing that goods have characteristics which they do not have,subd.a and 
representing that goods are of a particular standard,quality,or grade,if they are of another,subd.a.
daugherty alleges honda violated the clra by c oncealing and failing to disclose that the model year preludes and accords equipped with engines contain a defect,and by continuing to market and sell defective cars notwithstanding knowledge of the defect.daugherty further alleges honda issued a partial product update campaign and press releases designed to and likely to mislead owners of models into believing that their cars were not defective,and failed to give proper notice of the defect to model year owners.we agree with the trial court that these allegations do not state a violation of the clra.
the complaint fails to identify any representation by honda that its automobiles had any characteristic they do not have,or are of a standard or quality they are not.all of plaintiffs automobiles functioned as represented throughout their warranty periods,and indeed many still have experienced no malfunction.daugherty insists,however,that the clra should be broadly interpreted to include claims based exclusively on fraudulent omissions,and for this proposition cites outboard marine superior court d.outboard marine.in outboard marine,the court held that the practices proscribed by the,r epresenting that goods are of a particular standard,quality,or grade,if they are of another,subd.a included a proscription against a concealment of the characteristics,use,benefit,or quality of the goods contrary to that represented.outboard marine,supra,d at.as the court observed,it is fundamental that every affirmative misrepresentation of fact works a concealment of the true fact.id.at.while we do not disagree with outboard marine,it does not assist daugherty,because the complaint does not allege any representation of fact that works a concealment of the true fact.ibid.in other words,and as outboard marine also opined,the clra proscribes a concealment of characteristics or quality contrary to that represented,but in daugherty case,no representation was made to which the alleged concealment was contrary.id.at.
the facts in outboard marine clarify the point.in that case,the defendant manufactured an vehicle trackster,and represented that it was designed to operate within the parameters of certain specifications,including gradeability percent grade or degrees plus side hill ability of degrees traction to get up grades as steep as percent and even greater makes the impassable possible runs smoothly over rocks,stones and rough places and was the most reliable vehicle ever produced at the same time,the defendant allegedly knew,but did not disclose,that the vehicle would not operate within its design criteria,the vehicle was unstable and would roll over forward on a downgrade,and its braking system was totally defective.outboard marine,supra,d at.the court held this conduct unquestionably falls within the activities proscribed by the clra.id.at.the court compared the plaintiff allegations of misrepresentations under the clra with its allegations in a second cause of action for fraudulent concealment,and concluded the two causes of action allege,in different language,identical conduct.the court explained 
the clra cause of action alleges,among other things,that the trackster has great ability grade or plus while the fraudulent concealment cause of action stated that it was concealed that the trackster did not have that capability to say that the hydrastatic transmission provides positive braking as alleged in the clra cause of action,necessarily conceals that the braking system is totally defective.the allegation that the trackster maneuverability is unsurpassed because of the control as alleged in the clra cause of action necessarily conceals that t he control handle aggravates the latent instability of the machine as alleged in the fraudulent concealment cause of action.id.at.
the court therefore concluded that the clra proscription against r epresenting that goods are of a particular standard if they are of another includes a prohibition on concealment of the characteristics contrary to that represented.outboard marine,supra,d at.
in short,although a claim may be stated under the clra in terms constituting fraudulent omissions,to be actionable the omission must be contrary to a representation actually made by the defendant,or an omission of a fact the defendant was obliged to disclose.in daugherty case,no representation is alleged relating to the engine,which functioned as warranted.accordingly,no claim has been stated 
the court of appeal in bardin daimlerchrysler th,d bardin recently reached precisely the same conclusion.in bardin,the manufacturer used tubular steel in the exhaust manifolds of some of its vehicles instead of more durable and more expensive cast iron.the plaintiffs sued under the ucl and the clra.the court found no claim was stated under either law.as to the clra,the court held 
plaintiffs claim for violation of the clra fails because the second amended complaint neither alleged facts showing daimlerchrysler was bound to disclose its use of tubular steel exhaust manifolds,nor alleged facts showing daimlerchrysler ever gave any information of other facts which could have the likely effect of misleading the public for want of communication of the fact it used tubular steel exhaust manifolds.the second amended complaint did not allege a single affirmative representation by daimlerchrysler regarding the exhaust manifolds.id.at,d.
daugherty asserts the complaint alleges facts showing honda had a duty to disclose the alleged defect in its engine and made affirmative representations at the time of sale and thereafter,thus meeting the standards stated in bardin.neither assertion is correct.daugherty alleged no facts that would establish honda was bound to disclose the defect in the engine.bardin,supra,th at,d.daugherty claims the complaint alleges honda knowledge of unreasonable risk to plaintiffs at the time of sale,but the unreasonable risk alleged is merely the risk of serious potential damages namely,the cost of repairs in the event the defect ever causes an oil leak.the sole allegation mentioning safety is the paragraph claiming punitive damages,and that paragraph merely asserts a legal conclusion that honda conduct was carried on with a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of plaintiffs and others,entitling plaintiffs to exemplary damages under civil code.see blank kirwan cal d,courts treat a demurrer as admitting all properly pleaded material facts,but not contentions,deductions,or conclusions of fact or law.the complaint is devoid of factual allegations showing any instance of physical injury or any safety concerns posed by the defect.see bardin,supra,th at,d plaintiffs alleged the manufacturer knew and concealed fact that tubular steel exhaust manifolds prematurely cracked and failed much earlier than conventional cast iron manifolds plaintiffs did not allege any personal injury or safety concerns and did not allege use of the manifolds violated any warranty or other agreement.honda affirmative representations at the time of sale were its express warranties,as to which no breach occurred.see part i,ante.as in bardin,no facts are alleged which show honda ever gave any information of other facts which could have the likely effect of misleading the public for want of communication of the defect in the engine daugherty complaint did not allege a single affirmative representation by honda regarding the engine bardin,supra,th at,d.accordingly,the trial court correctly concluded daugherty did not state a viable claim under the clra.
iv.violation of the unfair competition law.
daugherty asserts the conduct alleged in the complaint constitutes unlawful,unfair and fraudulent business practices within the meaning of the unfair competition law ucl,business and professions code section et.again,we disagree.
conduct violating the ucl includes any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice bus.by proscribing unlawful business practices,the ucl borrows violations of other laws and treats them as independently actionable.in addition,practices may be deemed unfair or deceptive even if not proscribed by some other law.thus,there are three varieties of unfair competition practices which are unlawful,unfair or fraudulent.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.daugherty fails to allege a violation of the ucl under any of the three prongs.
first,we rejected daugherty claims that honda conduct violated and the clra.consequently,daugherty can not state a violation of the ucl under the unlawful prong predicated on a violation of either statute,as there were no violations 
second,the conduct alleged does not constitute a fraudulent business act or practice.unlike common law fraud,a business and professions code section violation can be shown even without allegations of actual deception,reasonable reliance and damage.historically,the term fraudulent,as used in the ucl,has required only a showing that members of the public are likely to be deceived.committee on children television,general foods cal d.daugherty contends honda failure to disclose the defect in the engine at the time of sale,failure to include model years in its product update campaign and press releases,and failure to give proper notice to purchasers of model year cars is likely to deceive those customers into believing that no such defect exists.we can not agree that a failure to disclose a fact one has no affirmative duty to disclose is likely to deceive anyone within the meaning of the ucl.as observed in bardin,supra,th at,d,i n order to be deceived,members of the public must have had an expectation or an assumption about the matter in question.in bardin,the complaint did not allege the public had any expectation or made any assumptions regarding the life span of the exhaust manifold of the manufacturer vehicles,or any facts showing the manufacturer had made any representation of any kind,much less any misrepresentation,regarding its vehicles.ibid.holding a complaint did not state a cause of action under the fraud prong of the ucl.the same is true in this case.the only expectation buyers could have had about the engine was that it would function properly for the length of honda express warranty,and it did.honda did nothing that was likely to deceive the general public by failing to disclose that its engine might,in the fullness of time,eventually dislodge the front balancer shaft oil seal and cause an oil leak.
third,daugherty asserts in its opening brief,without elaboration,that honda conduct was inherently injurious to consumers and thus an unfair business practice under the ucl again,we disagree.this court has recently formulated a test for determining whether a practice is unfair in consumer cases under the ucl.guided by,we concluded the factors defining unfairness are the same as those used under section of the federal trade commission act section test.camacho automobile club of southern california th,d.an act or practice is unfair if the consumer injury is substantial,is not outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition,and is not an injury the consumers themselves could reasonably have avoided.ibid.in this case,we need not analyze all factors in the section test,because the conduct alleged fails to meet the first factor the injury to consumers is not substantial,if indeed it can be characterized as a cognizable injury at all see bardin,supra,th at,d complaint did not state a ucl claim for unfair business practices use of less expensive and less durable materials in vehicles to make more money did not violate public policy,no representations were made by the manufacturer about the composition of the exhaust manifold which was made with steel inste
