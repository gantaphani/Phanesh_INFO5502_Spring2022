facts and procedural history 
highway currently runs through the heart of downtown sandpoint,idaho,and is the only highway that ties northern idaho to southern idaho.the proposed highway construction project the project will improve in and around sandpoint.
the project will be funded and constructed in four separate phases.the first,second,and fourth phases involve widening the existing highway to four lanes.the third phase involves realigning an approximate stretch of to create a byway that will route the highway to the east of sandpoint and remove from the downtown sandpoint area.because the agencies deem the third phase to be the most important phase of the project,the agencies have proceeded with that phase first.
in september,the agencies approved a final environmental impact statement the eis for the project.in may,the agencies issued a record of decision the rod for the project.in the rod,the agencies selected the sand creek byway as the preferred alternative for the third phase of the project.as initially planned in the eis,the sand creek byway involved constructing two miles of new highway along the east side of sand creek,building a partial structure over sand creek and bridge street,and building a full diamond interchange at the junction of and state highway.
in april,the agencies released an environmental assessment the ea that included various changes to the project design described in the eis.these changes all relate to the third phase of the project,the sand creek byway,and were made in response to input from various members of the local community.the changes include traffic design as building additional and adding a third lane for safer well as aesthetic improvements and mitigation as constructing a pedestrian and bicycle pathway along sand creek and building three artificial habitat enhancement areas in sand creek.the ea concluded that the changes to the project design would not have significant impacts beyond those already considered in the eis.based on this conclusion,the agencies issued a finding of no significant impact fonsi.
in august,the agencies prepared an environmental reevaluation the reevaluation covering the project.the reevaluation set forth additional changes to the project design and assessed possible environmental effects of those changes.the majority of the changes involve dredging sand creek and will result in the removal of approximately cubic yards of material from sand creek.the reevaluation concluded that there was no additional significant impact and that neither a supplemental environmental impact statement seis nor an environmental assessment ea was required.
in july,after the agencies released the ea and issued its fonsi determination,but before the agencies prepared the reevaluation,nican filed suit in the district court challenging the agencies approval of the project.on the parties for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the agencies and against nican.
nican moved for an injunction pending appeal,which the district court denied.nican then sought and obtained an injunction pending appeal from a motions panel of this court.after oral argument in this expedited appeal,we lifted the injunction and allowed construction of the sand creek byway to commence.this opinion sets forth the explanation for our decision.
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.nw.ecosystem alliance fish wildlife,cir.the administrative procedure act apa provides authority for the court review of decisions under nepa and section f of the department of transportation act,c.see pit river tribe forest,cir alaska ctr.for the env t armbrister,cir.under the apa,a reviewing court may set aside agency actions that are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.as this court recently explained 
review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow,and we do not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.rather we will reverse a decision as arbitrary and capricious only if the agency relied on factors congress did not intend it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,or offered an explanation that runs counter to the evidence before the agency or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.

discussion 
nepa is our basic national charter for protection of the environment.ctr.for biological diversity highway traffic safety,cir.although nepa does not impose any substantive requirements on federal agencies,it does impose procedural requirements.see lands council,at.through these procedural requirements,nepa seeks to make certain that agencies will have available,and will carefully consider,detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts,and that the relevant information will be made available to the larger public audience.id.quoting robertson methow valley citizens council,d.
nican argues that the agencies violated nepa procedural requirements by a failing to consider alternatives to changes to the project set forth in the ea,b failing to disclose and assess in the ea the impacts of dredging sand creek,c failing to consider a tunnel alternative for the project,d failing to consider the impacts the project will have on historical properties,and e failing to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement.we address each of these claims in turn.
failure to consider alternatives 
nican argues that the agencies violated nepa by failing to consider alternatives to the various changes to the project design set forth in the ea.we disagree.
nepa requires the agencies to study,develop,and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.e.this alternatives provision applies whether an agency is preparing an environmental impact statement eis or an environmental assessment ea,and requires the agency to give full and meaningful consideration to all reasonable alternatives.native ecosystems council forest,cir.however,an agency obligation to consider alternatives under an ea is a lesser one than under an eis.id.at.thus,whereas with an eis,an agency is required to r igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives,see a,with an ea,an agency only is required to include a brief discussion of reasonable alternatives.see b.
nican does not dispute that the agencies adequately explored and evaluated reasonable alternatives to the project in preparing the eis.nican also does not challenge the agencies selection,in the rod,of the sand creek byway as the preferred alternative.rather,nican argues that the agencies violated nepa because they failed to consider alternatives to the various changes to the project design set forth in the ea.
in the ea,the agencies considered and briefly discussed two alternatives the project with the changes proposed in the ea,and the project without the proposed changes,proceeding with the project as previously described in the eis.as discussed in section below,the changes to the project proposed in the ea will not result in significant environmental effects that were not previously evaluated in the eis.under these circumstances,we hold that the agencies fulfilled their obligations under nepa alternatives provision when they considered and discussed only two alternatives in the ea.see native ecosystems,at holding that the agency complied with nepa alternatives provision in preparing an ea where the agency considered only two no action alternative and a preferred alternative b requiring only a brief discussion of reasonable alternatives in an ea.
failure to dredging 
nican argues that the agencies violated nepa by failing to disclose and assess in the ea,or a supplemental ea,the impacts of dredging sand creek.we disagree.
prior to issuance of the ea,there were internal discussions within the agencies regarding the possible need for the excavation or dredging of sand creek.there also was,however,a good deal of uncertainty within the agencies about whether dredging would be required and,if so,the extent of that dredging.for example,the initial application to the army corps of engineers indicated a belief that no dredging would be required.and shortly before the ea was issued,hydraulics engineers were still examining at least three dredging alternatives,and the design remained subject to change.
the agencies could not adequately or meaningfully evaluate the environmental impacts of any potential dredging until they had more information,which depended at least in part on ongoing discussions with the army corps of engineers and the clean water act permitting process.once additional information regarding the proposed dredging was available,the agencies performed the reevaluation to analyze the dredging and its projected impacts,and to determine whether the new information required the preparation of a seis or a supplemental ea.see idaho sporting cong.alexander,cir price road neighborhood ass dep t of,cir a.the agencies concluded that the dredging would not have significant environmental impacts beyond those already considered,and thus that neither a seis nor a supplemental ea was required.
the agencies use of the reevaluation process is substantially similar to that approved in price road,at,and we find no fault with the agencies use of that process here.
in price road,a freeway project initially contemplated two enclosed tunnels but was revised to include two loop ramps instead of the tunnels.id.at.the agencies considered,in an environmental reevaluation,the environmental effects of the changes and determined there were no discernible differences in the level of environmental impacts beyond those previously considered.id.at.the agency thus did not prepare an ea or eis for the changes.id.
we noted that,while nepa does not specifically address how an agency should decide when changes require a more formal ea or eis,the federal highway administration had specifically provided for reevaluations as a means to determine whether or not the approved environmental document remains valid.id.at citing c.we thus concluded that if the agency,after the requisite hard look in a reevaluation,determines that the new impacts will not be significant or not significantly different from those already considered,then the agency is in full compliance with nepa and is not required to conduct a supplemental ea.id.at see also highway j citizens group mineta,cir holding that when a known issue came into sharper focus after the formal environmental documents were issued,it was not improper to use internal reevaluation to analyze the issue.
in the present case,the agencies took the requisite hard look at the impacts of dredging sand creek in the reevaluation,and determined that there were no new impacts that were significantly different than those already considered and that neither a seis nor a supplemental ea was therefore required.we hold that the agencies did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in making those determinations,and that they complied with nepa in their evaluation of the proposed dredging 
tunnel alternative 
nican argues that the agencies violated nepa by failing to consider a new tunnel alternative for the project.again,we disagree.
agencies have a continuing obligation to consider new information that comes to light,even after the issuance of an eis.see c ii requiring the agency to prepare supplements to either draft or final environmental impact statements if t here are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts see also marsh oregon natural res.council,d a n agency need not supplement an eis every time new information comes to light after the eis is finalized on the other hand,nepa does require that agencies take a hard look at the environmental effects of their planned action,even after a proposal has received initial approval.friends of the clearwater dombeck,cir when new information comes to light the agency must consider it,evaluate it,and make a reasoned determination whether it is of such significance as to require a supplemental eis.internal quotation marks and citation omitted hughes river watershed conservancy glickman,cir holding that the agency violated nepa by failing to take a hard look at new information regarding zebra mussel infestation.
this continuing obligation,however,extends only to new information or circumstances regarding environmental impacts that may not have been appreciated or considered when the eis was prepared.an agency is not required by nepa to consider new alternatives that come to light after issuance of the eis absent substantial changes in the proposed action relevant to environmental concerns,or significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.c see.
here,the tunnel alternative is not new information or a new circumstance regarding environmental impacts that may not have been appreciated or considered when the eis was prepared,and there is no substantial change in the project that is relevant to environmental concerns.accordingly,we hold that the agencies did not violate nepa by failing to consider the tunnel alternative when it was brought to their attention in 
impacts to historic properties 
nican argues that the agencies violated nepa by taking a phased approach to how the project will impact historic properties,and failing to take a hard look at how the construction and operation of the project will impact the burlington northern railroad depot the depot.we disagree and hold that the agencies fully complied with nepa on this issue.
nepa requires federal agencies to consider the environmental impact of major federal action.see san carlos apache tribe united states,cir citing c see also coliseum square ass n,jackson,cir.nepa has no independent requirement that an agency examine,separate and apart from any environmental impacts,the impact that a federal action will have on historic properties.nican reliance on nepa regulations requiring consideration of environmental impacts to support its argument is therefore misplaced.
moreover,although an eis is required to include discussions of historic and cultural resources,see g,the agencies eis complied with this requirement.the eis considered the impacts the project is anticipated to have on historic properties,primarily focusing on the impacts of the sand creek byway alternative versus a couplet alternative.the agencies ultimately chose the sand creek byway alternative,in part because the couplet alternative potentially would have impacted numerous historic sites,whereas the sand creek byway alternative only would potentially impact the depot and some underground sites 
the eis recognized possible noise and vibration impacts,noted general steps that would be taken to minimize impacts,and indicated that additional surveys and mitigation measures would be undertaken after selection of the preferred route.the ea included a more detailed noise analysis following testing and modeling,which concluded that there were no significant adverse effects from the project the ea also described various mitigation procedures to protect the depot from other construction activities,including the changes to the project and ongoing monitoring,developed in consultation with the state historic preservation officer shpo 
we hold that the broad overview in the eis of the project impacts on historic properties,cou
