this appeal requires us to revisit the constitutional propriety of a state sunday closing laws.appellant kittery motorcycle,kittery is a motorcycle dealership located in kittery,maine,near the new hampshire border.kittery claims that maine sunday closing laws.ann.tit,west supp,violate the united states constitution guarantees of equal protection and due process because,as a result of numerous exemptions enacted over the past half century,these laws authorize the sale of everything on sundays except motor vehicles defined to include motorcycles under maine law.kittery claims that,as a consequence,it loses substantial business to dealerships in new hampshire,a state that permits the sale of motorcycles on sunday.
while sunday closing laws may be vestiges of a bygone era,we conclude that the laws at issue are not constitutionally infirm.just as the district court rejected kittery challenge to maine sunday closing laws,so do we.

proceedings below 
kittery filed suit in the united states district court for the district of maine on august,seeking a declaratory judgment that sections and are unconstitutional to the extent they prohibit motorcycle dealers from selling motorcycles in maine on sundays.in the alternative,kittery sought a declaration that its dealership could legally operate on sundays pursuant to the amendment to section the exemption for retail stores larger than square feet.
following limited discovery,both sides moved for summary judgment.kittery assailed the closing laws on a number of fronts.first,it argued that sections and violate the united states constitution guarantees of equal protection and due process in that they single out motor vehicle dealerships for closure while permitting every other business to remain open on sundays.next kittery argued that,assuming arguendo that the state could constitutionally proscribe sunday motor vehicle sales,the state had no rational basis for classifying motorcycles as motor vehicles.kittery maintained that motorcycles are more akin to recreational as vehicles and sale on sundays is not proscribed.finally,kittery argued that sections and are unconstitutionally vague and that the amendment to section impliedly repealed section.
in a thoughtful opinion,the district court expressed frustration with the seemingly illogical nature of the statutory scheme.ultimately,however,the district court held that kittery arguments must fail in light of the constitutional presumption that absent some reason to infer antipathy,judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted.kittery motorcycle,rowe,d,quoting beach communications,d.judgment for the defendant was entered accordingly,and this appeal ensued.where,as here,summary judgment has been granted,the court of appeals reviews the matter de novo,regarding the record and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the party who lost below.grant,llc comm r of me.dep t of,food rural,cir.
a.the equal protection and due process claims 
as explained above,kittery claims that maine sunday closing laws violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection and substantive due process in making its claims,kittery does not argue that an equal protection analysis differs in any way from a due process analysis.indeed,the parties have,by and large,framed their arguments almost solely in terms of equal protection.accordingly,we will analyze kittery claims solely in terms of equal protection.see minnesota clover leaf creamery,d remarking that if statute does not violate equal protection,it follows a fortiori that it does not violate the fourteenth amendment due process clause,cir noting that the type and kind of scrutiny applied,and the result,would be no different on either theory.
the supreme court has developed a tripartite rubric for evaluating equal protection challenges to legislation.when a statute burdens certain fundamental rights,voting rights or the right to interstate reviewing court will strictly scrutinize that statute,upholding it only if the government can clearly demonstrate a compelling interest incapable of being served by less intrusive means.see,of,d right to interstate travel storer brown,d brennan,dissenting voting rights.likewise,a reviewing court will apply strict scrutiny if a legislative distinction is based on a suspect classification such as race or national origin.see,shaw reno,d racial classifications.by the same token,the supreme court has identified other classifications,such as illegitimacy,which are less suspect and thus subject to a less exacting level of scrutiny,often characterized as intermediate scrutiny.in such cases,the government must demonstrate at a minimum that the challenged classification is substantially related to an important government objective.clark jeter,d.
all other regulations,including the statute under review in this case,are subject to the third and least exacting tier of basis social and economic legislation that does not employ suspect classifications or impinge on fundamental rights must be upheld when the legislative means are rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.hodel indiana,d.the parties do not dispute that kittery equal protection challenge to maine sunday closing laws entails this lowest level of scrutiny.kittery maintains,however,that even under this rational basis test,maine sunday closing laws are unconstitutional as applied to automobile and motorcycle dealerships.
kittery faces an uphill battle.under the rational basis test,the classifications in maine sunday closing laws come to us bearing a strong presumption of validity,beach communications,at.as another court has noted,e ven foolish and misdirected provisions will be upheld under this test.craigmiles giles,cir.kittery task is made all the more difficult because the state,in order to defeat kittery claim,need only articulate some reasonably conceivable set of facts that could establish a rational relationship between the challeng
