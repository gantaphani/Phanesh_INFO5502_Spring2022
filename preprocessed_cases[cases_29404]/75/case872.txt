freedom airlines has been a regional carrier for delta air lines since.after delta sought to terminate its regional connection agreement with mesa air group,freedom corporate parent mesa commenced this action seeking an injunction prohibiting delta from terminating the agreement.the district court granted mesa motion for a preliminary injunction,holding,inter alia,that mesa had shown a substantial likelihood of success on its equitable estoppel claim.we affirm.
background 
the district court factual findings,which we review for clear error,fischer neraida,cir,were these in,mesa and delta entered into an agreement for mesa to act as a delta regional operate its own aircraft under the delta name and to service delta passengers on flights initially,mesa operated out of orlando,florida.subsequently,delta asked mesa to operate flights out of new york john kennedy airport.
jfk has worse weather and more airspace congestion than orlando,which makes flight cancellations more common.the increased likelihood of cancelled flights was significant because the connection agreement rewards mesa for months where it achieves a high completion rate,and authorizes delta to terminate the contract if mesa completion rate falls below for three months of any period of a consecutive.
the connection agreement does not define completion rate.initially,the parties understood completion rate to mean the ratio of scheduled flights to flights that actually reach their destination.however,flights may be cancelled for a number of reasons.they may be cancelled by the faa based on weather,or by air traffic control based on congestion.alternatively,they may be cancelled in advance by the carrier itself when the carrier anticipates unfavorable conditions.specifically,when a carrier anticipates that only a portion of scheduled flights will be allowed to depart,it may of its own initiative cancel lower priority flights to increase the likelihood that higher priority flights will reach their destinations.this is called a coordinated cancellation.
between and,when mesa was operating out of orlando,its completion rate was often over.during this period,mesa counted coordinated cancellations against its reported completion rate,and did not report such cancellations to delta as a separate statistic.
because jfk less hospitable operating conditions had the potential to affect not only mesa compensation but also its ability to meet the connection agreement renewal targets,mesa sought assurances from delta that mesa would not be penalized by the move.mesa was particularly concerned about coordinated cancellations,which were much more common at jfk than at orlando in early,delta coo assured mesa ceo that delta would work with mesa to make appropriate modifications to the parties agreement to ensure that mesa would not be penalized by the move to jfk.subsequently,delta manager courtney boyd promised mesa coo jorn bates that coordinated cancellations would not be counted toward mesa completion rate.in reliance on these verbal assurances,mesa subsequently agreed to hundreds of coordinated cancellations.it also stopped counting coordinated cancellations toward its completion rate and billed delta accordingly.between september and january,delta paid mesa based on its reported completion rate calculation which did not count coordinated cancellations without objection.
the parties relationship took a turn for the worse in.in march,delta senior management met to discuss a plan to respond to rising fuel prices by actively enforcing exit provisions in contracts in order to reduce regional jet capacity.the plan singled out the mesa connection agreement for cancellation.subsequently,delta initiated negotiations to buy out the mesa contract,and,when negotiations proved unsuccessful,delta sent mesa a letter terminating the connection agreement ostensibly based on mesa completion rates for october,december and february.there is no dispute that mesa completion rate fell below in february regardless of the method of accounting for coordinated cancellations.however,if coordinated cancellations are excluded,mesa completion rate for october and december of was well over 
a week after receiving delta termination notice,mesa commenced this action seeking an order enjoining delta from terminating the connection agreement.mesa subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction,arguing,inter alia,that delta should be equitably estopped,based on its assurances that it would not do so,from counting coordinated cancellations toward mesa completion rate.the district court granted mesa motion for a preliminary injunction.
ii.discussion 
our review of a district court decision granting a preliminary injunction is somewhat complex we review legal conclusions de novo,keener convergys,cir,factual findings for clear error,fischer,at,and the ultimate decision to grant or deny the injunction for abuse of discretion.bellsouth,mcimetro access transmission,llc,cir.
to obtain a preliminary injunction,the moving party must show substantial likelihood of success,irreparable harm,that the balance of equities favors granting the injunction and that the public interest would not be harmed by the injunction.bellsouth,at.only the first element of this test is at issue here delta argues that mesa has not shown a substantial likelihood of success on its estoppel claim.it argues first that the district court erred by applying new york law to mesa estoppel claim,and second that the district court factual findings were insufficient as a matter of new york law to support estoppel.
as a threshold matter,we hold that the district court correctly applied new york law to mesa estoppel claim.the connection agreement contains a provision stating that the agreement is subject to new york law.although delta argues that this provision does not apply to equitable claims,it conceded at oral argument that it did not make this argument below.thus,its argument that new york law should not apply to mesa estoppel claim is waived.see daewoo motor,motors,cir holding that arguments,if not properly presented to the district court,are waived 
applying new york law to mesa estoppel claim,we agree with the district court that mesa has shown a substantial likelihood of success.under new york law,a n estoppel rests upon the word or deed of one party upon which another rightfully relies and so relying changes his position to his injury.nassau trust montrose concrete prods,internal quotation marks omitted.the elements of estoppel,in other words,are a false representation,reasonable reliance and a detrimental change of position delta argues that the district court factual findings were insufficient to establish any of these elements.we disagree.
false representation 
delta argues that there was no evidence that it made false representations to mesa.specifically,it argues that the district court findings establish at most that it failed to correct mesa mistaken belief that the parties had reached an agreement not to count coordinated cancellations toward mesa completion rate silence,it claims,does not constitute a false representation as a matter of new york law.
this argument is wide of the mark for two reasons.first,under new york law,words or conduct may give rise to estoppel.nassau trust,at.here,the evidence was that,after mesa and delta allegedly agreed to modify the connection agreement,mesa chief operating officer jorn bates sent delta an email memorializing this agreement and mesa representatives sent multiple followup emails referencing the agreement,to which delta never responded.the evidence also showed that,knowing that mesa believed that the parties had agreed that coordinated cancellations would not be counted against it and that mesa had begun excluding coordinated cancellations from its invoices,delta paid mesa invoices without objection.even without more,delta failure to take reasonable steps to correct mesa alleged misunderstanding seems to us sufficient conduct to satisfy new york falsity requirement.see,john robert vito,app.div d dep t noting that false conduct includes the failure to promptly assert a right where such failure has given rise to cir
