plaintiff lucille mccabe appeals from a judgment entered in a products liability action after the trial court granted summary judgment for defendants american honda motor company,incorporated and saturn of the valley,incorporated saturn.mccabe was injured when the driver side air bag in her honda civic failed to deploy in a frontal collision with another car.mccabe sued honda,the air bag manufacturer,and saturn,the reseller,alleging the air bag was defective in both its manufacture and its design the trial court granted honda motion for summary judgment,reasoning the expert declaration from a honda engineer established that the air bag was not intended to inflate under the circumstances of the crash and that mccabe testimony that she expected the air bag to deploy was insufficient,without expert testimony,to raise a triable issue of material fact as to product defect.
on appeal,mccabe contends she raised triable issues of fact as to design defect under the consumer expectation theory and maintains the court erred in holding the consumer expectation test inapplicable as a matter of law.we agree mccabe raised triable issues of fact as to whether a driver side air bag,in the disputed factual context of the frontal collision at issue in this case,is the kind of product about which consumers can form minimum safety assumptions.consequently,it was error for the trial court to conclude,as a matter of law,that the consumer expectation test was inapplicable.
summary judgment was also improper because honda failed to provide any evidence negating the alternative,theory of design defect available to mccabe.under that alternative test,a product that causes injury may be defective in design notwithstanding its satisfaction of consumer expectations if the design contains an excessive danger that outweighs its relative merit.
factual and procedural background 
on september,while traveling westbound in her civic,mccabe came to a full stop in the left turn lane of a controlled intersection and waited for a break in oncoming traffic to make a left turn.according to mccabe,as the light turned yellow and she prepared to make her left turn,a cadillac traveling eastbound at a high speed collided head on with her civic.although the civic was equipped with a driver side air bag,the air bag did not deploy in the crash.mccabe,who suffered damage to her face and teeth in the accident when her head slammed against the steering wheel,sued honda and saturn,alleging the civic air bag was defective in its design manufacture.
honda motion for summary judgment 
honda moved for summary judgment,arguing that the air bag performed in accordance with its intended design.honda included with its motion the owner manual for the civic,advising the consumer that the air bag system is designed to inflate only in a severe frontal collision comparable to a crash into a parked car at miles per hour,and will not inflate in a moderate frontal collision,or during a rear impact,side impact,or a even if the impact is severe.the owner manual also included an illustration depicting the frontal collision range to span from the outside corner of one front headlight to the outside corner of the other.
honda also included the expert declaration of mary christopherson,a honda staff engineer involved in the design and testing of automotive air bags.christopherson explained that determining whether an air bag should have deployed after a given collision required an analysis of the angle of impact and the longitudinal deceleration experienced by the vehicle in the collision as compared with the severity of a miles per hour full frontal impact.according to christopherson,the air bag is designed to deploy when the crash sensors predict in the first moments of a collision that the deceleration of the vehicle along its longitudinal axis will be more severe than a full frontal barrier impact at or above miles per hour,and is designed not to deploy if the longitudinal deceleration of the vehicle is less severe than a full frontal barrier impact below miles per hour.in addition,the frontal collision range for deployment is defined as an impact with a principal direction of force that is within degrees of the centerline of the vehicle.air bags are not intended to deploy in impacts in which the principle sic force vector is outside the degree range,unless the crash severity is so severe that the longitudinal deceleration of the vehicle exceeds the severity of a miles per hour full frontal barrier impact.
christopherson reconstructed the accident based on the physical damage to the vehicles as depicted in the photographs,and concluded the left front corner of the civic made initial contact with the left front wheel area of the cadillac at a frontal collision range,outside the degree frontal collision range required for the air bag to deploy.she determined the longitudinal component of the crash was approximately four miles per hour,very clearly less severe than a full frontal barrier impact in which the air bag is designed to deploy.based on the foregoing,christopherson opined that the air bag system performed as designed,and there was no evidence of a defect.
mccabe opposition 
in opposition to the summary judgment motion,mccabe maintained the cadillac collided with her civic head on.mccabe included photographs of the civic showing extensive damage to the left front hood area and to the left side of the car and claimed the collision occurred within the frontal collision range identified in the owner manual.mccabe also included witness testimony,including her own and that of the cadillac driver,that the cadillac was traveling at a speed at or in excess of miles per hour when it collided with her civic.mccabe testified she purposely purchased a car with an air bag for safety reasons and expected the air bag would deploy in a collision like the one in this case.
honda reply and the trial court ruling 
in reply,honda observed that mccabe offered no expert testimony refuting christopherson expert opinion that the air bag performed in accordance with its intended design.honda argued that the consumer expectation test set forth in barker lull engineering cal d,barker,permitting a plaintiff to prove a design defect with circumstantial evidence that the product performed below the safety standard an ordinary consumer would expect,did not apply to the deployment of an air bag,which,it maintained,involved sophisticated technology and was outside the ordinary experience of the consumer.
the trial court granted summary judgment for honda,reasoning that,by omitting from her opposition any expert testimony contravening christopherson declaration,mccabe had failed to produce evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the air bag should have deployed under the circumstances of this accident.the court concluded,without explanation,that the consumer expectation test,permitting a plaintiff to establish a design defect without resort to expert testimony,was inapplicable to the circumstances of this case.
mccabe filed a timely notice of appeal.
contention 
mccabe contends the trial court erred in concluding the consumer expectation test for defective design was inapplicable under the facts of this case and under the consumer expectation test,she raised triable issues of fact as to whether the air bag design was defective.

product defect and design defect.
california recognizes two distinct categories of product defects manufacturing defects and design defects.barker,supra,cal d at pp.a manufacturing defect exists when an item is produced in a substandard condition.barker,at,see,lewis american hoist derrick d.manufacturer failure to comply with its own design specifications regarding assembly of crane showed manufacturing defect.such a defect is often demonstrated by showing the product performed differently from other ostensibly identical units of the same product line.barker,at.
a design defect,in contrast,exists when the product is built in accordance with its intended specifications,but the design itself is inherently defective.barker,supra,cal d at.in barker,the supreme court recognized two tests for proving design defect.the consumer expectation test permits a plaintiff to prove design defect by demonstrating that the product failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner.id.at,italics omitted.this test,rooted in theories of warranty,recognizes that implicit in a product presence on the market is a representation that it is fit to do safely the job for which it was intended.barker,at,see also soule general motors cal th,d,soule ordinary users or consumers of a product may have reasonable,widely accepted minimum expectations about the circumstances under which it should perform safely.consumers govern their own conduct by these expectations,and products on the market should conform to them.if the facts permit an inference that the product at issue is one about which consumers may form minimum safety assumptions in the context of a particular accident,then it is enough for a plaintiff,proceeding under the consumer expectation test,to show the circumstances of the accident and the objective features of the product which are relevant to an evaluation of its safety soule,at,d,leaving it to the to employ its own sense of whether the product meets ordinary expectations as to its safety under the circumstances presented by the evidence.soule,supra,cal th at,d,campbell general motors cal d.expert testimony as to what consumers ordinarily expect is generally improper.soule,at,d,expert testimony as to what laypersons may expect from product improperly invades province of jury.
the second test for design defect is known as the test.under this test,products that meet ordinary consumer expectations nevertheless may be defective if the design embodies an excessive preventable danger.barker,supra,cal d at,soule,supra,cal th at,d.to prove a defect under this test,a plaintiff need only demonstrate that the design proximately caused the injuries.once proximate cause is demonstrated,the burden shifts to the defendant to establish that the benefits of the challenged design,when balanced against such factors as the feasibility and cost of alternative designs,outweigh its inherent risk of harm.barker,at,soule,at,d.
the two tests provide alternative means for a plaintiff to prove design defect and do not serve as defenses to one another.a product may be defective under the consumer expectation test even if the benefits of the design outweigh the risks.curtis state of california ex rel.of transportation d.on the other hand,a product may be defective if it satisfies consumer expectations but contains an excessively preventable danger in that the risks of the design outweigh its benefits.barker,supra,cal d at.
whether a plaintiff may proceed under the consumer expectation test or whether design defect must be assessed solely under the test is dependent upon the particular facts in each case.soule,supra,cal th at,d.because i n many situations the consumer would have no idea how safe the product could be made,the consumer expectation test is reserved for cases in which the everyday experience of the product users permits a conclusion that the product design violated minimum safety assumptions and is thus defective regardless of expert opinion about the merits of the design.id.at,d.for example,the ordinary consumers of modern automobiles may and do expect that such vehicles will be designed so as not to explode while idling at stoplights,experience sudden steering or brake failure as they leave the dealership,or roll over and catch fire in collisions.id.at,fn,d,see also campbell general motors cal d,passenger on bus injured during sharp turn could use consumer expectation test to prove absence of grab bar was design defect public transport is matter of common experience and required no expert testimony sparks,th,d insulation containing asbestos and causing fatal disease was a product within ordinary experience and understanding of consumer arnold dow chemical th,d home pesticides causing disability was product within common knowledge of consumer,and,therefore,defect could be assessed under consumer expectation theory.
some products cause injury in a way that does not engage its ordinary consumers reasonable minimum assumptions about safe performance.for example,the ordinary consumer of an automobile simply has no idea how it should perform in all foreseeable situations,or how safe it should be made against all foreseeable hazards.soule,supra,cal th at,d.in those cases,where plaintiff theory of defect seeks to examine the behavior of obscure components under complex circumstances outside the ordinary experience of the consumer,the consumer expectation test is inapplicable and defect may only be proved by resort to the analysis.id.at,d,where automobile collision resulted in left front wheel breaking free,collapsing rearward and smashing floorboard into driver feet,it was error to instruct jury with consumer expectation test proper test for defect is because behavior of obscure component parts during complex circumstances of accident not within ordinary experience of consumer morson superior court th,d consumer expectation test inapplicable to assess defect in latex glove where chemical in the rubber caused allergic reactions in those sensitive to latex the allergenicity of the rubber is a matter beyond the common experience and understanding of the product consumers.
whether a product is within the everyday experience of ordinary consumers and thus susceptible to a consumer expectation analysis can not be determined by looking at the product in isolation,but rather must be considered in the context of the facts surrounding its failure.the critical question is whether the circumstances of the product failure permit an inference that the product design performed below the legitimate,commonly accepted minimum safety assumptions of its ordinary consumers.soule,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because honda failed to demonstrate the air bag was not defectively designed as a matter of law.
honda incorrectly maintains it met its burden of negating product defect on summary judgment by showing,through unrefuted expert testimony,that the product performed in accordance with its intended design.mccabe complaint alleged a defect in both the manufacture and design of the air bag.even if honda expert declaration could be viewed as having demonstrated,as a matter of law,that the air bag performed under the circumstances of the crash in conformity with its design a questionable conclusion considering the underl
