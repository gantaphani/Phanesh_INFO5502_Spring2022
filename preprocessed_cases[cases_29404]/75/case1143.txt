background 
on april,cadillac of whittier dealer leased to lukather a new cadillac manufactured by gm.the lease was financed by gmac.within a month the cadillac began to exhibit an intermittent but recurring malfunction in the electronic stability control system.lukather first brought the cadillac into the dealer to repair the malfunction on june,when the car had been driven only miles.between june,and january,lukather brought the cadillac to the dealer for service for the same malfunction on more than four occasions.
lukather was driving the cadillac on the freeway on february,when the brakes came on by themselves,making the car hard to drive.lukather brought the cadillac to the dealer,where it remained up to the time of trial in march.at the time of trial,lukather was still making lease and insurance payments on the cadillac.beginning in february,gm paid for a rental car for lukather,but it stopped making those payments on april.lukather paid for his rental car from april,to the time of trial.
gm expert admitted at trial that the malfunction was unable to be repaired after reasonable attempts to do so.gm conceded at trial that the cadillac qualified as a lemon under the act.thus,the principal contested issues at trial were whether gm violated section d by failing promptly to make restitution,and if so,whether the failure was willful so as to permit the assessment of a civil penalty.
the act applies to leases as well as sales of consumer goods.see,subd.a.section d provides in pertinent part if the manufacturer or its representative in this state is unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts,the manufacturer shall either promptly replace the new motor vehicle in accordance with subparagraph a or promptly make restitution to the buyer in accordance with subparagraph b.however,the buyer shall be free to elect restitution in lieu of replacement,and in no event shall the buyer be required by the manufacturer to accept a replacement vehicle.
subparagraph b of section d provides in the case of restitution,the manufacturer shall make restitution in an amount equal to the actual price paid or payable by the buyer,including any charges for transportation and options,but excluding nonmanufacturer items installed by a dealer or the buyer,and including any collateral charges such as sales tax,license fees,registration fees,and other official fees,plus any incidental damages to which the buyer is entitled under section,including,but not limited to,reasonable repair,towing,and rental car costs actually incurred by the buyer.
the key exhibit on the issue of whether gm complied with section d was a series of written service request activity logs that memorialized the telephone contacts between lukather and gm call center.the logs reveal the following on march,lukather made a complaint to gm call center,informing a customer relationship specialist crs that he did not feel safe with the cadillac any more.the crs contacted the dealership,which confirmed the problem with the cadillac and that the dealership and the engineer were still working to find out what was wrong with the car.the crs noted that lukather requested a vehicle repurchase and that he needed someone to help him.lukather was advised that some research needed to be done and that his file would be escalated to a case manager.the log for march,contained the cadillac vehicle identification number and lukather contact information.
on march,a different crs,maggie weber,contacted the service manager at the dealer,who told her that he thought the cadillac was repaired.on march,weber again contacted the service manager at the dealer,who told her that the cadillac tested out good over the weekend,and is going back to the customer today.weber left a voicemail for lukather on march,offering to cover one month lease payment.on march,lukather left a voicemail for weber stating that he did not want the cadillac back.lukather also had a conversation with another crs on march in which he told her that he did not want the cadillac back and that he was not satisfied with one month payment.lukather also spoke to weber on march,telling her that he did not want the cadillac back.weber told lukather that if the car is repaired,gm may not be able to assist beyond that.
on march,lukather again spoke with weber,telling her that he did not want to accept the cadillac back as he had safety concerns.weber told lukather that she was escalating his case to a person who specializes in making such decisions.weber then left a voicemail message for paul wasco,gm district service manager,informing him that lukather did not want the cadillac back and was seeking alternatives.
wasco left a voicemail message for weber on march,admitting that the cadillac does basically qualify for lemon law,and asking whether lukather wanted to be released from the vehicle,or into a lease to another vehicle.wasco was aware that lukather was an elderly gentleman and said let see what we can do to get him taken care of.on march,weber called lukather and asked him whether he wanted out of lease,or into another vehicle.lukather told her that he did not want his lease payments to go up.he also asked weber whether he should make the cadillac lease payment due on march.weber told him that to avoid credit issues,he should make the payment and that this will probably not be completed by then.on march,weber left a message for wasco that lukather would like to get into the lease of a used vehicle,does not want his payments to increase.weber also asked wasco what he wanted her to do at that point.wasco returned weber call and told her that he will speak directly with lukather and will work with the dealer as far as payments and lease.
on march,lukather told weber that he thinks he wants his lease money back.weber told lukather that wasco should be contacting him about that later in the week.wasco did not contact lukather by april,when lukather called weber.lukather left a voicemail complaining that the matter was dragging on,he had not heard from wasco,he was still paying on the lease for the cadillac,and he had been patient enough.weber then left a voicemail for lukather that repurchase requests are not overnight,that this may take some time.she also said that she would nudge wasco on that.on april,wasco telephoned weber and told her that he was waiting on salesman at dealership,turned over to have lukather go in and discuss what vehicle he would like.weber then immediately telephoned lukather and told him that wasco had contacted the dealer,who was to contact lukather about a trade into a new vehicle.lukather told weber that he wanted all of his lease money back,and after he got that,he would buy another cadillac.weber responded that there were usage fees,time and mileage that need to be applied,and that he would not be reimbursed all of his lease payments.lukather stated that he would be contacting his attorney and sought no further assistance.
on april,lukather called weber and left a voicemail asking what gm will pay him back from what he had paid on his lease.wasco also left a voicemail for weber on april,stating that lukather wanted all of his money back,that may not happen,but will research an exchange of collateral on the lease,where all payments will apply to new lease,that is what he is shooting for according to weber,wasco stated that lukather needs to get into his vehicle and out of the rental vehicle,verified that vehicle is repaired.gm will not be paying for the rental vehicle at this point.after receiving wasco voicemail,weber called lukather,who told her that wasco wanted him to work with the dealership to choose another vehicle,but lukather did not want another car he wanted all of his money back.weber again told lukather that there would be time and mileage charges.weber also told lukather that wasco was working on an exchange of collateral on the lease.lukather again stated that he did not want another vehicle.lukather told weber that the rental car agency asked him for a deposit payment if he was going to continue with the rental weber told lukather that the cadillac was repaired and our recommendation is that lukather return the rental,drive his vehicle while we iron out the details,this is not an overnight process.lukather responded that someone should be able to give him an answer that day weber told him that if he wants an answer today we would not be able to give him that.lukather said that someone can,and hung up on weber.
later on april,weber left a message for wasco that lukather is adamant that he wants a straight repurchase,refuses to pick up the cadillac,as that will be a sign that he accepts it as repaired,and will not return rental.
lukather testified at trial that on april or,weber told him that it would take several months for gm to decide whether to buy back the cadillac.at trial,lukather did not recall whether he ever spoke with wasco.
according to wasco trial testimony,he telephoned lukather sometime between april and,and got the impression that lukather was still exploring whether he wanted a straight repurchase or a trade repurchase.at that time,wasco believed that the cadillac was repaired.wasco claimed at trial that he explained to lukather the specifics regarding his options of a straight repurchase or a trade repurchase and that he was not trying to force lukather into accepting a replacement vehicle.there was no written documentation of wasco telephone conversation with lukather.
in his deposition,wasco testified that he did not contact lukather directly to tell him that gm would repurchase the cadillac,he did not know if anyone from gm told lukather that gm would repurchase the cadillac,and he believed that weber was attempting to call lukather to tell him that gm would repurchase the cadillac when lukather refused to return gm calls.
wasco left a voicemail message for weber on april,asking for the name and address of the lienholder and the vehicle identification number for the cadillac.wasco stated that once he had the foregoing information,he would turn it over to the proper people,who would take a couple of weeks to pull lukather out of the cadillac.wasco also noted that the group that does this will figure out the payments,usage fee will be small as lukather complained of situations early on in the life of the cadillac.wasco stated that gm would not pay for lukather rental car.
on april,weber spoke with lukather,who told her that gmac was the lienholder.weber told lukather that he should pick up the cadillac,as gm was no longer paying for his car rental.lukather reiterated that he will not drive the cadillac.weber provided wasco with the information he had requested on april.
on april,lukather,through his attorney,filed a complaint against gm and the dealer under the act.on april,weber,who was unaware of the lawsuit,called lukather.lukather told weber that he had retained an attorney and that weber should talk to his attorney.
gm sent letters to lukather attorney on may and,seeking information about the cadillac and requesting that lukather return a signed release of lien information to gm.the may letter stated that an offer can not be made until the necessary,previously requested documents have been provided.although neither lukather nor his attorney responded to gm letters or provided any documents,gm made a repurchase offer to lukather by letter of may.the letter offered to pay off the lienholder gmac with a specific sum of money and to pay lukather and his attorney.the latter amount included for lukather lease payments,minus for the miles,plus in attorney fees.the letter also contained a release of claim for lukather signature.lukather attorney did not respond to the may letter.
at the conclusion of the trial in march,the trial court made a tentative ruling that gm violated the act.in its statement of decision issued in may,the trial court found that lukather trial testimony was credible and that wasco trial testimony was not credible.the court determined that gm did not act promptly in offering to repurchase the cadillac,stating,the service request activity log does not support gm claim it did so.the trial court also determined that gm violation of the act was willful,permitting the assessment of a civil penalty,reasoning that the cadillac was delivered to the dealer on.this action was filed.between those dates the court finds gm was not acting in good faith in providing plaintiff with a clear and prompt spelling out of his rights under the statute and in trying to persuade him to accept a replacement rather than the repurchase he initially and periodically requested.the court also determined that lukather was not required to mitigate his damages after gm made a clear offer to refund his money.
in early august,gm repurchased the cadillac and refunded all of the money lukather had paid on the cadillac lease.on september,an amended judgment judgment was entered in favor of lukather and against gm.lukather was awarded actual damages of,prejudgment interest of,civil penalties of,and attorney fees,costs and expenses of,for a total of.
discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
gm claims the evidence was insufficient to support the finding that it violated section d,maintaining that the trial court erred in imposing the duty on it to make restitution to lukather on the very same day it determined the cadillac was a lemon or in the very first call offering lukather his options.gm argues that the obligation to provide lukather a replacement car or restitution is a process that requires a series of labor intensive steps to be undertaken and the process can not be accomplished in a single telephone call or a single day.gm contends that in placing the duty on gm to provide lukather the financial specifics of the offer,the trial court held gm to a standard of conduct not required by section d,and one that was impossible for gm to meet on march.we disagree.
gm arguments are based on mischaracterizations of the trial court findings and determinations.the trial court did not place on gm the duty to make restitution to lukather on the first day it determined the cadillac was a lemon.rather,the trial court found that on march,lukather communicated his desire for a vehicle repurchase to gm and for weeks thereafter gm did not try to comply with his request,but instead tried to persuade him to accept a replacement rather than the repurchase he initially and periodically requested.italics added.thus,the trial court found that gm stalled and frustrated lukather attempts to obtain restitution for many weeks.
and the evidence supports the implied finding that gm had ample time in the period between march and april,in order to comply with the act.no evidence supports gm assertion that in this case the matter of restitution was a labor intensive process that required months to accomplish.in its may,letter,gm offered lukather restitution and asked lukather for further information which gm claimed was required in order to calculate the amount of such offer.even without any response from lukather to gm may,letter,it took gm two days until may,to obtain the appropriate information on its own,to calculate an amount of restitution,and to send lukather a letter with its offer.accordingly,once gm decided to make an offer of restitution,it took gm two days to determine the amount it needed to do so.the record thus belies gm assertion that the process of restitution is labor intensive and requires months to accomplish.
to the extent that gm contends that lukather conduct and statements indicated that he was indecisive
