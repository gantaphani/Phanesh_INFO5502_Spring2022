factual and procedural summary 
sorrento valley road is located near the intersection of interstate and interstate.in late,caltrans closed a portion of sorrento valley road to permit nearby construction of state route near the closed portion of sorrento valley road runs parallel to,and west of,from carmel mountain road to carmel valley road,and borders the los peñasquitos lagoon,a sensitive natural preserve.
two years later,individuals began requesting the city to reopen sorrento valley road because the state route construction was complete.in,cisa filed a writ petition in superior court seeking to compel the city to reopen the road.while that writ petition was pending,the city prepared plans to reopen the road with minor improvements.however,during the plan review process,the california coastal commission determined that a coastal development permit was required and the city concluded that an eir was necessary.
the city staff thereafter prepared an eir for the proposed reopening of sorrento valley road the eir.the eir found that reopening the road would result in many significant detrimental environmental impacts to water,drainage,biological resources,noise,and landform,and that these impacts,while mitigable,would irreversibly change the character of the environment.the eir also found that one of the proposed alternatives,the permanent closure of the road,would result in the least environmental impacts,while fulfilling some of the project objectives and goals.
during consideration of this eir at a march city council hearing,several city council members questioned whether reopening sorrento valley road was necessary given that many alternative roads exist in the same basic location and that an additional traffic study presented to the city council showed that opening the road would not reduce traffic congestion in the area.after consideration of these and other factors,the city council ultimately voted not to certify the eir or approve the reopening of the road.the city council instead directed city staff to study redeveloping the street primarily as a recreational amenity for or for limited vehicular access with a pedestrian and bicycle pathway.the city council further directed the city manager to return to the city council with an action to amend the local land use plan to delete this portion of sorrento valley road from the traffic circulation system and to prepare other necessary findings,including compliance with the requirements of the vehicle code and streets and highways code for closing a public street.
the city thereafter formed a task force to study the proposed road closure and to develop recommendations for the use of the road.the city staff prepared an eir that studied the potential impacts from permanently closing sorrento valley road and compared these impacts with the potential impacts from reopening the road with and without safety improvements.this final eir concluded that the proposed exclusive pedestrian use would result in the least environmentally significant detrimental impacts while fulfilling the project objectives and goals.the eir noted that each of the project alternatives opening or permanently closing the road would have traffic impacts,some of which could not be mitigated.
in january,the city planning commission held a public hearing and,based on the evidence presented,voted to recommend to the city council the approval of the road closure for exclusive use and the related eir certification and plan amendments.
the next month,in february,the city council held a public hearing at which interested individuals,including cisa counsel,were given the opportunity to state their support for,or opposition to,the proposed road closure and to explain the basis for these positions.the thrust of cisa position was that the city council had no legal authority to keep sorrento valley road closed because the eir found that at least people would drive on the road if it were reopened.the road closure proponents countered that the road was no longer necessary based on evidence showing there were numerous alternatives to sorrento valley road,traffic circulation actually improved after closing sorrento valley road and opening two nearby mountain road and el camino real,and opening sorrento valley road would not relieve traffic congestion in the merge area.
after considering each of these arguments,the city council voted to certify the eir,approve the closing of sorrento valley road for vehicles,and amend the local land use plan to permit this road to be used exclusively by pedestrians and bicyclists.with respect to the road closure,the city council made a specific finding that there is no present or prospective public use for sorrento valley road,citing the evidence showing road improvements and other transportation options in the area provided sufficient alternatives to make the road unnecessary for present or future vehicle traffic.the city council further found the road closure was in the public interest because it would substantially increase environmental protection and public recreational opportunities at the los peñasquitos lagoon.
instead of amending its first writ petition,which was still pending in the superior court,cisa filed a second writ petition and complaint against the city,challenging the city council february resolutions and seeking declaratory relief and monetary damages.the parties submitted a lengthy administrative record,including transcripts of the relevant planning commission and city council hearings,and the and draft and final eir.after considering these materials and counsels arguments,the superior court judge peterson found the city acted within its authority to close the road and amend the local plan and these decisions were supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.the court further found the eir was adequate in that it contains sufficient information to inform the decision makers of the task before them.the court thus entered a judgment in the city favor.based on this judgment,judge quinn,who was presiding over the earlier writ petition,entered judgment against cisa on the original writ petition.
discussion 
street closure 
cisa primary contention on appeal is that the city had no authority to permanently close sorrento valley road.
a city may close a public street by resolution of its legislative body,after a noticed vacation hearing,upon a finding that the street is no longer necessary.sts,et,subd.a.two code sections identify the specific findings that must be made before an existing street may be closed to vehicular traffic on the basis that it is unnecessary.first,streets and highways code section,subdivision b provides i f the legislative body finds,from all the evidence submitted,that the street,highway or public service easement is unnecessary for present or prospective public use,the legislative body may adopt a resolution vacating the street,highway,or public service easement.vehicle code section,subdivision a similarly provides that local authorities may adopt rules and regulations by ordinance or resolution to c los e any highway defined to include a street to vehicular traffic when,in the opinion of the legislative body having jurisdiction,the highway is n o longer needed for vehicular traffic.see.
our review of a legislative determination that a street is unnecessary no longer needed is highly deferential,governed by the standards set forth in code of civil procedure section.heist,supra,d at.see city of lafayette county of contra costa d.lafayette.under these standards,review is limited to an inquiry into whether the action was arbitrary,capricious or entirely lacking in evidentiary support.citation.citation.mike moore towing city of san diego th,d see heist,supra,d at.the petitioner has the burden of proof to show that the decision is unreasonable or invalid as a matter of law.mike moore towing,supra,at,d.we review the record de novo except where the trial court made foundational factual findings,which are binding on appeal if supported by substantial evidence ibid.
under these standards,the city determination that sorrento valley road was no longer necessary was supported by the record.the evidence showed sorrento valley road had been used primarily as an alternative to the,but that during the time the road was closed the had been improved and this freeway is being widened with additional lanes,for a total of lanes.the record additionally showed there were plans to construct the nearby carmel mountain road interchange at the during through and a parallel road on the east side of had been built,making it unnecessary to continue to provide a parallel road on the west side of.the city council further found that the five year,five million dollar transportation demand management program in sorrento valley will reduce the demand for highways and streets in the area.the transcript of the city council hearings shows that the mayor and the city council majority were specifically persuaded by this evidence to conclude that the street was unnecessary under the applicable statutory standards.although these public officials recognized that the merge area continues to be congested,they found that the reopening of sorrento valley road would not relieve this congestion or provide a necessary transportation alternative for the public.
reviewing the record as a whole,we can not say the city acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner in making these policy determinations based on the facts before it.the existence of conflicting evidence is insufficient to undermine our conclusion that the city findings were supported.the city council acted within its legislative function when it weighed the conflicting evidence and determined that sorrento valley road is unnecessary for present or prospective public street purposes and no longer needed for vehicular traffic under the applicable code sections.see heist,supra,d at.
cisa main argument to the contrary is based on the undisputed fact that if sorrento valley road were to be reopened,many drivers would elect to use the road.in support,cisa directs us to the portion of the record showing that cars daily used sorrento valley road before the street was closed,and that an estimated to vehicles would use the road on a daily basis if the road were reopened.based on these facts,cisa argues the city finding that the road was unnecessary was arbitrary and capricious as a matter of law.
the propriety of this argument depends on how the statutory terms unnecessary and n o longer needed are defined,subd.a sts,subd.b.cisa equates these terms with the concepts of use and demand,arguing that if people want to use a street it must be necessary.under these asserted definitions,cisa contends that a local entity may close a public street only if no one wants to drive on the road,there is no demand for the street.cisa thus says that a ll that matters under the law is whether people want to use the road,and if people do want to use the road,then a city has no discretion to close it.
these proposed definitions are not supported by the language of the applicable statutes.under its plain meaning,the word unnecessary connotes something that is not essential or needed for the continuing existence or functioning of something.american heritage dict.college ed,see also random house unabridged dict.ed,defining necessary as being essential,indispensable,or requisite.similarly,if something is not needed by the public,this condition means that it is not required,which is different from stating that the item is not wanted or desired by individual citizens.these definitions are consistent with the statutory language providing that it is the opinion of the legislative body that determines whether a road is n o longer needed for vehicular traffic,subd.a.the word opinion implies that the legislature intended to provide the local legislative body with substantial discretionary authority to determine whether,in its policy judgment,a road continues to be necessary for traffic circulation purposes.
under these definitions,the fact that a substantial portion of the public would like to have a road reopened or would use the road,does not mean the legislature is legally precluded from finding the road is not necessary because another road provides equivalent benefits.cisa argues that i f people want to drive on a road each day,there is no reasonable basis for a decision that the road has no use.in asserting this argument,cisa ignores the crucial words unnecessary and n o longer needed in the statutes.cisa proposed interpretation improperly rewrites the statute to say that a street may be closed only if it will no longer be used.
moreover,we must construe a statute in a manner that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.people jenkins cal th,d.if a legislative finding that a road is unnecessary could be defeated by a showing that people would use the road,a legislative determination to close a road would be nearly impossible to uphold.as the road closure proponents explained during the city council meetings,although it is true that a road will almost always be used if it is there,this fact does not mean that this usage is necessary to the individual or to the public.for example,if there were three parallel roads going to the same place,it may be that there could be a demand for each road,different people would choose to drive on different roads.however,this does not mean that each road is needed or necessary to the public as a whole under the meaning of the statutes.the governing body may look at the entire system of roads,and reasonably make a judgment that a single road is no longer essential or necessary when viewing the entire transportation network.
to support its interpretation of the statutes,cisa argues there is a strong public policy to protect the public interest in continued use of its streets,and the public has strong rights in continued use of existing public streets.county of san diego cal.water.cal d.cisa also maintains that the state has preempted the entire field of traffic control,and a city has only the limited powers expressly provided for in the vehicle code and that delegations of these powers must be strictly construed.see,rumford city of berkeley cal d,rumford save the sunset strip coalition city of west hollywood th,d.
we agree with these general principles,but they are insufficient to defeat a legislative decision to close a road if the facts support that the road is unnecessary for present or prospective public use.although the use of highways is a common and fundamental right,of which the public and individuals can not rightfully be deprived lafayette,supra,d at,the legislature has specifically mandated that a local entity may overcome an individual right to use a street if the street is no longer needed,subd.a.thus,not all interferences with an individual right to continue to use a public street are unlawful.likewise,although the state has preempted the field of motor vehicle traffic regulation,a city does have the authority expressly given to it by the legislature.see rumford,supra,cal d at.because the legislature specifically gave a local legislative body broad discretion to close a public street if it finds the street is no longer necessa
