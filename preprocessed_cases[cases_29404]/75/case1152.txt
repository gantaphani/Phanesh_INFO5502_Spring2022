introduction 
defendant lincare,lincare,provides respiratory services and medical equipment setup to patients in their homes.plaintiffs jose gomez,daniel gutierrez,and donny talbot collectively,plaintiffs were service representatives for lincare.their job duties included driving vans containing liquid oxygen and compressed oxygen,which are defined by the federal government as hazardous materials.in addition to their regular,work days,plaintiffs regularly worked on call in the evenings and on weekends.
plaintiffs sued lincare to recover unpaid compensation.specifically,plaintiffs sought compensation for the time spent resolving customer questions by phone,and for all the time they were on call,even when not responding to customer calls.plaintiffs also claimed they were entitled to a premium rate of compensation,rather than their regular rate of compensation,for all hours worked in excess of eight hours per day or hours per week.lincare filed motions for summary judgment summary adjudication and demurrers.the trial court rulings on those motions ultimately resolved every cause of action against plaintiffs.judgment was entered,and plaintiffs appealed.for the reasons explained in detail,post,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
the trial court granted lincare motions for summary adjudication of plaintiffs claim for overtime compensation on the ground that plaintiffs,as drivers of hazardous materials,were covered by the motor carrier exemption and therefore exempt from california overtime law.lincare failed to carry its initial burden of proof to show the motor carrier exemption applied to all of plaintiffs workdays,and summary adjudication was improperly granted.
the trial court also sustained lincare demurrer to plaintiffs claim for breach of an express contract.as we shall explain,the complaint contained sufficient facts to state a cause of action for breach of an express contract,and the order sustaining the demurrer is reversed.
the trial court then granted summary judgment.we deem the order granting summary judgment to be an order granting summary adjudication of all remaining causes of action in plaintiffs complaint.the trial court determined lincare had established there were no triable issues of material fact regarding plaintiffs claim for time following a regular shift of less than eight hours.we affirm the order granting summary adjudication of the first cause of action in the fourth amended complaint because undisputed evidence showed plaintiffs were paid for all time they worked during regular shifts and were never on call after working less than an shift.
with respect to plaintiffs claims for failure to provide itemized wage statements,failure to pay wages upon termination of employment,and unfair competition,the trial court the parties claims were derivative of a valid claim for wages.because the court had summarily adjudicated all the wage claims against plaintiffs,it summarily adjudicated those claims,listed ante,against them as well.as noted,we conclude the trial court erred by granting summary adjudication of the overtime claim based on the motor carrier exemption therefore,we also reverse the summary adjudication of those causes of action.
finally,the trial court summarily adjudicated plaintiffs claims for breach of an contract and promissory estoppel.although the trial court correctly determined there was no triable issue of material fact regarding the contract claim,lincare failed to meet its initial burden with respect to the promissory estoppel claim by failing to address the allegation that lincare promised to pay plaintiffs for the time spent telephonically resolving customer questions.while we affirm the order granting summary adjudication of the sixth cause of action,we reverse the order with respect to the seventh cause of action because plaintiffs raised a triable issue of fact whether time spent resolving customer issues telephonically when no visit was necessary was de minimis.
statement of facts 
lincare provides respiratory services,including oxygen systems,respiratory care,infusion therapy,and medical equipment setup to patients in their homes.plaintiffs were service representatives for lincare plaintiffs job responsibilities included transporting liquid and compressed oxygen,oxygen concentrators,and liquid oxygen systems,and setting up related medical equipment for lincare patient clients.
plaintiffs worked shifts monday through friday.when plaintiffs worked more than eight hours in one day as part of their regular hours,they were paid overtime rates.
plaintiffs were also required to carry a pager or cell phone after their regular work hours and respond to patient phone calls at night or on the weekend.lincare policy required plaintiffs to respond telephonically to pages within minutes,and to be available to respond to patient calls,in person,within two hours.plaintiffs were prohibited from consuming alcohol while on call,but were otherwise free to engage in any activities desired.when plaintiffs made service visits after hours,they were compensated by lincare at the regular rate of pay.if plaintiffs were able to resolve the customer problem by telephone without making a service visit,they were instructed not to record that time,and they were not compensated for it.
lincare written policy reads,in relevant part,as follows all service reps will receive normal pay for hours worked.hours worked is defined as the time spent by a service representative on a service call or with an emergency phone call after the normal work day.work is divided equally,where practical,among all service representatives in each area,and is a condition of employment.if the total hours worked exceeds the regularly scheduled work week or in the state of california exceeds the hour work day,as required by law,a driver will be paid at his overtime rate of pay for each additional hour worked.notwithstanding this policy,plaintiffs alleged and declared they were not paid for their time on emergency phone calls after normal working hours.
procedural history 
plaintiffs second amended complaint alleged causes of action for failure to pay wages,in violation of industrial welfare commission iwc wage order and california code of regulations,title,section failure to pay overtime compensation,in violation of labor code sections,and failure to provide itemized statements,in violation of labor code section failure to pay wages upon termination of employment and unfair competition,in violation of business and professions code section et.
lincare moved for summary judgment summary adjudication against plaintiffs.following briefing and oral argument,the trial court denied the motions for summary judgment,and granted the motions for summary adjudication only as to the second cause of action for failure to pay overtime compensation.the court concluded plaintiffs were exempt from california overtime provisions as drivers of hazardous materials.
plaintiffs fourth amended complaint alleged causes of action for failure to pay wages in violation of iwc order and california code of regulations,title,section failure to provide itemized statements,in violation of labor code section failure to pay wages upon termination of employment,in violation of labor code section unfair competition,in violation of business and professions code section et breach of express contract breach of contract and promissory estoppel.lincare demurred to the fifth,sixth,and seventh causes of action in the fourth amended complaint.the court overruled the demurrer as to the sixth and seventh causes of action,but sustained it without leave to amend as to the fifth cause of action for breach of express contract,on the ground the employee handbook,which,plaintiffs alleged,memorialized the terms of the express contract,unequivocally stated it was not an employment contract.
lincare then filed a second set of motions for summary judgment summary adjudication.the court granted the motions for summary judgment.the court concluded lincare had proven there were no triable issues of material fact regarding the wage claim in the first cause of action.the court found the causes of action for beach of an contract and promissory estoppel failed because the undisputed evidence showed there was no promise to pay plaintiffs any more than they had actually been paid.the court also found the claims for violation of labor code sections and and for unfair competition were derivative of a valid claim for wages.because the wage claims had been decided against plaintiffs,the court determined those claims,too,must fail.judgment was entered,and plaintiffs timely appealed.

we review orders granting summary judgment or summary adjudication de novo.saelzler advanced group cal th,d,village nurseries greenbaum th,d.a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is properly granted if the moving papers establish there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.summary judgment provide s courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.

summary adjudication of statutory overtime claim 
the second cause of action in the second amended complaint alleged lincare had failed to pay plaintiffs overtime pay,as required by labor code section,subdivision a,which provides,in relevant part eight hours of labor constitutes a day work.any work in excess of eight hours in one workday and any work in excess of hours in any one workweek and the first eight hours worked on the seventh day of work in any one workweek shall be compensated at the rate of no less than one and times the regular rate of pay for an employee.in its motions for summary adjudication of this cause of action,lincare argued that,because plaintiffs transported hazardous materials as part of their jobs,they were exempt from california statutory overtime rules 
at trial,lincare would bear the burden of proving the affirmative defense of plaintiffs exemption from overtime drug stores,superior court cal th,d,wamboldt systems,supra,wl.lexis at,and therefore bore the burden of proof to establish the affirmative defense on its motions for summary adjudication.h ow the parties moving for,and opposing,summary judgment may each carry their burden of persuasion production depends on which would bear what burden of proof at trial.again,in reader digest superior court cal d,we held to the effect that the placement and quantum of the burden of proof at trial were crucial for purposes of summary judgment.citation.thus,if a plaintiff who would bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence at trial moves for summary judgment,he must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying material fact more likely than,he would not be entitled to judgment as a matter of law,but would have to present his evidence to a trier of fact.by contrast,if a defendant moves for summary judgment against such a plaintiff,he must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact not to find any underlying material fact more likely than,he would not be entitled to judgment as a matter of law,but would have to present his evidence to a trier of fact.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.exemptions to the overtime compensation laws are narrowly construed against the employer and their application is limited to those employees plainly and unmistakably within their terms.nordquist broadcasting th,d.
california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision j exempts from the rules regarding overtime compensation those employees whose hours of service are regulated by california code of regulations,title title,section,subdivision b limits the driving time of employees who transport hazardous materials,such as liquid oxygen because plaintiffs transport hazardous materials,lincare claimed they were exempt from the standard overtime pay rules set forth in labor code section.the trial court accepted this argument pursuant to wage order,plaintiffs are exempt from the overtime provisions of that order.these provisions do not apply as the plaintiffs were regularly transporting hazardous materials.oxygen was always on their vehicles.defendant has met its burden.plaintiffs have not raised a triable issue of material fact.
as relevant to this appeal,the update of the dlse division of labor standards enforcement enforcement policies and interpretations manual revised enforcement manual provides the iwc exemption only applies to employees whose regular duty is that of a driver,not any other category of worker.the policy would cover employees regularly employed as relief drivers or as assistant drivers.however,any driver who does not drive or operate a truck for any period of time during an entire workday is entitled to overtime premium compensation for all overtime hours worked performing duties other than driving during that day.citation,italics added,as of april.
in support of this interpretation,the enforcement manual cites crooker sexton motors,cir.the crooker court determined that even de minimis interstate driving activity affected the safety of interstate motor vehicle operations,making the employee activities subject to federal department of transportation regulations governing hours of work,and,therefore,the employee was exempt from the fair labor standards act of overtime provisions.id.at.the court additionally determined that,during weeks where the employee did not perform any interstate driving activities,he would be entitled to receive overtime pay.id.at.
a case from the united states district court for the northern district of california addressed a very similar factual situation to that presented in this case.in wamboldt systems,supra,wl.lexis,an employee sued to recover overtime pay.the employee had been a customer service representative for systems,and drove a vehicle transporting hazardous materials,wl,at.filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing the employee was exempt from california overtime compensation laws because the exemption for a driver of hazardous materials applied,wl,at pp.as in this case,employer relied only on california regulations,not federal regulations,to support its claim that the employee was exempt.ibid.the district court concluded the employer could not obtain summary judgment because there was a factual dispute as to how much of the employee time was spent transporting hazardous materials,and therefore whether the driver exemption had been triggered,wl,at pp.
in a later order denying a motion for reconsideration,the same court clarified its original holding,concluding,the court finds that,under the proper legal standard,the employee would be entitled to overtime for days in which he did not transport hazardous materials.wamboldt systems,no.c pjh,wl.lexis.
in order to obtain summary adjudication of the second cause of action in plaintiffs second amended complaint,based on the application of the driver exemption,lincare was required to present evidence showing that each plaintiff drove a vehicle containing hazardous materials for some period of time on each and every workday.having reviewed the record de novo,we conclude lincare failed to meet its initial burden,and the trial court erred in granting the motions for summary adjudication.
with respect to gutierrez,lincare separate statement of undisputed material facts provided that gutierrez spent a significant portion of his time driving.in support of the motion,lincare offered gutierrez deposition testimony,including the following q were there ever any days when you were just in stayed at the base or at the center and did go out on a route during the regular workday a there was some occasions when there was enough stops for two vans.one would stay there.q okay.and so is that kind of an unusual condition a it happened once in a while.lincare did not submit any evidence to establish gomez and talbot drove a vehicle containing hazardous materials every day they were scheduled to work.given the deposition testimony of gutierrez,quoted ante,it is reasonable to infer that on some workdays,gomez and talbot,too,never drove lincare vehicles.
additionally,in the evidence offered by lincare in support of the motion,talbot testified that he did not always have the lincare van with him at home when he was on call.from this evidence,it could reasonably be inferred that gutierrez and gomez,as well as talbot,worked for lincare while not transporting hazardous materials or substances.
demurrer without leave to amend of claim for breach of express contract 
in the fourth amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged they had entered into contracts with lincare,under the terms of which lincare would pay them for work performed,including a premium rate equal to one and one half plaintiffs regular rate of pay time and a half for all time plaintiffs worked beyond eight hours in a workday or hours in a workweek.plaintiffs alleged the terms of their contracts were communicated orally and in writing,and were memorialized in lincare employee handbook and in plaintiffs paychecks.
the trial court sustained lincare demurrer to the cause of action for breach of express contract,without leave to amend.fifth cause of action for breach of express contract this court has previously stated that the handbook contains no contractual language which would bind defendants.indeed,the handbook contains language stating that it does not constitute a contract,so that employees could not properly rely on it as establishing any enforceable agreement between them and the defendant.the handbook simply does not support a cause of action for overtime wages.the language in the handbook could not be clearer.there is a clear disclaimer.
plaintiffs argue on appeal that in sustaining the demurrer,the trial court erroneously ignored other allegations and evidence concerning contract formation in the fourth amended complaint.specifically,the complaint alleged lincare actually treated plaintiffs as nonexempt employees by paying them overtime compensation,and plaintiffs paychecks showing overtime payments memorialized lincare oral representations that they would be treated as nonexempt employees.
neither the trial court order sustaining the demurrer,nor lincare respondent brief on appeal,addresses plaintiffs allegation that the paychecks showing plaintiffs were paid for overtime hours memorialize an express agreement that plaintiffs would be treated as nonexempt employees.even absent any allegations regarding the employment handbook,the fourth amended complaint contained sufficient facts to state a cause of action for breach of an express contract.
summary judgment summary adjudication of remaining causes of action in the fourth amended complaint 
the trial court granted lincare motions for summary judgment summary adjudication as to the remainder of the causes of action in the fourth amended complaint.the court tentative ruling granting the motions reads this court has previously found that there is no express contract.the deposition testimony of the plaintiffs show s that there was no promise made to pay other than the wages provided and therefore there is no implied contract or promissory estoppel.all of the other claims are derivative of the finding of some other type of agreement or obligation to pay other than the wages actually paid.defendant has met its burden of proof.plaintiffs have failed to raise a triable issue of fact.first cause of action for failure to pay wages the fact that plaintiffs agreed or did agree to be paid for the time they spent answering telephone calls after their regular shift is irrelevant.plaintiffs must be paid for the hours worked.but as defendant points out,and as plaintiffs admit,by their requests to amend,plaintiffs claims were never based on hours worked over the shift,but were always based on claims for time when an shift was not worked.plaintiffs have had an adequate opportunity to plead their causes of action and have indeed on several occasions after their attempts were found to be without merits in the past.as the defendant argues,to allow plaintiffs to again assert a new claim would be to start this action all over.that is not fair to the defendant,particularly after the plaintiffs have seen and reviewed defendant motion for summary judgment.plaintiffs should file a new lawsuit if they wish to pursue this new theory.second cause of action for failure to provide itemized statements this cause of action is derivative of a viable cause of action for wages.as there is none,this cause of action fails.third cause of action for failure to pay wages upon termination of employment this cause of action is derivative of a viable cause of action for wages.as there is none,this cause of action fails.fourth cause of action for unfair competition this cause of action is derivative of a viable cause of action for wages.as there is none,this cause of action fails.sixth cause of action for breach of contract as the evidence clearly shows that there is no basis for finding an implied contract,this cause of action fails.seventh cause of action for promissory estoppel as the evidence clearly shows that there were no promises made to support promissory estoppel,this cause of action fails.the trial court made the tentative ruling its final order.
we consider each cause of action in the fourth amended complaint in turn.
first cause of claim under california code of regulations,title,section 
the first cause of action in the fourth amended complaint seeks recovery for time worked after a shift.plaintiffs,and members of the plaintiffs class,frequently worked less than an work shift,and subsequently were scheduled to work.as will be articulated below,it is this time that is the subject of plaintiffs claim for time wages.italics added.lincare offered undisputed evidence that plaintiffs were paid for all the time they worked during their regular shifts,including overtime worked as part of the regular shifts,and were never on call after working less than a full shift 
plaintiffs argued the trial court should not grant the motions for summary judgment because the court was required to liberally construe plaintiffs claims in the fourth amended complaint,citing code of civil procedure section.plaintiffs also make this argument on appeal.section applies when the sufficiency of a pleading is challenged by means of demurrer or motion for judgment on the pleadings.it is irrelevant here,where we are considering a motion for summary judgment.see palestini general dynamics th,d contrasting use of code of civil procedure section,which requires liberal construction of pleading to achieve substantial justice between parties,to summary judgment proceeding based on evidence.plaintiffs misunderstand the purpose of a motion for summary judgment,which is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.
lincare met its initial burden on the statutory claim for failure to pay wages.plaintiffs failed to meet their burden to establish a triable issue of material fact as to that claim.the trial court did not err in granting lincare motions for summary adjudication on this cause of action.
in any event,the language plaintiffs contend they would have added to the complaint,if permitted to amend it,in response to the motions for summary judgment would not have created a meritorious cause of action.plaintiffs argue they are entitled to overtime wages for the entire time they were on call during the evenings and weekends waiting for patient calls,but when they were not actually responding to pages telephonically or in person.plaintiffs are incorrect.
waiting time may be compensable if it is spent primarily for the benefit of the employer and its business.armour wantock.time firefighters spent on call in the fire hall was compensable,even though they spent time in idleness and amusements.a determination of whether the waiting time is spent predominantly for the employer benefit depends on two considerations the parties agreement,and the degree to which the employee is free to engage in personal activities.owens local,of western pulp paper workers cir.
lincare written policy provided,in relevant part the service representative will be available via telephone or beeper to provide service at all times as follows telephone response within minutes response within hours as necessary.by accepting continuing employment,plaintiffs impliedly agreed to the policy terms.see owens local,of western pulp paper workers,supra,at.the ninth circuit court of appeals provided a nonexclusive list of factors,none of which is dispositive,to determine whether the employee was free to engage in personal activities whether there was an living requirement whether there were excessive geographical restrictions on employee movements whether the frequency of calls was unduly restrictive whether a fixed time limit for response was unduly restrictive whether the employee could easily trade responsibilities whether use of a pager could ease restrictions and whether the employee had actually engaged in personal activities during time,at,fns.omitted.in sum,these factors favor a determination that the waiting time did not unduly restrict plaintiffs ability to engage in personal activities.lincare did not impose an living requirement,and did not impose excessive geographic restrictions on plaintiffs.the time limits set for plaintiffs responses to minutes to respond by telephone and two hours to respond to a patient not unduly restrictive.employees were permitted to trade responsibilities.plaintiffs were provided pagers by lincare.plaintiffs depositions confirmed they had engaged in some personal activities while on call we do not believe plaintiffs unilateral decisions to avoid personal activities while on call changes the fact that they did engage in some activities and could have continued to do so.
second cause of to furnish itemized statements in violation of labor code section 
the second cause of action in the fourth amended complaint alleges lincare violated labor code section by failing to provide plaintiffs with itemized statements accurately showing the total number of hours worked,the applicable hourly rates,and the corresponding number of hours worked at each hourly rate.the gist of plaintiffs claim is that because lincare did not pay them overtime or keep accurate records of the entirety of plaintiffs time,the statements provided to plaintiffs were inaccurate plaintiffs do not claim they were not provided any wage statements by lincare.
subdivision a of labor code section provides,in relevant part every employer shall,semimonthly or at the time of each payment of wages,furnish each of his or her employees an accurate itemized statement in writing showing total hours worked by the employee,and all applicable hourly rates in effect during the pay period and the corresponding number of hours worked at each hourly rate by the employee in its motions for summary judgment summary adjudication,lincare argued this cause of action was wholly derivative of a valid claim for wages,and,because all wage claims had been disposed of,it,too,should be resolved against plaintiffs.in opposition,plaintiffs agreed this was a derivative cause of action.because we have concluded,ante,that lincare failed to meet its initial burden of proof on the motions for summary adjudication regarding the driver overtime exemption defense,the cause of action for failure to furnish itemized wage statements survives.
third cause of to pay wages at end of employment in violation of labor code section.
the third cause of action in the fourth amended complaint alleges lincare violated labor code section by failing to pay plaintiffs overtime compensation when they quit or were terminated from their employment.if an employer willfully fails to pay,without abatement or reduction,in accordance with sections,and,any wages of an employee who is discharged or who quits,the wages of the employee shall continue as a penalty from the due date thereof at the same rate until paid or until an action therefor is commenced but the wages shall not continue for more than days,subd.a.
the trial court concluded this claim was derivative of plaintiffs claim for unpaid wages,and,because no such claim remained,the court found this claim failed as well.on appeal,the parties agree that this claim stands or falls with a claim for wages.because we have concluded,ante,that lincare failed to meet its initial burden of proof on the motions for summary adjudication regarding the driver overtime exemption defense,the cause of action for failure to pay wages upon termination of employment survives.
fourth cause of competition 
plaintiffs alleged lincare violated business and professions code section et by failing to pay them for the hours they actually worked,and by failing to pay them overtime compensation.as with the claims for failure to pay wages upon termination of employment and failure to provide itemized statements,lincare argued in its motions for summary judgment summary adjudication that the unfair competition claim was derivative of a valid wage claim,and must be resolved in its favor.because we have concluded,ante,that lincare failed to meet its initial burden of proof on the motions for summary adjudication regarding the driver overtime exemption defense,the cause of action for unfair competition based on lincare alleged failure to pay plaintiffs for the hours worked survives.
sixth cause of of contract 
plaintiffs claim for breach of an contract alleges lincare payment of overtime compensation on some occasions created a term of a contract between lincare and plaintiffs that lincare would pay plaintiffs for all hours worked and would pay plaintiffs a premium rate for overtime hours.
a cause of action for breach of implied contract has the same elements as does a cause of action for breach of contract,except that the promise is not expressed in words but is implied from the promisor conduct.yari producers guild of america,th,d.
lincare offered evidence that plaintiffs were promised they would be paid and were in fact paid for time when a service visit was required plaintiffs were never promised they would be paid for time resolving customer questions by telephone when a service visit was not required or when they were on call but not responding to pages and plaintiffs were not aware of anyone who was promised he or she would be paid,or was paid,for time resolving customer questions by telephone when a service visit was not required or when he or she was on call but not responding to pages.
in their oppositions to the motions for summary judgment summary adjudication,plaintiffs offered the deposition testimony of lincare person most knowledgeable to the effect that lincare pays its service representatives overtime compensation for working more than eight hours a day or more than hours a week,and posts this information in its service centers.that lincare paid plaintiffs overtime when they worked more than eight hours in a day is undisputed.it is also undisputed that these overtime payments were for extra hours at the end of an workday,not for hours.the trial court correctly granted the motions for summary adjudication on this cause of action.
seventh cause of estoppel 
similar to the cause of action for breach of an contract,plaintiffs cause of action for promissory estoppel alleges lincare promised plaintiffs it would pay them for all hours worked,and promised to pay them overtime compensation if they worked more than eight hours per day or hours per week.this cause of action also alleges that,based on those promises,plaintiffs agreed to work on call shifts lasting an entire week and requiring telephonic
