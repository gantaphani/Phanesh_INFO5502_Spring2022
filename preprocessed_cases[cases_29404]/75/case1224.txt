plaintiff abigail stockinger,a college student enrolled in a class designed to train guides for trips,was injured off campus while riding in the open bed of a classmate pickup truck,as they worked on an assignment to map a route for a later class trip.this appeal involves plaintiff suit against defendants feather river community college and college instructor russell reid,alleging negligence in planning and supervising the class assignment.the classmate who was driving at the time of the accident is not a party to this action.plaintiff appeals from summary judgment entered in favor of defendants.plaintiff contends the trial court improperly excluded her evidentiary submissions and erred in concluding her claims were barred by various statutory immunities and assumption of the risk.
we shall conclude that most of plaintiff evidentiary contentions are without merit,and even assuming some evidence should have been admitted,the trial court correctly ruled defendants had no liability pursuant to education code section which limits liability when students are not on school property.as a general rule,a college may require college students to complete an assignment without specifying how the students are to transport themselves,and without assuming a duty of care with respect to the mode of transportation selected by the students.
factual and procedural background 
in april,plaintiff filed her lawsuit against defendants,alleging she was injured on may,at forest service road battle springs road,in an unincorporated district of quincy in plumas county,miles south of bucks lake road.the complaint alleged defendants failed to exercise reasonable care in planning and were so negligent in organizing,entrusting and supervising a mandatory off premises school sponsored activity,so as to cause physical and emotional injuries to plaintiff.plainitff sic participation in the subject off premises school sponsored activity was required and said activity was not a field trip or excursion as contemplated by section fn,ante and california code of r egulations title,section defendant public entity and public employee are being sued pursuant to government code section public employee is liable for injury caused by his act or omission except as otherwise provided by statute.
defendants moved for summary judgment,asserting plaintiff injuries were caused by the reckless driving of her classmate,richard mcgrath who was not named as a defendant in this lawsuit,and by plaintiff own decision to ride unrestrained in the open bed of mcgrath truck despite her admitted knowledge that it was dangerous to do so.defendants asserted that,as against them,there was no duty,no breach,and no causation.defendants further asserted plaintiff claim against them was barred by the statutory limitation of liability for college students while off campus,pursuant to section.see fn,ante.
reid submitted a declaration stating he was the instructor of the pack course,which taught practical skills necessary in the organization and implementation of a pack trip.the pack course had a homework assignment in which students had to map,plan,and organize a potential pack trip.after the assignment was completed,reid would accompany the students on a pack trip on may through,perhaps utilizing the students maps.
the course assignment sheet stated the assignment listed as assignment,due monday,may,was for the class to divide themselves up into groups,with two to four students per group,and for each group to map out a route for a pack trip,starting from the college stable area,traveling approximately six miles the first day,eight to miles the second day,and five miles the third day.the students had to locate two places to camp overnight,with water and grass and secluded from the public.the assignment called for the students to find locations,explore,drive,draw a map,and write a summary.the assignment sheet stated,you must the entire trip we will have to drop hay off at either camp site,so be sure to check out each spot carefully instructor reid verbally instructed the students that they could also ride horses in performing the assignment 
the assignment sheet was distributed to students at the beginning of the semester,and the students had all semester in which to do it.the assignment sheet warned the students not to procrastinate.
reid attested that,in recognition that these students may one day guide others on pack trips and be responsible for the safety of others,the purpose of the assignment was to provide students an opportunity to develop the requisite leadership and practical skills for planning,implementing,guiding a pack trip of their own.my students were mainly young adults,such as the plaintiff age.such adults in this field must be given responsibilities in order to learn responsibility for themselves and others.thus,the students were given the liberty to complete assignment on their own terms without direct instructor involvement.the students were free to select with which students they wanted to work,but each group had to have at least one person with experience.plaintiff had experience,having successfully completed the pack course twice.
reid was not involved in the selection of plaintiff group was not involved in the planning of her group outing,did not undertake to provide transportation for the assignment,and did not supervise or control the operation of plaintiff group.reid attested he was not aware plaintiff group intended to use mcgrath vehicle,was not aware of mcgrath driving record,and was not aware plaintiff and another student would choose to ride without seatbelts in the bed of mcgrath truck.
in the years that reid has given this assignment,no student other than plaintiff had ever been seriously injured in performing the assignment.
defendants submitted excerpts of plaintiff deposition,in which she said reid did not influence who joined which group,and reid did not supervise plaintiff group in its operation.although each group was supposed to be limited to a maximum of four persons,plaintiff group had five,because it was the last group formed.plaintiff group consisted of plaintiff,richard mcgrath,jeanette graves,lilly wren,and joellen chunn.a few days before the accident,plaintiff and chunn asked reid if they could be excused from the assignment to attend a rodeo.he said their group needed them for their experience,and their failure to complete the assignment would be detrimental to their grade for the class or for the assignment plaintiff could not remember which one.plaintiff concluded her participation was required.chunn skipped the assignment and went to the rodeo,yet did not fail the class.
plaintiff in her deposition also testified her group concluded they needed a vehicle for the assignment because it was open country.only mcgrath had a vehicle.his vehicle a ford was a flatbed pickup truck with only three seats in the front with perhaps only two seatbelts and no seats or seatbelts in the flatbed.on the morning of the accident,plaintiff and wren drove in wren car to the start of the dirt road they would travel.it did not occur to the group that anyone would have to ride in the bed of the pickup until they met at the start of the dirt road.
plaintiff testified that,before the accident,she never told reid that her group would have to use mcgrath pickup,and she did not recall anyone ever telling reid that someone would have to ride in the bed of mcgrath truck.no one in her group ever asked to use school vehicles.
although plaintiff knew it was dangerous to ride in the bed of a pickup truck and knew she would not have any seatbelt protection she agreed to do so as did graves.wren sat in front with the driver.
no one in plaintiff group was familiar with that road,though plaintiff was familiar with the area.
after driving for a few minutes,mcgrath started driving too fast and skidding around corners.plaintiff complained,and he slowed down,but soon picked up the speed again.she estimated his speed at miles per hour,which she considered unsafe.however,she did not ask him again to slow down.she did not know why she stayed silent.the truck skidded,hit something,and plaintiff was thrown from the vehicle.the accident left her a paraplegic.
when asked in deposition what she thought reid did wrong,plaintiff testified reid required her participation in the mapping and did not provide a school vehicle.
defendants also submitted a declaration from united states forest service project engineer charles carter,attesting the road on which plaintiff was injured,united states forest service road in plumas county,was a dirt and gravel road which could be easily navigated by an ordinary passenger vehicle or sedan driven with due care.drive was not needed.the road was wide enough for opposing vehicles to pass when there was no snow as was the case in may.
plaintiff opposed summary judgment.
in opposition to summary judgment,plaintiff submitted her own declaration and excerpts from her deposition,but the trial court sustained defendants evidentiary objections to those items,and plaintiff does not challenge those evidentiary rulings on appeal.we therefore presume that those evidentiary rulings were correct lopez baca th,d,and we disregard those excluded items.
plaintiff submitted reid responses to requests for admissions,admitting he did not inspect mcgrath vehicle or driving record,did not offer safety instruction on driving vehicles off paved roads,and did not ask how a group would fit in mcgrath vehicle.reid also admitted he was aware the college had vehicles available for school use that could fit more than three persons,and he did not ask to use these vehicles for this assignment.
plaintiff submitted transcripts of three telephone conversations between plaintiff investigator kara wayne and mcgrath,graves who was the other person riding in the bed of the pickup,and reid.each transcript was accompanied by a declaration from wayne stating it was a true and complete reproduction of the conversation.each transcript reflected that at the end of the conversation,wayne asked,do you declare under penalty of perjury the statements you made on this recording are true and correct,to which mcgrath and graves responded affirmatively,and reid responded,to the best of my knowledge.
mcgrath interview included statements that reid knew mcgrath would be driving and knew mcgrath only had seats for two or three in the vehicle.graves said in her interview that she did not believe defendants knew mcgrath would be driving,she did not know whether defendants knew students would be riding in the back of a truck,but it was a common thing to do when finding a route for the pack trip.reid said in his interview that he was not aware who was going to be driving,was not aware any student would be riding in the back of a truck,and did not check mcgrath driver license or proof of insurance.
defendants made evidentiary objections to the transcripts of telephone conversations and accompanying declarations by plaintiff investigator,on the ground they contained inadmissible hearsay.
defendants reply papers to plaintiff opposition to summary judgment also contained a supplemental declaration from reid,attesting that the vehicles are vans and are not available for use in homework assignments.reid also refuted plaintiff characterization of the target area as wilderness.reid attested,the general area for our spring pack trips is intentionally planned not to be in a wilderness area.for safety and teaching effectiveness,the horseback riding associated with pack trips is designed for beginning and intermediate riders on flat graveled roads.
the trial court sustained defendants evidentiary objections and excluded the recorded statements of reid,mcgrath,and graves,and the accompanying declarations of plaintiff investigator.
the trial court granted summary judgment to defendants for the following reasons 
defendants had no duty to protect plaintiff from her choice to sit in the back of an open pickup truck without a seatbelt and endure the reckless driving of nonparty richard mcgrath during the subject scouting trip,since these actions were not reasonably foreseeable.
defendants were immune from liability under section fn,ante.there was no contention or evidence triggering the exemption from immunity,that plaintiff was or should have been under the immediate and direct supervision of a school district employee while on the scouting trip.indeed,plaintiff counsel admitted that plaintiff was not relying on this exemption from immunity 
the trial court also determined plaintiff claim was barred by primary assumption of risk and the immunity for discretionary activity,matters we need not address.
plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from the nonappealable order granting summary judgment modica merin d,but later filed a timely amended notice of appeal from the judgment.
discussion 
standard of review 
summary judgment is properly granted when there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a defendant or has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.code civ,subd.p see also,aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.once the moving party defendant meets its burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show a triable issue of material fact exists.code civ,subd.p.
if a party moving for summary judgment would prevail at trial without submission of any issue of material fact to a trier of fact for determination,then he should prevail on summary judgment.in such a case the court should grant the motion and avoid a trial rendered useless by nonsuit or directed verdict or similar device.citations.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th,d.
because plaintiff appeals from an order granting defendant summary judgment,we must independently examine the record to determine whether triable issues of material fact exist.code civ,subd.c citations.saelzler advanced group cal th,d.in performing our de novo review,we must view the evidence in a light favorable to plaintiff as the losing party citation,liberally construing her evidentiary submission while strictly scrutinizing defendants own showing,and resolving any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in plaintiff favor.citation.id.at,d.
summary judgment will be upheld when,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the opponent,the evidentiary submissions conclusively negate a necessary element of plaintiff cause of action,or show that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact requiring the process of a trial.guz bechtel national,cal th,d.
ii.appellate rules 
plaintiff violates the california rules of court,rule,which requires that each appellate brief must support any reference to a matter in the record by a citation to the record.here,plaintiff provides citations to her separate statement of disputed facts,without citing where in the record we can find the evidence supporting the facts asserted in the separate statement of disputed facts.the separate statement is not itself evidence of anything.it is mere assertion.the evidence of the asserted facts appears affidavits,depositions.plaintiff brief should have cited to those pages in addition to the separate statement of disputed facts.city of lincoln barringer th,d.in this instance,we shall disregard the failure to comply with the appellate rules,though we note for the benefit of appellate counsel that this court has discretion to disregard contentions unsupported by proper page cites to the record.id.at,d lewis county of sacramento th,d aguimatang california state lottery d.
iii.evidentiary rulings 
plaintiff contends the trial court erred in excluding transcripts of telephone conversations between plaintiff investigator and witnesses,during which the witnesses verbally declared their statements were true under penalty of perjury,and which plaintiff investigator authenticated via her own declaration attesting the transcripts were true reproductions of her conversations.the trial court excluded the transcripts because they are hearsay and without proper foundation.we shall assume for purposes of this appeal that the transcripts were properly authenticated though defendants dispute the point.we shall conclude the trial court properly excluded the transcripts of the investigator taped telephone conversations with mcgrath and graves,because they constituted inadmissible hearsay,and the investigator declarations authenticating the transcripts did not eliminate the hearsay problem.we shall also conclude,however,that even if the transcript of reid interview was admissible,because admissions by a party opponent are an exception to the hearsay rule,any error in excluding the transcript was harmless.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,states an opposition to summary judgment,where appropriate,shall consist of affidavits,declarations,admissions,answers to interrogatories,depositions,and matters of which judicial notice shall or may be taken.subdivision d of the same statute provides supporting and opposing affidavits or declarations shall be made by any person on personal knowledge,shall set forth admissible evidence,and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavits or declarations.
here,plaintiff did not submit in the trial court any affidavit,declaration or deposition of mcgrath,graves,or reid.plaintiff claims the transcripts,containing statements under penalty of perjury,were themselves declarations,once authenticated by her investigator declaration.she cites no authority supporting her position,and we conclude it is without merit.
first,the transcripts could not qualify as declarations sufficient to defeat summary judgment,because they contained no statement that the information contained therein was based upon personal knowledge.code civ,subd.d witchell de korne d.
moreover,the fact that the transcripts showed statements by the interviewees,responding affirmatively to the question whether their statements were true under penalty of perjury,did not convert the statements into admissible affidavits or declarations.
thus,code of civil procedure section provides 
whenever,under any law of this state or under any rule,regulation,order or requirement made pursuant to the law of this state,any matter is required or permitted to be supported,evidenced,established,or proved by the sworn statement,declaration,verification,certificate,oath,or affidavit,in writing of the person making the same other than a deposition,or an oath of office,or an oath required to be taken before a specified official other than a notary public,such matter may with like force and effect be supported,evidenced,established or proved by the unsworn statement,declaration,verification,or certificate,in writing of such person which recites that it is certified or declared by him or her to be true under penalty of perjury,is subscribed by him or her,and,if executed within this state,states the date and place of execution,or,if executed at any place,within or without this state,states the date of execution and that it is so certified or declared under the laws of the state of california.italics added.
code of civil procedure section has been applied in summary judgment proceedings.witchell de korne,supra,d.truslow woodruff d.
subscribe as used in section means to sign with one own hand.in re marriage of reese guy th,d.here,there was nothing subscribed by mcgrath,graves,or reid.as to each,there was only a transcript reflecting each was asked verbally by plaintiff investigator,at the end of a telephone conversation,if his or her statements were true and correct under penalty of perjury.additionally,there is no indication in the declaration of plaintiff private investigator that she is one of the limited category of persons authorized by law to administer oaths code civ,judges,court clerks,notaries public,shorthand reporters.
thus,there was no compliance with code of civil procedure section,and the transcripts themselves were inadmissible on that ground.
the mcgrath and graves transcripts were inadmissible on another ground they consisted of inadmissible hearsay.evidence containing hearsay is not admissible evidence and will not raise a triable issue defeating summary judgment.code civ,subd.d,hayman block d.the declaration of the investigator does not cure this problem with respect to mcgrath or graves.the investigator attested the transcripts were true and complete reproductions of her conversations.however,the investigator declaration could not convert inadmissible hearsay into admissible evidence.hearsay evidence is evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness testifying at the hearing and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter stated,subd.a.the statements made by mcgrath and graves in conversation with the investigator meet this test and were hearsay.
plaintiff makes no argument in her opening brief on appeal as to what possible exception to the hearsay rule would apply to the statements of mcgrath and graves instead,plaintiff merely argues the transcripts were properly authenticated by the investigator and therefore should have been admitted.
however,authentication alone does not overcome other rules of evidence,such as the hearsay rule.there is a difference between the foundational device of authentication and substantive rules of admissibility of evidence,such as the hearsay rule.
thus,evidence code section states,authentication of a writing means a the introduction of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the writing that the proponent of the evidence claims it is or b the establishment of such facts by any other means provided by law.evidence code section states,a writing may be authenticated by evidence that the writing refers to or states matters that are unlikely to be known to anyone other than the person who is claimed by the proponent of the evidence to be the author of the writing.
thus,authentication of a writing is independent of the question of whether the content of the writing is inadmissible as hearsay.see kramer barnes d.
plaintiff cites case law for the proposition that tape recordings,properly authenticated,are admissible as writings.she argues it naturally follows that transcripts of tape recordings,properly authenticated,are also admissible.however,the cases cited by plaintiff merely dealt with questions of authentication of otherwise admissible evidence.thus,in sortino d.overruled on other grounds in flanagan flanagan cal th,d,the challenged evidence was a transcript of a conversation with the opposing party.id.at.admissions of a party opponent are an exception to the hearsay rule,evidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered against the declarant in an action to which he is a party.the other case cited by plaintiff,darley ward cal d,involved a tape recording of a board hearing in a citizen mandate petition against the board,seeking to overturn the board decision.id.at.darley held the trial court was required to accept the tapes or grant a continuance for preparation of a written transcript of the tapes.id.at.neither case helps plaintiff here.
we conclude the trial court properly excluded the evidence of the telephone conversations between plaintiff investigator and mcgrath and graves on the ground the evidence was hearsay.
reid transcript stands on different ground.hearsay statements by reid fall within the hearsay exception for admissions of a party opponent,though plaintiff does not so argue.reid admissions,reported by the investigator,would not be barred by the hearsay rule.however,assuming the reid transcript was properly authenticated a point disputed by defendants,the transcript of reid statements does not help plaintiff case,because it merely showed reid did not check mcgrath driving record or insurance status.as we discuss,post,reid had no duty to do so,and his failure to do so does not provide any basis for liability.any error in excluding reid transcript is harmless on this record.
iv.summary judgment was proper 
plaintiff contends the trial court erred in concluding her claim was barred by section.we disagree.
in order to determine whether a tort claim may be maintained against a public entity,the paradigm for analysis ordinarily requires we proceed by first identifying a duty on the part of the entity,then ascertain a statutory basis for liability,and then finally determine whether any statutory immunities are applicable.citation.crow state of california d.
a public entity is not liable for injury arising from an act or omission except as provided by statute,subd.a hoff vacaville unified school district cal th,d.government code section,subdivision a,provides a public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of its employee within the scope of employment if the conduct would have given rise to a cause of action against the employee.hoff,supra,cal th at,d.under government code section,subdivision a,a public employee is liable for injury caused by his act or omission to the same extent as a private person.hoff,supra,cal th at,d.
college districts and employees generally have no liability for injuries to college students,with specified exceptions,fn,ante.
although the education code contains a provision for elementary and secondary schools,which is identical to section,we shall see that case law recognizes that the presumed maturity of college students warrants different treatment in terms of duty of supervision.
here,the injury to plaintiff occurred off campus though we note defendants argue the absence of duty in this case has very little to do with the fact the accident occurred off campus.
plaintiff asserts she is relying on section fn,ante as the basis for liability,in that section provides a college district and its employees may be liable and responsible for the conduct and safety of students off campus,where the district undertakes a activity or fails to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.
plaintiff cites case law that she views as helpful to her position that the mapping assignment was a activity,wolfe dublin unified school dist.th,d activity is one that requires attendance and for which attendance credit may be given.though not cited by plaintiff,barnhart cabrillo community college,supra,th,d,indicates the test is not whether participation is voluntary,but whether the activity is part of the school curriculum.id.at,d.
we shall assume for purposes of this appeal that the mapping assignment was a activity and not a field trip or excursion see fn,ante.nevertheless,section contains the further qualification that defendants are liable only while the students were or should have been under the immediate and direct supervision of an employee of such district or board during the assignment.fn,ante.
it is undisputed the students were not under the immediate and direct supervision of a district employee while they were performing the mapping assignment,and we see nothing suggesting defendants should have been supervising the students while they were engaged in doing the assignment.
plaintiff does not contend the students were or should have been under the immediate and direct supervision of a district employee during the students performance of the mapping assignment.instead,she claims the timing of the immediate and direct supervision in section refers to the time when the negligent conduct by the district employee occurs,and here the negligence occurred in the classroom when reid gave the assignment and should have checked driving arrangements and insurance records,and in the planning and development of the assignment.plaintiff notes students are under the immediate and direct supervision of a district employee while in the classroom.plaintiff argues that,when reid gave the assignment in the classroom,he should have taken reasonable steps to ensure that there were enough safe vehicles for the students,that the vehicles had proper seating,and that all drivers had adequate insurance and good driving records.plaintiff also claims reid should have instructed the students on safety,and should have taken steps to procure safer vehicles if needed.plaintiff argues reid failure to take these steps was a breach of the standard duty of care as well as that created by section.
however,plaintiff construction of section fn,ante is defeated by the statutory language itself,which says,in the event of such a specific undertaking,the district shall be liable or responsible for the conduct or safety of any student only while such student is or should be under the immediate and direct supervision of an employee of such district or board.italics added.thus,under section,defendants would be liable for the conduct of student mcgrath whose reckless driving caused the accident only while mcgrath was or should have been under the immediate and direct supervision of reid.similarly,defendants would be liable for the safety of plaintiff only while plaintiff was or should have been under the immediate and direct supervision of reid.thus,section does not,as plaintiff claims,impose liability on defendants for negligent supervision in the classroom.
we agree with defendants argument that plaintiff position would eviscerate section,because any activity is invariably preceded by some kind of instruction.the statute draws a line between activities requiring additional supervision and control over the students when they travel,and the multitude of activities for which liability can not be imposed.this case clearly falls in the latter category.
plaintiff cites case law allowing imposition of liability for injuries resulting from negligence.however,the cited cases turned on the common law rule that schools have a duty to exercise ordinary care in supervising students on school premises and are liable for injuries proximately caused by their breach of that duty.plaintiff reliance on these cases is flawed because,despite the fact she was a college student at the time of the accident,her cited cases were predicated on the duty of supervision owed by school employees to elementary and high school students,and plaintiff fails to acknowledge the law treats college students differently.college students are adults who,unlike children,are able to make their own responsible decisions about their own transportation.
thus,we said in ochoa california state university th,d unlike high school students,whose attendance is compelled and over whom school officials have direct responsibility while the students are at school,adult college students attend school and participate in school activities voluntarily.citation.furthermore,since college administrators have abandoned in loco parentis supervision of adult students and have recognized the students rights to control and regulate their own lives,colleges and universities may no longer be charged with a general duty of care to supervise student activities.citations.id.at,d university owed no duty to protect student from assault by opposing player in intramural soccer game.
similarly,in crow state of california,supra,d,we affirmed summary judgment in favor of a university in an action by a university student who was assaulted in a dormitory by another student during a keg party.id.at.we rejected the plaintiff argument that liability could be predicated on the university negligent operation and supervision of the dormitories.id.at.the plaintiff was an adult college student voluntarily drinking beer at the dormitory,and no claim was made that the college knew or should have known of any particular risk of harm at this particular dormitory.id.at.of interest to the case now before us,we noted in crow the distinction between young,immature schoolchildren in grammar and high schools on the one hand and adult students in colleges and universities on the other was highlighted in baldwin zoradi d,which held university trustees and dormitory advisors were not liable to a student who was injured while engaged with other students in a speed contest in their cars after a drinking party in the dormitory.crow,supra,d at.
baldwin in turn cited a federal case where an was injured while returning from an sophomore class picnic in a vehicle driven by a person who became intoxicated at the picnic.the class advisor had cosigned a check for the beer.the picnic had been advertised on campus with flyers depicting beer mugs.after
