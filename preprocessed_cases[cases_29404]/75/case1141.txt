survivors martinez and campos and the parents of the dead passengers,appellants regino ibarra morin and guadalupe campos de morin for georgina isabel ibarra campos de esparza,and appellants andres esparza silva and carlota hernandez de esperza for andres esparza hernandez,filed a complaint in october in san diego superior court.they alleged causes of action for strict and negligent product liability,negligent maintenance and repair,and negligent infliction of emotional distress.they named as defendants the explorer manufacturer,respondent ford motor company the manufacturer of the right rear tire,respondent cooper tire and rubber company the san diego auto dealership from which the explorer was purchased,leader auto sales and,the san diego tire company that sold the defective tire,power tires appellants attached as exhibits to their complaint certified translations of official death certificates issued by mexican authorities for decedents georgina isabel ibarra campos and andres esparza hernandez.the death certificates identified decedents nationality as mexican and stated they died in vista hermosa in the mexican state of michoacan.additionally,the certificates identified as mexican the nationality of decedents parents,who were suing for themselves and for the estates of their dead children appellant regino ibarra morin and appellant guadalupe campos de ibarra,respectively father and mother to georgina isabel ibarra campos,and appellant andres esparza silva and carlota hernandez morales,respectively father and mother to andres esparza hernandez.
in january,respondents ford and cooper tire filed their answers to appellants complaint.at the time respondents filed their answers,which did not allege forum non conveniens,both respondents were defendants in judicial council coordination proceeding in los angeles superior court known as the winston tire cases.the coordinated proceeding was instituted in in the wake of numerous lawsuits throughout california that alleged copper tire had negligently designed and manufactured vehicle tires.in ordering coordination,the los angeles superior court had found 
e ach tire defect case centers on liability theories of design as well as manufacturing defect,the common glue being that all injuries were allegedly caused by defective tire treads separating from tires made by cooper.at least three issues predominate whether the tires were defectively designed whether the tires were defectively manufactured and whether,in part,injury resulted therefrom.
the same day cooper tire served its answer to appellants complaint,cooper tire petitioned to transfer appellants complaint from san diego superior court to los angeles to be included in the winston tire coordinated proceeding ford did not object to the transfer.two weeks later,the coordination trial court in los angeles granted the petition and in february san diego superior court transferred the case to los angeles.
respondents thereafter pursued discovery against appellants.in may,ford individually served on each appellant requests for production,form interrogatories,and special interrogatories,which appellants answered in august.the discovery ford propounded on appellant guadalupe campos de morin,the mother of decedent georgina isabel ibarra campos,is representative of the discovery that ford sought from all six appellants.
ford served on guadalupe campos de morin requests for inspection and production of documents in her possession.the subject matter of the documents ford sought included the explorer purchase all communications by anyone regarding the accident documents from ford about the explorer depictions of the explorer condition at any time before or after the accident defects and repairs to the explorer depictions of any scene,place or object relevant to or connected to the accident documents filed with or created by governmental agencies or insurance companies that related to the accident tests and inspections of the explorer other accidents in which the explorer was involved morin settlement demands payments by insurers medical history and treatment of morin deceased daughter since medical records of morin daughter injuries from the accident her daughter employment history and earnings since lawsuits and other legal actions since involving morin or her daughter civil or criminal complaints against them and all other documents relating to the liability of ford,cooper tire,leader auto sales,and power tires.
ford also served individually on morin and each of the other appellants form interrogatories.those interrogatories,each of which had subparts,sought information about each appellant insurance physical,mental,and emotional injuries medical history property damage loss of income or earning capacity and other damages.
finally,ford served almost six dozen special interrogatories on each appellant.again,the special interrogatories ford propounded on guadalupe campos de morin were largely representative of those served on all six appellants,except the interrogatories to surviving appellants driver jose mazon martinez and passenger jesus manuel ibarra campos did not seek information about decedents.three of the special interrogatories asked about morin citizenship,place of domicile,and addresses for the previous five years.more than two dozen special interrogatories sought information about the explorer at issue,such as its purchase,use,service,repair,and alleged defects.more than a dozen special interrogatories sought information about past and future financial responsibilities and means of support for morin and her daughter before her daughter death.five special interrogatories sought information about the general health,physical condition,and disabilities of morin daughter.eight special interrogatories sought information about morin theories of liability for ford,cooper,power tires,and leader auto sales.and finally,special interrogatories sought miscellaneous information,such as proof morin daughter was wearing a seat belt when the accident occurred,and documentation of medical bills and burial expenses paid by morin for her daughter.
cooper tire served discovery on appellants in april,which appellants answered in july.cooper tire served on each appellant a plaintiff fact sheet specially prepared for the coordinated winston tire proceeding.the fact sheet asked questions about the following

all told,ford and cooper tire propounded more than pages of written discovery on appellants.appellants responses spanned more than pages.additionally,cooper tire took possession of the tires at issue by july.
in february,ford and appellants unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the lawsuit through mediation.cooper tire did not participate.when the attempted mediation failed,ford filed its motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens,in which cooper tire joined.they asserted the ties of appellants lawsuit to mexico predominated over any ties to california,making mexico the appropriate forum for trying the case.respondents noted that the explorer at issue was owned,operated,and registered in mexico at the time of the accident in mexico,and all the plaintiffs lived in mexico.the first responders to the accident were mexican authorities and the physicians who treated the accident victims were mexican.additionally,mexican officials conducted the investigation.in contrast to the accident ties to mexico,respondents asserted the lawsuit ties to california were minimal.the two defendants,leader auto sales and power tires,had defaulted and the remaining defendants,respondents ford and cooper tire,were corporations based outside california.
appellants opposed the motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens.their principal argument was respondents delayed their motion to dismiss in order to take advantage of discovery mechanisms in california that do not exist in mexico.in reply,respondents asserted,and reiterate on appeal,that their motion was timely because they had no grounds to move for dismissal for forum non conveniens until they had conducted discovery.they argued to the trial court that appellants complaint did not establish a basis for forum non conveniens,because it did not specify the residency or citizenship of any of the plaintiffs or the plaintiffs decedents ford only learned of plaintiffs mexican residency and citizenship when it received discovery responses in august.
the trial court granted the motion and entered its order of dismissal after concluding california was a seriously inconvenient forum in which to try appellants lawsuit.the court order did not address the timeliness of ford motion or the prejudice,if any,from respondents pursuit of discovery before ford filed the motion to dismiss.this appeal followed 
discussion 
the trial court did not address appellants principal argument against respondents motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens the motion was prejudicially untimely after respondents had received extensive discovery of matters unrelated to the motion on review,we apply the traditional appellate presumption that the trial court rejected appellants untimeliness argument when it ruled in respondents favor.in re marriage of arceneaux cal d,denham superior court cal d,maria riles cal d,fladeboe american isuzu motors th.but regardless of whether our presumption actually comports with the trial court reasoning,we hold the court erred when it rejected appellants contention that the motion was prejudicially untimely.
forum non conveniens is an equitable doctrine.stangvik shiley cal d.it invokes a trial court discretionary power to decline to exercise the jurisdiction it has over a cause of action when it believes the action may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere.ibid.grounded in equity,its purpose is to see that equity is done.see,toscano greene music th,elbert,limited federated income properties d,it is a measure of the virility and flexibility of equitable principles that they may be applied to the end that neither party is permitted to secure an advantage to the prejudice of another.we review a trial court application of the doctrine for abuse of discretion.roman liberty university,th.
mexico,the forum the trial court deemed more suitable than california in which to try appellants lawsuit,does not allow the type or scope of discovery that california permitted respondents to propound here.mexico does not allow written discovery akin to interrogatories and provides for only limited requests for production of documents.indeed,ford expert witness on mexican law stated,we do have discovery in mexico.although ford witness may have been slightly exaggerating,we nonetheless accept as the point that ford and cooper tire could not have received in mexico the discovery that they got while litigating in california.
a party abuses the discovery process when it takes advantage of california laws and legal processes to propound discovery beyond the scope of establishing the grounds for a forum non conveniens motion and then,after getting its discovery,asserts california is an inconvenient forum.accord groom health net th,prejudice when party uses discovery not available in arbitration to discover plaintiffs strategy and evidence before moving to compel arbitration.the inequity of respondents pretrial maneuvers is especially pronounced given that cooper tire,with ford acquiescence,transferred appellants complaint from appellants chosen diego county where the ford explorer was purchased and the allegedly defective tire the coordination proceedings in los angeles.respondents successful transfer of appellants complaint to los angeles conflicts with their assertion that california is an inconvenient forum because the coordination proceedings presuppose the efficiency and convenience of trying multiple cases that share the common glue that tires designed and manufactured by cooper tire caused the injuries alleged in the coordinated lawsuits.
respondents note that the law imposes no express time limit on a party forum non conveniens motion,and thus contend their motion filed in april months after appellants filed their complaint was timely.for example,morris afga th morris,granted a motion filed one year after the plaintiffs filed their complaint.and britton dallas airmotive,th,granted a motion made one year after most of the defendants had answered.
respondents reliance on these decisions is unavailing,however,because those decisions found the plaintiffs
