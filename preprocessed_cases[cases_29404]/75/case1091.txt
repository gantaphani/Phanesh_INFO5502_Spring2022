airboss railway products,airboss of america,robert magnuson,and jose mediavilla collectively,the defendants appeal from the judgment of the united states district court for the western district of missouri.pandrol usa,lp airboss ry.
the district court entered summary judgment of infringement of patent the patent and found that the defendants had waived their affirmative defenses and counterclaims by not raising them during briefing of for summary judgment.we hold that the district court did not err in construing the claims in granting summary judgment of patent infringement against all defendants or in determining the amount of plaintiffs lost profits.however,we also hold that the defendants did not waive their defense of patent invalidity nor did they waive their invalidity counterclaim.we therefore vacate and remand for further proceedings.
background 
this is the second time this case has come before us.in the first appeal,we affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment of noninfringement of patent the patent,but vacated the grant of summary judgment of noninfringement of the patent and remanded the case for further proceedings.pandrol usa,lp airboss ry,pandrol i.on remand,pandrol usa,lp and pandrol the plaintiffs prevailed,securing a judgment awarding damages and an injunction based on a finding of infringement of claim of the patent.this time around,the parties dispute solely concerns this judgment concerning the patent.accordingly,we limit our description of the background to that patent.
the patent relates to a railroad track fastening system and is directed to a rail seat assembly designed to resist erosion of the concrete rail tie by interposing an plate and a layer of adhering material between the rail pad and the rail.figure from the patent specification is reproduced below 
the patent specification describes the preferred embodiment,in part,as follows 
the improvement of this invention is to provide an abrasion plate between the pad and the tie.the plate is smooth edged and incorporates recesses to fit around the clamp supports or shoulder.
the plate may be bonded by layer of adhesive epoxy resin adhesives are preferred to the tie or an hdpe closed cell foam of mm thickness of the same size and shape as plate fitted between plate and tie.
at issue on this appeal is the district court interpretation of the term adhering material in claim of the patent.that term appears in claims and.claim recites 
an abrasion resistant rail seat for securing a rail to a concrete rail tie of the type in which the rail has a flange and is secured to a concrete rail tie by elastic rail clamps and an elastomeric rail pad insulates the rail from the rail tie,the improvement comprising interposing an abrasion resistant plate between said rail pad and said rail tie,said abrasion resistant plate forming a water tight seal with said rail tie,said abrasion resistant plate being wider than said rail and extending beyond the flange of said rail,and a layer of adhering material between said abrasion resistant rail plate and said rail tie for adhering said plate to said tie,said material being the sole means for adhering said plate to said tie so that the replacement of said abrasion resistant rail plate is facilitated.

claim recites a rail seat as claimed in claim,wherein said adhering material is a closed cell foam pad of one to two millimetres sic in thickness and of similar shape to said plate.id.at,ll.emphasis added.
the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint in this action on may,alleging that plaintiff pandrol was the owner of all right,title and interest in the patent,and that plaintiff pandrol usa,lp was the exclusive licensee under the patent.the plaintiffs alleged that defendant airboss railway products,directly infringed the patent.the plaintiffs also alleged that defendants airboss of america and robert magnuson magnuson and jose mediavilla mediavilla induced infringement.airboss of america was the parent company of airboss railway products.magnuson was the president of airboss railway products,and mediavilla was the vice president.the accused device was airboss railroad track fastening system.
on may,the defendants filed answers to the complaint.in addition to denying infringement and inducement of infringement,the defendants raised affirmative defenses,including patent invalidity.the defendants also filed counterclaims for a declaratory judgment that the patent was invalid.in presenting their counterclaims,the defendants alleged

on october,the district court issued an order construing the patent.the court construed the recited adhering material in claims and of the patent to be a layer of adhesive,such as a glue or epoxy,that bonds the plate to the tie.pandrol usa,lp airboss ry,slip op.at.on december,based on this claim construction,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of the patent.
on december,pursuant to a stipulation by both parties,the district court ordered that the defendants counterclaims are dismissed without prejudice and that defendants will be allowed to assert all said counterclaims in the event this matter is remanded for further consideration.pandrol usa,lp airboss ry,order of.
the plaintiffs appealed to this court.on march,we vacated the district court determination of noninfringement of the patent and remanded.pandrol i,at.
we held that the district court had erroneously interpreted the adhering material recitation of claims and to require a layer of adhesive,such as a glue or epoxy,which bonds the plate to the tie.id.at.we reasoned that the dictionary definition of adhere indicates that bonding is not the only way to get two objects to adhere to one another.for instance,magnets,solder,and velcro strips can all be used to adhere objects together id.at.we pointed out that the second preferred embodiment referred to an hdpe closed cell foam,which does not adhere by bonding,and that a construction that would cause a preferred embodiment to fall outside of the scope of the patent claims is strongly disfavored.id.at.we also determined that the district court narrow construction of adhering material was inconsistent with the language of claim,which indicated that a closed cell foam pad was an adhering material.we therefore vacated the district court judgment of noninfringement of the patent and remanded the case for further proceedings.id.at.
on remand,on july,the individual and corporate defendants filed a motion for summary judgment of noninfringement.the defendants argued that the adhering material limitation required that the adhering material actually bind the rail plate to the rail tie.they urged that because the airboss product has nothing that acts to stick or hold the abrasion plate to the rail tie by suction,grasping or fusion or anything else,and there are no nails or spikes used,the accused product did not meet the adhering material limitation and the defendants were entitled to summary judgment of noninfringement as a matter of law.suggestions of defs.in support of their mot.for summ.of july,at.the defendants did not raise their affirmative defenses or counterclaims of invalidity in this motion.nor did the defendants contest the plaintiffs title to the patent.on july,defendants magnuson and mediavilla moved for summary judgment dismissing them as defendants,arguing that there was no proof that they knowingly induced infringement.
on august,the plaintiffs filed a for summary judgment of infringement as to claim.the plaintiffs argued that this court decision mandated that the adhering material limitation include a closed cell foam pad of the thickness recited in claim.because there was no dispute but that the accused device included such a closed cell pad,the plaintiffs argued,they were entitled to a judgment of infringement as a matter of law as to claim.alternatively,the plaintiffs argued that the foam pad in the accused product in fact did adhere to the plate and the tie as a result of the pressure on the tie resulting from heavy rail traffic.the plaintiffs did not request summary judgment of liability,nor did they seek summary judgment as to the affirmative defenses and counterclaims of invalidity asserted in the defendants answers of may.
on september,the individual and corporate defendants answered the plaintiffs for summary judgment.in their opposition,the defendants disputed the plaintiffs arguments regarding claim construction and infringement,but again did not raise their affirmative defenses or counterclaims of patent invalidity,nor did the defendants dispute the plaintiffs title to the patent or argue that the individual defendants and airboss of america were not responsible for inducing infringement.
on november,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment of infringement as to claim and denied the defendants motions for summary judgment.pandrol usa,lp airboss ry,slip op.at,opinion.in construing the meaning of the recited adhering material,the court found 
as made clear in the federal circuit decision,the term adhering material is not limited to bonding and must include a closed cell foam pad as well as the preferred polyethylene closed cell foam pad disclosed in the preferred embodiment.as a result,for purposes of claim of the patent,adhering must include at least the type of adherence that results from the combined use of a metal abrasion plate,polyethylene foam pad,and concrete tie under a railroad rail.
id.at.the court found that i t is undisputed that defendants product utilizes a foam pad which is a polyethylene pad of one to two millimeters in thickness and of similar shape to the abrasion plate.id.at.the court therefore concluded 
s ince it is undisputed that defendants are using a polyethylene closed cell foam pad in their assembly product,copying the disclosed embodiment in plaintiffs patent,the court finds that plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on their claim that defendants have infringed the patent.
in denying defendants magnuson and mediavilla motion for summary judgment dismissing them as defendants,the court held that,based on the two defendants personal participation in airboss alleged acts of infringement,they could be held personally liable for participating in,inducing,and approving acts of patent infringement,and would not be dismissed from the case.id.at.
during a november,telephone conference involving the parties and the district court,the defendants argued that they were entitled to try the issues of patent invalidity,ownership and the liability of the individuals.transcript of.conference of,at,ll,pandrol.the plaintiff argued that damages is all that left.id.at,ll.the district court asked the parties to submit briefs on the issue of whether the defendants had waived the right to contest patent validity or the other defenses by not raising them in response to the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.on november,both parties filed the requested briefs.
on november,the district court declined to schedule for trial the affirmative defenses of invalidity of the patent lack of responsibility of one or more of the defendants for the acts of infringement and lack of ownership by the plaintiffs.pandrol usa,lp airboss ry,order of,at,order.the district court found that the defendants had waived their defenses by failing to raise them in opposition to the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment of infringement.the district court limited the trial to the issue of damages.while the court did not specifically address the defendants counterclaims,it ordered that a trial would be held,limited to the determination of plaintiff damages.id.at.
on november,a jury trial was held on the issue of damages.the jury awarded the plaintiffs in lost profits damages,and the district court entered judgment against the defendants for this amount.on january,the court granted the plaintiffs motion to alter or amend the judgment,and awarded the plaintiffs an additional in prejudgment interest.in addition to these monetary damages,the district court entered a final injunction against the defendants on november,preventing defendants from manufacturing,marketing,selling,or shipping any of the defendants assembly devices which have been found to infringe plaintiffs patent.pandrol usa,lp airboss ry,order of,at.
the defendants timely filed this appeal.
discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review.
even though the parties have raised no objection to our jurisdiction over this appeal,we are obligated to consider whether there is a final judgment of the district court.a view eng g,robotic vision.if a case is not fully adjudicated as to all claims for all parties,there is no final decision and therefore no jurisdiction.syntex pharm.int l.a judgment that does not dispose of pending counterclaims is not a final judgment.id.the issue here is whether the district court disposed of the defendants counterclaims,thereby rendering an appealable final judgment.
after the district court original grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants,the defendants agreed to dismiss their counterclaims without prejudice,so that there would be an appealable final judgment.the parties stipulated that the defendants counterclaims be dismissed without prejudice to defendants right to assert all the defenses recited in its answers and counterclaims to plaintiff first amended complaint,including the defenses of patent invalidity,in the event of an appeal which results in a remand for trial.stipulation of.the district court then ordered that the defendants counterclaims are dismissed without prejudice and that defendants will be allowed to assert all said counterclaims in the event this matter is remanded for further consideration.pandrol,order of.because the counterclaims had been dismissed,the first appeal to this court was from a final judgment.however,we were advised at oral argument in the present appeal that on remand from this court,no further action was taken to reinstate the counterclaims.both parties agreed that none was required,and that the counterclaims were automatically reinstated,and were treated as reinstated by both the parties and the district court.both parties urged as well that the district court disposed of the counterclaims.we agree.
after the district court granted summary judgment of infringement,the defendants urged that the issue of patent invalidity remained to be resolved.def.br.re.fact issues remaining to be tried before a jury at.in ruling that the defendants had waived their defenses,the district court subsequently ordered that the trial will be limited to the determination of plaintiffs damages.order at.in this ruling the district court effectively held that the counterclaims had been waived.after the jury returned a verdict on damages,the district court entered judgment against the defendants on november.
no form of words is necessary to evince the rendition of a judgment.united states schaefer brewing,d citation omitted.rather,whether an order constitutes a final judgment depends upon whether the judge has or has not clearly declared his intention in this respect in his opinion.id.in other words,as the second circuit has observed,f inality is determined on the basis of pragmatic,not needlessly rigid pro forma,analysis what essentially is required is some clear and unequivocal manifestation by the trial court of its belief that the decision made,so far as it is concerned,is the end of the case.fiataruolo united states,cir.in this case,the district court entry of judgment against the defendants for money damages and an injunction,after having held that the defendants had waived the issue of patent invalidity,evinced a clear intent to resolve or dispose of all claims and end the case.there is,therefore,a final judgment of the district court,and this court has jurisdiction over the appeal under a.
we review the grant of summary judgment without deference.johnson worldwide,zebco.
ii.claim construction.
the only issue the parties raise regarding claim construction concerns the adhering material limitation of claim.the defendants argue that the district court erroneously concluded that any closed cell foam pad is an adhering material.
our earlier decision in this case is dispositive of this issue.in pandrol i we concluded that t he clear language of claim indicates that a closed cell foam pad is an adhering material,and that the district court construction erroneously excluded from claim coverage the hdpe closed cell foam that was disclosed in the preferred embodiment.pandrol i at.
the defendants essentially argue that our earlier claim construction was incorrect.even if that claim construction were not binding as the law of the case,it was clearly correct.both the abstract and the preferred embodiment make clear that a gasket between the rail plate and the rail tie,in and of itself,constitutes an adhering material and need not satisfy a separate bonding requirement the abstract provides,t he plate may be bonded to the rail tie or a resilient gasket can be interposed between the rail tie and the plate.abstract of the patent emphasis added.this makes clear that bonding is merely an alternative to the separate solution of merely interposing a gasket between the rail tie and the plate.the preferred embodiment similarly provides,t he plate may be bonded by layer of adhesive epoxy resin adhesives are preferred to the tie or an hdpe closed cell foam of mm thickness of the same size and shape as plate fitted between plate and tie.patent,ll.emphases added.once again,bonding is merely an alternative embodiment to inserting a closed cell foam,which is fitted between the plate and the tie.hence,while the claims require an adhering material between the abrasion resistant plate and the rail tie,this requirement is satisfied by interpos ing or fitt ing the closed cell foam pad between the rail plate and the tie.
the defendants argument that the patentee disclaimed such an interpretation during prosecution is without merit.during prosecution,the patent examiner initially objected to the drawings in the application under a because the drawings in the application did not include an illustration of the adhering material.office action of,in the application at.the patentee amended the application by including an illustration of the adhering material in the drawings and correct ing the informalities noted by the examiner in the specification.am.of,to application at.the specification originally contained the following language 
the plate may be bonded by adhesive epoxy resin adhesives are preferred to the tie or an hdpe closed cell foam of mm thickness of the same size and shape as plate is fitted between plate and tie.
see id.at.the patentee amended the specification to refer to the new drawings,by adding layer of between by and adhesives and deleting the word is between plate and fitted.hence,the amended lines of the specification read 
the plate may be bonded by layer of adhesive epoxy resin adhesives are preferred to the tie or an hdpe closed cell foam of mm thickness of the same size and shape as plate fitted between plate and tie.
patent,ll.added language emphasized deletion indicated by strikethrough.the addition of the phrase layer of and the deletion of the word is are without significance.the defendant retained the language indicating that a preferred embodiment would include an hdpe closed cell foam of mm thickness of the same size and shape as plate fitted between plate and tie.patent,ll.emphasis added.
the district court found,i t is undisputed that defendants product utilizes a foam pad which is a polyethylene pad of one to two millimeters in thickness and of similar shape to the abrasion plate.opinion at.there is thus no dispute that under this construction of claim,the district court correctly determined that the claims cover the accused device,and that the plaintiffs were,therefore,entitled to summary judgment of infringement as a matter of law.
iii.waiver of the invalidity defense and counterclaim.
the defendants argue that they did not waive the right to a trial on the issue of invalidity by failing to raise it in opposition to the for summary judgment as to the issue of infringement.we agree.
on remand of this case from our first decision,the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment as to all defendants,asking that the district court enter judgment of infringement against the defendants and in favor of the plaintiffs on claim of the patent.suggestions of pls.in support of their mot.for summ.of,at.as noted above,the plaintiffs did not request summary judgment of liability,only infringement.nor did the plaintiffs seek summary judgment with respect to the affirmative defense and counterclaim of invalidity asserted in the defendants answers of may.
supreme court precedent and our cases make clear that patent infringement and patent validity are treated as separate issues.in cardinal chemical morton international,d,the supreme court held that a finding that a patent is not infringed does not render the counterclaim for patent invalidity moot.id.at.the court determined that a party seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity presents a claim independent of the patentee charge of infringement.id.at.emphasis added.the court concluded that of the two questions,validity has the greater public importance.id.at.citation omitted see also altvater freeman.holding that a finding of noninfringement does not render the distinct claim of patent invalidity moot.
similarly,this court has long recognized that patent infringement and invalidity are separate and distinct issues.though an invalid claim can not give rise to liability for infringement,whether it is infringed is an entirely separate question capable of determination without regard to its validity.medtronic,cardiac pacemakers,uspq,noting that although the district court was correct in its determination that the patents in suit were invalid,the better practice would have been to resolve the issue of infringement as well see also carman,wahl,uspq,the district court erroneously combined the analysis of validity with that of infringement.
we have applied this rule in a variety of contexts.for example,in tenneco resins,reeves,uspq,we held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing a party delayed motion to amend its pleadings to add a defense of invalidity 
while we recognize that the issues of infringement,interference,validity,and unenforceability are normally addressed together,they are distinct and separate issues.thus,tenneco had the duty to place this distinct and separate issue in its pleading if it wished the court to consider the matter.given that the infringement and validity issues are normally addressed together,reeves and the trial court could reasonably have assumed that tenneco silence in its original pleading expressed its intention not to raise the validity issue.
id.at,uspq at citation and internal quotations omitted.
in fin control systems pty,oam,we held that a district court could not sua sponte grant a party summary judgment of patent invalidity in response to a motion for summary judgment that was focused exclusively on the issue of noninfringement 
the defenses of invalidity and unenforceability were not the subject of any motion before the district court,nor does the record indicate that these aspects of the case had been fully litigated at the time that the district court entered judgment.therefore,the district court sua sponte grant of summary judgment of invalidity and unenforceability was procedurally improper because it did not provide the parties with adequate notice or an
