daniel lundeen appeals from the jurisdictional dismissal of his suit against norman mineta,the secretary of the united states department of transportation usdot the metropolitan transit authority of harris county,texas metro and the city of houston houston.agreeing with the district court conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction of this case,we affirm its dismissal of lundeen action.
facts and proceedings 
this suit was brought by a bicyclist opposed to a federally funded highway project in which metro and houston seek to renovate the portion of louisiana street,a downtown thoroughfare,that runs from west gray to lamar.the renovation would construct five traffic lanes,with no restrictions on the leftmost three lanes,a hov restriction for lane four,and a restriction for the fifth or rightmost lane.metro and houston have secured usdot grants to fund this reconstruction hereafter,the louisiana project.
lundeen,a bicyclist who is a citizen and resident of houston,sued mineta,metro,and houston to block the louisiana project.he asked the district court to enjoin operation of bus lanes,hov lanes,and metro buses on louisiana street to enjoin houston from enforcing its ordinance against bikes in bus lanes and to declare that ordinance void and the louisiana project,as well as the operation of metro buses as envisioned in that project,ineligible for federal transportation funding.lundeen pleadings allege that because he is a bicyclist,his personal safety on and enjoyment of louisiana street are threatened by the project as envisioned.he claims that he objected to the design of the project,only to be brushed off by both metro and usdot.on appeal,he states that the design and operation of the louisiana project would threaten him with unreasonable risk of personal injury and death and that the design is deliberately calculated by metro to discourage any use of louisiana street by bicycle sic.
mineta and metro moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.the district court granted their jurisdictional motions and dismissed the action.lundeen timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
we review a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction de novo our review here is tripartite.we begin with lundeen claim against secretary mineta.
jurisdiction over mineta and usdot 
as we have previously noted,
the principle of sovereign immunity protects the federal government from suit except insofar as that immunity is waived.a waiver must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text and will not be implied.see lane pena,d citations omitted numerous supreme court opinions hold that courts should construe statutes against waiver unless congress has explicitly provided for it 
consequently,no suit may be maintained against the united states unless the suit is brought in exact compliance with the terms of a statute under which the sovereign has consented to be sued.the burden is on lundeen to show such consent,because he is the party asserting federal jurisdiction he has pointed us to no waiver in itself,its predecessors,or usdot authorizing legislation.we therefore confine our analysis of whether the district court had jurisdiction of lundeen action against mineta to the single statute that lundeen identifies as permitting him to sue the government the administrative procedure act apa 
judicial review of agency action 
lundeen basic argument assumes that,under the apa scheme,usdot funding of the louisiana project is an agency action.mineta does not contest this assumption,perhaps because the term definition is very broad and encompasses a funding decision 
the parties sharply disagree,however,over whether judicial review is statutorily precluded.the apa generally provides that a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,is entitled to judicial review thereof.in granting this entitlement,the statute clearly waives the official immunity of officers of the united states this certainly qualifies as a waiver of sovereign immunity.the apa expresses a broad exception,however,to its general rule courts may not review an agency action when the statutes preclude judicial review or agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.mineta urges that the first exception applies if it does,its statutory preclusion of judicial review would be jurisdictional in effect,requiring dismissal if neither exception applies,jurisdiction exists,although it does so under the general statute,not the apa proper,which does not create an independent grant of jurisdiction to bring suit.
our analysis under the first exception begins with the strong presumption that congress intends that the federal courts review agency action the agency can rebut this presumption by pointing to specific language or specific legislative history that is a reliable indicator of congressional intent.the standard is whether congressional intent to preclude judicial review is fairly discernible in the statutory scheme.in determining whether this is so,we cast a broad evidentiary net we look to the statute language,structure,and legislative history,and also to the nature of the administrative action authorized 
the key provisions at issue entered the statute books in as parts of the transportation equity act for the century in,congress federal highway and transit funding.
statutory text 
amended the united states code to add special language favoring bicyclists g and to rewrite a highly reticulated scheme that explicitly precludes judicial review and.how these provisions interrelate is a matter of first impression.
sections and of amended and to require that metropolitan regions acting through metropolitan planning organizations and states,respectively,develop transportation plans that establish priorities of projects for federal funding.sections and delineate the scope of planning and provide a list of planning factors,several of which are relevant to this case but they also protect that planning,and the planners failure to consider a factor,from judicial review.the relevant language of section,the provision,states 
f scope of planning process.
in metropolitan transportation planning process for a metropolitan area under this section shall provide for consideration of projects and strategies that will 
b increase the safety and security of the transportation system for motorized and nonmotorized users 
c increase the accessibility and mobility options available to people and for freight 
d protect and enhance the environment,promote energy conservation,and improve quality of life.
failure to consider failure to consider any factor specified in paragraph shall not be reviewable by any court under this title,subchapter ii of chapter of title,or chapter of title in any matter affecting a transportation plan,a transportation improvement plan,a project or strategy,or the certification of a planning process 
section list of state planning factors and prohibition on judicial review of state planning are identical to this quoted language if these provisions were all that we had to construe,lundeen would have no case.
lundeen points to g,however,which was amended by section a of to read,in pertinent part 
bicycle transportation and pedestrian walkways.
g planning and design.
in and pedestrians shall be given due consideration in the comprehensive transportation plans developed by each metropolitan planning organization and state in accordance with sections and,respectively.bicycle transportation facilities and pedestrian walkways shall be considered,where appropriate,in conjunction with all new construction and reconstruction of transportation facilities,except where bicycle and pedestrian uses are not permitted.
safety plans and projects shall provide due consideration for safety and contiguous routes for bicyclists and pedestrians 
lundeen notes that,even though the first sentence of g refers back to and,which explicitly preclude judicial review,the second sentence of g does not.neither does g.he suggests that,as g title suggests,the provision operates on two levels planning and design.on this view,the provision not only requires that bicyclists receive consideration in the planning processes,which courts may not review,but also requires that bicyclists receive due consideration,when appropriate,in the design of particular projects.metropolitan and state plans developed pursuant to and,lundeen asserts,do not contain design details such as bike lanes.he reasons that when congress required that transportation projects afford bicyclists and bike routes due consideration,and that bicycle transportation facilities be considered,where appropriate,in conjunction with all reconstruction of transportation facilities,congress meant to impose a design requirement distinct from the planning requirement.under this theory,because only the first sentence of g refers back to and,the latter sections do not foreclose judicial review of design violations.
the district court rejected lundeen contention that g imposes a judicially reviewable design requirement,stating that section g is relevant only in the context of and,both of which unambiguously preclude judicial review.accordingly,g does not provide a basis for this court jurisdiction.the district court quoted only the first sentence of g,however,and did not respond in detail to lundeen bifurcation argument,which focuses on the last two sentences.
the case with respect to g alone is not open and shut,as g is less than pellucid.nevertheless,lundeen argument runs into several textual difficulties.
first,lundeen attempt to bifurcate g ignores the consistency of language in that section three sentences.all three use the terms consider or consideration.the better construction of g gives this term a consistent meaning,maintaining uniformity of construction in all three sentences 
second,if consider and consideration do indeed mean the same thing throughout g,that meaning is to be found in and,to which g first sentence refers.both those sections require that metropolitan planning organizations and states consider various factors as they draw up plans to support his contrary the meaning of consideration in and is not imported into fails to identify for us any other portion of or title that uses the term.rather,he asserts that g on its own establishes a new consideration requirement that is judicially reviewable.this is an energetic construction of the second two sentences at issue,given that neither of them specifies official or what give due consideration to facilities and routes for,and the safety of,bicyclists.the second sentence of g masks agency by using the passive voice bicycle transportation facilities shall be considered.section g states that plans and projects shall provide due consideration,as though decisions are made by the plans and projects rather than by federal,state,and local agency officials,planners,designers,and engineers.the indeterminacy of these two sentences reinforces our view that we should interpret consider,as used throughout g,in light of and,to mean consider during planning.
third,we concede that g provides a modicum of support for lundeen bifurcated reading,because it is a separate paragraph thus perhaps distinguishing its language from that of g,and because,taken in isolation,it might fairly be read to impose a definite requirement.the distinction from g is particularly important because that section refers to and,each of which explicitly states that failure to consider a as transportation planning is not judicially reviewable.these bans on judicial review are quite sweeping failure to consider a factor shall not be reviewable by any court under this title or provisions of the apa in any matter affecting a transportation plan,a transportation improvement plan,a project or strategy,or the certification of a planning process.neither party has cited any case deciding whether the phrase any matter affecting a transportation plan or strategy includes compliance with g,and we have found none.thus we are left to our own devices to determine how to reconcile these two provisions.
the supreme court reviewability test asks whether congressional intent to make an agency action judicially reviewable is fairly discernible not just from statutory text,but also from structure,legislative history,and the nature of the administrative action alleged to be reviewable.we address each of these other indicators of intent.
statutory structure 
the structure of title militates against lundeen bifurcated reading of g in several ways.lundeen assertion that the planning processes established in and do not address particular projects or the implications of projects for bicycles is belied by the text of those sections.as amended,and state that the plans shall provide for the development and integrated management and operation of transportation systems and facilities including pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities that will function as an intermodal transportation system.both metropolitan planning organizations and states are commanded to develop transportation improvement programs that shall include,respectively,priority list s of proposed federally supported projects and federally supported surface transportation expenditures.the metropolitan planning organizations and states must each also develop plans,with respect to which citizens,representatives of users of public transit,and other interested parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to comment on the plans in development as for its transportation improvement program,each metropolitan planning organization must provide an opportunity for comment during the plan development,must provide a further period before approving the plan,and must publish the plan annually the state then selects from the approved improvement plan the projects that will receive federal funds lundeen suggested bifurcation between planning and project design is thus not necessarily borne out by the statute structure,although it may be reflected in the statute implementation.
unsurprisingly,title does mandate that projects comply with federal standards in m,this title even mandates that the secretary of transportation veto any project that will have significant adverse impact on the safety for nonmotorized transportation traffic unless the project provides for a reasonable alternate route or such a route already exists the record is devoid of any evidence on alternate routes,however,partly because lundeen never mentioned m in his complaint or in his briefs.we therefore decline to address any violation of m.
broadening our focus to title as a whole gives still further evidence against lundeen argument.even if we assume that g does impose a design criterion independent of the planning processes specified in and,we see that congress wrote that criterion into title chapter,which generally governs highways that are not highways authorized by chapter.other provisions in chapter cover federal lands highways,forest development roads,defense access roads,the highway,territories highways,the darien gap highway which is in panama,and a portion of the alaska highway that is in canada any freestanding design criterion in chapter would more naturally apply to these highways than to highways such as the louisiana project.we are convinced that if it had wanted a putative,judicially reviewable,criterion to cover highways,congress would have placed such a provision in either chapter entitled highways,chapter general provisions,or chapter highway safety.if g does contain a design requirement independent of the planning processes in chapter,the location of that requirement in chapter militates strongly against applying the requirement to the highways governed by chapter.the structure of title thus evinces in several ways a congressional intent that the courts not review any violation of g with respect to a highway.
legislative history 
lundeen has not cited any portion of the legislative history of in support of his interpretation of g.our independent review of the history has unearthed no evidence supporting his interpretation of g but has revealed some evidence supporting the district court jurisdictional dismissal.
the current version of g was
