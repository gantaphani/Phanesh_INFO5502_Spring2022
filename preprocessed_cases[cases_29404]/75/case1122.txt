this writ of review proceeding presents the question of whether the public utilities commission the commission has the authority to order railroads to stop using horns at certain pedestrian rail crossings in the city of san clemente the city.we conclude the answer to that question is no,because in public utilities code section the legislature has commanded that an audible warning device mounted on the train must be sounded at every rail crossing in the state,except those within federally established quiet zones.because the pedestrian crossings at issue here are not within a federally established quiet zone,a train horn must be sounded at those crossings,and the commission has no authority to order otherwise.accordingly,we will set aside the commission decision to the contrary.
factual and procedural background 
in the city,a railroad track separates the beach from the bluff on which the residential and commercial areas of the city are located.matter of the application of the city of san clemente cal.the track is presently used by petitioner bnsf railway company bnsf in the operation of freight trains and by petitioner national railroad passenger corporation amtrak in the operation of passenger trains.we will refer to petitioners bnsf and amtrak jointly as the railroads.
before,access across the railroad track to and from the beach was essentially uncontrolled beachgoers would walk up and down the bluff on informal trails and cross the track at virtually any point they chose.an effort to develop a more regular trail and safer crossings resulted in the san clemente pedestrian beach trail.part of the overall plan for the beach trail was the san clemente beach safety enhancement project,which included protective barriers,undercrossings,and crossings and which was subject to the approval of the commission.the project,as approved by the commission in may,coordinated the new beach trail with the improvement of two existing pedestrian crossings,the construction of four new pedestrian crossings,and the construction or improvement of four pedestrian undercrossings,channeling pedestrians to the approved crossings through the use of vegetative barriers and fencing.
while the project the commission approved increased public safety along the stretch of beach,the project also resulted in significant complaints regarding the noise of the trains transiting the area,because approximately trains per day travel that stretch of track,and the trains blow their horns at all seven of the pedestrian crossings.accordingly,in august the city filed an application with the commission asking for authority and approval to alter and improve the seven existing san clemente beach trail at grade crossings.in particular,the city sought approval to p rovide an audible warning system aws as a supplemental safety measure at each trail crossing to be utilized during conditions in lieu of warning horns in conjunction with other additions,alterations and improvements to the safety features of the trail crossings.italics added.in its application,the city asserted that t he aws,implemented at the seven trail crossings,would replace and eliminate the routine train horn warnings that currently intrude on residents who live adjacent to the trail crossings in support of its application,the city argued that under a complex interplay of certain california statutes and federal regulations,the commission had the authority to approve the use of wayside horns that is,horns mounted at the crossings instead of train horns at the pedestrian trail crossings 
in september,the railroads filed a protest and response to the city application,asserting that because california state statutes require railroads to use locomotive mounted horns in advance of pedestrian railroad crossings,the commission has no statutory authority to approve an automated wayside horn system as a substitute for locomotive mounted horns,and the commission has no jurisdiction to order railroads to stop using locomotive mounted horns as required by california state statutes.
in february,the city moved for an interim ruling from the commission on whether the commission had the authority to approve the city request to use wayside horns in lieu of train horns.an administrative law judge alj granted that motion,and the parties briefed the jurisdictional issue.
in july,the alj issued his proposed decision concluding that the commission has jurisdiction to consider approving the use of wayside horns instead of train horns at pedestrian rail crossings.the commission adopted that decision as its own in august,effective immediately decision.within days,the railroads filed an application for rehearing to which the city responded,but the commission did not act on that application,and thus it was deemed denied after days,subd.b.
in november,the alj issued a scoping memo and ruling setting an evidentiary hearing for january and the final decision for april.in december,the railroads commenced the present proceeding by filing a timely petition for a writ of review of the commission jurisdictional decision in this court.we issued the writ in february.
discussion 
the issue in this case is whether the commission has the authority to prohibit trains from using their horns at pedestrian rail crossings,in favor of audible warning signals mounted at the crossings,where those crossings are not located in a federally established quiet zone.the railroads contend the commission does not have that authority.we agree.
sources and limits of the commission authority 
we begin with the provisions of our state constitution that govern public utilities,which are found in article xii.section of that article provides,as relevant here,that p rivate corporations and persons that own,operate,control,or manage a line,plant,or system for the transportation of people or property,and common carriers,are public utilities subject to control by the legislature.under this provision,all railroad carriers are subject to legislative control.city of union city southern pac.d.section of article xii provides for the composition of the commission,and section gives the commission the power to fix rates and establish rules for the transportation of passengers and property by transportation companies among other things.section of the article then provides that t he legislature has plenary power,unlimited by the other provisions of this constitution but consistent with this article,to confer additional authority and jurisdiction upon the commission 
the legislature exercised this power when it enacted sections and of the public utilities code,which are broadly worded grants of power to the commission over railroad crossings in general.santa clara valley transportation authority public utilities,supra,th at.section gives the commission the power to permit the constructions of crossings of a public road,highway,or street and the track of any railroad corporation.subdivision a of section further provides in relevant part that the commission has the exclusive power t o determine and prescribe the manner,including the particular point of crossing,and the terms of installation,operation,maintenance,use,and protection of each crossing of a public or publicly used road or highway by a railroad.
even more broadly,the legislature has authorized the commission to supervise and regulate every public utility in the state and to do all things,whether specifically designated in the public utilities act or in addition thereto,which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of such power and jurisdiction.additional powers and jurisdiction that the commission exercises,however,must be cognate and germane to the regulation of public utilities consumers lobby against monopolies public utilities com.cal d.more important,p ast decisions of our supreme c ourt have rejected a construction of section that would confer upon the commission powers contrary to other legislative directives,or to express restrictions placed upon the commission authority by the public utilities code.assembly public utilities com.cal th.
thus,however broad the scope of the commission authority over railroad crossings may be,the commission does not have the authority to contravene the expressed will of the legislature in this area.in the railroads view,however,that is exactly what the commission will be doing if the commission approves the city application in this case and orders the railroads to stop sounding their locomotive horns at the pedestrian rail crossings along the city beach trail.according to the railroads,section mandates the use of audible warning devices for trains approaching any and all railroad grade crossings within the state of california,including each of the san clemente pedestrian grade crossings,and it does not give the commission authority to restrict their use.
the history of section.to 
because the history of section will be relevant to our evaluation of the railroads argument or,more specifically,to the offered by the city and the commission we begin there.since,the legislature has expressly required trains to sound audible warnings at railroad crossings.in that year,as part of a n act to provide for the incorporation of railroad companies,and the management of the affairs thereof,and other matters relating thereto stats,ch,the legislature mandated that a bell,of at least twenty pounds weight,shall be placed on each locomotive engine,and be rung at a distance of at least eighty rods,mile from the place where the railroad shall cross any street,road,or highway,and be kept ringing until it shall have crossed such street,road,or highway,under a penalty of one hundred dollars for every neglect.in,that statute was codified as section of the civil code,which remained in place until,when,as part of the establishment of the public utilities code stats,ch,the provision became section of that code.stats,ch.prior to that,in,the legislature had amended the provision to permit the use of a steam whistle,air siren,or air whistle instead of a bell stats,ch.
in,the first significant change in years to the provision codified as section was proposed as senate bill.as a senate committee analysis of the bill explained,the city of roseville had asked the commission for permission to create a pilot project to install an automated horn system at two railroad crossings as an alternative to having trains sound their whistles as they approach ed the crossings.com,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,hereafter,analysis of bill.the committee analysis noted that t his automated horn system,known as a wayside horn,has the potential to reduce noise pollution because the horns are stationary,located at the crossing,and can be directed down the street as opposed to a train whistle,which sounds for about a quarter mile as a train approaches a crossing.ibid.the analysis further noted that the commission had denied roseville request for a pilot project because it found the project ran contrary to state law.ibid.
at the time,the committee analysis explained,s ome cities,including sacramento,ha d established quiet zones in which train whistles we re either banned or restricted.analysis of bill.meanwhile,t he federal railroad administration fra,the federal agency responsible for railroad safety had conducted a study of florida train whistle ban,which found that trains not sounding their whistles were far likelier to have a collision than trains which did sound their whistles.ibid.in response to that study,the fra was formulating draft regulations to limit quiet zones to areas only where supplementary safety measures we re installed,such as four quadrant gates.ibid.in fact,the federal railroad administration had begun the process of drafting rules regarding the use of locomotive horns at public grade crossings earlier in because that rulemaking was mandated by public law,which added section to title of the united states code.th at statute require d the secretary of transportation whose authority in this area has been delegated to the federal railroad administrator under cfr to issue regulations that require the use of locomotive horns at public grade crossings,but g ave the secretary the authority to make reasonable exceptions.
as enacted in august,senate bill modified sections and to authorize certain pilot projects to test the use of wayside horns in california in lieu of bells or whistles.stats,ch.specifically,the legislature added subdivision d to section,giving the commission the following additional authority 
d to authorize on an basis and supervise the operation of pilot projects to evaluate proposed crossing warning devices or new technology at designated crossings,with the consent of the local jurisdiction,the affected railroad,and other interested parties,including,but not limited to,represented railroad employees.
a the legislature finds and declares that for the communities of the state that are traversed by railroads,there is a growing need to mitigate train horn noise without compromising the safety of the public.therefore,it is the intent of the legislature that the commission may authorize pilot projects,after an application is filed and approved by the commission in at least the communities of roseville and lathrop to test the utility and safety of stationary,automated audible warning devices as an alternative to trains having to sound their horns as they approach crossings.
b in light of the pending proposed ruling by the federal railroad administration on the use of locomotive horns at all crossings across the nation,it would be in the best interest of the state for the commission to expedite the pilot projects in order to contribute data to the federal rulemaking process regarding the possible inclusion of stationary,automated warning devices as a safety measure option to the proposed federal rule.stats,ch.
consistent with the creation of these pilot projects,the legislature added a new subdivision a to section,as follows 
a the ringing of the bell or the sounding of the steam whistle,air siren,or air whistle is not required when approaching a railroad crossing that has a permanently installed audible warning device authorized by the commission that sounds automatically when an approaching train is at least feet from the place where the railroad crosses any street,road,or highway,and that keeps sounding until the lead locomotive has crossed the street,road,or highway.
b the operator of the locomotive may ring the bell or sound the steam whistle,air siren,or air whistle at crossings equipped as set forth in subparagraph a.stats,ch,
thus,the new legislation made it optional for the locomotive operators to sound their bells or whistles at crossings where the new automated wayside horns were installed.
in,section was further amended to allow the commission to authorize additional wayside horn pilot projects in fremont and newark,as well as in any other location determined to be suitable by the commission.stats,ch.at the same time,the legislature amended section to authorize the commission to approve a second pilot project involving supplementary safety measures,as defined in section a of title of the united states code,for use on rail crossings.stats,ch.the referenced federal statute defined a supplementary safety measure as a safety system or procedure,provided by the appropriate traffic control authority or law enforcement authority responsible for safety at the grade crossing,that is determined by the secretary of transportation to be an effective substitute for the locomotive horn in the prevention of casualties.com,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,quoting a.the legislature,however,included a sunset provision relating to these supplementary safety measures,specifically providing that no new pilot project of this type may be authorized after january,and requiring the commission to report on the outcome of this pilot project by march.stats,ch,see also rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.
in april,the federal railroad administration published its final rule on the use of the locomotive horns at public grade crossings.paragraph a of section of the regulations provided that with the exception of certain crossings within six counties in illinois,issuance of this part preempts any state law,rule,regulation,or order governing the sounding of the locomotive horn at public grade crossings.c,a b,definition of chicago region.paragraph a of section of the regulations provided that e xcept as provided in this part,the locomotive horn on the lead locomotive of a train,lite locomotive consist,individual locomotive,or lead cab car shall be sounded when such locomotive or lead cab car is approaching a public grade crossing.the regulations defined a locomotive horn as a locomotive air horn,steam whistle,or similar audible warning device mounted on a locomotive or control cab car.paragraph a of section of the regulations specifically provided for the sounding of the horn with two long blasts,one short blast and one long blast.paragraph b of that section dictated when the sounding must begin.ibid.sections and of the regulations provided that the routine sounding of locomotive horns was not required at private grade crossings or at pedestrian crossings and that the regulations were not intended to affect state laws regarding the routine sounding of locomotive horns at those crossings.ibid.the regulations also provided procedures and prerequisites for establishing quiet zones where locomotive horns are not required to be routinely sounded at public grade crossings,definition of quiet zone,subpart c of part,quiet zone regulations.
in april,following the enactment of the federal regulations,a california assembly bill addressing various railroad safety and maintenance issues was amended to include a provision revising section in response to the new federal regulations.assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.in its initial form,the amendment to assembly bill proposed to include within section language taken straight from the federal regulations,including the definition of a locomotive horn.assem.bill reg.sess,as amended,proposed language of,subd.a.the bill also proposed to include the following language in section regarding the required use of a locomotive horn 
b except in a quiet zone,a locomotive horn shall be sounded when a locomotive is approaching a public grade crossing in accordance with section of title of the code of federal regulations.
c except in a quiet zone,a locomotive horn shall be sounded when a locomotive is approaching a private crossing or pedestrian crossing in the same manner and circumstances that the locomotive horn would be required to be sounded pursuant to subdivision b.assem.bill reg.sess,as amended,proposed language of,subds.b c,italics deleted.
with regard to this amendment,the legislative counsel digest explained as follows 
pursuant to the frsa,the secretary of transportation has adopted regulations to provide for safety at public grade crossings,as defined,by requiring use of a locomotive horn,as defined,except in quiet zones,as defined,established and maintained in accordance with those regulations.these regulations expressly preempt any state law,rule,regulation,or order governing the sounding of locomotive horns at public grade crossings,but are not intended to affect,nor do they preempt,any state law,rule,regulation,or order governing the sounding of locomotive horns at private grade crossings,as defined,or pedestrian crossings,as defined.
this bill would delete existing state law relative to the equipping and sounding of locomotive bells and would instead require that a locomotive horn be sounded when a locomotive is approaching a public grade crossing in accordance with the regulations adopted by the secretary of transportation,except in a quiet zone.the bill would additionally require that a locomotive horn be sounded when a locomotive is approaching a private crossing or pedestrian crossing in the same manner and circumstances that the locomotive horn would be required to be sounded when a locomotive is approaching a public grade crossing.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,italics deleted.
in may,the provision in assembly bill revising section in response to the federal regulations was completely rewritten.assem.bill reg.sess,as amended may.the new proposed language did not incorporate the definition of a locomotive horn from the federal regulations or specifically provide that the sounding of a locomotive horn was required.instead,the new language read as follows 
a except as provided in paragraph,a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device shall be sounded at any public crossing in accordance with section of title of the code of federal regulations.
except as provided in paragraph,a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device shall be sounded,consistent with paragraph,at all rail crossings not subject to the requirements of subpart b commencing with section of part of title of the code of federal regulations,including private grade crossings and pedestrian crossings.
a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device shall not be sounded in those areas designated and approved by the federal railroad administration as quiet zones pursuant to subpart c commencing with section of part of title of the code of federal regulations.assem.bill reg.sess,as amended may,proposed language of,subds.a,italics deleted.
with regard to this changed language,the legislative counsel digest noted as follows this bill would delete existing state law relative to the equipping and sounding of locomotive bells and would instead require that a locomotive horn be sounded when a locomotive is approaching a public gradebell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device be sounded at any public crossing in accordance with the regulations adopted by the secretary of transportation,except in a quiet zone.the bill would additionally require that a locomotive horn be sounded when a locomotive is approaching a private crossing or pedestrian crossingbell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device be sounded at all rail crossings not subject to the requirements of the regulations adopted by the secretary of transportation,including private grade crossings and pedestrian crossings,except in a quiet zone,in the same manner and circumstances that the locomotive horn would be required to be sounded when a locomotive is approaching a public gradeas required at a public crossing.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.
in august,while assembly bill was still pending in the california legislature,the federal railroad administration amended and clarified its final rule regarding the use of locomotive horns at grade crossings in response to petitions for reconsideration and associated letters in support.as relevant here,sections and of the regulations were revised to preempt state law with respect to private grade crossings and pedestrian crossings only to the extent that state law required the sounding of a locomotive audible warning device at any of those crossings for a period of time or in a pattern different from the locomotive horn sounding requirements set forth in section.at.as a result,the amended federal regulations provide that where state law requires the sounding of a locomotive horn at private grade crossings pedestrian crossings,the locomotive horn must be sounded in accordance with section.
a week after the release of the amended federal rule,the following changes were made to the language proposed for subdivisions a and a of section in assembly bill 
except as provided in paragraph,a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device shall be sounded,consistent with paragraph,at all rail crossings not subject to the requirements of subpart b commencing with section of part of title of the code of federal regulations,including private grade crossings and pedestrian crossings.
a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device shall not be sounded in those areas designated and approved by the federal railroad administrationestablished as quiet zones pursuant to subpart c commencing with section of part of title of the code of federal regulations.assem.bill reg.sess,as amended,proposed language of,subds.a.
despite the revisions to sections and of the federal regulations providing for the limited preemption of state law governing private grade crossings and pedestrian crossings as described above,the legislative counsel digest continued to assert that the federal regulations were not intended to affect,nor do they preempt,any state law,rule,regulation,or order governing the sounding of locomotive horns at private grade crossings,as defined,or pedestrian crossings,as defined.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.
assembly bill was enacted into law on september,without further substantive changes to the provisions revising section in response to the federal regulations.accordingly,in its present form,section provides as follows 
a except as provided in paragraph,a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device shall be sounded at any public crossing in accordance with section of title of the code of federal regulations.
except as provided in paragraph,a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device shall be sounded,consistent with paragraph,at all rail crossings not subject to the requirements of subpart b commencing with section of part of title of the code of federal regulations.
a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device shall not be sounded in those areas established as quiet zones pursuant to subpart c commencing with section of part of title of the code of federal regulations.
this section does not restrict the use of a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device during an emergency or other situation authorized in section of title of the code of federal regulations.
b any railroad corporation violating this section shall be subject to a penalty of two thousand five hundred dollars for every violation.the penalty may be recovered in an action prosecuted by the district attorney of the proper county,for the use of the state.the corporation is also liable for all damages sustained by any person,and caused by its locomotives,train,or cars,when the provisions of this section are not complied with.
application of section to the present disputea.the statutory language 
with the current language of section and the history of the statute in mind,we turn to the question raised in this case whether section mandates the use of a audible warning device for a train approaching a pedestrian rail crossing in california that is not in a federally established quiet zone.we conclude it does.
subdivision a of section mandates that,except in a quiet zone established pursuant to the federal regulations,a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device shall be sounded at any public crossing in accordance with section of title of the code of federal regulations.at the same time,subdivision a of the statute mandates that,except in a quiet zone established pursuant to the federal regulations,a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device shall be sounded,consistent with paragraph,at all rail crossings not subject to the requirements of subpart b commencing with section of part of title of the code of federal regulations.
to the extent the pedestrian crossings at issue here are public crossings,by its plain language subdivision a of section mandates that an audible warning device must be sounded at those crossings in accordance with section of title of the code of federal regulations.moreover,to the extent the pedestrian crossings at issue here are not subject to the requirements of subpart b of part of title of the code of federal regulations because they are not public grade crossings,subdivision a of section likewise mandates that an audible warning device must be sounded at those crossings consistent with paragraph of subdivision a of section that is,in accordance with section of title of the code of federal regulations.thus,whether the pedestrian crossings at issue here are governed by subdivision a,subdivision a,or both,section mandates that an audible warning device must be sounded at those crossings in accordance with section of title of the code of federal regulations.
of course,this conclusion requires us to determine what it means to sound an audible warning device in accordance with section.by its plain terms,section dictates when a locomotive horn must be used at a public grade crossing.the federal regulations define a locomotive horn as a locomotive air horn,steam whistle,or similar audible warning device mounted on a locomotive or control cab car,italics added.paragraph a of section of the regulations specifically provides for the pattern of the sounding of the horn two long blasts,one short blast and one long blast.paragraph b of the section provides for the place where the sounding must begin at least seconds,but no more than seconds,before the locomotive enters the crossing,unless the locomotive is traveling in excess of miles per hour,in which case the sounding shall not begin more than mile in advance of the crossing.paragraph d of the section contains specific provisions for trains that approach a crossing after first stopping in close proximity to the crossing.and paragraph e of section provides that w here state law requires the sounding of a locomotive audible warning device other than the locomotive horn,the locomotive audible warning device shall be sounded in accordance with paragraphs b and d of this section.
the railroads argue that because sections a and a incorporate cfr for pedestrian grade crossings,section clearly requires the use of a audible warning device at those pedestrian crossings.italics added.in other words,in the railroads view,only the sounding of an audible warning device mounted on a locomotive can be considered in accordance with s ection.
the commission argues that n o language in section requires the use of a locomotive or train mounted horn and that t he terms locomotive horn or train mounted horn or any other term embodying the concept of a locomotive or train mounted horn simply do not appear anywhere in the language of section.rather,the commission argues,the actual language of section allows the use of a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device.in a similar vein,the city argues that t he clear and unambiguous language of section requiring the sounding of a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device at rail crossings contains no language limiting such audible warning devices to devices,and the railroads may not,under the guise of statutory construction,attempt to rewrite section to include a requirement to use audible warning devices where none exists.
the commission and the city are both correct on one very limited point section does not,by its own terms,expressly require the use of an audible warning device mounted on a locomotive.but the statute does expressly require the sounding of an audible warning device in accordance with s ection,and section expressly requires the sounding of a locomotive horn,which by definition means an audible warning device mounted on a locomotive or control cab car.neither the commission nor the city explains how the sounding of an audible warning device mounted at the crossing,instead of on the locomotive,can be considered in accordance with s ection,when that section of the federal regulations,by its very terms,requires the sounding of an audible warning device mounted on a locomotive.
this gap in the commission and the city argument is highlighted by the commission contention that section merely states that a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device shall be sounded that is not what section says at all.what the statute says is that a bell,siren,horn,whistle,or similar audible warning device shall be sounded in accordance with section of title of the code of federal regulations,subd.a,italics added.the commission and the city make no attempt to explain how this qualifying phrase can reasonably be understood not to encompass the express requirement in section that what must be sounded is an audible warning device mounted on a locomotive.thus,we conclude that the statutory language of section supports only one reasonable conclusion here the legislature intended to require the sounding of a audible warning device at pedestrian rail crossings in california except at those crossings located in a quiet zon
