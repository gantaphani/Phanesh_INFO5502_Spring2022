plaintiffs and appellants miriam navarrete and her minor children bryan,stephanie,and steven navarette collectively navarrete appeal from a summary judgment in favor of defendant and respondent hayley meyer on plaintiffs claims for violation of vehicle code section and civil conspiracy arising from allegations that meyer,a passenger in a vehicle,told the driver to drive at an unsafe speed over a road meyer knew had unusual conditions that would cause the car to become airborne,resulting in a fatal accident.in granting summary judgment,the trial court ruled there was no evidence to suggest meyer act of telling the driver to drive faster affected his control over the vehicle,and therefore no triable issues of material fact as to either cause of action.navarrete contends the evidence raises triable issues for a jury as to whether to impose joint liability on meyer for her conduct on the night in question on a theory of concert of action or conspiracy,and also as to whether she unreasonably interfered with the safe operation of a vehicle within the meaning of vehicle code section to support a cause of action.we agree and reverse.
factual and procedural background 
on november,meyer was the front passenger in a vehicle driven by her friend brandon coleman.another person,levi calhoun,was in the back seat.while driving to a nearby drugstore,meyer told coleman to turn onto skyview drive as a shortcut.skyview drive is a residential street with a speed limit.meyer had been on skyview drive many times before that day,and she knew it had dips that would cause a car traveling at a high rate of speed to become airborne.while coleman was making the turn onto skyview drive,meyer told him about the dips,that it was fun to drive fast on them,and that he should do it.shortly after coleman turned onto the street,meyer told coleman to go faster.coleman asked calhoun if he should speed up,and calhoun responded,you probably should because you may mess up the car.coleman sped up.he accelerated to such a degree that he caught air from the dips and lost control of the car,which veered sharply to the right and collided into navarette parked vehicle while navarrete husband,esteban soto,was attempting to put one of their children in a car seat.soto legs were severed and he was killed by the impact.a data recorder from coleman car indicated its speed was miles per hour five seconds before the impact,and miles per hour one second before the impact.meyer estimated the car speed at about miles per hour.meyer admitted it was her idea to drive fast on skyview drive.
navarette sued coleman and the county of riverside,and eventually filed a first amended complaint naming meyer as a doe defendant.she alleged,among others,causes of action against meyer for violation of vehicle code section fourth cause of action and civil conspiracy fifth cause of action.in the fourth cause of action,navarette alleged meyer willfully interfered with coleman or the mechanism of the vehicle in such manner as to affect coleman control of the car that meyer acts caused a lapse of coleman control as to cause serious injury and death and that certain physical features of skyview drive increased and intensified the dangers to the decedent and plaintiffs from coleman and meyer conduct.in the fifth cause of action for conspiracy,navarrete alleged that coleman and meyer formed an oral implied agreement to commit a wrongful act,including but not limited to driving on skyview drive at unsafe speed and s uch agreement,conspiracy,joint venture between defendants to cause wrongful acts caused injuries to plaintiffs and decedent.she alleged that the conspiracy and agreement is evidenced by the fact,inter alia,that coleman and meyer a aided,abetted,approved,ratified,deliberately and knowingly failed,refused refrained from intervening in or preventing or stopping the wrongful conduct b deliberately and knowingly failed,refused,refrained from promptly and accurately reporting such wrongful conduct.
meyer moved for summary judgment or alternatively summary adjudication.she argued navarette fourth and fifth causes of action were without merit that undisputed facts showed she did not interfere with coleman control of the vehicle as needed to impose liability under vehicle code section,and there was no evidence of a tacit agreement between her and coleman to support a conspiracy cause of action or conspiracy to commit any tort.meyer argued that simply encouraging coleman to increase his speed was insufficient to support liability under either cause of action.in opposition,navarette argued meyer was liable as a joint tortfeasor for coleman negligence under the restatement second of torts,section and as a coconspirator that meyer formulated and communicated the plan for coleman to race at high speed on skyview drive to become airborne when he hit the dips in the roadway and v erbal encouragement and solicitation to commit a wrongful act can constitute a civil conspiracy.navarette maintained the evidence demonstrated an agreement and a plan to commit the wrongful act because a s a result of and in response to meyer instructions,coleman began accelerating.according to navarette,the court could infer that coleman was trying to impress meyer and acquiesced to her wishes,and an agreement could be inferred from his actions in response to her encouragement.finally,navarette argued there were triable issues of material fact as to whether meyer unreasonably interfered with the safe operation of the vehicle within the meaning of vehicle code section by her words and actions a reasonable inference from the evidence is that as the engine roared and the vehicle started accelerating down the road,that meyer instruction to go faster was unlikely stated in a calm,sterile manner,but rather the instruction itself was animated and enthusiastic.
the trial court granted summary judgment in meyer favor.it acknowledged that the material facts were undisputed that meyer told coleman to drive faster to catch air over the dips on skyview drive,but ruled there is no evidence to suggest that meyer act of telling coleman to drive faster affected coleman control over the vehicle and thus there was no triable issue of material fact as to the fourth cause of action for violation of vehicle code section.the court applied the same reasoning to grant summary judgment on the conspiracy cause of action.
navarette filed this appeal.

ii.threshold issues 
we initially address and reject meyer argument that navarette has improperly asserted a new cause of action on appeal aiding and abetting an exhibition of speed in violation of vehicle code section and that any such claim is barred by the theory of the trial doctrine.see dicola,supra,th at an argument or theory will not be considered if it is raised for the first time on appeal a party is not permitted to change his position and adopt a new and different theory on appeal.meyer points out there is no reference to vehicle code section or the words aiding and abetting an exhibition of speed in navarette operative complaint.
meyer contention fails under the principles permitting this court to look beyond the labels of the pleadings and to the gravamen of the claim to assess whether the first amended complaint states a cause of action.because navarette alleges that meyer formed an oral implied agreement or joint venture with coleman to commit a wrongful act,including but not limited to driving on skyview drive at unsafe speed and that mayer aided or abetted the wrongful conduct,her allegations encompass such a theory notwithstanding her failure to specifically reference vehicle code section.meyer complaint need only meet requirements it must contain a statement of the facts constituting the cause of action,in ordinary and concise language and should allege ultimate facts that as a whole apprise the adversary of the factual basis of the claim.davaloo state farm ins.th,see code civ,subd.a.and navarette raised these very issues in opposition to meyer summary judgment motion,so there is no basis to claim meyer was without opportunity to address the questions in the trial court.
meyer further contends navarette aiding and abetting an exhibition of speed theory can not be considered on appeal because it is premised on a factual theory the consequences of which are open to controversy and were not put in issue or presented at the trial and are not such that they could not be altered by the presentation of additional evidence.her apparent reasoning is that the aiding and abetting theory is flatly inconsistent with navarette pleaded theory of interference with coleman operation of the vehicle she maintains interference on the one hand and aiding and abetting,on the other,are antithetical concepts involving entirely opposite states of mind and thus the theories can not coexist.meyer compares the circumstances to those in sumner hill homeowners.rio mesa holdings th.
in sumner hill,a t every step of the case sumner hill homeowners.rio mesa holdings,supra,th.at from the filing of the operative complaint to the court statement of decision after trial,the defendants argued a map violated the subdivision map act,but then in an turnabout on appeal took the entirely contrary position that the county properly approved the map,which complied with that law.id.at.the appellate court in sumner hill declined to consider the new position,reasoning it would be unfair to allow the defendants to reinvent the case on appeal and there was no opportunity for the parties or trial court to consider the ramification of such a position or how it might relate to other issues,evidence or arguments.id.at.
the theory of the trial principle of sumner hill does not apply here.the essential facts of meyer conduct and the accident are not in dispute indeed meyer conceded that for purposes of the motion,she wanted coleman to speed over the dips and she told him to do so.the trial court observed in its minute order that t he facts in this case are not disputed that meyer did tell coleman to drive faster to catch air over the speed bumps.we see nothing about the basic factual theory of navarette case that was not presented in the trial court.rather,we are to assess whether these facts support liability under any pleaded theory or cause of action so as to defeat meyer summary judgment motion.nor do we agree that a theory that meyer aided and abetted coleman wrongful speeding is antithetical to the notion that she interfered with coleman control of the vehicle.as we explain more fully below,where a passenger encourages a driver to speed on a road that the passenger knows can render the speeding car airborne,it is for a trier of fact to decide whether the passenger actions constitute interference within the meaning of vehicle code section.
iii.joint liability under concert of and abetting theory 
navarette contends that meyer is jointly liable for coleman negligent conduct under a concert of action theory as set forth in section b of the restatement second of torts and sindell abbott laboratories cal d.she maintains meyer abetted,urged and encouraged coleman to engage in the prohibited activity of unlawful exhibition of speed within the meaning of vehicle code section for the purpose of the vehicle tires losing traction and becoming airborne.relying in part on agovino kunze d agovino,she asserts meyer as a passenger owed a duty under that statute not to aid or abet coleman in such action,and is jointly liable for the consequences of such conduct.
though navarette contentions are couched on the merits,our role on summary judgment is simply to decide whether the parties possess evidence requiring the procedures of a trial.soto county of riverside th,city of oceanside superior court th.the purpose of the summary judgment procedure is not to try the issues,but merely to determine whether there are issues to be tried.orser george d.we view the evidence most favorably to navarette and ascertain whether it raises a triable issue of material fact for a jury on any cause of action reasonably alleged in the first amended complaint.undertaking that analysis,we perceive a straightforward basis to reverse the summary judgment.
legal principles 
section of the restatement second of torts provides for harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of another,one is subject to liability if he a does a tortious act in concert with the other or pursuant to a common design with him,or b knows that the other conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself,or c gives substantial assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result and his own conduct,separately considered,constitutes a breach of duty to the third person.in sindell abbott laboratories,supra,cal d,the california supreme court determined whether a complaint stated a cause of action under the restatement concert of action doctrine,and explained these principles by quoting dean prosser comment that those who,in pursuance of a common plan or design to commit a tortious act,actively take part in it,or further it by cooperation or request,or who lend aid or encouragement to the wrongdoer,or ratify and adopt his acts done for their benefit,are equally liable with him.express agreement is not necessary,and all that is required is that there be a tacit understanding sindell,at,quoting prosser,law of torts ed.
the concert of action theory of group liability may be used to impose liability on a person who did not personally cause the harm to plaintiff,but whose advice or encouragement to act operates as a moral support to a tortfeasor,and if the act encouraged is known to be tortious,it has the same effect upon the liability of the adviser as participation or physical assistance.if the encouragement or assistance is a substantial factor in causing the resulting tort,the one giving it is himself a tortfeasor and is responsible for the consequences of the other act.cadlo owens illinois,th,quoting chavers gatke th.the doctrine is likened to aiding and abetting.see saunders superior court th,describing concert of action theory under the restatement as aiding and abetting fiol doellstedt th,referencing the restatement second of torts,section in describing aiding and abetting liability casey bank national ass th,gerard ross d,in the civil arena,an aider and abettor is called a cotortfeasor.
courts have applied the concert of and abetting principles in various civil contexts,including the drag race and like cases,opinions in which courts held the reciprocal inciting and encouraging one another to drive at a fast and reckless rate of speed furnished the necessary proximate cause to support joint and several liability of both racers,including the defendant whose car did not strike the plaintiff.chavers gatke,supra,th at.
agovino,supra,d is one such case.there,a defendant joint liability was predicated on his participation in a drag race with a third party,gary miner,even though the defendant vehicle did not contact the car in which the plaintiff was a passenger.id.at.the appellate court reversed a nonsuit granted at the close of the plaintiff case,stating it was for the jury to determine the manner of defendant driving and whether the same was done in concert with gary miner.the evidence,both direct and circumstantial,is substantial and if believed by the jury is more than sufficient to prove that,both immediately before and at the time of the collision,defendant was racing his vehicle with the car involved in the collision in violation of vehicle code section,former vehicle code section,thus establishing a prima facie case of negligence as a matter of law.that section provides that n o person shall engage in any motor vehicle speed contest or exhibition of speed on a highway and no person shall aid or abet in any such motor vehicle speed contest or exhibition on any highway.factually,the record at this stage of the trial contains sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant was engaged in and aided and abetted in an unlawful speed contest with gary miner,along laurel grove avenue through the erwin street intersection,at the time of the collision between the parker and miner cars.defendant was familiar with the neighborhood he knew that the two streets intersected at a point surrounded by the activity of residents who lived in the area,and adults and children who frequented the nearby park and that laurel grove avenue along which he raced his car was intersected by various residential cross streets,and had located thereon victory van owen park in which children played and picnicked.id.at.the appellate court also determined there was enough evidence of proximate cause to submit the case to the jury w hether the two boys,in so many words agreed to race,or from their conduct a tacit mutual understanding of such an agreement may be inferred,the collision with gary miner car nevertheless occurred during the time they were engaged in racing each other.the fact the defendant automobile did not actually come into contact with the plaintiff car is of little importance on the issue of proximate cause.id.at.the court analogized the circumstances to a criminal manslaughter case stemming from two codefendants racing separate cars in which one defendant killed the plaintiff and the other moved on there,the evidence was sufficient to show that the defendants were not acting independently of each other,and that they were jointly engaged in a series of acts which led directly to the collision.id.at,quoting people kemp d.
b.the evidence raises triable issues of fact as to joint liability stemming from coleman engaging in,and meyer aiding and abetting,an exhibition of speed 
we see little to distinguish the facts of this case from those in agovino,supra,d.construed most favorably to navarette,the evidence shows that in response to meyer urging,coleman deliberately accelerated his vehicle to well over skyview drive mile per hour speed limit for the specific purpose of rendering it airborne such that the tires left the roadway and lost traction,causing the fatal collision.indeed,the fact meyer was a passenger in coleman vehicle rather than driving a separate car strengthens the inference that she encouraged and incited him,and that they jointly engaged in a series of acts that led directly to the collision with navarette vehicle.agovino,at.meyer was familiar with skyview drive and its unique characteristics,and a reasonable fact finder could readily infer she knew other vehicles could be parked or other people would be present on such a residential street.meyer attempts to distinguish agovino on grounds there was no race in this case and her conduct as a passenger by itself would not and could not have caused injury to anyone.but meyer encouragement to coleman to speed from within coleman car is not materially different from that of a separate driver encouraging and engaging in a race,and her assertion that she could not cause injury because she was merely a passenger,is the very argument rejected by agovino and other concert of action cases.
meyer additionally argues that the evidence does not show coleman engaged in an exhibition of speed that the only reasonable inference is that he lost traction because he wanted to become airborne over some dips in the road and t here is no evidence that he intended to show off a fast car to his passengers or to anyone else at night in a residential neighborhood.we disagree with meyer characterization of the statute and view of the facts.
an early case addressed what the legislature meant by exhibition of speed within the meaning of vehicle code section webster new international dictionary,edition,defines exhibition as an act or instance of exhibiting for inspection,or of holding forth to view manifestation display.thus it would appear that the section could be violated by one person displaying the speed of his vehicle on the highway to another person in the first person car or in another car.in re harvill d,italics added.in harvill,the appellate court held that a trier of fact could reasonably infer that a driver who was revving up his engine and speeding at a rate of miles per hour was exhibiting or displaying the speed of his car to the female occupants of another car.id.at.
in people grier d,the appellate court addressed a defendant contention that the evidence was insufficient to show an exhibition of speed within the meaning of the statute where a police officer testified that during a turn,the defendant vehicle tires peeled,screeching,losing traction with the roadway.id.at.the grier court affirmed,stating it is common knowledge that maximum control of a vehicle upon the highway is maintained through the retention of traction between tires and pavement and that,during any process of skidding of the wheels of a vehicle,there is a corresponding diminution of the driver control over the vehicle.accordingly,safety measures are designed to reduce the skidding of vehicles,even during the process of reducing speed through the application of brakes.citation.where a person accelerates a vehicle in such manner as to deliberately cause it to skid,he is not only diminishing his control but increasing the hazard to bystanders or other vehicles from flying gravel.whether the action is deliberate or not is for the trier of fact under the circumstances of the particular case.obviously,not all cases of tire peeling or screeching would constitute violations of the statute.it is also common knowledge that the deliberate screeching and screaming of tires on the pavement are tension producers which increase nervousness in drivers and others,thereby increasing the likelihood of accident.id.at,italics added.the grier court defined an exhibition of speed broadly,holding that the observer of the exhibition did not need to be known to the defendant or be coupled with the defendant intent to impress the observer with the speed obtained,and because the defendant display took place in a highly developed and populated area,there was sufficient evidence to infer observation by some person or persons.id.at.
the evidence here permits a reasonable jury to infer that coleman accelerated the vehicle at meyer request so meyer and possibly calhoun could observe and experience the car gain air,as she had experienced in past trips along that road.this conduct manifestly comes within the ambit of an exhibition of speed under harvill,grier,and vehicle code section.
nor do we agree with meyer contention that there is no evidence she aided and abetted coleman.her claim is premised on the assertion that the law in california does not permit liability for aiding and abetting unintentional conduct that navarette alleged no intentional tort,only that coleman acted negligently,and there is no evidence he intended to harm anyone.she argues,even if coleman inadvertently violated the law against an exhibition of speed,which he did not,meyer could not be liable for aiding and abetting such unintentional conduct.however,for purposes of joint liability under a concert of action theory,it suffices that meyer assist or encourage coleman breach of a duty,which vehicle code section imposed upon him and also upon her not to aid and abet coleman.agovino,supra,d see also orser george,supra,d at stueve.farms,llc berger kahn th civil liability for aiding and abetting commission of a tort has no overlaid requirement of an independent duty,but focuses on whether a defendant knowingly gave substantial assistance to someone who performed wrongful conduct,mayhugh county of orange d,one may be held jointly liable where his or her negligence in concurrence with the negligence of another has caused a single injury staples hoefke d,to establish that a defendant is a joint tortfeasor,it must be shown the defendant proceeded tortiously with intent or negligence.
iv.civil conspiracy 
navarette further contends meyer is jointly liable based on civil conspiracy,which can arise from v erbal encouragement and solicitation to commit a wrongful act that meyer formulated and communicated the plan for coleman to illegally race at high speed on skyview drive to become airborne when he hit the dips in the roadway and the evidence demonstrates an agreement and plan between them to commit the wrongful act.
civil conspiracy is not an independent cause of action.applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,applied equipment kenne stennis th.instead,it is a theory of legal liability under which certain defendants may be held liable for an independent civil wrong rusheen cohen cal th,see also applied equipment,at doctors superior court cal d,committed by others.a participant in the conspiracy effectively adopts as his or her own the torts of other coconspirators within the ambit of the conspiracy.see applied equipment,at.the elements of an action for civil conspiracy are the formation and operation of the conspiracy and damage resulting to plaintiff from an act or acts done in furtherance of the common design in such an action the major significance of the conspiracy lies in the fact that it renders each participant in the wrongful act responsible as a joint tortfeasor for all damages ensuing from the wrong,irrespective of whether or not he was a direct actor and regardless of the degree of his activity.id.at.the essence of the claim is that it is merely a mechanism for imposing vicarious liability each member of the conspiracy becomes liable for all acts done by others pursuant to the conspiracy,and for all damages caused thereby.stueve.farms,llc berger kahn,supra,th at.
under a conspiracy theory of recovery,liability depends on the actual commission of a tort.see applied equipment,supra,cal th at richard levine,higashi,supra,th at kidron movie acquisition th,t he basis of a civil conspiracy is the formation of a group of two or more persons who have agreed to a common plan or design to commit a tortious act.liability presupposes that the coconspirator is legally capable of committing the tort,that he or she owes a duty to plaintiff recognized by law and is potentially subject to liability for breach of that duty.applied equipment,at.and for conspiracy liability,the conspiring defendants must have actual knowledge that a tort is planned and concur in the scheme with knowledge of its unlawful purpose.kidron,at.knowledge of the planned tort must be combined with intent to aid in its commission.ibid.an agreement may be tacit as well as express.citation.a conspirator concurrence in the scheme may be inferred from the nature of the acts done,the relation of the parties,the interests of the alleged conspirators,and other circumstances.arei ii cases th.
we can not say on meyer summary judgment showing that the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support joint liability on a theory of civil conspiracy.as we view it,the evidence raises a triable issue for a jury as to meyer liability on such a theory.critically,the law imposed on meyer personally an independent duty not to encourage or assist coleman in engaging in an unlawful exhibition of speed.and for purposes of civil conspiracy,the source of substantive liability arises out of a preexisting legal duty and its breach,and it makes no difference in the analysis whether the underlying duty is imposed by statute or by the common law.chavers gatke,supra,th at,citing in part doctor superior court,supra,cal d involving alleged conspiracy to violate insurance code section.
meyer advances several arguments as to why the facts can not support her liability based on a conspiracy.though she correctly points out there is no independent cause of action for conspiracy,meyer asserts any such claim must have an underlying illegal act.meyer further argues that a conspiracy can be formed only by parties already under a legal duty to the plaintiff,and that navarette has not identified any duty that meyer,as a passenger,owed to third persons standing by the roadside.we have already concluded meyer had an independent duty under vehicle code section,which a reasonable jury can find was violated by coleman and meyer actions.that duty inures to bystanders and other vehicles on the roadways.see,people grier,supra,d at.and the cases make clear the parties need only expressly or tacitly agree to commit a tort or civil wrong,which in this case is met by evidence raising a fact issue whether coleman and meyer agreed that coleman should engage in an exhibition of speed.meyer encouragement to coleman to exceed the speed limit on skyview drive,a street with unique dangers,was clearly wrong.the sort of injury that ensued from coleman unlawful conduct the car losing traction or control and striking another vehicle or person on the residential street was foreseeable,and is the very sort of harm the statute was designed to prevent.accord,michael jeffrey d,analyzing whether duty of care to third parties was owed by individuals encouraging their friend to shoot a marble with a slingshot at another minor the complaint sounded in conspiracy and there was a triable issue of fact as to whether the shooter friends actively encouraged,solicited,or conspired to injure the plaintiff in violation of penal code section,subdivision f as to constitute negligence per se.
meyer finally argues,relying on federal or authorities,that beca
