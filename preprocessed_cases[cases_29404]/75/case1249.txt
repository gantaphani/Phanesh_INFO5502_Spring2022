government code section requires that certain state agencies notify parties who may appear before them of their right to an interpreter at hearings conducted by the agencies.section also requires that the affected agencies give notice of the right to an interpreter at the same time that each party is advised of the hearing date.
in this case,the department of motor vehicles dmv an agency subject to the provisions of section,pursuant to section,subdivision a notified carlos leal that he had a right to an interpreter at an administrative hearing admin per se hearing at which the propriety of the suspension of his driver license would be adjudicated.however,dmv did not notify him of that right at the same time it notified him of the hearing date.instead,it did so at an earlier point in leal was arrested for driving under the influence and was issued a notice of of his license by the arresting officer,oakland police officer eric lewis.
as detailed below,we conclude that dmv failure to inform leal of his right to an interpreter at the time it notified him of the date of his admin per se hearing constitutes a violation of section.however,we also conclude that the error was harmless.nonetheless,we express our concern that dmv has reportedly not modified the form by which it provides notice of hearing dates to conform to the dictates of section.we further reject leal claim that the notice of a right to an interpreter included in the notice of issued on the night of leal arrest was defective because it was printed only in english.finally,we reject leal claim that the administrative record created by dmv was inadequate for purposes of trial court and appellate review.
in officer lewis report regarding leal arrest,he indicated that,on march,at around,he saw leal driving at a high rate of speed on macarthur boulevard in oakland.officer lewis pulled leal over and approached the car.he smelled a strong odor of alcohol on leal breath.leal displayed an unsteady gait after exiting the car and failed several field sobriety tests.officer lewis asked leal to recite his abc in english or spanish,but he could not complete them in either language.leal refused to take any other tests.officer lewis served leal with an age and older administrative per se order and temporary driver license admin per se suspension order a standard dmv form.the order notified leal that his license would be suspended for his refusal to take a chemical test unless he sought a hearing within days of his arrest.leal sought a hearing,which was held on may.
the admin per se hearing was by hearing officer gina madlangbayan.the hearing officer indicated that four issues were to be decided at the hearing did officer lewis have reasonable cause to believe that leal was driving under the influence when he arrested him was leal lawfully arrested was leal told that his license would be suspended for one year or revoked for two or three years if he refused to take a chemical test and did leal refuse or fail to take a chemical test after being asked to do so by officer lewis the hearing officer admitted the police report and the admin per se suspension order into evidence.officer lewis then testified in conformity with his report described above.he specifically stated that leal refused to take a breath test and failed to respond when asked if he would take a blood test.officer lewis informed leal that his refusal would result in the suspension of his license for one year.leal did not respond.
leal testified that he did not refuse to take any field tests and believed that he performed them well.he told officer lewis that he did not know the entire alphabet in english so,officer lewis asked him to recite the alphabet in spanish.officer lewis said that he did not complete the alphabet in spanish.leal argued that lewis would not know if he did so or not because lewis does not speak spanish.the hearing officer then asked if he refused to take a breath test.leal replied i refused after this i wo i refused and i never answered no,because the way he treat me at the transcription unclear on the.the hearing officer asked again if leal had refused the test,and leal stated i refused.i refused.i refused because he said if you do the test,then it possible you can go home or he already told was telling me i was wrong from the transcription unclear.so and i rest of response not transcribed due to overlap with hearing officer next question.when asked why he refused,leal testified because the way he was treating me the whole time because he says look,he says uh,well,you did pass this,you drunk.so,i said i did know i had to take a test transcription unclear so i refused rest of answer unclear.when the hearing officer asked if he were claiming that officer lewis never read him the admonition that his license would be suspended if he did not take a chemical test,leal stated i think he did that.however,leal claimed that,by that point,he was no longer paying attention.he said that he was not paying attention because,by the time the admonition was read,he was mad.at the end of the hearing,the hearing officer asked if leal understood that his refusal to take a chemical test was going to result in his license being suspended for a year,and leal replied that he understood.later that day,madlangbayan issued formal findings,supporting leal license suspension from may,through may.
leal petitioned for a writ of administrative mandate.leal supported the petition with a declaration in which he stated that his primary language is spanish he can understand some english if it is spoken slowly.he stated that the officer recited the admonition about having his license suspended if he did not take a chemical test very quickly in english.he could not keep up with what was being said.that is why he said at the hearing that he could not pay attention to what the officer was saying.he also stated that he gave no answer to officer lewis request that he take a breath test.prior to the hearing on the petition,leal filed supplemental points and authorities,asserting that he had been denied his statutory right to an interpreter at the admin per se hearing due to dmv failure to give him notice of the right to request an interpreter.he also contended that he was entitled to have the license suspension lifted because dmv failed to provide a complete record of the admin per se hearing for purposes of the writ petition.
the trial court issued a tentative ruling denying leal petition.when leal did not challenge the tentative ruling,the court issued an order denying the petition,and judgment was entered in conformity with the order.
ii.discussion 
dmv failure to comply with the requirements of section constitutes harmless error 
section provides every agency subject to the language assistance requirement of this article shall advise each party of the right to an interpreter at the same time that each party is advised of the hearing date each party in need of an interpreter shall also be encouraged to give timely notice to the agency conducting the hearing so that appropriate arrangements can be made.plainly,section requires simultaneous notice of a party hearing date and his or her right to an interpreter at the hearing.at oral argument,dmv conceded that its notice did not meet the requirements of section because the notice was not given at the same time that leal was advised of the hearing date.however,that concession is only the first step in determining whether or not leal is entitled to reversal.indeed,pursuant to article vi,section of the california constitution,n o judgment shall be set aside in any cause,for any error as to any matter of procedure,unless,after an examination of the entire cause,including the evidence,the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.here,both the legislative intent embodied in section and the evidence presented in support of leal petition for a writ of administrative mandate persuade us that dmv violation of section did not result in a miscarriage of justice.
the most significant rule to follow in interpreting a statute is ascertaining the intent of the leg
