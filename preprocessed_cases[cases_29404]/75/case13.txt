george corson worked as a welder and machinist for a railroad carrier.after retirement,corson was diagnosed with mesothelioma.he and his wife,a petitioner here,sued respondents railroad friction products corporation and viad corp in state court,claiming injury from corson exposure to asbestos in locomotives and locomotive parts distributed by respondents.the corsons alleged claims of defective design and failure to warn of the dangers posed by asbestos.after corson died,petitioner kurns,executrix of his estate,was substituted as a party.respondents removed the case to the federal district court,which granted them summary judgment,ruling that the claims were by the locomotive inspection act lia,et.the third circuit affirmed.
held petitioners and claims fall within the field of locomotive equipment regulation by the lia,as that field was defined in napier atlantic coast line.
a the lia provides that a railroad carrier may use or allow to be used a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only when the locomotive or tender and its parts or appurtenances are in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury,have been inspected as required by the lia and regulations prescribed thereunder by the secretary of transportation,and can withstand every test prescribed under the lia by the secretary.see.
b congress may expressly state law.but even without an express provision,state law must yield to a congressional act to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute,see crosby national foreign trade council,or when the federal statute scope indicates that congress intended federal law to occupy a field exclusively,see freightliner myrick.this case involves only the latter,field.
c in napier,this court held two state laws prescribing the use of locomotive equipment by the lia,concluding that the broad power conferred by the lia on the interstate commerce commission the agency then vested with authority to carry out the lia requirements was a general one that extends to the design,the construction and the material of every part of the locomotive and tender and of all appurtenances.at.the court rejected the states contention that the scope of the field was to be determined by the object sought through legislation,rather than the physical elements affected by it,at,and found it dispositive that t he federal and state statutes are directed to the same subject the equipment of locomotives.ibid.
d the federal railroad safety act of frsa did not alter the lia scope.by its terms,the frsa which instructs that t he secretary of transportation shall prescribe regulations and issue orders for every area of railroad safety supplementing laws and regulations in effect on october,a does not alter federal railroad safety statutes.rather,it leaves those statutes intact and authorizes the secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety with supplemental regulation.because the lia was already in effect when the frsa was enacted,the frsa left the lia,and its scope as defined by napier,intact.
e petitioners do not argue that napier should be overruled.instead,petitioners contend that their claims fall outside the lia field,as it was defined in napier.petitioners arguments are unpersuasive.first,the argument that the field does not extend to claims arising from the repair or maintenance of locomotives is inconsistent with napier holding that congress,in enacting the lia,manifest ed the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment.at.second,the argument that petitioners claims are not because they do not base liability on the design or manufacture of a product ignores that a claim alleges that the product itself is defective unless accompanied by sufficient warnings or instructions.because petitioners claims are therefore directed at the equipment of locomotives,they fall within the field defined by napier.third,the argument that petitioners claims are not because manufacturers were not regulated under the lia when corson was exposed to asbestos is inconsistent with napier,which defined the field on the basis of the physical elements regulated,not on the basis of the entity directly subject to regulation.finally,contrary to petitioners argument,the lia scope is not limited to state legislation or regulation but extends to state duties and standards of care directed to the subject of locomotive equipment.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
this case requires us to determine whether petitioners tort claims for defective design and failure to warn are by the locomotive inspection act lia,et.the united states court of appeals for the third circuit determined that petitioners claims fall within the field by that act,as that field was defined by this court decision in napier atlantic coast line.we agree.
george corson was employed as a welder and machinist by the chicago,milwaukee,paul pacific railroad from until.corson worked in locomotive repair and maintenance facilities,where his duties included installing brakeshoes on locomotives and stripping insulation from locomotive boilers.in,corson was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma.
in,corson and his wife filed suit in pennsylvania state court against defendants,including respondents railroad friction products corporation rfpc and viad corp viad.according to the complaint,rfpc distributed locomotive brakeshoes containing asbestos,and viad was the to a company that manufactured and sold locomotives and locomotive engine valves containing asbestos.corson alleged that he handled this equipment and that he was injured by exposure to asbestos.the complaint asserted claims that the equipment was defectively designed because it contained asbestos,and that respondents failed to warn of the dangers of asbestos or to provide instructions regarding its safe use.after the complaint was filed,corson passed away,and the executrix of his estate,gloria kurns,was substituted as a party.corson widow and the executrix are petitioners here.
respondents removed the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania and moved for summary judgment.respondents argued that petitioners claims were by the lia.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment for respondents.see kurns chesterton,civ.action ed,app.to pet.for cert.the third circuit affirmed.see kurns chesterton.we granted certiorari.
congress enacted the predecessor to the lia,the boiler inspection act bia,in.the bia made it unlawful to use a steam locomotive unless the boiler of said locomotive and appurtenances thereof are in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary peril to life or limb.act of,ch,stat.in,congress amended the bia to apply to the entire locomotive and tender and all parts and appurtenances thereof.act of,ch,stat.the bia as amended became commonly known as the locomotive inspection act.as relevant here,the lia provides 
a railroad carrier may use or allow to be used a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only when the locomotive or tender and its parts and appurtenances 
are in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury 
have been inspected as required under this chapter and regulations prescribed by the secretary of transportation under this chapter and 
can withstand every test prescribed by the secretary under this chapter.
the issue presented in this case is whether the lia petitioners claims that respondents defectively designed locomotive parts and failed to warn corson of dangers associated with those parts.in light of this court prior decision in napier,supra,we conclude that petitioners claims are.
the supremacy clause provides that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.art.vi,cl.of state law thus occurs through the direct operation of the supremacy clause.brown hotel employees.congress may,of course,expressly state law,but e ven without an express provision for preemption,we have found that state law must yield to a congressional act in at least two circumstances.crosby national foreign trade council.first,state law is naturally preempted to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute.ibid.second,we have deemed state law when the scope of a federal statute indicates that congress intended federal law to occupy a field exclusively.freightliner myrick.we deal here only with the latter,field.
we do not,however,address the lia effect on a clean slate,because this court addressed that issue years ago in napier.in that case,railroads challenged two state laws that prohibit ed use within the state of locomotives not equipped with certain prescribed devices,on the ground that the interstate commerce commission icc,the agency then vested with the authority to carry out the lia requirements,had not required the devices in question,at.in response,the states argued that their requirements were not because they were directed at a different objective than the lia,at.according to the states,their regulations were intended to protect railroad workers from sickness and disease,whereas the federal regulation endeavors solely to prevent accidental injury in the operation of trains.ibid.
to determine whether the state requirements were,this court asked whether the lia manifest s the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment.at.the court answered that question in the affirmative,stating that t he broad scope of the authority conferred upon the icc by congress in the lia led to that conclusion,at.the power delegated to the icc,the court explained,was a general one that extends to the design,the construction and the material of every part of the locomotive and tender and of all appurtenances.at.
the court rejected the states contention that the scope of the field was to be determined by the object sought through the legislation,rather than the physical elements affected by it.at.the court found it dispositive that t he federal and the state statutes are directed to the same subject the equipment of locomotives.ibid.because the states requirements operated upon the same physical elements as the lia,the court held that the state laws,however commendable or however different their purpose,at,fell within the lia field.
against the backdrop of napier,petitioners advance two arguments in support of their position that their claims related to the use of asbestos in locomotive equipment do not fall within the lia field.petitioners first contend that napier no longer defines the scope of the lia field because that field has been narrowed by a subsequently enacted federal statute.alternatively,petitioners argue that their claims do not fall within the lia field,even as that field was defined by napier.we address each of petitioners arguments in turn.
first,petitioners suggest that the federal railroad safety act of frsa,stat.codified at et,altered the lia scope.the frsa grants the secretary of transportation broad regulatory authority over railroad safety.see a.petitioners point to the frsa provision,which provides in part that a state may adopt or continue in force a law,regulation,or order related to railroad safety until the secretary of transportation prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the subject matter of the state requirement.a,supp.iii.according to petitioners,the frsa provision supplanted the lia of the field,with the result that petitioners claims are not because the secretary has not issued a regulation or order addressing the use of asbestos in locomotives or locomotive parts.
petitioners reliance on the frsa is misplaced.the frsa instructs that t he secretary of transportation,as necessary,shall prescribe regulations and issue orders for every area of railroad safety supplementing laws and regulations in effect on october.a ed.emphasis added.by its terms,the frsa does not alter federal statutes on railroad safety.rather,it leaves existing statutes intact,and authorizes the secretary to fill interstitial areas of railroad safety with supplemental regulation.marshall burlington northern,kennedy.because the lia was already in effect when the frsa was enacted,we conclude that the frsa left the lia,and its scope as defined by napier,intact.
since the lia scope remains unaltered,petitioners must contend with napier.petitioners do not ask us to overrule napier and thus do not seek to overcome the presumption of stare decisis that attaches to this precedent.see appliances,seb,slip,at noting the special force of the doctrine of stare decisis with regard to questions of statutory interpretation internal quotation marks omitted.instead,petitioners advance several arguments aimed at demonstrating that their claims fall outside of the field by the lia,as it was defined in napier.each is unpersuasive.
petitioners,along with the solicitor general as amicus curiae,first argue that petitioners claims do not fall within the lia field because the claims arise out of the repair and maintenance of locomotives,rather than the use of locomotives on a railroad line.specifically,they contend that the scope of the field by the lia is coextensive with the scope of the federal government regulatory authority under the lia,which,they argue,does not extend to the regulation of hazards arising from the repair or maintenance of locomotives.therefore,the argument goes,claims arising from repair or maintenance as opposed to claims arising from use on the line do not fall within the field.
we reject this attempt to redefine the field.in napier,the court held that congress,in enacting the lia,manifest ed the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment,and the court did not distinguish between hazards arising from repair and maintenance as opposed to those arising from use on the line,at.the field as defined by napier plainly encompasses the claims at issue here.petitioners claims for defective design and failure to warn are aimed at the equipment of locomotives.because those claims are directed to the same subject as the lia,napier dictates that they fall within the field,at.
petitioners further argue that,even if their claims are,their claims do not suffer the same fate.in their complaint,petitioners alleged in closely related claims that respondents negligently failed to warn of the risks associated with asbestos and to provide instructions concerning safeguards for working with asbestos and that the asbestoscontaining products were defective because respondents failed to give sufficient warnings or instructions concerning the risks,dangers,and harm inherent in said asbestos products.see app,see also brief for petitioners.according to petitioners,these claims do not fall within the lia field because t he basis of liability for failure to warn is not the design or manufacture of a product,but is instead the failure to provide adequate warnings regarding the product risks.reply brief for petitioners.
we disagree.a claim alleges that the product itself is unlawfully dangerous unless accompanied by sufficient warnings or instructions.restatement third of torts products liability c a claim alleges that a product is defective when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable instructions or warnings by the seller or other distributor,and the omission of the instructions or warnings renders the product not reasonably safe see also,comment l,at reasonable designs and instructions or warnings both play important roles in the production and distribution of reasonably safe products thus,the gravamen of petitioners claims is still that corson suffered harmful consequences as a result of his exposure to asbestos contained in locomotive parts and appurtenances.at.because petitioners claims are therefore directed at the equipment of locomotives,they fall within the field defined by napier,at 
petitioners also contend that their claims against manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts fall outside of the lia field because manufacturers were not regulated under the lia at the time that corson was allegedly exposed to asbestos.petitioners point out that the lia,as originally enacted in the bia,subjected only common carriers to civil penalties.act of,stat.it was not until,well after the events of this case,that the lia penalty provision was revised to apply to a ny person violating the lia.rail safety improvement act of,a,stat.see also b amending penalty provision to provide that an act by an individual that causes a railroad to be in violation shall be deemed a violation 
this argument fails for the same reason as the two preceding arguments it is inconsistent with napier.napier defined the field by the lia on the basis of the physical elements regulated the equipment of locomotives not on the basis of the entity directly subject to regulation,at.because petitioners claims are directed at the equipment of locomotives,they fall within the field.
petitioners proposed rule is also contrary to common sense.under petitioners approach,a state could not require railroads to equip their locomotives with parts meeting specifications,but could require manufacturers of locomotive parts to produce only parts meeting those specifications.we rejected a similar approach in an express context in engine mfrs.south coast air quality management.there,a state entity argued that its rules prohibiting the purchase or lease of vehicles that failed to meet stringent emissions requirements were not by the clean air act,a,because the rules in question were aimed at the purchase of vehicles,rather than their manufacture or sale,at.we observed,however,that treating sales restrictions and purchase restrictions differently for purposes would make no sense,because the manufacturer right to sell federally approved vehicles is meaningless in the absence of a purchaser right to buy them.at.similarly,a railroad ability to equip its fleet of locomotives in compliance with federal standards is meaningless if manufacturers are not allowed to produce locomotives and locomotive parts that meet those standards.petitioners claims thus do not avoid simply because they are aimed at the manufacturers of locomotives and locomotive parts.
finally,petitioners contend that the lia scope does not extend to state claims,as opposed to state legislation or regulation.petitioners note that a preempted field does not necessarily include state common law.brief for petitioners citing silkwood,sprietsma mercury marine.napier,however,held that the lia occup ied the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment to the exclusion of state regulation,at.that categorical conclusion admits of no exception for state duties and standards of care.as we have recognized,state regulation can be effectively exerted through an award of damages,and t he obligation to pay compensation can be,indeed is designed to be,a potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy.san diego building trades council garmon.riegel med tronic,absent other indication,reference to a state requirements in a federal express provision includes its duties we therefore conclude that state duties and standards of care directed to the subject of locomotive equipment are by the lia.
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that petitioners and claims fall within the field of locomotive equipment regulation by the lia,as that field was defined in napier.accordingly,the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.
it is so ordered.

justice kagan,concurring.
like justice sotomayor,post,at opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part,i doubt this court would decide napier atlantic coast line,in the same way today.the napier court concluded that congress had manifest ed the intention to occupy the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment,based on nothing more than a statute granting regulatory authority over that subject matter to a federal agency,at.under our more recent cases,congress must do much more to oust all of state law from a field.see,new york state of social servs.dublino,rejecting preemption even though congress had enacted a detailed and comprehensive regulatory scheme.viewed through the lens of modern preemption law,napier is an anachronism.
but napier governs so long as congress lets it and that decision provides a straightforward way to determine whether state laws relating to locomotive equipment are preempted.according to napier,the scope of the agency power under the locomotive inspection act lia determines the boundaries of the preempted field.see,at state regulations were preempted because they fell within the scope of the authority delegated to the commission see also ante,at the broad scope of the authority given to the agency led to napier conclusion post,at t he field is congruent with the regulated field and under that test,none of the claims at issue here can survive.
all of us agree that the petitioners claims are preempted.napier recognized the federal agency delegated authority over the design,the construction and the material of every part of the locomotive.at.in doing so,napier did not distinguish between hazards arising from repair and maintenance of the parts and hazards stemming from their use on the line.ante,at.the agency thus has authority to regulate the design of locomotive equipment like the brakeshoes here to prevent either danger.and that fact resolves the preemption question.because the agency could have banned use of the brakeshoes as designed,the petitioners claims which would effectively accomplish the identical result fall within the preempted field.
so too the petitioners claims,and for the same reason.napier did not specifically address warnings,because the case in no way involved them.but if an agency has the power to prohibit the use of locomotive equipment,it also has the power to condition the use of that equipment on proper warnings.and that is so,contrary to justice sotomayor view,see post,at,whether the warning is engraved into the part itself or posted on the workshop wall.here,for example,the agency need not have chosen between banning brakeshoes and leaving them entirely unregulated.it could instead have required a warning about how to handle those brakeshoes safely.if,say,a mask would have protected a worker from risk,then the agency could have demanded a notice to that effect.see,law general motors,as for warning requirements,these too are within the scope of the agency authority scheiding general motors,cal,same and because the agency could have required warnings about the equipment use,the petitioners claims,no less than their claims,are preempted under napier.
i understand these views to comport with the court opinion in this case,and i accordingly join it in full.
