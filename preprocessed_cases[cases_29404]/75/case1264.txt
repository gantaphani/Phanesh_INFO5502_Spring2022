this case presents an issue concerning federal preemption of state negligence claims against airlines.more specifically,the claim at issue alleges injury related to the storage of baggage in an overhead bin.similar questions have been litigated throughout the country,with various results.there is,for instance,a page american law reports note entitled liability of air carrier for injury to passenger caused by fall of object from overhead baggage compartment.annot.see also kelly,federalism in flight preemption doctrine and air crash litigation trans.after a review of the relevant statutes and case law,we conclude that the plaintiff and appellant here,arlene vinnick,can proceed on her negligence claim against respondent delta airlines.the judgment is thus reversed.
vinnick boarded a delta plane at about.she took her seat,an aisle seat.she fell asleep,but woke when another passenger luggage hit her on the head.she sued delta and the other passenger,karen ballard,for negligence,alleging that they negligently placed,stored and stowed and allowed to be placed,stored and stowed luggage in the overhead compartment,and said luggage fell upon plaintiff.
as to delta,vinnick alleged a breach of california common carrier standard of care under civil code section delta moved for summary judgment on the ground that there was no evidence that it had violated that standard of care,that the state standard did not apply because the matter was preempted by federal law,and that vinnick had not alleged a breach of the federal standard of care.
at summary judgment,both parties submitted ballard deposition testimony describing the accident.ballard was a passenger.she got on the plane with a book bag,which she was told could go under her seat,and a bag.she looked for overhead storage for her bag.as she opened the door of an overhead bin,a bag in that bin began to fall out.she reached up to prevent that bag from falling,and her own bag,which she was holding at about,slipped and made contact with vinnick.ballard was then able to put her bag in the overhead compartment,where it fit without difficulty.she did not ask a flight attendant for assistance at any time during the flight.
in addition to the facts just described,delta proposed as undisputed that ballard bag was within the size and weight limitations for baggage.that proposed fact was supported by ballard testimony regarding the bag weight,and by a portion of her deposition in which counsel measured the bag and determined that it was inches wide,inches tall,and inches thick.these facts were also supported by the declaration of gary corn,delta manager of airport passenger services at los angeles international airport,and portions of the delta standard practice manual,which generally hold that delta employees should size baggage to ensure that no bag is larger than the size wise box,which measures by by inches,and that bags may weigh no more than pounds each.
vinnick proposed as undisputed that delta was a common carrier subject to civil code section,and that delta own guidelines imposed a duty of care for ensuring the proper storage of all baggage.she based that fact on another portion of delta standard practice manual,headed proper stowage of carry on baggage and cargo in the cabin.in pertinent part,it reads the flight crew is responsible for ensuring the proper stowage of all baggage.
the trial court found that delta was entitled to summary judgment because the field of airline safety was preempted by federal law,and because vinnick failed to allege the correct federal standard of care or to introduce evidence of a violation of that standard.
discussion 
preemption 
under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution art.vi,cl,federal law preempts state law where congress so intends.fidelity federal sav.loan de la cuesta,d,since state of maryland wheat,the united states supreme court has consistently held that federal preemption of state laws requires a clear congressional intent.thus,preemption exists only where there is a clear and manifest purpose of congress to foreclose a particular field to state legislation.jones rath packing,d,quoting rice santa fe elevator.fenning glenfed,th,d.courts are reluctant to infer preemption,and it is the burden of the party claiming that congress intended to preempt state law to prove it.elsworth beech aircraft cal d.a preemption analysis begins with the presumption that federal statutes do not supersede the historic police powers of the state unless congress has manifested a clear intent to do so.cipollone liggett group,d.we do not believe delta carried its burden here.
we begin our analysis with an examination of the relevant federal statute and the two united states supreme court cases on which the jurisprudence in this area depends,morales trans world airlines,d and american airlines,wolens,d.
the federal statute 
the united states supreme court has explained that until,the federal aviation act of faa,stat,as amended.et ed.and supp.v,empowered the civil aeronautics board cab to regulate the interstate airline industry.although the faa,authorized the board both to regulate fares and to take administrative action against deceptive trade practices,the federal legislation originally contained no clause preempting state regulation.and from the start,the faa has contained a saving clause,stating nothing in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute,but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.in,congress enacted the airline deregulation act ada,stat,which largely deregulated domestic air transport.to ensure that the states would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own,morales trans world airlines,supra,d,the ada included a preemption clause which read in relevant part n o state shall enact or enforce any law,rule,regulation,standard,or other provision having the force and effect of law relating to rates,routes,or services of any air carrier.a.american airlines,wolens,supra,d,fn.omitted.
the ada also contains a savings clause which provides that a remedy under this part is in addition to any other remedies provided by law.c.this provision is a of faa,which provided that n othing in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute,but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.citations.lewis continental airlines,d.the united states supreme court has described this clause as a general saving clause,which is a relic of the regime,and which can not supersede the specific substantive preemption provision.morales trans world airlines,supra,at,see hodges delta airlines,cir,fn.morales accounted the savings clause of marginal significance.
morales and wolens 
the federal cases relevant to the issue before us depend on two united states supreme court cases which considered preemption under these statutes,morales trans world airlines,supra,d morales and american airlines,wolens,supra,d.
in morales,the airline industry sought to enjoin state attorneys general from enforcing guidelines adopted by the national association of attorneys general,purporting to govern airline fare advertising.the opinion focused on the relate to language of the ada preemption clause.reasoning from both the ordinary meaning and from case law interpreting similar language in the erisa preemption clause,the court found that the words thus express a broad purpose id.at,and that the proposed state enforcement actions related to fares and were preempted importantly,the court also found that congress enacted the ada preemption clause t o ensure that the states would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own.morales,supra,at.
as many courts have since noted,morales concluded with the observation that to adapt to this case our language in shaw delta air lines,d,s ome state actions may affect airline fares in too tenuous,remote,or peripheral a manner to have effect,at.morales,supra,at.
in american airlines,wolens,supra,at page.wolens,the court considered two consolidated state court class actions brought by participants in american airlines frequent flier program those plaintiffs contended that changes in the program violated the illinois consumer fraud act and also constituted a breach of contract.the court first found that the claims related to rates and to services,that is,access to flights and upgrades.wolens,at.the court then focused on another portion of the ada preemption clause,the words enact or enforce,and concluded that in light of the full text of the clause,and of the ada purpose to leave marketing mechanisms to the airlines,not to the states,the consumer fraud act claims were preempted.id.at.however,the court found that the preemption clause did not shelter airlines from suits alleging breach of contract,since those suits did not allege a violation of a obligation,but instead sought recovery for the airline alleged breach of its own undertakings.
wolens wrote that its conclusion also makes sense of congress retention of the faa saving clause.preserving the remedies now existing at common law or by statute.the ada preemption clause,a,read together with the faa saving clause,stops states from imposing their own substantive standards with respect to rates,routes,or services,but not from affording relief to a party who claims and proves that an airline dishonored a term the airline itself stipulated.wolens,supra,at.
after morales and wolens,many federal courts considered federal preemption of state law tort claims against airlines,reaching varied results.these cases seem to follow one of three lines of analysis.under two of them,represented by charas trans world airlines,cir charas and hodges delta airlines,supra,hodges,vinnick claim is not preempted.abdullah american airlines,cir,on which delta primarily relies,finds field preemption of the field of airline safety,but would allow state claims to proceed under a federal standard of care abdullah is,however,inconsistent with california law.we thus find that vinnick claim is not preempted.
hodges and charas 
hodges,supra,is first in time,so we discuss it first.in that case,the fifth circuit considered facts similar to our own a passenger was injured when another passenger opened an overhead compartment and dislodged a case of rum.she brought a state law tort claim against delta.the opinion begins by acknowledging that while morales found broad preemption of state laws which relate to rates,routes or services,that case did not define service.hodges adopted a definition services generally represent a or anticipated provision of labor from one party to another.if the element of bargain or agreement is incorporated in our understanding of services,it leads to a concern with the contractual arrangement between the airline and the user of the service.elements of the air carrier service bargain include items such as ticketing,boarding procedures,provision of food and drink,and baggage handling,in addition to the transportation itself.these matters are all appurtenant and necessarily included with the contract of carriage between the passenger or shipper and the airline.it is these contractual features of air transportation that we believe congress intended to as services and broadly to protect from state regulation.id.at.hodges then found that the plaintiff claim did not relate to services,but to the operation of the airline,and was not preempted.id.at.f ederal preemption of state laws,even certain common law actions related to services of an air carrier,does not displace state tort actions for personal physical injuries or property damage caused by the operation and maintenance of aircraft.id.at.
hodges also found that its definition of services harmonized the ada preemption clause with other sections of airline regulatory law,with congressional intent underlying the ada,with regulatory agencies understanding of the statute,and with general principles of federal preemption.hodges,supra,at.in particular,hodges cited the statutory requirement that airlines carry insurance for amounts for which they might become liable due to bodily injury or property damage resulting from the operation or maintenance of the aircraft a,and the lack of a federal remedy for persons injured by aircraft operations.id.at.
the ninth circuit originally adopted the hodges approach,in gee southwest airlines cir,but subsequently determined that the distinction between services and operations and maintenance was unworkable.in charas,supra,that court found that the focus in a preemption case should be on congressional intent.charas found that congressional purpose of the ada preemption clause was to avoid interference with economic deregulation thus,the preemption question was whether the state laws underlying the claims frustrate the goal of economic deregulation by interfering with the forces of competition.id.at.after considering the plain language of the preemption clause and the rule that in preemption cases,courts must start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress id.at charas found that there was no clear and manifest purpose to displace state tort law in actions that do not affect deregulation in more than a peripheral manner.ibid.
like hodges,charas found evidence of congressional intent in the federal statute requiring insurance for personal injury claims,and also found such evidence in the savings clause of the act,which,read together with the preemption clause,evidences congressional intent to prohibit states from regulating the airlines while preserving state tort remedies that already existed at common law,providing that such remedies do not significantly impact federal deregulation.app.recodified as see also morales,at.charas,supra,at.
charas concluded that when congress enacted federal economic deregulation of the airlines,it intended to insulate the industry from possible state economic regulation as well.it intended to encourage the forces of competition.it did not intend to immunize the airlines from liability for personal injuries caused by their tortious conduct.like rates and routes,congress used service in a in the public utility,the provision of air transportation to and from various markets at various times.in that context,service does not refer to the pushing of beverage carts,keeping the aisles clear of stumbling blocks,the safe handling and storage of luggage,assistance to passengers in need,or like functions.charas,supra,at.
the third circuit later agreed with charas,finding that focusing on the competitive forces of the market,rather than on a strained and unsatisfactory distinction between services and operations,leads to a more accurate assessment of congressional intent.taj mahal travel,delta airlines,cir,claim that airline letter to passengers defamed ticket agencies not preempted.
vinnick claim here is essentially that delta was negligent in failing to provide sufficient assistance to ballard to allow her to safely store her bag,or was otherwise negligent in the manner in which it provided for the storage of luggage.under both the hodges and the charas definitions of services,there is no preemption of such a claim.given that fact,we need not choose between the cases,and in fact find that in many important ways they are more alike than different.both cases acknowledge that congressional intent is the touchstone preemption question and both acknowledge that the intent has been spelled out by the united states supreme court and that it concerns protection of economic deregulation.as the third circuit observed in this regard,w hen state law does not have a regulatory effect,it is too tenuous,remote,or peripheral to be preempted.morales,at.we consider it highly unlikely that claims caused by careening service carts and plummeting luggage were to be removed from state adjudication.taj mahal travel,delta airlines,supra,at.
we also agree with hodges and charas that the federal requirement that airlines must carry insurance to cover claims like vinnick,and the lack of a federal remedy for such claims,are persuasive evidence that congress did not intend to preempt state court negligence claims based on injury caused by falling luggage.and,like charas,we find that this reading of the ada harmonizes that act preemption clause with the savings clause of the act 
in contrast,we find abdullah american airlines,supra,unpersuasive and contrary to controlling california authority.in that case,passengers injured during turbulence filed lawsuits alleging that the pilot and the flight crew were negligent in failing to take reasonable precautions to avoid turbulence and failing to give warnings so that passengers could fasten their seatbelts and protect themselves.the lawsuits were filed in the virgin islands and the cases were tried under territorial common law standards of care.the third circuit reversed,finding an implied field preemption.that is,the court found that b ecause the legislative history of the faa and its judicial interpretation indicate that congress intent was to federally regulate aviation safety,any state or territorial standards of care are federally preempted.abdullah,supra,at.abdullah relied on the history and intent of the act,finding that congress found the creation of a single,uniform system of regulation vital to increasing air safety.id.at.
abdullah did not base its holding on the preemption clause of the ada,which it characterized as an economic deregulation statute which is inapposite to resolving preemption questions relating to the faa and air safety.abdullah,supra,at.abdullah reasoned that the ada concerned only competition and that airlines compete against one another by attracting passengers through the rates,routes,and services they offer.congress did not want the states to hamper this competition by their own regulation of these areas.safe operations,however,are a necessity for all airlines.whether or not to conform to safety standards is not an option for airlines in choosing a mode of competition.for this reason,safety of an airline operations would not appear to fall within the ambit of the ada and its procompetition preemption clause.id.at.further,abdullah found that cases such as hodges were based on an application of the maxim to express one is to exclude the other to the ada preemption clause,a line of reasoning which abdullah found faulty,since the maxim can not override the clear intent of congress.
finally,abdullah ruled that state and territorial tort remedies can coexist with federal standards of care for air safety,so that the plaintiffs could proceed with their actions,but only under a federal standard.abdullah,supra,at.abdullah suggested that the federal standard was found in a regulation which provides that no person may operate an aircraft in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another.id.at a.
the first problem with abdullah is that it concerns preemption of the field of air safety.it is not at all clear to us that vinnick claim can properly be so described,or that a federal regulation concerning the manner of operation of an aircraft can or should be applied to her case.the case is of uncertain relevance 
next,abdullah does not seem to represent the prevailing view on the preemptive effect of the act.for instance,cleveland piper aircraft cir cited the savings clause of that act and found this section shows that congress did not intend to occupy the field of airplane safety to the exclusion of the state common law,citing numerous other cases which so held.id.at see also somes united airlines,mass d,before congress enacted the ada,it was understood that the savings clause preserved state law personal injury actions.abdullah itself notes that it depart s from the precedent established by a number of cases which hold that federal law does not preempt any aspect of air safety,citing several cases.abdullah,supra,at.
further,abdullah is contrary to controlling california supreme court authority,elsworth beech aircraft,supra,cal d.there,the heirs of passengers killed in a plane crash filed suit against the manufacturer of the plane.at trial,they proceeded in part on a negligence per se standard,alleging that the plane did not comply with faa standards.on appeal,the defendant argued that the faa decision certifying the design of the plane had a determinative effect,and that the doctrine of preemption precluded the jury from finding it liable for negligence in the design of the plane on the basis of violation of faa safety regulations.
the supreme court found no error,finding first that there can be no question as to the intent of congress to allow the states to apply their own laws in tort actions against aircraft manufacturers for the defective design of airplanes,in spite of the fact that federal law may have completely occupied the field of regulation of aircraft safety and certification.the federal aviation act of expressly declares that its provisions are not intended to abridge remedies that a party may have under state law.the doctrine of negligence per se is one of those remedies.elsworth,supra,cal d at.the court then found that since congress has clearly allowed state tort remedies,the critical issues before us are not whether it has fully occupied the field of aircraft regulation,but whether there is an irreconcilable conflict between the federal and state standards or whether the imposition of a state standard in a damages action would frustrate the objectives of the federal law.citation.elsworth,supra,cal d at.the court found neither circumstance to be true.
the california supreme court thus found that the act does not preempt state causes of action,even when the design of a plane,a federally regulated area,is at stake.
delta argues to the contrary,that california law holds that vinnick case is preempted under the act.we see nothing in baker airport authority cal d,or the other cases cited by delta which so holds.in baker,the california supreme court case considered nuisance claims based on airport noise and held only that state law damage remedies remain available against an airport proprietor despite the fact that federal law precludes interference with commercial flight patterns and schedules.id.at.bethman city of ukiah d.noted that since city of burbank lockheed air terminal,d,california courts considering preemption distinguished between state or municipal actions that effectively regulate the use of navigable airspace,aircraft traffic,or air flight safety,which are preempted,and those actions that concern location and environmental impacts of airports,safety of ground maintenance facilities,and the manufacture of aircraft,which are not preempted.
the common carrier standard of care 
our conclusion that vinnick claim is not preempted leads to the conclusion that she may proceed under california common carrier standard.we are aware that there is authority to the contrary,in gee southwest airlines,supra.one of the plaintiffs in gee presented a claim of injury similar to the facts here.gee found that the claim related to operations,not services,and was not preempted,but also found that the plaintiff could not proceed under california common carrier standard of care.instead,her claims should be evaluated under the common law standard of care.gee reasoned that the higher common carrier standard necessarily pertains to every action the airline takes.these are not laws of general applicability that happen to indirectly relate to airline service.medtronic,lohr,d.we believe this statutorily imposed standard of care,like the naag guidelines in morales or the consumer fraud act action in wolens,is an attempt by california to impose its own substantive standards on airlines thus,even though the plaintiff tort claims may proceed,they should be evaluated under the common law standard of care.id.at.
charas overruled gee only insofar as it was inconsistent with charas,arguably allowing the ruling on duty of care to stand,but we can not adopt the reasoning or result.under the logic of both charas and hodges,the ada preemption clause does not affect vinnick claim.that clause prohibits states from enacting or enforcing laws which relate to an air carrier rates,routes,or services.since vinnick claim does not relate to rates,routes,or services,the a
