background 
southern shuttle operates a airport shuttle,known as supershuttle,that transports passengers to and from three south florida airports miami international airport,palm beach international airport and fort international airport from december,to june,abel worked for defendant southern shuttle as a shuttle driver,driving passengers to and from airports.abel,like all shuttle drivers,was paid commission and tips,but not overtime compensation.abel employment ended after he refused to transport a passenger with a payment voucher and made the passenger exit the shuttle van,in violation of southern shuttle policy.
the shuttles are large nine and passenger vans.the shuttles pick up passengers at one of the airports and take them to any location in the area such as a residence,office or hotel,or pick them up at any location in the area and take them to one of the airports.shuttle drivers do not transport passengers to or from locations outside of florida.some shuttle passengers are transported to the airports so they can travel via air carrier to other states or countries.other shuttle passengers are transported from the airports after having flown from other states or countries.
many shuttle passengers arrange for shuttle transportation by contacting southern shuttle directly.passengers traveling to the airport make reservations ahead of time and schedule a trip to the airport.similarly,passengers traveling from the airport check in at a supershuttle airport kiosk or counter or with a curbside representative to be assigned to the next available shuttle.
southern shuttle president,mark levitt averred that a large portion of the reservations made with southern shuttle are through internet package deals wherein a traveler buys a package deal from a third party company that includes airfare,hotel accommodations and transportation to and from the airport the traveler receives a voucher for free transportation to and from the airport and provides the voucher to southern shuttle in lieu of payment and southern shuttle then prepares an invoice to the third party company for payment.these third party companies include internet travel web sites such as,travelocity,orbitz,cheaptickets,a german company called viator,a company in the united kingdom called get a bed,and american express,among others.
ii.discussion 
flsa motor carrier exemption 
the flsa requires employers to compensate employees at an overtime rate if they work more than forty hours during a workweek.a.the flsa provides for a number of exemptions to the overtime provision.see b.we construe flsa exemptions narrowly against the employer.walters am.coach lines of miami,cir,cert.denied.the employer has the burden to show that an exemption applies.id.
the flsa exempts from the overtime pay requirement any employee with respect to whom the secretary of transportation has power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of section of title,otherwise known as the motor carrier act mca exemption.b.whether the mca exemption applies is dependent on whether the secretary has the power to regulate,not on whether the secretary has actually exercised such power.baez wells fargo armored serv,cir.that is,for the mca exemption to apply,the secretary of transportation power to regulate under the act merely needs to cover a particular group of employees.walters,at.
section of title authorizes the secretary of transportation to prescribe requirements for qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees of a motor carrier or a private motor carrier.b.section a of title explicitly states that this provision in b applies to transportation described in.id.a.in turn,of title confers jurisdiction on the secretary of transportation over transportation by a motor carrier on a public highway,to the extent passengers,property,or both are transported by motor carrier between a place in a state and a place in another state or a state and another place in the same state through another state.id.
this court has interpreted the mca above statutory scheme.walters,at.we have said that the mca confers upon the secretary of transportation the authority to regulate the maximum hours of service of employees who are employed by a common carrier by motor vehicle engaged in interstate commerce and whose activities directly affect the safety of operations of such motor vehicles.id.quoting spires ben hill,cir.the applicability of the motor carrier exemption depends both on the class to which his employer belongs and on the class of work involved in the employee job.id.at quoting,outlining the requirements for the mca exemption.the walters court further instructed t here are two requirements for an employee to be subject to the motor carrier exemption his employer business must be subject to the secretary of transportation jurisdiction under the mca and the employee activities must directly affect the safety of operation of motor vehicles in the transportation on the public highways of passengers or property in interstate or foreign commerce within the meaning of the motor carrier act.id.emphasis added,quotation marks brackets omitted.
secretary mca jurisdiction over southern shuttle 
abel argues that southern shuttle failed to show the first requirement of the mca exemption.abel argues that southern shuttle is not subject to the secretary of transportation jurisdiction because southern shuttle airport shuttle service does not make or derive revenue from interstate trips,such that the secretary could exercise such jurisdiction and the secretary of transportation has not in fact exercised jurisdiction over southern shuttle.however,even if the secretary has not in fact exercised jurisdiction,the mca exemption still applies so long as the secretary has the authority to do so.see baez,at.therefore,this appeal turns on whether the secretary has jurisdictional power over southern shuttle.
here,the parties agree the secretary jurisdictional power depends upon whether the employer transportation service engages in more than de minimus interstate commerce therefore we examine the interstate commerce question.
walters american coach lines of miami.
our recent decision in walters sheds some light on this question.the walters employer was a bus company that had a contract with royal caribbean cruise lines to transport passengers to and from the ship ports and the miami and fort lauderdale airports.walters,at.the shuttle trip was included as part of the passengers vacation packages booked though either royal carribean or a travel agent.id.the passengers used vouchers to board the shuttle buses,and the bus company invoiced royal carribean for the trips.id.the bus company had informal agreements with two other cruise lines to provide similar shuttle transportation.id.the bus company also provided motor coach transportation,which included a small number of trips outside florida,that generated about four percent of the revenue.id.at.moreover,the bus company was licensed by the dot and authorized to operate an interstate motor carrier.id.at.
the walters court rejected the plaintiffs argument that interstate trips comprising of revenue were de minimus.id.at.this court noted that morris mccomb,as well as other cases,suggest that a company interstate business is de minimus if it is less than one
