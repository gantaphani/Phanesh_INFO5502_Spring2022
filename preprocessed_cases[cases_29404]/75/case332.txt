jason melton is a disabled individual who qualifies for dart paratransit services.the front yard of the melton home,in which jason lives with his parents,includes a steep slope that prevents the meltons from taking jason down to the street in his wheelchair.instead,the meltons have constructed a ramp in their garage to allow jason access to the rear drive and paved public alley.
although dart paratransit service previously had picked up jason in the alley directly behind the house,dart has picked up jason where the alley meets the street since.the meltons cite numerous health,safety,and convenience concerns resulting from the relocation to the end of the alley.
dart current paratransit is approved as compliant with title ii of the ada by the federal transit administration fta provides,service for people with disabilities who are unable to use dart fixed route system of buses or trains.dart guide to paratransit service provides that riders using the system must wait at the sidewalk,or at another safe waiting area in front of,or as close as possible to,the entrance of the location.the rider is responsible for travel to the location that is to say,dart has no responsibility under the plan to get the rider to the point of.paratransit drivers are instructed to wait for riders at the curb of a public street,in front of,or as close as possible to,the rider house,building or other designated location.
on february,the meltons filed this action against dart,contending that dart refusal to pick up jason in the alley directly behind his house constituted illegal discrimination against jason under the ada and the rehabilitation act.they sought an injunction requiring dart to make reasonable modification to its paratransit services to provide an alleyway for jason.
dart moved for summary judgment arguing that the law does not require it to make reasonable modification to its paratransit service.the meltons concurrently filed an opposing motion for partial summary judgment.the district court granted dart motion for summary judgment and denied the meltons motion for partial summary judgment,holding that neither the ada nor the rehabilitation act required dart to make reasonable modification to its paratransit service.melton dallas area rapid transit,d.the meltons filed a timely motion for a new trial,which was effectively a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to.e.the district court denied this motion,and the meltons filed a timely notice of appeal.
this court reviews a district court order granting a party summary judgment motion de novo.whittaker bellsouth,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the record discloses that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see celotex catrett,d.in making this determination,the court must evaluate the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.whittaker,at.
the americans with disabilities act,et,was passed by congress with the specific mandate of eliminating discrimination against individuals with disabilities.see b.the focus of this case is title ii of the ada,which covers discrimination in the provision of public services.see,et.title ii is divided into two parts part a covers public services generally,et part b applies specifically and only to public transportation provided by public entities,et.it is undisputed that dart paratransit service is covered by part b of title ii the parties dispute the application of part a to the issue presented in this case.
a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination before relief under the ada can be considered.to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ada,a plaintiff must demonstrate that he is a qualified individual within the meaning of the ada that he is being excluded from participation in,or being denied benefits of,services,programs,or activities for which the public entity is responsible,or is otherwise being discriminated against by the public entity and that such exclusion,denial of benefits,or discrimination is by reason of his disability.lightbourn county of el paso,texas,cir.
the parties agree that jason melton is a qualified individual within the meaning of the ada.the second element of the prima facie case,however,is a point of contention.the district court concluded,and dart argues on appeal,that the meltons failed to show that jason has been excluded from participation in,or is being denied the benefits of,dart paratransit service.see melton,d at.although jason has not been entirely prohibited from using dart paratransit service,the meltons argue that jason has been denied meaningful access because the discontinuation of alleyway makes his use of the system dangerous and extremely difficult.the meltons assert that the district court erred by not applying a meaningful access standard to evaluate the meltons claims of denial of access.although supreme court precedent suggests that denial of meaningful access is equivalent to a full denial of access under the ada we need not decide whether the meaningful access standard should be applied here the district court application of an incorrect standard of access is not reversible error unless the meltons also demonstrate discrimination on the basis of jason disability,the third element of the prima facie case.
thus,we turn to the question of whether the failure of dart to modify its plan constituted discrimination prohibited by the ada and the rehabilitation act.discrimination on the basis of disability differs from discrimination in the constitutional sense.reickenbacker foster,cir citing thompson colorado,cir.to determine whether dart discriminated against jason on the basis of his disability,we examine the ada itself and its own definitions of discrimination if the ada requires reasonable modification of dart paratransit plan,the meltons may have stated a prima facie case of discrimination and in which case we assume that summary judgment in favor of dart would be inappropriate.on the other hand,if the ada imposes no such requirement,as we hold,the meltons have failed to establish a prima facie case and summary judgment is appropriately granted to dart.
we now turn to the question at the heart of this case whether a paratransit service that is consistent with an plan is sufficient for compliance with the ada,or whether the ada requires a public transportation system to make reasonable modifications to its paratransit service.this difficult question is an issue of first impression not only for our court,but for all circuits.a proper analysis requires an examination of both the statutory and regulatory frameworks of the ada.
as we have noted above,title ii of the ada is divided into two subparts.part a governs all public entities,and part b applies specifically to the provision of public transportation by public entities.the attorney general is directed to promulgate regulations to implement part a under.but,it is the secretary of transportation who is directed to promulgate regulations to implement part b under
