opinion of the court 
this case involves a shipment of cigarettes,a train derailment,and a stolen trailer.the issues before this court are whether the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act applies to the case at hand and,if so,whether the district court properly entered summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff railroad.
background 
a large quantity of cigarettes was to be by train and then by atlanta to tokyo.the atlanta shipper of the cigarettes was brown williamson tobacco,the tokyo consignee was sumitomo,and the intended final carrier by water,culminating in delivery to the consignee,was american president lines,which issued a bill of lading covering the shipment the norfolk southern picked the shipment up in atlanta on november,and transported it by rail to new orleans,where the shipment was transferred to the southern pacific.union pacific,the plaintiff in the district court and appellee here,is the successor in interest of southern pacific.if the delivery had proceeded according to plan,southern pacific would have delivered the shipment of cigarettes to san pedro,california,at which point the american president lines vessel apl wisdom would have transported the cigarettes to tokyo.
all did not go according to plan.the southern pacific train that was carrying the shipment of cigarettes,along with other shipments,derailed in painted rock,arizona,on november.after the cigarettes were taken from the derailment site to the southern pacific yard in phoenix,ronald appelt,a southern pacific field manager,discussed the transportation of two trailers to california with dave saunders,an independent trucking contractor.saunders,who had entered into a trip lease with greentree transportation company a defendant in the district court and appellant here,represented that greentree would charge southern pacific to deliver the two trailers to california 
trailer number,bound for desert empire storage in san bernadino,was to be driven by saunders.trailer number,bound for a dock in san pedro,was to be driven first by gary,another independent greentree driver,and then by saunders.this latter trailer contained the cigarette shipment.the arrangement that appelt and saunders agreed on was that would transport his portion of the san the beacon truck stop in san bernadino and would then leave the shipment unattended until saunders could take over the shipment.upon arrival at a dock in san pedro,this trailer was to be loaded onto the american president lines vessel apl wisdom,which would transport the cigarettes to their final destination in tokyo.
the first part of this arrangement proceeded smoothly.when saunders arrived at the beacon truck stop in san bernadino,he acknowledged receipt of the san trailer from in good condition.saunders then proceeded to deliver the san trailer to its destination,at desert empire storage in san bernadino.at this point,the operation ceased to proceed smoothly.when saunders returned to the beacon truck stop,the location where the san trailer had been left,he discovered that the,of course,the shipment of cigarettes inside the missing.it was determined that the trailer and the shipment of cigarettes had been stolen.
notwithstanding the theft of one of the two trailers,greentree billed southern pacific,the rate originally quoted by saunders in his discussions with appelt for the transportation of the two trailers.southern pacific paid the entire to greentree,and also paid the full value of the stolen freight what union pacific refers to in its pleadings as its customer.southern pacific demanded reimbursement in this amount from greentree.while greentree insurance carrier ultimately paid to union pacific,as successor in interest to southern pacific,the remaining has not been paid by greentree or its insurance carrier.
union pacific filed a complaint in the district court for the western district of pennsylvania on november,seeking money damages from greentree in the amount of.union pacific filed its complaint pursuant to the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act.a after greentree filed an answer,union pacific moved for summary judgment.on february,the district court granted union pacific motion for summary judgment and awarded damages in the amount of.on march,greentree filed a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e to alter or amend the grant of summary judgment in favor of union pacific,and a motion for summary judgment in greentree favor.on march,before the district court had ruled on either of greentree two motions,greentree filed a notice of appeal in this court,appealing the final judgment entered in this action on the day of february.on april,this court entered an order staying the appeal pending disposition by the district court of greentree rule e motion and summary judgment motion.on april,the district court entered an order denying both of greentree motions.greentree appeal then proceeded in this court,without any amendment of the notice of appeal.
ii.applicability of the carmack amendment to the case at bar 
greentree contends that under the carmack amendment,only a shipper or other person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading,a,is a proper plaintiff,and union pacific is not a shipper or other person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading but an intermediate carrier,and therefore the district court lacked authority to entertain union pacific suit against greentree the supreme court has held that the carmack amendment was enacted to relieve shippers of the burden of searching out a particular negligent carrier from among the often numerous carriers handling an interstate shipment of goods,reider thompson,by permitting a shipper to hold either the initiating carrier or delivering carrier liable for damages to its goods in interstate commerce,mexican light power.mexican ry,regardless of which carrier actually caused the damage.an initiating or delivering carrier liable to a shipper may then recover from a connecting carrier for damages that occur on the connecting carrier line.id.see also commodity credit norton,cir quoting.blish milling.
under ordinary circumstances,a through bill of lading is issued by the initiating carrier and presented to the shipper.this document governs the entire transportation,and thus fixes the obligations of all participating carriers to the extent that the terms of the bill of lading are applicable and valid.commodity credit,at quoting blish milling,at.the supreme court explained in mexican light power that a second bill of lading issued by a connecting carrier does not alter the terms of the original bill of lading unless the connecting carrier has received a consideration for the bill of lading in addition to that which flowed under the bill of lading issued by the initiating carrier.at.
in the case at bar,there was uncontroverted evidence that,subsequent to the issuance by american president lines of a bill of lading,southern pacific and greentree entered into a second contract of carriage a contract under which greentree was to,in the event,did receive to transport two trailers,one of which contained the shipment of cigarettes,from phoenix to california.this contract was separate from the american president lines bill of lading,and the consideration paid to greentree the court put it in mexican light power in addition to that which flowed under the first bill of lading.id thus,union pacific in succession to southern pacific,as shipper,properly initiated this suit against greentree,as carrier,pursuant to the carmack amendment 
iii.summary judgment 
greentree raises two additional issues for review whether the district court erred in not granting summary judgment to greentree due to a contractual time bar on bringing suit and whether the district court overlooked genuine issues of material fact,thereby committing error in granting summary judgment to union pacific.
standard of review 
on an appeal from an order entering summary judgment,this court undertakes de novo review,applying the same standard the district court should apply.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact a
