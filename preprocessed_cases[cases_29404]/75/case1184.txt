following his arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol dui,the department of motor vehicles dmv suspended plaintiff paul dyer driver license under the administrative per se statutes.see.after an administrative hearing,the dmv upheld the suspension.
dyer then filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate in superior court,subd.a code civ.citing vehicle code section,the court granted the petition on the sole ground that the arrest was unlawful because the officer who pulled dyer over on suspicion of dui was driving an unmarked patrol vehicle.
on this appeal by the dmv,we shall reverse the judgment of the trial court.there was no evidentiary basis to support a finding that vehicle code section was violated and even if there was,the fact that the detaining officer was driving an unmarked vehicle did not render the subsequent arrest unlawful.we also reject dyer argument that the arrest was invalid because another officer,who placed him under arrest,did not personally observe him driving under the influence.
because the trial court relied on a legally infirm ground for granting the petition and failed to conduct an independent review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support the dmv factual findings,we shall vacate and remand for a new hearing.
just after midnight on february,sergeant jess phariss,who was on uniformed duty in an unmarked placer county sheriff department vehicle,was traveling southbound on state highway.the weather was clear and road conditions were good.
sergeant phariss spotted a jeep cherokee that was traveling southbound at miles per hour in a zone.the jeep sped up to miles per hour as sergeant phariss caught up to it,then slowed to.subsequently,sergeant phariss saw the jeep cross over both the solid double yellow the broken single yellow center line at least times.on three of those occasions,the jeep crossed completely into the northbound lane of traffic and then abruptly returned to the southbound lane.
at,sergeant phariss requested that deputy robert griggs proceed towards the location of the jeep.phariss activated his emergency lights and initiated a traffic stop of the jeep.griggs arrived to assist as phariss approached the driver,later identified as dyer,and asked him why he appeared unable to keep his vehicle within his lane of traffic.dyer answered,uh i did know i was in the other lane.phariss then asked if there was anything mechanically wrong with the jeep,to which dyer answered negatively.during the encounter,sergeant phariss noticed objective symptoms of intoxication,including a moderate odor of alcohol on dyer breath,confusion,unsteady balance,slow,slurred speech,and red eyes.
sergeant phariss directed dyer to step out of the jeep and go to the rear of the vehicle where deputy griggs was standing.dyer stumbled out of the jeep and griggs administered a series of field sobriety tests,which dyer performed very poorly.griggs then tried to obtain a breath sample.dyer put his lips to the mouthpiece several times but did not breathe into it.finally,he gave a quick puff of air into the mouthpiece,which registered an inconclusive content bac.based on dyer poor performance on the sobriety tests and the observations of phariss and griggs,griggs placed dyer under arrest for dui.
during an inventory search of the jeep,sergeant phariss found an opened,partially consumed bottle of vodka under the driver front seat,a glass pipe associated with smoking marijuana and a film canister containing marijuana.
dyer was transported to the county jail for booking,where deputy griggs administered two intoxilyzer breath tests at,some minutes after the arrest.the two breath samples each registered bac.
procedural history 
based on the investigation reports of deputy griggs and sergeant phariss and the results of the intoxilyzer test,the dmv suspended dyer driver license under section.dyer requested an administrative hearing.after an evidentiary hearing,the appointed dmv hearing officer found that the requirements of section had been met,and she upheld the suspension.
dyer then filed a petition for writ of mandate in superior court.see,subd.a.although the court initial ruling was to deny the writ,it ultimately reversed itself upon receipt of supplemental briefing.the trial judge determined that because sergeant phariss was driving an unmarked patrol car and not wearing a uniform in violation of section,dyer was not lawfully arrested and therefore the license suspension was improper.the dmv appeals from the judgment granting the writ of mandate.
