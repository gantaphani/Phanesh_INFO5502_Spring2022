although the underlying facts of this case relate to a tragic train accident that occurred several years ago in bourbonnais,illinois,the question before us in this appeal is a narrow procedural one can this court review the district court decision to remand the case to the state court in which it was originally filed we conclude that the best way to interpret the district court order is as one finding that it had no subject matter jurisdiction over the claims that were remanded.that being the case,this court has no appellate jurisdiction over the district court remand order.furthermore,even if we are wrong and the order was simply a decision to remand all supplemental state claims to the state court,we would exercise our jurisdiction to find that there was no abuse of discretion in that decision.we therefore dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
on march,an amtrak passenger train known as the city of new orleans made famous in a song written by steve goodman and performed by arlo guthrie and later willie nelson collided with a trailer loaded with steel rebar at a railroad crossing in bourbonnais,illinois.the city of new orleans derailed as a result of the collision,resulting in significant injury and the loss of many passengers lives.this suit,along with more than fifty others,was filed in illinois state court by injured passengers and the estates of those killed as a result of the collision.the plaintiffs alleged negligence,strict products liability and breach of implied warranties on the part of several defendants,including general electric,which designed and manufactured the locomotive that pulled the city of new orleans.the additional defendants were the manufacturers,owners,and operators of the equipment involved in the accident.two from that group are relevant to this appeal illinois central,which operates the tracks on which the city of new orleans traveled,and birmingham steel company,which loaded the steel rebar onto the trailer involved in this collision from its adjacent manufacturing facility.amtrak,though not initially named as a defendant in this suit,plays a role in the issues before us as well.
essentially,the procedural posture of this case can be boiled down to a simple pattern.plaintiffs a filed suit in state court raising a number of state law claims against a set of defendants b through n.one of those defendants,ge,removed the case to federal court,asserting as a basis for removal the argument that the federal locomotive inspection act,et,completely preempted the state law claims.in other words,ge claimed that any lawsuit these plaintiffs were bringing was inevitably and necessarily based on a federal question,and thus removal was available under a and b.later,defendant birmingham steel filed a complaint pursuant to fed.civ.against amtrak,which is a federal instrumentality.the district court initially concluded that ge complete preemption argument was correct,and thus that the removal was properly based on the presence of a federal question and supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.the court then dismissed all claims that the plaintiffs had asserted against ge all of which relied on state law on preemption grounds.finally,turning to the other defendants,the court ascertained that none of them was arguing that federal question jurisdiction existed based on the complete preemption idea.in the absence of a federal question,and in the absence of the complete diversity required by,he concluded that the case had to be remanded to state court.believing that the order of remand was erroneous,illinois central filed an appeal to this court.plaintiffs have not filed a from the order dismissing their claims against ge,and thus we have no occasion to rule on the correctness of the findings supporting that order.
the first question we must decide is whether we have appellate jurisdiction over illinois central challenge to the remand order.after devoting scant attention to this threshold question in its opening brief,illinois central urged us to find such jurisdiction in its reply brief.squarely challenged appellate jurisdiction in their brief.even if they had not,however,we would have had an independent duty to satisfy ourselves that jurisdiction existed before we could proceed to the merits of the appeal.
the reason why appellate jurisdiction is problematic,at best,comes from the language of the statute governing removals and remands.in deceptively simple words,d says 
an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,except that an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed pursuant to section of this title which applies only to civil rights cases shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.
the naive reader might think that this meant no appellate consideration by appeal,by writ of mandamus,or by any other device that lawyers might serve up,but that reader would be wrong.in a line of cases that began with thermtron products,hermansdorfer,d,the supreme court has adopted a more nuanced interpretation of the statute,and it is therefore the thermtron approach we are bound to follow.
in thermtron itself,the court faced an insubordinate district court judge who had remanded cases to the state court because his docket was overcrowded.the court of appeals had reviewed the propriety of these remands by means of a writ of mandamus,and the question before the supreme court was whether this was possible in light of the d ban on review on appeal or otherwise.using a close reading of the statute as a whole,the court concluded that the d ban on appellate consideration of remand orders had to be linked to the reasons for remand found in c.at.if the district court announced that its remand order was based on one of the grounds for remand recognized in c essentially,defects in removal procedure or want of subject matter jurisdiction,then review was barred.if the district court order fairly read indicated that it was remanding for some other it was potentially ultra some form of appellate review could proceed.id.in thermtron itself,after accepting jurisdiction,the court concluded that overcrowded dockets was not a permissible reason for remand.in the later case of quackenbush allstate insurance,d,the court agreed that remand in conjunction with a decision to abstain fell outside the scope of the c reasons and was thus reviewable despite d it then concluded on the merits that the remand order was unwarranted.
the court has made it clear,however,that the thermtron holding was not an invitation to exercise appellate review over remand decisions.to the contrary,it has three times cautioned that the thermtron exception to d is to be narrowly construed.just over a year after thermtron was decided the court issued a terse,per curiam opinion reversing the fifth circuit decision to reverse and remand a case to the district court for reconsideration of a remand order that had been based upon a possibly erroneous finding that diversity jurisdiction was lacking.see gravitt southwestern bell telephone,d.in doing so the court stressed the fact that the appeals courts are entirely without jurisdiction to review a remand order based on jurisdictional grounds,and that nothing in thermtron was to the contrary.id.nearly a decade later in university cohill,d,the court described thermtron as a response to a clearly impermissible remand,and hence as something that did not forbid a district court from remanding pendent claims.finally,in things remembered,petrarca,d,the court held that a district court order remanding a bankruptcy case to state court on the basis of untimely removal fell within the review prohibition of d.interestingly,justice kennedy joined by justice ginsburg filed a concurring opinion in things remembered in which he characterized as an opinion limiting thermtron scope.he specifically distinguished between the legitimacy of remanding a pendent or supplemental state claim to state court,on the one hand,and the possibility of judicial review of such an order,on the other.see at.the latter issue,he pointed out,was not before the court in things remembered.id.
before turning to the further development of thermtron in the lower courts,it is worth pausing for a moment to consider why congress might have included d in the judicial code.the answer is apparent it wanted to expedite the process of choosing a forum for litigation and to avoid exactly the kind of lengthy proceeding we are having in the present case.it is a scheme,with the narrow thermtron exception for truly abusive situations,plus the quackenbush exception for unwarranted applications of the slippery abstention doctrines.normally,however,a litigant is entitled to remove a case from state court a very mechanical procedure,to have the federal court test the propriety of the removal,and then to proceed with the case in either the federal court or the state court without further ado.the only thing that is at stake is the forum that will hear a claim.this is certainly not an unimportant matter,but it is not so fundamental that a second or third layer of judges must test its correctness.and as the court has noted in a case not involving d,an order resolving a dispute over where litigation shall proceed is not an appealable final order,nor does it fall within the exception carved out by the collateral order doctrine for significant claims that are otherwise effectively unreviewable on appeal.see lauro lines chasser,d.this and the supreme court receptivity to arbitral fora as alternatives to courts,its acceptance of forum selection clauses in contracts,and its frequent reminders that the state courts are fully capable of adjudicating federal claims and are entitled to respect by federal courts,all support the idea that at some point litigation over the choice of a courtroom must end.section d establishes that endpoint for almost all cases that are removed to federal court it comes when the district court judge makes the call,and it therefore falls outside the normal pattern of cases in which an appeal is either immediately or ultimately available.while we are certainly obliged to apply thermtron and quackenbush,we must also take seriously the cautionary language in gravitt,and things remembered.otherwise,d will cease to play any meaningful function.perhaps that would be good policy,but it is a policy that only congress can implement as long as the statute is on the books,it is binding on the federal courts.
it is against that background that we must evaluate one possible approach that arguably would support our appellate jurisdiction here.some courts appear to follow a rule under which appellate review is permissible if a jurisdictional remand occurs as a result of later events in a case.see in re amoco petroleum additives,cir w e understand to permit review when the district court believes that removal was proper and that later developments authorize remand.in re shell oil,cir same.see also poore life ins,cir trans penn wax mccandless,cir bogle phillips petroleum,cir van meter state farm fire cas,cir.but see angelides baylor college of,cir a remand order based on c jurisdictional grounds is not reviewable even if based on a event linton airbus industrie,cir,cert.denied,d same nutter monongahela power,cir declining to address whether appellate review exists for remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because of occurrences.
in our view,however,it would be a mistake to think that there was a rule to that effect and we thus have no necessary quarrel with the holdings of the cases cited in the previous paragraph.all later events are not equal.some,such as a district court conclusion that an initial acceptance of a claim of complete preemption was erroneous,reveal that the federal court never had jurisdiction of the case to begin with.other later events,such as a bona fide loss of diversity of citizenship or an ultimate judgment for less than the jurisdictional amount,may not have any jurisdictional significance at all.still others affect only the supplemental jurisdiction of the court.if we are dealing with the first of these later decision that jurisdiction never existed at all over the is nothing in the language of c that makes the timing of the district court jurisdictional determination significant.to the contrary,that statute makes it clear that defects other than the lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be raised within days after the notice of removal,but a district court must remand a case at any time before final judgment if it concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction.c.thermtron instructed that c and d must be read together,as a unit if that is true,then the most logical result would be to say that any remand based on a conclusion that jurisdiction was lacking at the time of removal is covered by c,no matter when that fact becomes apparent,and thus that appellate consideration of any such remand is barred by d.
the present case,in our view,is best regarded as one in which the court never had any jurisdiction over the claim.granted,the court order is not as clear as it might be with respect to its own jurisdiction.in the order addressing illinois central motion for reconsideration of the remand order,the judge actually said this court likely enjoys subject matter jurisdiction over this ligitation,but it then found that illinois central had waived any claim that complete preemption supported jurisdiction.we agree with our dissenting colleague that the jurisdiction of the court can not be conferred by consent,and can not in a certain sense be defeated by waiver.on the other hand,courts normally do not force parties to file particular defenses or claims our reported cases are replete with examples of both claims and defenses that are waived.illinois central concession here that the only pertinent form of preemption that could be asserted was conflict preemption made it clear to the court that nothing but state law claims over which it had no jurisdiction were before it.on that understanding,we read the court remand order as one based on an ultimate lack of its own subject matter jurisdiction over the claims.we note that the court did not say that it had jurisdiction over the claims under the supplemental jurisdiction statute.but the fact that the court may have made a mistake about its jurisdiction over the remaining claims does not defeat the bar found in d.see,gravitt,at.briscoe bell,d.
but wait,the defendants argue remember that birmingham steel impleaded amtrak under rule before the case was remanded.even though the original case of a b through n did not belong in federal court,what happens when defendant c files a claim against amtrak can the later claim save federal jurisdiction over the whole suit it can not,for the reasons we explain in more detail in part iii of this opinion.for present purposes,however,the only important point is that the district court did not think that amtrak saved its jurisdiction.as we just noted,the rule of nonreviewability found in d means that even remands based on an erroneous belief in the lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction can not be reviewed.thermtron,at.otherwise the rule means nothing at all,because appeals will be taken and sustained in those cases where the district court made a mistake,and rejected in cases where the district court was correct.even if the district court was wrong that it lacked jurisdiction over the claims that it remanded,the remand would nevertheless be jurisdictional.the only consequence of a mistake is that the case would proceed in state court even though it could have stayed in federal court.the drafters of d must have known that a few such mistakes would occur,but they were willing to accept them.in this case,if amtrak found itself before a state court as a defendant,it would have the right to remove its own case under federal question jurisdiction,because it is a federal entity in which the united states owns more than of the outstanding stock.see.it is true that this means it might take amtrak two steps to remain in federal court instead of one,but it also means that congress intent in enacting will not be thwarted.
since the district court order does not indicate that it believed that either supplemental jurisdiction or the presence of amtrak saved its jurisdiction,we find that the order of remand was indeed a jurisdictional one.that means it fell within the scope of c and thus that appellate review of the order is unavailable because of d.even if it is proper to rely on a temporal element to the ban on reviewability of jurisdictional remands in some circumstances,this is not one of them.to do otherwise would be to go significantly beyond the holdings of the supreme court and the language and purpose of c and d.that is something we are not willing to do.
because reasonable people might disagree over the best reading of the district court remand order,we think it prudent to address the alternative possibility that the court believed that it did have jurisdiction over the case after ge was dismissed,but that a remand was appropriate for some other reason waiver by the defendants of the complete preemption theory of defense,or discretionary exercise of the power to decline supplemental jurisdiction.if that reading is the correct one,then our appellate jurisdiction would be secure and we would have to consider the merits of the district court decision.
the starting point for that determination would be,once again,a jurisdictional inquiry.what,if anything,supported the district court jurisdiction as opposed to our own diversity jurisdiction never existed,because citizens of illinois appeared on both sides of the case.that means that jurisdiction over the case as a whole had to be based upon a federal question.ge claimed below and illinois central urges on appeal that the doctrine of complete preemption formed the basis of federal question jurisdiction in this case.but we simply can not agree with the district court that complete preemption supported the claims against either ge or the defendants who were left after ge was dismissed.that means,of course,that there was nothing in the case to which supplemental jurisdiction could attach.our conclusion has nothing to do with the fact that the lawyers for the defendants appear to have disclaimed any reliance on complete preemption.this is a question on which appellate review must be de novo,wholly apart from the district court decision,party waivers,or other stipulations.see rogers tyson foods,cir.
federal law has not swept away all state law in this field,thereby making any claim the plaintiffs were trying to assert against ge necessarily federal.the discussions in our recent decisions in tyson foods,supra,and vorhees naper aero club,cir,and the supreme court latest word on the question in sprietsma mercury marine,d analyzing federal boat safety act preemptive effect,underscore how narrow the complete preemption doctrine is.as we stressed in tyson foods and vorhees and as we stress again here,this does not mean that the federal statute in the locomotive inspection not have preemptive force.to the contrary,ordinary conflict preemption may well exist with respect to some or all of the claims.but conflict preemption,as we noted in vorhees,is merely a defense to the merits of a claim.as such,according to the complaint rule,it does not provide a basis for federal question jurisdiction.at.we see nothing in the locomotive inspection act to indicate that congress clearly intended completely to replace state law with federal law and create a federal forum at the same time.id.that is what would be necessary to create complete or field preemption,as opposed to the more routine conflict preemption.furthermore,the district court did not inquire into the question whether the federal claim includes the same ingredients as the state claim and provides some recovery,even though that is a prerequisite to finding complete preemption.see rogers,at emphasizing the need to find a private right of action under the federal law in question.both with respect to ge assertion of complete preemption,where the district court erred,and with respect to the other defendants,as to whom the district court properly recognized that only a question of conflict preemption within the competence of the state courts was presented,we believe that the district court itself lacked jurisdiction and thus that remand was required under c.naturally,the existence of a federal defense to a state claim is not enough to support federal jurisdiction.see,louisville nashville mottley.without the complete preemption theory to support the claims against the other defendants and some certainly had nothing to do with locomotive manufacture or safety,there simply was no federal question.
even if federal jurisdiction was lacking at the outset,the question arises again whether jurisdiction over the case as a whole was somehow created when birmingham steel filed its complaint against amtrak.it is clear that an original,lawsuit against amtrak would fall within the original subject matter jurisdiction of the federal court,pursuant to and.nevertheless,we must consider whether the existence of a complaint affects the court subject matter jurisdiction over the original action.we conclude that it does not.the supreme court considered a closely related problem in holmes group,vornado air circulation systems,d,where the question was whether the court of appeals for the federal circuit had appellate jurisdiction over a case in which the complaint did not allege a claim under the federal patent law,but a compulsory counterclaim filed pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure did.because the federal circuit appellate jurisdiction extends only to claims that arise under the patent laws,the court had to decide whether the counterclaim was enough to support that jurisdiction.it answered no.at.most of its discussion is a general consideration of the complaint rule,and thus is just as applicable to reliance on pleadings under rule as it was to pleadings under rule.if the plaintiff complaint is not based on a federal question,there is no jurisdiction.id.at.to allow even a compulsory counterclaim which arguably presented a stronger case for jurisdiction than a permissive counterclaim or a permissive action like the one before us to govern jurisdiction would potentially defeat the plaintiff choice of forum and radically expand the class of removable cases.id.at.
the claim might,however,permit the court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the original case,if everything arises out of the same constitutional case or controversy.but it is not clear in the present case because the district court never considered the question whether all the claims of the plaintiffs arose out of the same transaction or occurrence as the birmingham steel complaint against amtrak.without a better record,we can not venture a guess on that point.this kind of constitutional case or controversy link is a prerequisite to the assertion of supplemental jurisdiction under.see board of trustees,sheet metal workers pension fund elite erectors,cir.that statute authorizes supplemental jurisdiction only over claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.a.the statute goes on to permit supplemental jurisdiction over claims involving the joinder or intervention of additional parties,and so the fact that very few of the parties to the original action were involved in birmingham steel complaint is not necessarily a bar to the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.
once again,however,we will assume for the sake of argument that the claim against amtrak is part of the same article iii case as the entire rest of the action.we can not find that the district court was compelled to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remainder of the case,once amtrak was before it in one capacity.the normal rule is that district courts have discretion to retain or remand supplemental claims.groce eli lilly,cir.here,judge holderman appears to have been proceeding on the assumption that he probably had jurisdiction over the original ge case.one possible interpretation of his remand order is that he was deciding what to do with the supplemental claims that remained after the ge case was resolved although he used the language of waiver rather than this terminology.no matter what words he used,however,it is clear enough from his order that he thought the remainder of this case belonged in the state court,and thus he exercised whatever discretion he may have had and chose to remand those claims.if someone wants to litigate amtrak derivative liability for this most unfortunate accident,he or she can do so in a separate federal court action.in fact,now that even more cases have been filed,it is possible that there will be an eventual consolidation of cases in the northern district of illinois.as of now,however,there is no rule that permits federal courts to reach out and prevent state courts from proceeding with claims under state law that do not fall within the jurisdiction of the federal courts.the act,has no exception for this situation,even though this type of consolidation might be efficient.furthermore,we have just been reminded by the supreme court that a desire to protect federal jurisdiction is not enough to support the removal of essentially state law claims.see syngenta crop,henson,d.
for these reasons,we dismiss this appeal for want of appellate jurisdiction.in the alternative,we conclude that the district court remand was proper because of a lack of its own subject matter jurisdiction over the case,or resolving all issues as generously as possible in illinois central favor,there was no abuse of discretion in the decision to relinquish these state law claims among parties.
appeal dismissed.
as set forth in greater detail below,i believe that d does not bar review of the present appeal.furthermore,i believe that the district court erred in remanding this case to state court because of illinois central waiver of its right to a federal forum a district court exercise of jurisdiction over federal claims is mandatory and not subject to waiver.i therefore respectfully dissent.
although the majority opinion presents some background,my own review of the record indicates that a more detailed recounting of the factual and procedural underpinnings of the issues presented would be helpful to the reader.
the present case centers on a march,amtrak passenger train collision near bourbonnais,illinois.the injured victims and the deceased victims estates collectively the plaintiffs filed more than fifty personal injury and wrongful death actions in the circuit court of cook county,illinois.the complaints alleged negligence,strict products liability and breach of implied warranties on the part of several defendants.general electric ge,which designed and manufactured the locomotive,also filed an action for declaratory judgment in the northern district of illinois seeking a judgment that suits arising out of the bourbonnais accident were preempted by the locomotive inspection act,and that ge had complied with applicable federal law 
ge removed the state cases to federal court and argued that the locomotive inspection act occupied the field of locomotive safety regulation and therefore prevented the plaintiffs from bringing negligence and strict liability claims in state court.all of the defendants consented to removal.on may,the plaintiffs moved to remand.the cases were consolidated with ge action for declaratory judgment.ge then moved to dismiss the claims against it,contending that they were barred by the locomotive inspection act.on may,birmingham steel moved for leave to file a complaint against amtrak.the motion was granted,and birmingham steel complaint was docketed.
on june,the district court held a status hearing.it informed the parties that it had reached a decision on ge motion to dismiss the counts against it on the ground of preemption and on the plaintiffs motion to remand.the court further explained that it was circulating a draft opinion to the other judges who had been assigned these cases.just before this hearing,counsel for general signal had informed the district court by letter that it was withdrawing its motion to dismiss,which had been based on the preemptive effect of the federal railroad safety act frsa,et.at the hearing,the following colloquy occurred between the district court and counsel for illinois central and amtrak 
the court is there any other defendant who desires to raise any of these preemption claims other than those who have already raised the issue of preemption i notice that some defendants raised as affirmative defenses but did not move on the question,and i just want to know from the other defendants.
laing your honor,susan laing on behalf of the illinois central and amtrak.we have,in fact,raised preemption as to certain claims 
the court yes.
laing against the railroad but not all claims.and,therefore 
the court do you want me to address those,or do you want to just wait,as an affirmative defense.
laing as a basis for asserting federal jurisdiction,i have taken no position one way or the other.
the court all right.
laing as for an affirmative defense,i have a very strong position that federal law will control and preempt those claims.
the court okay.well,perhaps as to those defendants,such as amtrak,that have raised the issues but have not moved,maybe my opinion will be helpful in understanding what i believe to be the application of the law maybe i wo just go ahead and individually address it and say,well,amtrak has raised as an affirmative defense certain issues to certain claims.i will just go ahead and address the claims that have been presented and briefed and then that wo add to the clutter of the opinion,if that all right 
laing it obviously,if you asking my permission,it absolutely fine.i think that the issues are one and the same whether,in fact,federal law does preempt those areas.so,to that extent,if your opinion wants to address that,it probably would make most sense since everybody is here and all the cases are together.
june,tr.at.
after the status hearing,laing sent the court a letter dated june.this letter informed the court that,with respect to two of the cases subject to the court may,consolidation order,there had been no motion to remand.in those cases,amtrak had been named as a defendant and had removed,asserting federal jurisdiction under and.in the letter,laing also made reference to the district court inquiry about the cases that had been removed by general signal but that were now before the court in general signal motion to withdraw opposition to remand.the letter stated it is my understanding that counsel for general signal will be providing you with the definitive list of those cases.the record does not reveal when or whether general signal provided such a list.by a minute order dated june and entered on the docket on june,the district court granted general signal motion to withdraw its motion for judgment on the pleadings and its opposition to the plaintiffs motion to remand.as far as can be gleaned from the record,laing letter was the last communication between illinois central and the district court before the court issued its decision.
the district court issued its decision on june.the court initially noted that because general signal withdrew its opposition to plaintiffs motion to remand and its motion for judgment on the pleadings,this court does not consider the effect of the federal railroad safety act,upon which general signal initially relied,and which contains an express preemption clause,on this court subject matter jurisdiction or the possible preemptive effect of the frsa on plaintiffs claims.at.
the court then analyzed ge complete preemption argument with respect to the locomotive inspection act.it held that the locomotive inspection act occupied the field of locomotive safety regulation and that,consequently,any state law cause of action touching on subjects of regulation under the act implicitly states a federal cause of action.in the court view,the removed cases against general electric fall within the broad scope of actions preempted by the locomotive inspection act.at.therefore,it continued,all the claims asserted against general electric in the removed cases are preempted by federal law.id.at.thus,the court concluded,ge had the right to remove these cases from state court.the court then dismissed the claims against ge without prejudice.because the plaintiffs had not alleged any violation of federal law,the court also dismissed count of ge action for declaratory judgment,which sought a judgment that ge had complied with applicable federal regulations.
after both concluding that removal had been proper and dismissing the claims against ge,the district court remanded the remainder of the cases to state court.because no other defendants have asserted federal preemption as a basis for removal or opposed the state court plaintiffs motion to remand,all cases which were removed by general electric are hereby remanded forthwith to the circuit court of cook county.at.
illinois central filed a motion to reconsider under rule on july.illinois central advanced two arguments in support of its motion.first,it contended that the district court had jurisdiction because of the presence of amtrak,which had been added as a defendant in a complaint filed by birmingham steel on june.second,illinois central submitted that the court had jurisdiction because the frsa,like the locomotive inspection act,occupied the field of railroad safety completely consequently,the district court had subject matter jurisdiction.
the district court denied the motion to reconsider.it stated 
this court agrees with illinois central that this court likely enjoys subject matter jurisdiction over this litigation,as recognized in the court june,order.nevertheless,this court finds that remand of these cases is warranted because illinois central has expressly waived federal preemption or other federal law as a basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction.
at.the court concluded that,in the colloquy,counsel for illinois central waived federal jurisdiction by taking no position on whether the frsa provided an independent basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction.
the clear import of this exchange between counsel for illinois central and the court was that illinois central did not intend to assert federal subject matter jurisdiction in this court,but intended to raise its federal preemption defenses in the state court,or at least had no objection to this court remanding this litigation to state court.
id.the court took the view that our decision in rothner city of chicago,cir,left open the possibility that the doctrine of waiver might apply in the removal context.the court did not address illinois central specific argument about amtrak,but determined that illinois central had waived reliance on any ground of federal jurisdiction by its failure to respond to the plaintiffs motion to remand.illinois central filed a notice of appeal on august,
appellate jurisdiction 
as the majority notes,the first issue before this court is whether we have jurisdiction to consider illinois central challenge to the remand order.the plaintiffs contend that d bars appellate review of the district court remand order.for the reasons set forth below,i believe that this court has jurisdiction over the appeal.
the plaintiffs submit that appellate jurisdiction is barred by d.section d provides 
an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,except that an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed pursuant to section of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.
read in isolation,the plain language of d would seem to bar appellate jurisdiction.the supreme court,however,has interpreted d narrowly.the court has ruled that d must be read in pari materia with c,so that only remands based on grounds specified in c are immune from review under d.things remembered,petrarca,d.section c provides,in relevant part 
a motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within days after the filing of the notice of removal under section a.if at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,the case shall be remanded.
c.as long as a district court remand is based on a timely raised defect in the removal procedure or on lack of jurisdiction a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of the remand order under d.things remembered,at.the plaintiffs identify no defect in the removal procedure,or any other defect fitting the first sentence of c.
attention to the development of the rule articulated in things remembered,both in the supreme court and in the courts of appeals,provides significant guidance to the analysis of this case.in thermtron products,hermansdorfer,d,the supreme court held that d did not bar appellate review of a district court remand order that was based on the court overburdened docket.see thermtron,at.the court traced the history of d and concluded that congress had intended to link d with c.see id.at.after doing so,the court concluded that t here is no indication whatsoever that congress intended to extend the prohibition against review to reach remand orders entered on grounds not provided by statute.id.at.thus,s ection d is not dispositive of the reviewability of remand orders in and of itself.id.at.appellate jurisdiction is proper when the district court order was based on grounds wholly different from those upon which c permits remand.id.at.
in quackenbush allstate insurance,d,the supreme court concluded that appellate jurisdiction was proper over an remand order.the district court in quackenbush had decided that abstention under the burford doctrine was appropriate to prevent federal interference with the state regulation of an insurance company insolvency the district court remanded the action to state court on that ground.see quackenbush,at.the supreme court disposed of the d argument,noting that t he district court remand order does not fall into either category of remand order described in c,as it is not based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction or defects in removal procedure.id.at.
the courts of appeals have elaborated on the rule announced in thermtron.for instance,in benson si handling systems,cir,we reviewed a district court decision to remand to state court on the ground that successive removals are improper.we held neither c nor anything else in the sections of the judicial code devoted to removal forbids successive removals.the rule against there is such a an judicial invention,and thus subject to the appellate process.id.in clorox united states district court,cir,the ninth circuit held that a remand on the ground that the removing party had waived its right to remove was reviewable on appeal.see also pelleport investors,budco quality theatres,cir.several courts of appeals,including ours,have held that sua sponte remands based on defects in the removal procedure are outside of c and thus subject to appellate review.see in re continental cas,cir whole health chiropractic humana med.plan,cir in re fmc.packaging,cir page city of southfield,cir in re allstate ins,cir.
in setting the limits of our jurisdiction in conformity with the supreme court interpretive mandates in thermtron,things remembered and quackenbush,we have said that,when a district court asserts jurisdiction but later events call that jurisdiction into question and ultimately result in a later remand,we have jurisdiction to review that remand order.see in re shell oil,cir in re amoco petroleum additives,cir bogle phillips petroleum,cir.in shell oil,we reviewed a district court decision to remand a case,previously removed based on the court diversity jurisdiction,after the plaintiffs stipulated that they would seek damages below the jurisdictional amount.see shell oil,at.there,we held that resolution of the case depended on the reason for the district court remand.see id.at.if the district court believed that the case was properly removed,but that the stipulation justified a remand,then we may review the order.id.if,however,the district court believed that jurisdiction was missing at the outset,then d would block any review,even though we might disagree with that decision.accord van meter state farm fire cas,cir i f a district court determines subject matter jurisdiction to have existed at the time of removal,yet remands for alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on some event s,the remand order is not a section c remand order and is reviewable.when the district court appears to have asserted jurisdiction,the possibility that the remand order was issued pursuant to c for lack of jurisdiction is removed.lyons alaska teamsters employer,cir.stated another way,once the district court makes the unreviewable decision under c,unless new facts emerge that call the initial removal into question,any subsequent remand order is subject to appellate review 
these decisions acknowledge that c is necessarily tied to a temporal reference point,namely,the time of removal.van meter,at.the dispositive question is when was there jurisdiction at the time of removal,vanishing because of the change in the identity of the plaintiffs if so,we may review the remand order.amoco petroleum,at.w e understand university cohill,d,to permit review when the district judge believes that removal was proper and that later developments authorize remand.id.if the district court believed that the case was properly removed,but that subsequent events justified a remand,then we may review the order.shell oil,at.
it is with these principles in mind that this court should evaluate the district court opinion to determine the precise grounds of its decision.if it was based on one of the grounds set forth in c,review is barred.if,however,the district court grounded its decision in a reason not set forth in c,then d does not prohibit review by this court.
a plain and common sense reading of the district court june opinion is the starting point for this analysis.heaton monogram credit card bank,cir.the removing defendant,ge,removed this case from state court on the ground that the locomotive inspection act completely preempted any state regulation of locomotive safety therefore,the court concluded,removal was proper.the district court agreed that the locomotive inspection act occupied completely the field of locomotive safety and therefore permitted removal on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.had the district court determined that this act did not occupy the field of locomotive safety and that no other ground for removal was present,and remanded on those grounds,our review would be barred by d.however,after resolving the jurisdictional issue in favor of ge,the court proceeded to grant ge motion to dismiss,a decision also based on the ground of preemption.at this point,ge was no longer a party to the case.
the district court then turned to the remainder of the case.another defendant,general signal,had maintained that the frsa preempted completely the plaintiffs claims and therefore served as a basis for removal to federal court.after the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand,general signal initially filed an opposition and moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground of complete preemption.however,general signal later withdrew its opposition to the remand and apparently withdrew from the litigation pursuant to a settlement.the district court then remanded the remaining cases to state court b ecause no other defendants have asserted federal preemption as a basis for removal or opposed the state court plaintiffs motion to remand at.notably,the court did not remand the case because it believed that,once ge was dismissed,federal subject matter jurisdiction had been lost.nor did it hold that there was not complete preemption under the frsa,as general signal had urged prior to its withdrawal.indeed,the court specifically noted that it believed that it had subject matter jurisdiction.in its order denying illinois central motion to reconsider,it stated 
this court agrees with illinois central that this court likely enjoys subject matter jurisdiction over this litigation,as recognized in the court june,order.nevertheless,this court finds that remand of these cases is warranted because illinois central has expressly waived federal preemption or other federal law as a basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction.
the district court therefore made clear that its remand was not based on c,but on an,or election of the remaining parties not to persist in the position taken by general signal prior to its withdrawal from the litigation that the frsa totally preempted the field of railway safety.in re shell oil,cir holding that the ban on reviewability contained in d is not applicable where the trial judge articulated a reason for remanding the case that is not found in c.
assessing the district court statements in the procedural context in which they arose,i can not agree with the majority that t he present case is best regarded as one in which the court never had any jurisdiction over the claim.see supra at.the district court did not conclude that it lacked the authority to decide the case.it accepted jurisdiction and resolved one aspect of the case when it determined that the state claims against ge were preempted by the locomotive inspection act.it then reviewed the remainder of the case.it decided to remand the case,not because it believed that it lacked jurisdiction,but because no remaining party continued to assert another ground for removal.the court did not cite c as a basis for its action.indeed,it stated explicitly that it did not believe that it lacked jurisdiction.the district court remanded the case on the ground of waiver,a ground not listed in c.neither c nor anything else in the sections of the judicial code devoted to removal authorizes a remand for waiver.see benson,at noting that there was nothing in the judicial code forbidding successive removals and thus the court of appeals had jurisdiction to review the district court decision to remand on that ground.such a rule would be an judicial invention,and thus subject to the appellate process.id.therefore,contrary to the view taken by my colleagues,i believe that this court has jurisdiction over this appeal 
because i believe this court has appellate jurisdiction,i next must consider illinois central contention that the district court should not have remanded the case to state court.the district court stated in its order denying illinois central motion to reconsider that t his court agrees with illinois central that this court likely enjoys subject matter jurisdiction over this litigation nevertheless,this court finds that remand of these cases is warranted because illinois central has expressly waived federal preemption or other federal law as a basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction.
in this court,illinois central claims that there are two bases for the district court jurisdiction and that the district court incorrectly ignored both.first,illinois central contends that,because amtrak was a party to the litigation,having been added by birmingham steel complaint,the court had federal question jurisdiction under.second,illinois central argues that the frsa occupies the field of railroad safety therefore the plaintiffs claims,although styled as state law tort actions,were really federal claims that invoked the district court federal question jurisdiction.
the district court was confronted with a highly complex,unusual and fluid situation.yet,after reflection,i must conclude that the court misapprehended the limitations on its authority to remand and its corollary responsibility to exercise jurisdiction over federal claims.it appears that this misstep may be due to a failure to distinguish sufficiently the criteria governing removal from the situations in which a remand is permitted the fifth circuit has had occasion to explain this distinction 
unquestionably,a party may implicitly waive its right to remove a case by failing timely to file a notice of removal.likewise,a party may implicitly waive its right to contest the removal of a case on procedural grounds by failing timely to move for remand.nevertheless,the ability of a party to remove a case and the ability of a court to remand a case that has been properly removed by a party,are distinct concepts not necessarily subject to the same rules.although parties may waive their rights to remove a case or to contest the removal procedure,they may neither confer subject matter jurisdiction on the district court nor strip it of such jurisdiction by agreement or waiver.the authority of a district court to remand a properly removed case is dependent on the nature of the claims which the case comprises and the nature of the district court jurisdiction over those claims.the fact that the fdic waived its right to remove the instant case is irrelevant to the determination of whether the case should have or could have been remanded once it had been properly removed by another party who had not waived the right to remove.
buchner fdic,cir citations omitted.consequently,the inquiry this court must address is whether the district court had the authority to remand the action involving amtrak in the circumstances presented here.
the authority of a district court to remand a case is not discretionary.indeed,as explained by the supreme court in thermtron products,hermansdorfer,d,that power is quite circumscribed w e are not convinced that congress ever intended to extend carte blanche authority to the district courts to revise the federal statutes governing removal by remanding cases on grounds that seem justifiable to them but which are not recognized by the controlling statute.the court reinforced and elaborated on its thermtron decision in university cohill,d 
the thermtron decision was a response to a clearly impermissible remand,of a kind very different from that at issue here.in thermtron,the district court had no authority to decline to hear the removed case.the court had diversity jurisdiction over the case,which is not discretionary.thus the district court could not properly have eliminated the case from its docket,whether by a remand or a dismissal.
id.at.i believe,therefore,that this court must turn to the statutory bases for remand to determine if a remand was appropriate in the circumstances presented here.
there are three statutory provisions that address a district court authority to remand.one grant of remand authority is found among the removal provisions,c.section c states 
a motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within days after the filing of the notice of removal under section a.if at any time before final judgment,it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,the case shall be remanded.
c.it is well established that the district court jurisdictional inquiry for purposes of c is determined as of the time the removal petition is filed.see gossmeyer mcdonald,cir w hether subject matter jurisdiction exists is a question answered by looking at the complaint as it existed at the time the petition for removal was filed.emphasis in original.
also speaks to a district court authority to remand.specifically,c provides that 
w henever a separate and independent claim or cause of action within the jurisdiction conferred by section of this title federal question jurisdiction is joined with one or more otherwise claims or causes of action,the entire case may be removed and the district court may determine all issues therein,or,in its discretion,may remand all matters in which state law predominates.
c.by its terms,c applies only to separate and independent claims.in american fire casualty finn,the supreme court explained that t he addition of the word independent gives emphasis to congressional intention to require more complete disassociation between the federally cognizable proceedings and those cognizable only in state courts before allowing removal.the claims to which applies is further limited by the requirements that the claims be joined and removed.section c applies only to claims that were joined with a federal question claim while in state court,first national bank of pulaski curry,cir interpreting joined narrowly to apply only to claims joined by the plaintiff in the original state court action,and also that were removed c does not encompass claims added in federal court.
provides a final statutory basis for remanding a claim to state court under c,a court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim that is related to the underlying action if the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction,or if the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.although,strictly read,does not speak in terms of a remand,codifies the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction.in,the supreme court established the right of a district court to remand,as opposed to only dismiss,a pendent claim 
a district court has discretion to remand to state court a removed case involving pendent claims upon a proper determination that retaining jurisdiction over the case would be inappropriate.the discretion to remand enables district courts to deal with cases involving pendent claims in the manner that best serves the principles of economy,convenience,fairness,and comity which underlie the pendent jurisdiction doctrine.
at.the power to remand,however,is limited to claims over which the district court has only supplemental jurisdiction the power does not extend to claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction.see in re city of mobile,cir borough of mifflin lancaster,cir 
thus,absent a claim for abstention,a district court may remand when one of three situations arises it discovers that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction for the initial removal it concludes that state law predominates in a removed claim that is separate and independent from the removed federal question claim or it determines that it should not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a state law claim.
evaluating the district court action against the statutory options outlined above,i believe that the district court remand order may have seem ed justifiable to the court,but was not cognizable under the controlling statute s.thermtron,at.first,c does not provide a basis for the remand ordered by the district court.as noted previously,c is necessarily tied to a temporal reference point,namely,the time of removal.van meter state farm fire cas,cir.with respect to the initial removal,the district court agreed with the removing defendant,ge,that the locomotive inspection act occupied completely the field of locomotive safety,that this complete preemption provided a basis for federal question jurisdiction and,therefore,that removal was proper.consequently,the district court did not,and could not,rely on c to remand amtrak claim after it made the determination that initial removal was proper.
neither can the district court order be grounded in c.section c allows a district court to remand only separate and independent claims joined and removed with a federal question claim.however,as a claim,the claim against amtrak is not separate and independent from the actions brought by the plaintiffs against the original defendants.more fundamentally,the action was not joined and removed with the action against ge the action against amtrak was instituted in district court.
finally,the district court remand order finds no support in.section allows a district court to remand a claim based on the court supplemental jurisdiction.the authority to remand pursuant to does not encompass claims over which the district court has federal question jurisdiction.here,the presence of amtrak in the litigation constituted a valid basis for federal question jurisdiction.because amtrak is a federally chartered corporation in which the united states owns more than of the outstanding stock,it may litigate in federal court.see see,wyant passenger,stating that it is that federal courts have jurisdiction over cases in which amtrak is a party.cases involving federally chartered corporations such as amtrak arise under the laws of the united states and,therefore,come within the court federal question jurisdiction.see wayne.valley,cir a claim against a wholly owned federal corporation created under an act of congress,such as tva,falls within the general grant of federal question jurisdiction found in holl
