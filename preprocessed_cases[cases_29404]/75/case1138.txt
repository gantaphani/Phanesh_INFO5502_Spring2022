defendant andrew mace was convicted of violating vehicle code section for leaving the scene of a accident without assisting a person injured in the accident.on appeal,mace raises various instructional errors.we hold that a driver knowledge that a person involved in an accident is injured gives rise to a duty to ascertain what assistance the injured person may need.we also hold that any person who is considered a driver for purposes of the statutes has a duty to render assistance to other persons in the same vehicle who are injured in the accident,including the actual driver of the vehicle.we reject mace remaining arguments and affirm the judgment.

discussion 
mace was convicted of violating section.although a violation of section is popularly denominated,the act made criminal thereunder is not the hitting but the running.people corners d.section,subdivision a,provides the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to a person,other than himself or herself,or in the death of a person shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the accident and shall fulfill the requirements of sections and.
section,subdivision a,in turn,requires t he driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of any person,among other things,to render to any person injured in the accident reasonable assistance,including transporting,or making arrangements for transporting,any injured person to a physician,surgeon,or hospital for medical or surgical treatment if it is apparent that treatment is necessary or if that transportation is requested by any injured person.

jury instructions 
on appeal,mace raises three instructional errors.at trial,mace did not object to the instructions and did not request the amplifying and pinpoint instructions discussed in his opening and supplemental appellate briefs.ordinarily,a party may not complain on appeal that an instruction correct in law and responsive to the evidence was too general or incomplete unless the party has requested appropriate clarifying or amplifying language.people lang cal d,see also people scheer th,scheer appellant forfeited issues on appeal by failing to object to caljic and failing to request amplifying instructions.we will address mace arguments for two reasons he claims the instructions did not include all the elements of the offense and this violated his right to due process see,and because he raises an claim based on trial counsel failure to request pinpoint instructions.
after conference with counsel in chambers,the court instructed the jury with a modified version of caljic 
the defendant is accused in count three of having committed the crime of felony hit and run,in violation of section a b of the vehicle code.
every person who,as a driver of any vehicle,is knowingly involved in an accident resulting in injury to any other person other than himself must,one,immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the accident.
two,give his name,current residence address,registration number of the vehicle he is driving,and the name and current address of the owner of the vehicle to the person struck or the driver or occupants of any vehicle collided with and to any traffic or police officer at the scene of the accident and the driver or injured occupant of the driver vehicle shall,upon request,if available,exhibit his or her driver license to such person persons or officer.
three,render reasonable assistance to any person injured in the accident,including the transportation or making arrangements for the transportation of any injured person to a physician,surgeon,or hospital for medical or surgical treatment if it is apparent that such treatment is necessary or that transportation is requested by the injured person.
a willful failure of a driver of any vehicle to comply with any one of these duties when involved in an accident resulting in injury is a violation of vehicle code section a b sic of a crime.
the word knowingly means that the driver of the vehicle involved knew that an accident had occurred,knew that he was involved in the accident,and either knew that the accident resulted in injury to a person or knew that it was necessary or knew that it was of such nature that it was probable that it resulted in injury.
the word involved as used in this instruction means being connected with an accident in the natural or logical manner.
to be involved in an accident does not require that the vehicle collide with another vehicle or person.
in order to prove a violation of vehicle code section a b,each of the following elements must be proved 
a person,while driving a motor vehicle,was involved in an accident resulting in injury to another person.
that person knew that the accident had occurred,knew that he was involved in the accident,and either knew that the other person had been injured or from the nature of the accident it was probable that another person had been injured.
that person willfully failed to perform one or more of the following duties.
a to immediately stop at the scene of the accident,b to give his name,current resident address,the registration number of the vehicle,and the name and current resident address of the owner of the vehicle to the person injured or to the driver or the occupants of the other vehicle,if any,and to any traffic or police officer at the scene of the accident and,though requested,failed to show his available driver license.
c,to render reasonable assistance to the person injured.
before you may find that the defendant violated vehicle code section a b,you must agree that the defendant failed to perform one or more of the foregoing duties and also unanimously agree on at least one particular duty that he failed to perform.
if you unanimously agree that you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of a violation of vehicle code section a b,you should find him not guilty in count three.
the court also gave caljic,explaining the duties of a nondriving owner of a vehicle 
the term driver of the vehicle as used in these instructions includes the owner of the vehicle who is riding therein at the time of the accident with full authority to direct and control the operation of the vehicle although some other person may be doing the actual driving.
under these circumstances,the owner of the vehicle,which,to his knowledge,has been involved in an accident resulting in injury or death to any person is required by law to cause the vehicle to stop and to perform the other duties imposed upon the driver of the vehicle as you have been instructed.
knowledge of an injured person need for assistance 
mace first argument is that the trial court erred by failing to instruct on knowledge of the duty to render assistance.mace argues that it is not enough to instruct the jury that it must find that a defendant knew that an accident occurred,knew he was involved in it,and knew that a person was injured or that it was probable that a person had been injured based on the circumstances.according to mace,the jury must be instructed that,in addition to finding that the defendant knew a person was injured,it must find that the defendant knew assistance was required,or would have reasonably anticipated assistance was necessary.italics omitted.
the people respond that sections and reasonably place the onus on the driver to check on the welfare of others in his vehicle when a collision occurs.we agree that,where a driver knows that a person has been injured in an accident,a duty arises to determine whether the injured person needs assistance.
in scheer,supra,th at page,the court recognized the driver duty to render necessary assistance under vehicle code section,at a minimum,requires that the driver first ascertain what assistance,if any,the injured person needs,and then the driver must make a reasonable effort to see that such assistance is provided,whether through himself or third parties.here,the jury was properly instructed that,to convict,it must find mace either knew that the accident resulted in injury to a person or knew that it was of such nature that it was probable that it resulted in injury.the jury,therefore,must have found that mace knew that pauline was injured or knew the accident was of the nature that it was probable that she was injured.under scheer,this triggered a duty to ascertain what assis
