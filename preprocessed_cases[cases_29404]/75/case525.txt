the decatur county commissioners,the shelby county commissioners and the city of shelbyville,all indiana entities,as well as five rail shippers,lowe pellets grains,premier ag,kolkmeier brothers feed,greensburg milling,and kova fertilizer,the petitioners seek to review an order of the surface transportation board board or stb,declining to penalize the central railroad company of indiana cind for its embargo of a portion of the shelbyville line.we affirm the decision of the board.
the shelbyville line is the last miles of the shelbyville secondary track.the shelbyville secondary track runs from cincinnati,ohio,milepost to shelbyville,indiana milepost.the secondary track had been approved for abandonment in,but was subsequently returned to service when consolidated rail corporation conrail,its owner,entered into an agreement with the state of indiana and local interests to provide local and overhead,traffic that neither originated nor terminated on the line carrier rail service on the line.when that agreement expired,conrail and the states of indiana and ohio negotiated to return the line to common carrier service.as a result of the negotiations,cind acquired the shelbyville secondary track from conrail in and assumed common carrier obligations.
although,when cind acquired the line,almost all of it met federal railroad administration fra class standards,which permitted trains to be operated at miles per hour on the line,cind spent approximately to restore the line to an appropriate condition for common carrier service.over the next two years,cind continued to maintain the segment between milepost and milepost,but maintenance otherwise was deferred,and approximately miles of track deteriorated to fra class standards.fra class standards are the minimum standards for an operating rail line and permit trains to run at miles per hour.see.in october,cind applied for federal local rail freight assistance lrfa funds to rehabilitate the track between milepost and milepost essentially the subsequently embargoed segment to fra class standards.the lrfa funds were to be used to replace crossties and to perform ditching and surfacing.the grant application did not mention that any grant money would be used to remedy erosion and slippage.
cind underwent a management change in november.the new management embarked on a program to rehabilitate the entire shelbyville line to fra class standards.the segment between sunman,indiana,at milepost,and greensburg,indiana,at milepost,was rehabilitated to fra class standards in.cind application for lrfa funds was also granted in part.as a condition of the grant,however,cind was required to spend of its own funds for each of lrfa funds that it spent.cind never used the lrfa grant funds.
cind became aware,during an inspection trip,of slippage,erosion,slides and other problems between milepost and milepost after heavy spring rains in.the railroad made temporary repairs to permit continued operations but held off on a permanent resolution,claiming uncertainty about the shelbyville line viability.cind ceased operating over the segment between milepost and milepost on february,after its personnel and a consultant inspected the line and found that significant slippage had occurred at milepost.
on the same day,cind president,christopher burger,telephoned to inform the five shippers who are petitioners in this case,and later notified them by letter,that rail operations were being discontinued over the affected segment but that cind would continue to serve them from the west.none of the shippers are located along the segment itself.burger advised the shippers that they would soon be notified of rate changes in connection with the new routing.he also warned them that the affected segment might not be repaired,stating,based upon our knowledge of existing and potential traffic,we do not believe at this time that the expense of repairing,rehabilitating and continuing to operate the line can be justified.
at the time cind stopped operations over the affected segment,the shelbyville line handled primarily overhead traffic,which could be rerouted over other lines.most of the shelbyville line overhead traffic had come from conrail.but,in,the completion of a major rail infrastructure project in cincinnati had relieved some of the congestion that had prompted conrail to route some of its traffic over cind.the bulk of the traffic over the shelbyville line,however,still consisted of this conrail interchange traffic.
a week after cind ceased operations on the segment,cind rerouted its conrail interchange traffic from indianapolis to sharonville,indiana.cind also rerouted traffic originating or terminating on the shelbyville line as necessary so that all shippers could receive uninterrupted rail service using routes that did not involve the segment.two weeks later,on march,cind announced surcharges of to,effective on april,on all carloads moving between the shelbyville line and interchange points at shelbyville,indianapolis or frankfort,indiana.
in response,on april,the petitioners filed a complaint with the board pursuant to b and asserted that cind had unlawfully discontinued operations on a rail line in violation of and had imposed unlawful surcharges on freight in violation of the petitioners sought restoration of service by asking the board to order immediate repairs of the embargoed segment and requested an award of damages for the costs associated with their shift to transportation by trucks instead of by rail.
on april,cind officially placed an embargo on the segment of the line between milepost and milepost.on april,cind filed an answer to the petitioners complaint,denying the allegations in the complaint.thereafter,cind filed a motion to stay proceedings,indicating its intent to submit an abandonment petition with the board sometime in the future.by an order dated september,the board decided to initiate an investigative proceeding and denied cind motion to stay.
in the interim,cind had been trying to increase the traffic over the shelbyville line.in late,a decision was made to sell conrail lines in part to csx transportation,csxt,and in part to norfolk southern railway company ns.csxt was to acquire the conrail line from which cind received most of its overhead traffic,but csxt would be able to reroute that traffic over its own lines without using cind lines.between october and october,cind engaged in negotiations with csxt and ns,seeking favorable restructured traffic flows and other concessions in connection with the planned acquisition of conrail by the other railroads.although these negotiations led to certain agreements by csxt and ns to mitigate some of the harm of lost traffic to cind,there was no agreement benefiting the shelbyville line.thus,on january,cind filed a petition for an exemption from stb regulation,pursuant to so that cind could abandon the entire shelbyville line.the petition for exemption was denied.the board found the record inadequate and advised that a formal application for abandonment should be filed under if cind wished to pursue abandonment.cind filed a petition to reopen the exemption proceedings on may,and replies in opposition were filed on june.
railtex,then sought authority to acquire cind,which was granted.in a letter filed on november,cind,now a railtex subsidiary,notified the board that it had decided to resume operations over the entire shelbyville line,and it withdrew its petition to reopen the exemption proceeding.on september,the board issued an order denying the petitioners complaint.the board found that cind failure to operate over the embargoed segment of the shelbyville line during a twenty month period was not unlawful,cind did not violate its common carrier obligations and the establishment of the surcharges of to did not violate.decatur county comm rs cent.of,at surface transp.bd,stb decision.because operations on the entire shelbyville line had been restored in november,the board did not consider,in its order denying the complaint,the petitioners request for an order restoring service on the line.petitioners now appeal from the board determination that the embargo remained reasonable during the period.
this court has jurisdiction to review final orders of the stb pursuant to a.our review of a decision by the board is narrow.we will affirm an order that is supported by substantial evidence.see rltd ry.surface transp,cir citing icc louisville nashville.we review a determination of the board regarding an embargo under the high level of deference accorded to an agency reasonable interpretation of the statutes which the agency administers.united transp.legislative bd.surface transp,cir citing chevron,natural res.defs.council,d.
the statutory common carrier obligation imposes a duty upon railroads to provide transportation or services on reasonable request.a.a railroad may not refuse to provide services merely because to do so would be inconvenient or unprofitable.roofing prods.surface transp,cir.the common carrier obligation,however,is not absolute.id.a valid embargo will relieve a carrier of its obligation to provide service.id.at.an embargo can be imposed by a carrier to temporarily cease or limit service when it is physically unable to serve specific shipper locations.under its common carrier obligation,the embargoing railroad must restore service within a reasonable period of time.id.
to be valid,an embargo must be reasonable at all times.roofing,at.the board employs a balancing test to determine the reasonableness of an embargo.under this test,the board considers the cost to repair the railroad the intent of the railroad the length of the embargo the amount of traffic on the line and the financial condition of the carrier.id.the reasonableness of an embargo involves a inquiry and is to be determined on a basis.id.here,the board applied the balancing test and concluded that the embargo remained reasonable at all times.the petitioners contend that the board erroneously applied the balancing test.they argue that the board erred in considering the cost to rehabilitate the entire shelbyville line the board determination of cind intent was not supported by substantial evidence the board erred in determining that cind acted reasonably in imposing an embargo for twenty months and the board erred in relying on the projected profitability of the shelbyville line.we address these arguments in turn,in the context of the board balancing test.
as the first step in applying its balancing test,the board examines the cost to repair the railroad to return it to safe operating condition.in the present case,the board found that the cost to repair the embargoed portion of the line to fra class standards the minimum operating standard for a rail line was.the board also found that the cost to repair the portion of the shelbyville line to fra class standards was.thus,the board determined that the cost to repair the entire line was.
the petitioners argue that,since the board calculated this latter number the figure,the board considered that figure,which was the cost to repair the entire line,instead of the cost to repair only the embargoed portion of the line.using the cost to repair the entire line was erroneous,the petitioners allege,because the proper standard for assessing the cost of repair should focus on the cost of resuming services at levels.roofing,at.but we believe that the board properly examined the cost of resuming services as prescribed in roofing.
in the present case,to determine the cost of resuming services at level,the board had to decide how much of the line needed repairs and how extensive those repairs needed to be.to operate at all,the line had to be restored to fra class standards.before the embargo,the entire shelbyville line operated at fra class standards or better.and,unlike the railroad in roofing,cind had never received an exception to run its lines at standards below fra class standards.thus,since the embargoed segment could not be used unless the rest of the line was at least up to the lowest operating standards,the board correctly focused on the cost of resuming services at levels when it examined the cost to repair the shelbyville line to fra class standards.
the board,however,contends that it examined the cost to repair the entire shelbyville line,not with respect to factor of the balancing test,but in connection with its study of the financial condition of cind factor of the balancing test.as we have indicated,however,even if the board had considered the cost to repair the whole rail line under factor of that test,the board did not err.the reasonableness of an embargo is determined on a basis.roofing,at.in this case,there are no shippers located within the embargoed portion of the line.hence,it was proper to take into account the cost of repairing the portions of the line since those parts of the line had to be used to serve the shippers.thus,the board did examine the cost of resuming services at levels because,in order to service the shippers,the whole shelbyville line would have to be repaired to fra class standards.and of course,the cost to rehabilitate the entire line would also play a part in assessing the financial condition of the railroad another factor in the balancing test.
as the second step in its balancing test,the board examined the intent of the carrier with respect to the abandonment.as applied here,did the railroad allow the line segment to deteriorate and remain in condition in order to hasten abandonment of the service in the proceedings below,the petitioners argued that cind intended to abandon the shelbyville line and furthered this intent by delaying needed maintenance and depressing traffic.the board,however,found otherwise.
we find that cind acted reasonably in not making in erosion repairs in.prior to the slippage at milepost,cind had adopted a policy of applying its limited resources to the profitable southeast end of its system between milepost and milepost to hold down expenses cind was in a difficult financial condition and faced dim prospects for increased traffic and revenues.we find no credible evidence that cind was deliberately downgrading,or actively discouraging traffic on,a viable line simply to facilitate its abandonment.similarly,the evidence fails to show that cind should have known that the slippage at milepost would worsen,that the cost of repair would escalate,and that the failure to make the repair in would eventually lead to a discontinuance of cind operations over the affected segment.
stb decision at.the board also found that cind did not intentionally downgrade the service and discourage traffic in the years preceding the embargo.id.at.finally,the board found that cind made diligent efforts to satisfy its common carrier obligations by making,or being prepared to make,alternative shipping arrangements.id.at.on appeal,the petitioners argue that the evidence in the record does not support the board conclusion that cind was applying its resources to the southeast end of the system.they cite evidence indicating that cind had taken steps to repair and maintain various other segments of the line.this evidence,however,does not contradict the board conclusion that cind was focusing on the southeast portion of the shelbyville line.cind did make efforts to maintain some other portions of the shelbyville line.cind made these efforts to maintain some other portions of the line because it was required to keep the entire line at fra class standards or better because fra class standards are the minimum operating standards for a railroad.the board finding on this issue is supported by the evidence that cind deferred maintenance on about miles of the shelbyville line and allowed those portions,some of which were at fra class standards,to deteriorate to fra class standards.stb decision at.thus,the board findings on cind intent,namely that cind did not deliberately downgrade the line or discourage traffic on it in order to facilitate its abandonment,were amply supported by substantial evidence.
the third factor to be considered under the balancing test is the length of the embargo.the petitioners contend that the board conclusion that the embargo remained reasonable throughout its life is an unreasonable interpretation of cind common carrier obligation.but the board concluded
