carlos lopez petitions for review of the decision of the federal aviation administration faa not to renew his appointment as a designated engineering representative der.he challenges the decision on substantive and procedural grounds as well as maintaining that he had a property and liberty interest in the continued renewal of his designation,entitling him to due process under the fifth amendment.although the court does not have jurisdiction to review the substance of the faa decision because it is committed to agency discretion by law,a,the court does have jurisdiction to review lopez procedural claim that the faa failed to follow its nonrenewal procedures.insofar as there was any such failure,we hold that lopez has failed to show prejudice and that,in light of circuit precedent,because his claim of a liberty or property interest in a der designation is without merit,lopez can not show that he was entitled to renewal of his status or to constitutional due process.accordingly,we deny the petition for review.
