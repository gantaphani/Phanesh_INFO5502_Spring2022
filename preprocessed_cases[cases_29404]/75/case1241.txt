steven gourley,director of the department of motor vehicles dmv of the state of california and to dmv director sally reed,appeals a judgment granting a petition for writ of mandate.code civ.the judgment overturns a decision of the dmv which suspended the driving privilege of daniel macdonald macdonald for one year for driving with a blood alcohol concentration bac of percent or above 
vehicle code section requires the arresting officer to set forth all information relevant to the enforcement action in a sworn report to the dmv the essential issue presented is whether,in reviewing the suspension,the dmv is limited to considering the information set forth in the arresting officer sworn report.
after considering the statutory scheme and pertinent case law,we conclude the requirement that the arresting officer set forth all relevant information in a sworn report does not preclude the dmv from considering the arresting officer unsworn report.it appears solovij gourley th,d,relied on by the trial court,was wrongly decided.the judgment is reversed with directions to reinstate the suspension.
factual and procedural background 
on march,at,california highway patrol chp officer lawrence lawrence observed macdonald driving westbound on the freeway at de soto.macdonald drove in lane,then drifted two feet into lane,and then drifted back to the right.macdonald right tires then crossed five feet onto the right shoulder.he continued driving partially on the shoulder for a distance and then exited at the topanga canyon offramp.
lawrence initiated a traffic stop.he noted that macdonald eyes were red and watery,his speech was thick and slurred,and there was an odor of alcohol emanating from his breath.macdonald admitted he had been drinking.
macdonald failed several standard field sobriety tests.macdonald preliminary alcohol screening tests showed a bac of and percent.
lawrence arrested macdonald and transported him to the west valley police station where breath tests disclosed a bac of sample and sample percent,respectively.lawrence issued an administrative per se order,confiscated macdonald driver license and issued him a temporary license.
on the date of the incident,lawrence completed a sworn report on dmv form.with respect to the facts and circumstances which led to the stop,lawrence wrote obs,subject vehicle driving desoto to topanga weaving side to side in made.
on the same date,lawrence completed chp form,driving under the influence report,an unsworn report see fn,infra,which included a more detailed narrative of the above circumstances leading to the stop and arrest.
both the and the reports were transmitted to the dmv.
the administrative hearing.
macdonald requested an administrative hearing to overturn the suspension of his driving privilege.
the hearing was held on december,the persons present were the hearing officer and macdonald counsel.
the hearing officer admitted five documents into evidence exhibit,lawrence sworn statement on dmv form exhibit,lawrence unsworn narrative statement on chp form exhibit,the intoxilyzer report indicating a bac of sample and sample percent,respectively exhibit,administrative per se order and temporary driver license and exhibit,macdonald driving record.
on macdonald behalf,the declaration of a forensic toxicologist,darrell clardy,was submitted and received into evidence as exhibit 
macdonald counsel objected to exhibit,chp form,arguing an unsworn report by an officer is inadmissible hearsay.the hearing officer overruled the objection and issued a notification of findings and decision,sustaining the license suspension based on lawrence sworn statement,dmv form,and the arrest report,chp form,which accompanied it.the dmv decision suspended macdonald driving privilege for one year.
superior court proceedings.
macdonald filed a petition for writ of mandate code civ,to set aside the suspension.macdonald alleged the dmv erred in admitting the unsworn form into evidence and allowing its use as a basis for a determination that there was probable cause to stop the vehicle.
in opposition,the dmv contended the unsworn form was properly received in evidence,and the statutory scheme does not limit the evidence at the hearing to sworn testimony.further,there was probable cause to stop macdonald because he was weaving across two lanes and drove onto the shoulder of the freeway.he was an accident waiting to happen.had the officers not stopped petitioner,he could have injured himself others.
the trial court granted the petition,ruling as follows facts stated in the arresting officer unsworn report do not comply with section,which requires all information relevant to the enforcement action to be set forth in the officer sworn report.here,the arresting officer sworn report,the dmv report,merely stated the subject vehicle was weaving from side to side in w lane.there is no indication of the distance or duration of such weaving.weaving back and forth within one own lane,without specific facts to establish that the weaving was pronounced or went on for some substantial distance,is not sufficient to establish probable cause.further,pursuant to solovij gourley,supra,th,d,the dmv could not rely on the arresting officer unsworn report to establish probable cause for the stop therefore,the dmv decision to suspend macdonald driver license was not according to law and constituted an abuse of discretion.
the dmv filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.
contentions 
the dmv contends the weight of the evidence supports the dmv suspension of macdonald driving privilege because lawrence had reasonable cause to believe macdonald was driving under the influence macdonald was lawfully arrested he was driving a motor vehicle with a bac of percent or greater the hearing officer properly admitted and relied upon lawrence and statements to find probable cause for macdonald stop and to uphold the license suspension.
discussion 
overview of the administrative per se statutory scheme.
under the statutory procedure known as the administrative per se law,the dmv must immediately suspend the driver license of a person who is driving with percent or more,by weight,of alcohol in his or her blood,subd.a.the procedure is called administrative per se because it does not impose criminal penalties,but simply suspends a person driver license as an administrative matter upon a showing the person was arrested for driving with a certain bac,without additional evidence of impairment.lake reed cal th,fn,d.the express legislative purposes of the administrative suspension procedure are to provide safety to persons using the highways by quickly suspending the driving privilege of persons who drive with excessive levels to guard against erroneous deprivation by providing a prompt administrative review of the suspension and to place no restriction on the ability of a prosecutor to pursue related criminal actions.id.at,d.
as explained in lake reed,wherein the supreme court dealt in depth with the purposes and procedures of the administrative per se law,the enactment was deemed necessary due to the time lag that often occurs between an arrest and a conviction for driving while intoxicated or with a prohibited bac.during this interim period,arrestees who eventually could be convicted of an driving offense were permitted to continue driving and,possibly,endangering the public thereby.moreover,without administrative per se laws,persons with extremely high bac levels at the time of arrest could escape license suspension or revocation by plea bargaining to lesser crimes or entering pretrial diversion.thus,by providing for an administrative license suspension prior to the criminal proceeding,the law affords the public added protection.lake reed,supra,cal th at,d.
under the administrative per se law,when a person is arrested for driving under the influence and is determined to have a prohibited bac,the arresting officer,on behalf of the dmv,serves the person with a notice of order of suspension,subds.b c,lake reed,supra,cal th at,d.the notice informs the driver the license suspension will be effective days from the date of service,states the reason and statutory grounds for the suspension,and explains the driver right to seek an administrative hearing,subd.c,subd.a.if the arresting officer serves the notice,the officer also confiscates the driver license and issues on behalf of the dmv a day temporary license,subd.b lake reed,supra,at,d.
after either the arresting officer or the dmv serves a driver with the notice of order of license suspension,the dmv conducts an automatic internal review of the merits of the suspension,subd.a lake reed,supra,cal th at,d.in its review,the dmv considers the sworn report submitted by the peace officer and any other evidence accompanying the report,subd.a.
apart from the automatic internal review,the driver may request a hearing,in which case the dmv holds a contested review hearing on its decision to suspend a license,subd.b lake reed,supra,cal th at,d.if,as here,the driver requests a hearing,the universe of potentially available evidence is enlarged,for a ny evidence at the hearing shall not be limited to the evidence presented at an administrative review pursuant to section,subd.b.the rules potentially governing the evidence available for use in such hearings are set forth in division,chapter,article of the vehicle code,commencing with section,subd.a.two provisions are especially relevant.first,section states in pertinent part at any hearing,the department shall consider its official records and may receive sworn testimony.second,for all matters not specifically covered by division,chapter,article of the vehicle code,section incorporates the provisions of the administrative procedures act governing administrative hearings generally,et lake reed,supra,cal th at,d.
the hearing,which is typically before a dmv hearing officer,reviews the suspension determination under the preponderance of the evidence standard and the dmv bears the burden of proof,subd.b lake reed,supra,cal th at,d.
on an order for suspension under section,for drivers years of age and older,the sole issues are whether a the peace officer had reasonable cause to believe that the person had been driving a motor vehicle in violation of section or.b the person was placed under arrest and c the person was driving w hen the person had percent or more,by weight,of alcohol in his or her blood,subd.b.fn.omitted.lake reed,supra,cal th at,d,subd.c.
in ruling on a petition for writ of mandate following an order of suspension or revocation,a trial court is required to determine,based on its independent judgment,whether the weight of the evidence supports the administrative decision.gananian zolin th,d lake reed,supra,cal th at,d.
on appeal,this court role is to review the record to determine whether the trial court findings are supported by substantial evidence,resolving all evidentiary conflicts and drawing all legitimate and reasonable inferences in favor of the trial court decision.lake reed,supra,cal th at,d.
the requirement of filing a sworn report pursuant to section.
section,which is at the center of this controversy,provides in relevant part a if a peace officer arrests any person for a violation of section,or driving under the influence,the peace officer shall immediately forward to the department a sworn report of all information relevant to the enforcement action,including information that adequately identifies the person,a statement of the officer grounds for belief that the person violated the statute,a report of the results of any chemical tests that were conducted on the person,a copy of any notice to appear under which the person was released from custody,and,if immediately available,a copy of the complaint filed with the court.for the purposes of this section immediately means on or before the end of the fifth ordinary business day following the arrest b the peace officer sworn report shall be made on forms furnished or approved by the department.c for the purposes of this section,a report prepared pursuant to subdivision a and received pursuant to subdivision a of section,is a sworn report when it bears an entry identifying the maker of the document or a signature that has been affixed by means of an electronic device approved by the department.italics added.
solovij interpretation of section.
in solovij,supra,th,d,the arresting officer sworn report stated as justification for the driver initial stop only that she violated section.th at,d.solovij found the statement that the driver violated section is not evidence,it is a legal conclusion.ibid.the facts necessary to support the initial stop were contained exclusively in the unsworn report of the arresting officer.ibid.solovij held that because section requires the arresting officer to set forth all relevant information in the sworn report,the dmv could not rely on the arresting officer unsworn report,and therefore there was insufficient evidence of probable cause for the arrest.solovij,supra,th at,d.
solovij acknowledged that lake reed had determined the unsworn report of a nonarresting officer is admissible at the administrative per se review hearing pursuant to the public employee record exception to the hearsay rule,lake reed,supra,cal th at,d,solovij,supra,th at,d.nonetheless,solovij held the dmv could not rely on the unsworn report of the arresting officer,and therefore there was insufficient evidence of probable cause for the arrest.solovij,supra,th at,d.
solovij reasoned lake is distinguishable.here the question is whether the dmv properly considered the unsworn report of the arresting officer.the dmv reliance on the arresting officer unsworn report does not involve the hearsay rule.the unsworn report of the arresting officer is just as much a public employee record as the unsworn report of the nonarresting officer found admissible in lake.the problem is that section expressly requires the arresting officer to file a sworn report containing all information relevant to the enforcement action we presume that when the legislature said the arresting officer must include all information in a sworn report,it meant what it said.an unsworn report will not suffice.it is true that at the hearing,the dmv is not limited to a consideration of the arresting officer sworn report.but the dmv can not evade the statutory requirement that the arresting officer must include all information in a sworn report simply by categorizing the arresting officer unsworn report as additional evidence.our supreme court said in lake p ermitting the department hearing officer to consider and rely on the nonarresting officer unsworn police report does not unfairly evade the requirement that the arresting officer file a sworn report.lake reed,supra,cal th at,d.permitting the department hearing officer to consider and rely on the arresting officer unsworn report would unfairly evade that requirement.because the dmv may not rely on the arresting officer unsworn report,there is no evidence that the officer initial stop of solovij was reasonable.thus there is insufficient evidence of probable cause for her arrest.th at,d,italics added.
solovij erred in holding an arresting officer noncompliance with section precludes the dmv from considering the arresting officer unsworn report.
it appears solovij cursory analysis of section is at odds with lake reed and with the statutory scheme.as explained in lake reed,regardless of whether the administrative review consists of an automatic internal review or a contested review hearing,the dmv is not limited to considering the sworn report of the arresting officer.lake reed,supra,cal th at,d.
when the dmv conducts an automatic internal review of the merits of the suspension or revocation,the dmv considers the sworn report submitted by the peace officer pursuant to section and any other evidence accompanying the report,subd.a,italics added.
alternatively,where,as here,the dmv holds a review hearing on the suspension decision pursuant to the driver request,the universe of potentially available evidence is enlarged,for a ny evidence at the hearing shall not be limited to the evidence presented at an administrative review pursuant to section,subd.b.lake reed,supra,cal th at,d.section provides in pertinent part at any hearing,the department shall consider
