introduction 
petitioner,department of motor vehicles the dmv,seeks a writ of mandate directing respondent court to vacate its order requiring it to produce to the people its unredacted records concerning real party in interest,teodorico manliclic carmona carmona,who is charged with vehicular homicide arising out of a may,traffic collision.the people issued a subpoena duces tecum for the records.the dmv opposed the subpoena,claiming privileges under vehicle code section and evidence code section,subdivision b.carmona joined in the people request that the dmv produce the records 
the dmv contends that entries in carmona driving record relating to his physical or mental condition are absolutely privileged under section,which provides,in relevant part all records of the department relating to the physical or mental condition of any person are confidential and not open to public inspection and under evidence code section,subdivision b,the official information privilege.
we hold that section does not create a privilege,independent of evidence code section,to withhold information required to be produced by subpoena although the dmv established that its claim of privilege involved official information within the meaning of evidence code section,section does not forbid disclosure of such official information within the meaning of evidence code section,subdivision b and under evidence code section,subdivision b,the necessity for disclosure of complete copies of carmona driving records outweighs the dmv interest in preserving confidentiality.accordingly,we find that the trial court order requiring the dmv to produce to the people the entirety of carmona driving records was a sound exercise of discretion,and we deny the petition.
factual and procedural background 
on may,carmona,while traveling on the freeway,clipped one car,another a mile later,and then hit a third vehicle,a utility truck,causing it to overturn and kill the driver.witnesses reported carmona to have been making unsafe and precipitous lane changes and to have been driving at excessive speeds.a short distance after hitting the utility truck,carmona car stopped in the center divider.a witness who encountered carmona shortly after his car stopped described him as clammy,bluish,and staring blankly.
carmona was transported for medical care.while hospitalized,he made a statement to a california highway patrol chp officer investigating the accident.that statement,as well as witness statements,was contained in an accident report generated by the chp and filed with the dmv.
subsequently,carmona was charged with vehicular homicide.on august,the people served the dmv with a business records subpoena duces tecum the subpoena requiring it to produce all documents maintained by dmv regarding driving record of teodorico manliclic carmona including copy of file of physical of consciousness,priority,interview contact,tape recording and official transcript of hearing,all documents submitted,including any submitted or referenced by carmona and copy of file of fatal,including same of all sic and certified copy of driver white printout and certified copy of printout and any and all other documents or related documents maintained by your agency concerning carmona driving record.the documents commanded by the subpoena were represented to be material to the issues in the case because they were n eeded for successful prosecution of the vehicular homicide case.
on august,the dmv responded to the subpoena by transmitting to the clerk of the court an unsigned custodian of records declaration purporting to transmit true and correct copies of available records.a letter accompanying the records and the custodian of records declaration provided your attention is respectfully directed to the provisions of section of the vehicle code regarding the confidentiality of records of the department relating to physical or mental conditions and section e regarding confidentiality of social security numbers.you may also notice that portions of the attached material deemed confidential have been redacted,as they apply to procedures for updating our database.neither the custodian of records declaration nor the letter identified what had been redacted or otherwise withheld under a claim of confidentiality.
a.the records produced by the dmv 
the dmv produced pages of documents in response to the people subpoena for carmona driving record,of which pages appear to be redacted.the redactions are contained in documents discussing carmona medical history,including records related to administrative proceedings placing his driving privileges on medical probation and revoking them.
trial court proceeding on the dmv motion 
on october,in the criminal action,the dmv filed a noticed motion for order modifying subpoena,or,in the alternative for a protective order,citing to code of civil procedure section motion to quash,section dmv records of medical and physical condition confidential,and evidence code section,subdivision b official information privilege,seeking an order relieving it from producing the redacted information.the dmv contended that section rendered the redacted information confidential and not subject to disclosure,disclosure was against the public interest in driver safety because confidentiality of medical evaluations was necessary to ensure accurate reporting,the information was available from sources,and carmona consent to disclosure had no effect on the dmv independent assertion of privilege.
the people filed a joint opposition to the motion and a motion to compel,in which it informed the court that carmona intended to pursue an affirmative defense of unconsciousness due to diabetic coma,and that the voluntariness of any unconsciousness would be at issue in the pending criminal proceeding.the people contended plausible justification had been established for the subpoenaed documents.carmona had been involved in a traffic accident,which he had attributed to his diabetic condition.therefore,evidence of his knowledge of his condition,including his prior statements about it,as well as his eating,sleeping,driving,and medication practices,were material to whether he had knowingly failed to exercise the caution of a similarly situated reasonably prudent driver.the people disputed that section created an absolute privilege,and maintained that,on balance,the public interest was best served by disclosure.
the dmv reply papers were supported by a declaration by the chief of the dmv information services branch,stating,in pertinent part pursuant to vehicle code section,and departmental practice physical and mental condition record information is not disclosed to anyone,including the court,law enforcement agency,and other governmental agency.
on january,the dmv motion was heard.carmona joined with the people in seeking that the dmv be required to produce unredacted copies of his driving record,and on that basis,the trial court ordered the dmv to comply in full with the people subpoena.
on february,the dmv filed a petition for writ of mandate,contending that section and evidence code section created statutory privileges to withhold the medical information contained in carmona driving record,unaffected by carmona consent to release the information.we stayed production of the dmv records,issued an order to show cause,and set the matter for hearing.
standard of review 
appellate review of issues of statutory construction is de novo.redevelopment agency county of los angeles th,d.
appellate review of discovery orders applying the law to facts is under the abuse of discretion standard.we set aside the court order granting or denying discovery only where it has been demonstrated that discretion was abused.people superior court baez th,d.discretion is abused only when the trial court exceeds the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances before it being considered.denham superior court cal d,quoting loomis loomis d.
the parties contentions 
the dmv contends that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering it to disclose the entirety of carmona records,because section requires it to keep driver medical information absolutely confidential,section and evidence code section set forth absolute privileges with respect to driver medical information,and even in the absence of an absolute privilege,the public interest in maintaining confidentiality of medical information in carmona records outweighs the need for disclosure.
the people assert that evidence code section is the only statutory privilege under which medical information in the dmv records can be withheld,the dmv information concerning carmona medical condition is conditionally privileged under evidence code section,subdivision b,and the trial court acted properly in ordering the dmv to produce unredacted copies of its records,because the people and carmona joint interest in disclosure of the records outweighs the dmv interest in maintaining their confidentiality.
discussion 
the people described the information it sought with specificity and stated good cause for its production.the dmv then bore the burden of establishing its entitlement to its claim of privilege chadbourne,superior court cal d,by proving the preliminary facts to show that the privilege applied.mahoney superior court d.
evidentiary privileges are codified deviations from the common law principle that the public has a right to every man evidence.citation.trammel united states,d.under california law,privileges are strictly statutory.absent a statutory privilege,no person has a privilege to refuse to produce a writing in a legal proceeding,subd.b.
the evidence code generally establishes the law of this state respecting the subject to which it relates,and absent a statute stating otherwise,the evidence code privilege statutes apply to all legal proceedings in which a claim of privilege is made after december,subds.a c.
in sum,absent either an evidence code section establishing a privilege for the dmv to refuse to produce a writing,or a statute expressly creating such a privilege outside the evidence code,no such privilege exists,subd.c,subd.b.
the dmv contends that the language in section,deeming all records of the dmv relating to the physical or mental condition of any person confidential and not open to public inspection,creates a privilege independent of the evidence code.we disagree.characterizing information as confidential from public inspection is not the equivalent of establishing a privilege in a legal proceeding.section does not use the term privilege nor does it invoke the concept of privilege as that term used in the evidence code or discovery statutes.accord davies superior court cal d,interpreting.
we are constrained to interpret statutes by examining their actual language.we are required to give effect to statutes according to the usual,ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.citations.moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.i t is the language of the statute itself that has successfully braved the legislative gauntlet.it is the language which has been lobbied for,lobbied against,studied,proposed,drafted,restudied,redrafted,voted on in committee,amended,reamended,analyzed,reanalyzed,voted on by two houses of the legislature,sent to a conference committee,and,after perhaps more lobbying,debate and analysis,finally signed into law by the governor if the meaning is without ambiguity,doubt or uncertainty,then the language controls.halbert lumber,lucky stores,th,d.
moreover,in determining legislative intent,our responsibility is to construe the words of a statute in context in light of the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.citation.decker city of imperial beach d.in doing so,we must harmonize statutes and statutory sections regarding the same subject,both internally and with each other,to the fullest extent possible,fair employment housing com.cal d.
the obvious and stated purpose of section is to render physical and mental condition information confidential and not open to public inspection.placing this language in context confirms that it merely provides a limitation on public disclosure,not an evidentiary privilege.
in general,the records of the dmv shall be open to public inspection during office hours,subd.a.the dmv is authorized to sell the information in its files and to charge for providing the inspection or sale of information,subd.a.the legislature has enacted limitations and exceptions to the inspection and sale of information in the dmv files.these limitations and exceptions appear at sections through.section,declaring physical and mental condition information confidential from public inspection,is placed with the statutes declaring certain home addresses confidential.
specifically,sections,and declare that the home addresses of identified public officials and public employees,and of their spouses and children,are confidential.a confidential address under section is confidential without qualification.a confidential address under sections,subdivision b,and,subdivision b,shall not be disclosed to any person,except a court,a law enforcement agency,the state board of equalization,and a ny governmental agency to which,under any provision of law,information is required to be furnished from records maintained by the department.section provides an additional exception to confidentiality for a n attorney in a civil or criminal action that demonstrates to a court the need for the home address,if the disclosure is made pursuant to a subpoena,subd.b.
section provides that residence address information is confidential and shall not be disclosed to any person,except a court,law enforcement agency,or other governmental agency,or as authorized by section or.section declares confidential the record of a driver participation in traffic school,driving school,and driving instruction,and provides that it shall not be disclosed to any person,except a court,section provides that the dmv information concerning any motor vehicle liability insurance policy is confidential and shall not be disclosed to any person,except to a court of competent jurisdiction,a law enforcement or other governmental agency,or parties involved in an accident reported to the dmv.
while these statutes differ in their particulars,they do not show a legislative intent to create a privilege.collectively,they acknowledge that information confidential for purposes of public inspection may nevertheless be necessary for and subject to disclosure in legal and other official proceedings.in other words,if confidential meant privileged,it would be repugnant to include language allowing for the disclosure of such confidential information.applying the rules of statutory construction,we find the word confidential in section synonymous with the word confidential as used in these statutes.confidentiality does not equate with privilege.
accordingly,insofar as the dmv claim of privilege not to produce carmona complete driving record rests upon section,we reject it.we then turn our focus to the only statute which arguably could support the dmv position code section,the official information privilege.
evidence code section 
the dmv claims an absolute privilege under evidence code section,subdivision b,which provides,in relevant part b a public entity has a privilege to refuse to disclose official information,and to prevent another from disclosing official information,if the privilege is claimed by a person authorized by the public entity to do so and disclosure is forbidden by an act of the congress of the united states or a statute of this state or disclosure of the information is against the public interest because there is a necessity for preserving the confidentiality of the information that outweighs the necessity for disclosure in the interest of justice 
evidence code section establishes a privilege for statutorily defined official information 
subdivision a of evidence code section defines official information within the meaning of the statute as information acquired in confidence by a public employee in the course of his or her duty and not open,or officially disclosed,to the public prior to the time the claim of privilege is made.
the people contend that the dmv failed to establish the preliminary fact of information acquired in confidence,a threshold bu
