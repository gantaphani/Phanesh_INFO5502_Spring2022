in an arbitration over benefits for workers adversely affected by a rail merger,the arbitrators decided the core liability issues against the carrier.the surface transportation board declined to set aside or modify the award.the carrier appeals now in the form of union pacific as successor by merger to the original acquiring firm.applying the highly deferential standard of review that the board claims is applicable,we find the board decision arbitrary and capricious and reverse.
the statutes governing the type of rail merger in question require the board to condition any approval on the merged carrier agreement to provide labor protection benefits.a.in granting its approval for the merger of the denver rio grande and the southern pacific,the board imposed its standard requirements,known as the new york dock conditions.see a new york dock dist.terminal,aff sub nom.new york dock ry.united states,cir.
in the merged carrier consolidated various activities.among these were the prior railroads denver and san francisco computer systems,which the carrier joined in a management and information services mis division at southern pacific computer headquarters in san francisco.and in the carrier gave notice of further consolidations between operations of southern pacific and the former denver rio grande as a result,it and the transportation communications union entered into a implementing agreement governing protection for certain groups of potentially affected employees.
in a task force headed by thomas matthews,the carrier senior vice president and chief administrative officer,recommended that the carrier outsource the functions of its merged mis department.it proceeded to do so,engaging a completely separate firm,integrated systems solutions corporation issc,to perform the department functions.many of the mis employees moved to issc.a dispute arose between the carrier and some noncontract,nonunion mis employees over whether this outsourcing was subject to the new york dock conditions imposed in.in december four such employees,together with the southern pacific empowered employees committee speec,pronounced speak,a voluntary organization purporting to represent such employees,invoked arbitration under article iv of the new york dock conditions.
the parties agreed to bifurcate the arbitration,initially addressing only those issues applicable to all claimants.after a lengthy and unexplained delay,the panel issued a decision on march,the award,finding that the mis outsourcing was causally related to the merger in a manner bringing it within the reach of new york dock provisions,and that the named complainants and individuals were employees rather than management for purposes of new york dock eligibility.see generally newbourne grand trunk,cir.the carrier appealed to the board while that appeal was pending,the panel issued a second decision on february,rejecting the carrier claim that a key witness recantation required it to vacate its award.
on september,the board issued the decision now at issue board decision.it applied its highly deferential lace curtain standard established in review of an arbitration over a lace curtain allowance,which is awarded for expenses incurred preparing a home for occupancy.chicago transp.lace curtain,aff sub nom.international of workers.as the board said 
under the lace curtain standard,we limit our review of arbitrators decisions to recurring or otherwise significant issues of general importance regarding the interpretation of our labor protective conditions.we do not review issues of causation,the calculation of benefits,or the resolution of other factual questions in the absence of egregious error.

finding that the carrier had failed to make the requisite showing under our lace curtain standards,the board denied the carrier request that it review the award.board decision at.although the wording may suggest that review is purely discretionary,the board,opinion in reality expresses a conclusion that the arbitrator decision contained no error cognizable under lace curtain.
jurisdiction 
the board argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear union pacific appeal because its decision was not final.
the hobbs act gives the courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review the board rules,regulations,or final orders.for an order to be final,two conditions must be satisfied the order must not be tentative or interlocutory in nature,and it must be an action in which rights or obligations have been determined or from which legal consequences will flow.bennett spear,d citations omitted.these factors are interpreted pragmatically,abbott labs.gardner,d,to assure that courts neither improperly intrude into the agency decisionmaking process nor squander judicial resources through piecemeal review.united states epa.
here,there is little practical concern pointing against review.there is no suggestion that the board decision is tentative or interlocutory rather,it completes the liability phase of a proceeding that the parties agreed to bifurcate.see hart surgical,ultracision,cir t he definiteness with which the parties have expressed an intent to bifurcate is an important consideration.trade,natural petroleum charterers,cir i f the parties have asked the arbitrators to make a final partial award as to a particular issue and the arbitrators have done so,the arbitrators have no further authority,absent agreement by the parties,to redetermine that issue.see generally role models,white,to be final,an action need not be the last administrative action contemplated by the statutory scheme.citation omitted.and the board itself decided to review the panel award despite speec argument that the award was not a final arbitration decision for purposes of.see public utilities comm.of ferc,considering position taken by agency under review when deciding whether its order is final.indeed,a possible benefit for the board is that our resolution on the merits may moot the second phase of the proceeding.see id.
it is also apparent that by declining to review the arbitration panel award,the board order determined rights from which legal consequences will flow.the panel concluded that the outsourcing was causally related to the merger and that the individuals were employees of the sort eligible for new york dock benefits.given the board decision upholding those conclusions,all that remains to be decided is the amount of those benefits for each affected employee.see hart surgical,at holding that court has jurisdiction under the federal arbitration act to review arbitration awards that determined only liability and not damages.while those damages might amount to nothing for any given individual,the chance that the remaining proceedings will moot the case by giving victory to union pacific as to all claimants seems remote.see public utilities,at.nor does it appear that the issues likely to arise in such proceedings would much overlap with the claims that are central here,so that serious duplication of appellate effort seems unlikely.we find the board decision final for purposes of our jurisdiction.
standard of review 
the carrier argues that we should review the arbitration panel decision directly,rather than limiting our inquiry to whether the board acted arbitrarily and capriciously in the application of its lace curtain standard.compare association of american railroads surface transp,sentelle,concurring in part and dissenting in part stating that the court may be required to directly review the arbitrator decisions when the board has applied lace curtain review,with swonger surface transp,cir stating without explicitly deciding that judicial review is limited in this situation to whether the board properly declined to review the arbitration panel decision.in association of american railroads the board had issued an order,under a cognate labor protection provision,d,requiring arbitration for disputes arising under that order,and we upheld the board.judge sentelle noted in his concurrence that the court decision did not address the scope of our review if an arbitration decision e
