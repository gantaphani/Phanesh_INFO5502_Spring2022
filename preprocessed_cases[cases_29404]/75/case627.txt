soo line railroad company soo line appeals from the district court order vacating in part an arbitration award entered by national railroad adjustment board board.we reverse.
soo line operates a rail system under the interstate commerce act and constitutes a carrier within the meaning of of the railway labor act,first.its track workers are represented by the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees bmwe or union.as the result of a merger between soo line and the milwaukee railroad,relations between soo line and bmwe are governed by one of two collective bargaining agreements.union members working at properties originally owned by soo line work under the agreement and employees at former milwaukee railroad properties work under the agreement.the parties stipulate that this dispute is governed by the agreement.
in february of,soo line assigned certain painting projects at its paul roundhouse to members of the brotherhood of railway carmen.on march,bmwe filed a claim with soo line original claim,asserting that pursuant to the agreement the painting work should have been assigned to bmwe employees and claiming compensation for straight time and overtime hours.on march,bmwe filed a supplemental claim with soo line,claiming that bmwe workers were entitled to compensation for an additional straight time and overtime hours of painting work.soo line denied both the original and the supplemental claims on may.
the dispute was then submitted for arbitration before the national railroad adjustment board board.in award,dated january,the board ruled that soo line was procedurally barred from disputing the union original claim because it had failed to contest it within sixty days as required by the agreement.the board accordingly ordered soo line to compensate the union for the hours specified in the original claim.the board addressed the merits of the supplemental claim,however,and determined,in relevant part,that the scope rule in the agreement did not explicitly limit painting to bmwe members that the union therefore bore the burden of demonstrating that painting at the paul roundhouse was historically performed by bmwe members and that the union failed to satisfy this burden.the board therefore rejected the supplemental claim for compensation.
bmwe subsequently filed a petition in federal district court,challenging the board arbitration award to the extent that it rejected the union supplemental claim.although the court acknowledged that it owed the board decision extraordinary deference,it concluded that the board had exceeded its jurisdiction by citing industry practice,custom,and usage involving the agreement and failing to draw its essence from the agreement.the court accordingly vacated the relevant portion of the award and remanded for further findings by the board regarding the past practice of the parties under the agreement.

the supreme court has recently reminded us once again about the narrow scope of judicial review of a decision judicial review of a decision is very limited.courts are not authorized to review the arbitrator decision on the merits despite allegations that the decision rests on factual errors or misinterprets the parties agreement.major league baseball players ass garvey,d.see also duluth,missabe iron range ry,int l of locomotive eng rs,cir.

although the parties agree that the agreement controls this case,the board award cited two prior awards that involved the application and interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.the relevant portion of the board decision reads 
the organization bmwe has not carried its burden on the supplemented allegations found in the march,letter.the scope rule does not reserve painting work exclusively to the organizations members and the record does not establish that the organization members have historically performed this type of work.see third division award between the parties without an express reservation of work guaranteed to them by contract,the organization was obligated to show that its members have historically performed the work.on the contrary,the carrier has shown that its carmen have performed similar painting.third division award between the parties and awards cited therein carmen painting portions of buildings at different locations.
it is well established that an arbitrator may look to outside sources to aid in interpreting a collective bargaining agreement,alvey,at.accordingly,the board citation of these awards is not,in itself,problematic.the question,rather,is whether the citation of these two awards indicates that board decision improperly draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.id.when viewed in the light of our deferential standard of review,we conclude that it does not.
we turn first to award,which the board cited solely for the proposition that the union bore the burden of establishing the prior practice of the parties at the paul roundhouse.although award involved application of the agreement,we conclude that the citation of the award for this limited purpose does not indicate that the board award draws its essence from an inapplicable collective bargaining agreement.bmwe does not argue that the burden of proof was improperly applied by the board,nor does the union contend that the agreement mandates the application of a different burden of proof rule.furthermore,we observe that u nless there is specific controlling language in the collective bargaining agreement an arbitrator decision allocating the burden of proof among the parties ordinarily can not be reviewed in federal court.alvey,at.accordingly,we conclude that the citation of award does not implicate jurisdictional issues.
we next address the board citation of award,keeping in mind that a mere ambiguity in the opinion accompanying an award,which permits the inference that the arbitrator may have exceeded his authority,is not a reason for refusing to enforce the award.united steelworkers,at.the board cited award for the proposition that the carrier has shown that its carmen have performed similar painting,and identified the award as being between the parties.bmwe argues that award was not between the parties because it involved a distinct bargaining unit under the agreement,rather than the bargaining unit governed by the agreement.further,bmwe argues that the board determination that the union failed to carry its burden with regard to the historical practice at the paul roundhouse was based on its erroneous belief that award demonstrated that carmen had routinely done painting work under the agreement.we disagree.
