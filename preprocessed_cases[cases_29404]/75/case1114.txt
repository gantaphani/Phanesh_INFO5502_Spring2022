introduction 
california kin care law,requires employers,who provide paid sick leave to their employees,to allow employees to use sick leave to care for family members.united airlines,united seeks to avoid this state law obligation by the creation of an employee sick leave plan and trust,which united holds out as being subject to the employee retirement income security act erisa et and,thus,exempt from state regulation.
in ruling on for summary judgment,the trial court determined,among other things,that application of the kin care law to california domiciled pilots was not preempted by erisa.united appeals,contending the trial court erred by concluding the plan and trust were not within the scope of erisa and by ruling that the airline pilots association international alpa had standing to prosecute this case.we affirm.
ii.background 
united maintains a paid sick leave plan for its pilot employees and has done so for at least ten years.the rate at which united pilots accrue paid sick leave is established by the collective bargaining agreement cba between alpa and united.united does not permit pilot employees to use accrued sick leave to attend to an illness of a child,parent,spouse,or domestic partner.thus,for example,when plaintiff captain kathleen wentworth wentworth sought to use a portion of her accrued paid sick leave to care for her dying mother,united denied her request and instructed her to take time off without pay.
united sick leave plan s and trusts 
in,united created its sick leave plan plan and sick leave trust trust.united asserts that the primary reason that it maintains the sick leave plan as an erisa plan is so that it could provide uniform benefits and uniform administration to all its employees,without having to comply with specific state laws applicable to sick leave,including california kin care law.united plan was amended in and was largely revised,in relevant part,after the instant action commenced.the revised plan and trust became effective july 
the plan is part of united employee welfare benefit plan.the plan was designed to provide sick leave benefits to the united employees in the event of an employee sickness the plan states that it is intended to constitute an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of erisa.plan documents appoint a plan administrator and a fiduciary within the meaning of erisa.from the beginning,the plan administrator has been a committee of united employees.since,the plan administrator has been a committee called the retirement and welfare administration committee rawac,comprised of united senior management employees.
the participants in the plan include practically all of united employee groups,including pilots.the plan provides that sick leave benefits shall be funded entirely by the trust,which itself shall be funded solely by company contributions.the plan also provides that sick leave will be paid at a pilot s regular rate of pay up to the number of hours credited to the pilot sick leave bank.
the plan and trust as it existed prior to 
the original trust stated expressly that it was a grantor trust.according to the original plan,united retained the ability to cease contributions to the trust,if united decided it was impossible or inadvisable.further,if united decided to cease making contributions,the trust would attempt to pay out any sick leave owed to united employees.the original plan also provided that if there were insufficient trust assets to meet sick leave liability,united could in its sole discretion,prescribe the rules for determining the priority of payment and allocation of available assets.pursuant to the original plan and trust,assets held in the trust would not revert to united.however,an exception existed,in the event united decided to terminate the trust,and trust assets exceeded the benefits to be paid,the plan permitted the remaining assets to revert to united.
the original trust also stated that the trustee had no duty to require any contributions to be made to it or to determine that the contributions received by it comply with the provisions of the plan according to united,it had a funding policy under the original trust,which used historical trends in sick leave usage to forecast the coming month anticipated sick leave payments.united doubled this amount,and then added million to determine its monthly contribution.this prior funding formula was not in writing.
the plan and trust since 
united substantially revised the trust in.the revised trust now provides that the trustee has a right to enforce a contribution obligation against united.united also hired an actuary to develop a funding formula and that funding policy was approved by the plan administrator.under the revised trust,united is required to make contributions to the trust on a monthly basis in amounts calculated to ensure that the trust will have sufficient money to cover one month worth of sick leave payments.
however,the revised plan still allows united,in its sole discretion,to cease making contributions to the trust if it determines that contributions are impossible or inadvisable.united also retains a reversionary interest in trust assets,upon termination of the trust and after all benefits owed are paid.according to the deposition testimony of lincoln lounsbury,united senior counsel,the revised trust,like the original trust,is a grantor trust.lounsbury further testified that united had not taken any steps to change the tax status of the trust,and he confirmed that the trust is still a taxable trust.
payment scheme under both trusts 
pilots receive wage payments on the first and sixteenth days of each month.sick leave benefits are paid to united pilots along with their regular pay from one of three payroll accounts owned by united.the payroll account from which a particular pilot is paid,depends solely on whether the pilot is paid through direct deposit,a physical paycheck,or credit union.united transfers money from its main operating account to cover all payments made out of its payroll accounts.the trust transfers money to united main operating account in an amount sufficient to cover the current month sick leave liability.
under the original trust,any sick leave pay owed to the pilots was paid on the sixteenth day of the month following the month in which the leave was taken,and was combined with the pilots regular wages in one paycheck.
the original trust provided that the trustee was authorized t o make payments from the trust fund to united as reimbursement for payments made to plan participants or beneficiaries of the plan and permitted the payment of trust assets to united to reimburse united for plan benefits advanced to plan participants or beneficiaries on behalf of the plan or trust.generally,the original trust transferred money for benefits to united a day or so in advance of the date the benefits were paid out.in some instances,however,the benefits were first paid by united and then later reimbursed by the trust.for example,during the month period between january and april,united received reimbursement from the trust after it had paid sick leave to pilots on occasions and received reimbursement on the same day as it made sick leave payments on another occasions.
pursuant to the revised trust,united is required to make its contribution to the trust by the fifth business day of each month,and the trust now transfers money to united before united makes sick leave payments to its employees.united retains any interest earned on money transferred from the trust and uses it to help fund the next due payment.similarly,when a pilot receives sick leave pay and later receives workers compensation or state disability for his or her absence,the pilot is required to turn over any workers compensation or state disability payment back to united or the plan these returned payments are not credited to the trust.
commencement of litigation 
in november,three pilots and their union,alpa collectively plaintiffs,sued united,claiming various statutory violations associated with the plan.inasmuch as the instant appeal is limited to plaintiffs first cause of action,we confine our discussion and analysis to plaintiffs claim that united policy and practice of prohibiting pilot employees from using accrued sick leave to care for ill family member violates california kin care law.labor code section states that an employer that provides paid sick leave to employees must permit employees to use,in any calendar year,the amount of accrued sick leave the employee would accrue during six months of employment,to attend to an illness of the employee child,parent,spouse,or domestic partner.section expressly excludes sick leave benefits provided under an employee welfare plan that qualifies as an erisa plan,subd.b.
in october,both sides moved for summary judgment.in its motion for summary judgment,united argued,among other things,that plaintiffs claims were preempted under erisa and that alpa lacked standing to bring its claims.by their motion,plaintiffs argued,among other things,that the plan,both in its original and revised form,did not qualify as an employee welfare benefits plan within the meaning of erisa because the plan was an exempt payroll practice the trust was a mere for payments that offered no genuine protection for employees sick leave benefits and the trust did not offer actual protection for employees benefits because,as a grantor trust,any money held in the trust remained the property of united and subject to the claims of its creditors.
in granting summary adjudication to plaintiffs,the trial court held that erisa did not preempt plaintiffs claims because the trust assets were reachable by united creditors,and therefore the employees benefits remain ed tied to the financial health of united.accordingly,the trial court concluded that the trust was not really a bona fide separate trust and failed to comply with the department of labor criteria for erisa trusts.
iii.discussion 
despite the voluminous record on appeal and extensive briefing,this appeal raises essentially a single legal issue namely,whether united plan,as funded by the trust qualifies as an erisa plan,thus preempting plaintiffs kin care law claim.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that it does not.we begin our analysis with a brief review of the governing legal principles.
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,considering all of the evidence set forth in the supporting and opposition papers,except that to which objections have been made and sustained by the court,and all uncontradicted inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence.artiglio corning cal th.in independently reviewing a motion for summary judgment,we apply the same analysis used by the superior court.we identify the issues framed by the pleadings,determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent claims,and determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable,material factual issue.silva lucky stores,th.if there is no triable issue of material fact,we affirm the summary judgment if it is correct on any legal ground applicable to this case,whether that ground was the legal theory adopted by the trial court or not,and whether it was raised by the moving party in the trial court or first addressed on appeal.jordan allstate ins.th.
erisa is a comprehensive federal law designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee pension and benefit plans.citation.as a part of this integrated regulatory system,congress enacted various safeguards to preclude abuse and to secure the rights and expectations that erisa brought into being.citations.prominent among these safeguards is an expansive preemption provision,found at section of erisa citations.marshall bankers life casualty cal th.that provision preempts any and all state laws insofar as they relate to any employee benefit plan governed by erisa.a.the parties here vigorously dispute whether plaintiffs claim relates to an employee benefit plan within the meaning of section a and,hence,is preempted.
the comprehensive and reticulated statute citation contains elaborate provisions for the regulation of employee benefit plans.massachusetts morash,morash.however,as the united states supreme court has explained in morash the precise coverage of erisa is not clearly set forth in the act.erisa covers employee benefit plans,which it defines as plans that are either an employee welfare benefit plan,or an employee pension benefit plan,or both.erisa.an employee welfare benefit plan,in turn,is defined as a ny plan,fund,or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization,or by both,to the extent that such plan,fund,or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries,through the purchase of insurance or otherwise,medical,surgical,or hospital care or benefits,or benefits in the event of sickness,accident,disability,death or unemployment,or vacation benefits,apprenticeship or other training programs,or day care centers,scholarship funds,or prepaid legal services erisa,as codified.morash,supra,at,fn.omitted.
the act does not further define plan,fund,or program or benefits in the event of sickness and does not specify whether every policy to provide benefits in the event of sickness fall within its ambit.see,morash,supra,at discussing act failure to further define vacation benefits.the words any plan,fund,or program maintained for the purpose of providing benefits in the event of sickness may surely be read to encompass sick leave payments to an employee.see ibid.in this case,the plan falls squarely within erisa definition of an employee welfare benefit plan,because it was established by an employer united to provide employees with certain welfare benefits,including sick leave pay.moreover,there is no serious dispute that the sick leave plan is governed by formal plan documents,administered by a claims administrator,provides for comprehensive administrative procedures for filing and adjudicating claims,and is otherwise held out as an erisa plan.
however,a regulation of the secretary of labor excludes certain payroll practice s from the application of erisa.bassiri xerox cir,alaska airlines oregon bureau of labor cir,alaska airlines.more specifically,the payroll practices exemption provides that an employee welfare benefit plan for purposes of erisa shall not include payment of an employee normal compensation,out of the employer general assets,on account of periods of time during which the employee is physically or mentally unable to perform his or her duties,or is otherwise absent for medical reasons b emphasis added.thus,the payroll practices exemption would apply if the payment of sick leave benefits under the plan qualifies as normal compensation and the sick leave benefits are paid from united general assets.
here,it is undisputed that at all times of the trust operation,sick leave benefits were and are paid as part of an employee normal compensation and out of the employer general assets to wit,out of united main operating account.accordingly,the plan falls squarely within the plain meaning of a payroll practice.this is not,however,the end of our analysis.
while plan benefits do pass through united general corporate account and are distributed along with regular wages,the plan is funded by a valid trust.see morash,supra,at finding a payroll practice where benefits were paid directly out of an employer general assets,with no connection to any trust funkhouser wells fargo bank,cir,same.moreover,the revised trust is the sole source of funding for the plan general corporate assets are never directly used to pay plan benefits.see alaska airlines,supra,at finding a payroll practice where an employer sought reimbursement from the trust after paying benefits out of its general assets czechowski tandy,same.and,although,under the original trust,united occasionally sought reimbursement from the trust after paying for the sick leave benefits out of its general assets,the general practice was to transfer money for benefits to united a day or so before the date the benefits were paid.
payment from a separate fund certainly militates towards finding an employee benefit plan within the meaning of erisa.morash,supra,at.however,as the ninth circuit explained in alaska airlines,supra,an employer must do more than create a separate fund for benefits payments to qualify for erisa preemption that separate fund must be actually liable for the benefits.id.at.for example,in alaska airlines,the airline created a welfare plan for the payment of sick leave and other employee benefits.id.at.it also created a trust to administer the benefits payments.ibid.instead of paying sick leave benefits directly from the trust,however,the airline entered into a repayment agreement with the trust,under which the airline paid sick leave benefits directly to employees from its general funds and then sought reimbursement from the trust.ibid.the ninth circuit held that the airline system of benefits payments was not an plan.id.at.the court explained that the airline was not transmitting funds the trust had provided to pay the employee rather,it was paying first,and seeking reimbursement later.id.at.the court held that the airline payment from its general assets qualified as a payroll practice under the plain words of erisa.ibid.
the court in alaska airlines did not,however,end its analysis there.specifically,the court also concluded that the substance of the airline plan was not necessarily one of a funded benefit program.alaska airlines,supra,at.for example,there was no clear relation between the amount of funds in the trust and the sick leave liability accrued by the airline employees.ibid.under the airline plan,employees were dependent on the financial health of their employer,rather than the financial health of the trust,for their benefits payments.ibid.accordingly,the court found that the airline system had more of the characteristics of an unfunded payment than of an erisa trust fund payment.ibid.
after the decisions in morash and alaska airlines,the department of labor dol issued several advisory opinions articulating a test for determining whether a separate trust to pay vacation benefits is an employee welfare benefit plan under erisa.see dol advisory opinion,wl denny opinion dol advisory opinion,wl may company opinion.the dol test provides the trust must have a legal obligation to pay plan benefits the employer must have a legal obligation to make contributions to the trust the contributions must be actuarially determined or otherwise bear a relationship to the plan accruing liability and the trust paying the benefits must be a bona fide separate trust.denny opinion at.
the ninth circuit has held that advisory opinions interpreting an ambiguous labor regulation such as the one before the court are controlling unless they are plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.bassiri xerox,supra,at citing auer robbins.thus,providing that the dol interpretation of when an employee benefits plan is is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with erisa,then courts will apply the dol test for to an employer plan.
here,after reviewing the applicable law and dol advisory opinions,the trial court found that the dol interpretations regarding employee benefits were not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with erisa.the trial court then proceeded to apply the dol test for determining whether a separate trust to pay sick leave benefits is an employee welfare benefit plan under erisa.the trial court determined the original trust did not qualify as an erisa plan because united contributions were not actuarially determined and did not otherwise bear a resemblance to the original plan accruing liability.in addition,the court found that neither the original nor the revised trust qualified as erisa plans because they were not bona fide separate trusts under the law.after explaining that the trusts were grantor trusts under internal revenue code section which provides that trust assets are considered part of the employer general assets,remaining subject to the claims of an employer creditors in the case of insolvency the trial court found that the trusts constituted payroll practices exempt from erisa.
accordingly,we must determine whether the trust is merely a pass through,considering whether the contributions to the original trust were actuarially determined and whether the original or revised trust qualifies as a bona fide separate fund.
funding for the original trust was n ot actuarially determined 
as noted,the trial court determined that united plan,as funded by the original trust,did not fall within erisa ambit because,among other things,the original trust funding was not actuarially determined or otherwise commensurate with the plan accruing liability we agree.
background 
united maintains that its prior funding policy was a set formula under which united forecasted the coming month anticipated sick leave payments using historical trends,doubling it,and adding million.according to united,the formula used past payments to participants to forecast payments required for upcoming payroll periods.this formula,however,was never reduced to a writing.rather,united claims that the component of the formula that forecast upcoming sick leave was embedded in an excel spreadsheet.the embedded formula was not known to united treasury department employees who were responsible for transferring funds from the trust to the plan.for example,james jazdzewski,a senior staff specialist in cash management,testified that he did not know how the formula worked.rather,jazdzewski input various figures,and the spreadsheet produced a number he did not know what that number reflected.not only did jazdzewski not know how the contributions were calculated,he was also unaware of the time periods utilized in determining the historical data.
soon after lincoln lounsbury joined united as senior counsel in,he began speaking with various consulting firms regarding the review of the funding policy.at his deposition,lounsbury explained that he contacted the consultants not because he thought the existing policy lacked actuarial analysis,but because any policy whether actuarial determined or not has to be reviewed from time to time.ultimately,united engaged the consulting firm trion to review the funding policy and to make recommendations for appropriate changes and revisions.
trion actuary,paul hitchcox,testified that for a period of time prior to july,the excel spreadsheet was not functioning the way it had been designed to work.specifically,hitchcox testified that the prior funding method produced a weekly estimate of the sick leave payments.that weekly estimate was updated each month.the monthly update broke so it was frozen the base that it worked from was frozen at some unknown point in time and continued to use an old number.hitchcock characterized the former plan as having specious accuracy and arbitrary monthly adjustments with very little logic to them.
in enacting erisa,congress primary concern was with the mismanagement of funds accumulated to finance employee benefits and the failure to pay employees benefits from accumulated funds.citation.to that end,it established extensive reporting,disclosure,and fiduciary duty requirements to insure against the possibility that the employee expectation of the benefit would be defeated through poor management by the plan administrator.morash,supra,at.it stands to reason that one way of safeguarding against the mismanagement of funds is for the contributions to be actuarially determined or otherwise bear a relationship to the plan accruing liability.see alaska airlines,supra,at denny opinon at.
here,if the funding formula operated as united states it did double forecast plus million,it would seem to bear a relationship to the plan accruing liability.however,the record indicates that united did not always use the same period of time to determine the forecast and that the factors used in the forecast were not entirely clear.accordingly,the prior funding method produced arbitrary results.this suggests that the original trust offered no real protection for employees benefits.in other words,contributions to the original trust did not bear a consistent relationship to the plan accruing liability.see alaska,supra,at.without a consistent relationship to the accruing liability for benefits,the degree of risk depended on the financial health of united,not the trust.ibid.in sum,funding of the original trust was not actuarially determined and did not otherwise bear a relationship to the plan accruing liability.
neither the original trust nor the revised trust a re bona fide separate trusts 
grantor trusts nongrantor trusts 
the internal revenue code contains special rules,referred to herein as grantor trust rules,which treat certain grantors of trusts as the owners of all or certain portions of the property in those trusts.see hereafter int.the grantor is the person or corporation who actually places the funds in trust.see mead,a primer in the grantor trust rules,supra.at.the purpose of the grantor trust rules is to prevent the use of a temporary or incomplete transfer in trust as a means of tax avoidance.crane commissioner cir,scheft commissioner,internal revenue.accordingly,the grantor trust rules attempt to determine when a trust should be respected for tax purposes and when it should be ignored.soled,reforming the grantor trust rules notre dame,grantor trust rules.specifically,the grantor trust rules recognize the separate existence of a trust when a grantor has parted with dominion and control over the trust corpus,but ignore the separate existence of a trust when the grantor has retained dominion and control over trust assets.ibid.thus,in computing income tax liability,grantors treated as trust owners are required under internal revenue code section to include income,deductions,and credits attributable to the portion of the trust owned.sollee et,maximizing the benefits of deferred compensation plans funded through secular trusts tax,compensation benefits at compensation benefits.one commentator has referred to internal revenue code section as making a trust function like a spaghetti colander a ll income,deductions,and credits against tax of a trust are poured in.if a taxpayer is treated as having dominion and control over all or a portion of a trust,then items of income,deductions,and credits against tax attributable to such ownership remain in the spaghetti colander and the taxpayer must take them into account in computing the taxpayer taxes.the balance of income,deductions,and credits against tax drain through the spaghetti colander and are taxed to the trust or trust beneficiaries soled,supra,grantor trust rules,notre dame.at,fn.omitted.
by contrast,a nongrantor trust is a separate taxable entity distinct from the grantor and the trust beneficiaries.compensation benefits,supra,tax at.generally,a nongrantor trust is taxed under the trust rules of internal revenue code section,which generally conform with the rules for individuals.ibid.to the extent income is distributed to beneficiaries,the trust is entitled to a deduction and the beneficiary is required to include the amounts in income,up to the taxable amount of the trust.ibid.
in the employment context,employers often will establish a grantor trust and make contributions in the name of employee beneficiaries to create a source of funding for otherwise unfunded benefit plans.see in re outboard marine.inasmuch as the trust corpus technically remains property of the employer,the employee beneficiaries of the trust are not taxed on their portion of the trust corpus or proceeds until the assets are actually distributed to the beneficiaries.see int,et mcallister resolution trust cir,mcallister.however,as several circuit courts have explained,such advantageous tax treatment is not extended without certain strings attached.goodman resolution trust cir,goodman mcallister,supra,at resolution trust mackenzie.cir,mackenzie.federal tax law conditions the beneficial treatment of a grantor trust on the requirement that the trust fund remains subject to the claims of the employer creditors as if the assets were the general assets of the employer.citations.goodman,supra,at.
here,it is undisputed that the trusts at issue are grantor trusts however,united insists that the trial court incorrectly assumed that the availability of trust assets to creditors is an inherent feature of all grantor trusts.rather,according to united,the availability of trust assets to creditors is an inherent feature of only a species of grantor trusts,colloquially known as rabbi trusts.united maintains that although their trusts are grantor trusts,they are not,and have never been rabbi trusts.
rabbi trusts secular trusts 
rabbi trusts 
the first rabbi trust was developed over thirty years ago by a congregation that wanted to provide for its rabbi after his retirement,while at the same time protecting him against any changes in control.see corporate counsel guide to nonqualified deferred compensation agreements hereinafter corporate counsel guide part i,chapter,rabbi trusts,overview of rabbi trusts the first rabbi trust overview in re outboard marine,supra,at,fn.although the trust agreement did not allow the congregation to alter,amend,revoke,change,or annul any of the trust provisions,it provided that the trusts assets would be subject to the congregation creditors,just as if the assets remained among the general assets of the congregation.overview,supra.additionally,the rabbi interest in the trust was not subject to assignment,alienation,or attachment,nor to the claims of the rabbi creditors,and it could not otherwise be alienated or encumbered by the rabbi.ibid.
responding to a request for a determination as to whether the rabbi would be deemed in receipt of current income by virtue of the funding of the trust for his benefit,the internal revenue service irs,in a private letter ruling determined that the rabbi would not be in receipt of current income regarding trust assets that were subject to congregation creditors and that were not paid or made available to the rabbi.priv.ltr.rul.hereinafter plr,wl.the irs concluded that the rabbi would not be in receipt of income until the year that the payments were actually received by or otherwise made available to the rabbi.id.at.
today,the term rabbi trust is synonymous with a grantor trust in which an employer makes contributions to the trust in the name of beneficiaries to create a source of funding for otherwise unfunded benefit plans.because the trust corpus technically remains property of the employer,the trust beneficiaries are not taxed on their portion of trust assets or trust corpus until the assets are actually distributed to the beneficiaries.in re outboard marine,supra,at.moreover,as a condition of this beneficial tax treatment,rabbi trusts are required to remain at all times subject to the claims of the grantor general creditors.ibid.
secular trusts 
some employers have used secular trusts to protect their employees against both changes of control and corporate insolvency issues.corporate counsel guide,part i,chapter,securing nonqualified deferred compensation,secular trusts.a secular trust is so named to distinguish it from the rabbi trust.ibid.the key distinction between rabbi trusts and secular trusts is that secular trust assets are separated from the employer assets,and can not be reached by the company creditors.ibid.thus,a secular trust not only protects against nonpayment due to a change in control,but also secures payments against the employer insolvency or bankruptcy.ibid.this protection,however,comes with a price.a secular trust results in immediate taxation to employees based on the employer trust contributions in the year they are contributed,prior to the employee actual receipt of benefits.ibid.
here,it is undisputed that the assets and income attributable to the trust are taxable to united under internal revenue code section.united concedes the trust is a grantor trust owned by its creator,and it is taxed as such.yet,united insists that its grantor trusts are not rabbi trusts because the trust assets are not subject to the claims of its creditors.however,the irs position is that an employees trust,one that accumulates funds to pay benefits to employees and can not be reached by employer creditors,can not be treated as a grantor trust owned by the employer.sollee,compe
