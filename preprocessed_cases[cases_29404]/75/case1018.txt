this case predominantly involves changes to arrival and departure procedures to the north,northeast,and northwest of the phoenix sky harbor international airport phx.these changes were necessitated by the massive growth of passenger demand at phx over the past years.this growth resulted in imbalanced airline routes to and from phx,outdated arrival and departure procedures,overburdened airspace configurations,and increased air traffic complexity.as a consequence of these problems,operational errors also increased.in response to congress national airspace redesign nar mandate and related agency studies,the federal aviation administration faa developed the northwest plan to improve the management and safety of flights arriving from and departing to the north of phx.
as part of the environmental review of the northwest plan,the faa issued a final environmental assessment ea and finding of no significant impact record of decision fonsi.the ea and fonsi concluded that the environmental impact of the northwest plan would be insignificant.because a comprehensive environmental impact statement eis is only required by the national environmental policy act nepa when the agency action will significantly affect the quality of the human environment,c,the faa decided that preparation of an eis was unnecessary.see also robert percival et,environmental regulation law,science and policy ed providing an overview of the origins and development of the eis requirement susannah french,judicial review of the administrative record in nepa litigation,cal,same.petitioners,town of cave creek,arizona,et representing municipal entities surrounding phx,and their inhabitants seek review of the ea and fonsi.petitioners contend that the faa should be required to prepare an eis because the agency failed to give adequate consideration to certain criteria that agencies are obliged to address in determining whether a proposed action will significantly affect the environment.
we deny the petition for review.in preparing the ea and fonsi,the faa properly employed a methodology.petitioners raise only nominal challenges to the agency methodology and findings,and their other arguments lack merit.it is obvious that,after the northwest plan,the noise levels in the challenged areas will be compatible with all existing land uses in these areas,including residential housing,churches,and recreational parks.we therefore conclude that the faa adequately considered the relevant criteria,and that the agency reasonably concluded that preparation of an eis was unnecessary.
background 
a.the need for new arrival and departure procedures at phx 
phx was purchased by the city of phoenix in.it is now the country fifth busiest airport.due in part to the extraordinary growth of the phoenix metropolitan area,passenger use at phx has tripled twice in the past years.see,windermere,scott see arizona as hot market,puget sound bus,at quoting a businessman statement that the greater phoenix area is a phenomenal growth area for the united states.
phx consists of acres located in the southeast corner of the incorporated city of phoenix.phx has three parallel runways oriented in an configuration.depending on the wind and weather patterns,the airport operates either in west flow where aircraft depart phx to the west and arrive from the east or east flow where aircraft depart phx to the east and arrive from the west.generally,winds dictate that the airfield operates in east flow in the morning and west flow in the afternoon.
aircraft at phx follow published arrival procedures stars and departure procedures dps.under phx old procedures,aircraft bound for phx arrived from the north along two main flight paths karlo star and fossl star,and north and northeast departures from phx proceeded along four routes eagul dp,drake dp,st johns dp,and dryheat dp.
because phx is located in southwest arizona,more aircraft arrive from and depart to the north and east of the airport than to the south or west.before the northwest plan,the number of northern routes,the proximity of certain routes to others,and the increases in eastbound departures created route conflicts,inefficiencies,and operational errors within albuquerque air route traffic control center artcc and the phoenix terminal radar approach control tracon airspace.for example,the high volume of air traffic in albuquerque artcc sector created procedural complexities for controllers,in turn increasing phx departure delays,flight times,and flight distances.high traffic levels in sector required frequent use of a holding pattern that forced aircraft to fly at lower altitudes and forced albuquerque center to implement restrictions as far away as the denver and kansas city centers.descents on karlo star and ascents on drake dp routinely crossed paths in sector,resulting in increased separation or rerouting of aircraft.sector also controlled an intersection located very near the luke air force base radar approach control.because of the intersection proximity to the military radar approach control,phx traffic interfered with military training missions,and air traffic complexity increased generally.
the old procedures also created conflicts in phoenix tracon airspace.during both west flow and east flow,the intersection of some routes restricted departures to lower altitudes below the arriving aircraft until clear of the arrival route.these conflicts increased the complexity of controller operations,increased delays,and introduced greater potential for operational errors.
while sectors,and were overloaded,sector was underutilized.in fact,the overloading and complexity of sectors,and and thus,of the phoenix tracon airspace as well were due in part to the underutilization of sector.
b.the northwest plan 
the inefficiencies,workload imbalances and safety concerns at phx led the faa to study potential solutions.then,based on its own assessment of the problems facing air travel,congress passed the nar mandate in.nar required the faa to conduct a comprehensive redesign of the national airspace system and prepare and submit a report to congress setting forth projected milestones for completion of the redesign and a date for completion.notes.the faa developed the northwest plan in response to both the studies and the nar.
the northwest plan addressed the aforecited safety and efficiency concerns by modifying some of the arrival and departure routes.the plan eliminated airspace conflicts within sector by moving an arrival procedure east and establishing a new departure procedure.it also addressed the complexity within sector and the underutilization of sector by modifying the boundary of sector to accommodate a new departure route which would receive all traffic previously routed on the sector eagul dp.the plan also changed sector boundaries and replaced the old fossl star with two new arrival procedures,which served to eliminate the conflicts created by some of the old holding patterns.the plan also included development of advanced satellite navigation systems which would further alleviate operational complexity and increase controller flexibility.
these changes began in and,when the faa executed a series of categorical exclusion determinations,preliminary environmental review checklists,and noise screening memoranda designed to authorize the changing of numerous flight departure and arrival paths.the faa authorized the implementation of five new arrival procedures and six departure procedures.
environmental review of the project 
the faa began its evaluation of the potential impacts of the northwest plan by conducting preliminary environmental reviews for each proposed airspace redesign.the preliminary review processes included application of faa air traffic noise screen model,which indicated that implementation of the northwest plan would not cause any significant noise or other environmental impacts.nonetheless,the faa decided to prepare an ea because it was anticipated that some communities would oppose the proposed changes,and also because the modified routes would overfly two indian reservations.
the faa first introduced the plan to the phoenix airspace users workgroup in march.in january,the agency issued a notice of proposed action and began preparation of an ea for the plan.the faa solicited comments from the general public and federal,state,and local agencies to determine any issues of concern,and thereafter published a draft environmental assessment dea.in april,the faa circulated the dea for public comment and held four public workshops to explain the project,answer questions,and accept written comments on the dea.
the faa had initially developed two alternative models for implementation of the northwest plan.after additional analysis and consideration of responses submitted during the dea process,the faa determined that it would prepare a supplemental ea in order to develop a third alternative that covered the public major concerns.in june,the faa issued a supplemental draft ea that presented and analyzed this new alternative.after the agency received extensive public comment and held numerous meetings on the dea and supplemental draft ea,the faa issued a final ea and fonsi in december.on the basis of these documents,the faa determined that it did not need to prepare an eis because the northwest plan would not significantly affect the environment.
in evaluating the plan environmental consequences,the faa utilized the faa integrated noise model inm version b to assess noise levels at locations surrounding phx and the seven satellite airports.the noise modeling analysis took into account,inter alia,the number of flights,time of day,aircraft type,altitude,and geographic dispersion of flights.the inm produced a series of sound level contours connecting thousands of grid points of equal day night noise levels dnl.
faa followed its guidelines,which provide that any area exposed to a noise level increase of db of dnl or more within the dnl contour is considered to be significantly affected,while increases of db within the dnl contour or db within the dnl contour are reportable increases.courts have long accepted the faa dnl standard as the appropriate methodology for assessing the impact of aircraft noise.see,citizens against burlington,busey,sierra club dot,now,faa,cir suburban comm dole,cir.the inm projected that the highest noise level for the plan would be dnl.for both the second and third proposed alternatives,the faa determined that there would be no significant or reportable noise impacts.
the faa also supplemented its inm noise modeling in two ways.first,the agency chose specific grid point locations under the flight paths and measured noise impacts and any changes stemming from the or alternatives and.the faa determined that,although noise levels would increase for some points,each point would remain below the threshold of significance.second,to evaluate the plan impact on total noise levels,the faa also conducted measurements of average ambient noise levels leq for seven representative locations.the faa placed one site site in carefree under the proposed silow dp.measurements at site revealed that the existing ambient noise level,which consists of all background noise including aircraft and nonaircraft noise was leq during the day and leq at night.the faa examined the relative change in aircraft noise caused by the plan,then evaluated the overall impact of the change in aircraft noise by performing a logarithmic calculation to account for the actual impact of the project as added to the existing ambient noise levels.
for alternatives and,the faa determined that,although aircraft noise levels would increase at some locations,the overall ambient noise level would not increase at any of the seven monitor locations.for the cave cross area,the faa determined that,although the plan would increase aircraft noise slightly at site by db,when summed logarithmically,the existing ambient level of daytime and nighttime would not materially change.accordingly,the faa concluded that the highest noise level from the project would be dnl,and that there would be no significant increase in noise levels in the dnl contour and no reportable increase within the dnl contour.thus,the faa found that there would be no significant noise impacts for any of the alternatives.
overflights of cave creek,carefree,and spur cross ranch 
cave creek,carefree,and spur cross ranch the areas with respect to which petitioners claim that the faa did not give adequate consideration to the northwest plan noise effects are located approximately miles northeast of phx.for decades,during east flow at phx,portions of cave creek and carefree were located directly below the drake dp.thus,in east flow,daily departures on that dp overflew cave creek,carefree,and spur cross ranch from phx traffic alone,these areas have been located beneath annual aircraft operations for decades.
with the implementation of the northwest plan,the annual operations from the old drake dp would no longer fly over cave creek,carefree,and spur cross.after northwest,one new procedure the silow dp in west flow will fly over portions of cave creek and carefree.because silow is located further northeast than the old drake dp,the silow dp does not overfly spur cross ranch.thus,the annual flights directly over spur cross ranch decreased by with the implementation of the northwest plan,while overflights of cave creek and carefree increased by to a total of.also,because the northwest plan raises the average minimum altitude for overflights of cave creek,carefree,and spur cross from to feet,and because new airspace design will allow departures to use unrestricted climbs,areas under the proposed dps will experience reduced noise levels.

the national environmental policy act,nepa requires federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement for every major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.an environmental assessment is made for the purpose of determining whether an eis is required.see.if any significant environmental impacts might result from the proposed agency action then an eis must be prepared before agency action is taken.sierra club peterson,

petitioners argue that the faa actions in this case fail the third step of the sierra club standard.in particular,petitioners contend that the faa should be required to prepare an eis because it failed to make a convincing case for its finding of no significant impact.they argue that the faa did not make a convincing case,because it failed to consider adequately a number of factors agencies must weigh in determining whether a proposed action will significantly affect the environment.see id.b.petitioners claim the agency failed to consider adequately the unique characteristics of the affected geographical areas the cumulative impacts of the plan the controversy generated by the environmental impacts of the plan the precedent that the plan creates and the fact that spur cross ranch may be protected by f of the department of transportation act,c.petitioners challenge as related to cave creek and carefree differs somewhat from the challenge it mounts to the agency consideration of the environmental impact on spur cross.thus,we address the distinct challenges in turn.
cave creek and carefree 
for cave creek and carefree,the ea and fonsi used methodology which petitioners only nominally challenge.petitioners do not challenge the guidelines that the faa used to evaluate the noise impacts of the plan,which the agency has employed since to satisfy its nepa obligations.see,pt.app.under these guidelines,faa actions that do not result in noise level increases of db or more within the dnl contour are,by definition,insignificant under nepa,because all land use activities at issue here are compatible with noise levels below dnl.see,city of bridgeton slater,cir noting that aircraft noise level is considered compatible with all land uses outside the dnl contour.courts have long accepted the faa dnl standard as the appropriate methodology for evaluating the impacts from aircraft noise.see supra part 
the faa properly applied its regulations to determine whether the plan noise impacts would be significant,and the agency determined that there would be neither significant increases within the dnl contour nor reportable increases within the or dnl contours.petitioners attempt to deflect focus from the strength of the agency findings by arguing that the faa failed to consider adequately a number of factors relevant to whether the plan will significantly affect the environment.their contentions do not carry the day.
cumulative impacts 
regulations require the agency to consider the cumulative environmental impacts of any proposed action.although petitioners challenge to the agency evaluation of the plan cumulative impacts is petitioners most factually intensive argument,it is ultimately unpersuasive especially considering that the agency methodology is well established and that its ambient noise measurements take into account most of the problems that petitioners raise.
for example,the ambient noise measurements answer petitioners claim that the faa only considered the plan incremental impacts,rather than adding the incremental impact to the environmental baseline.petitioners challenge clearly misconstrues the agency actual methodology,as the faa ambient measurements do take into account the environmental baseline.after measuring the environmental baseline,the faa then calculated the aircraft portion of this ambient level and used the inm to calculate the aircraft only noise for each alternative.thereafter,the faa evaluated the relative change in noise level attributable to aircraft noise.it then logarithmically calculated how the projected aircraft noise from the project,when added to the ambient baseline,would change the baseline ambient noise levels.this process indisputably examines both the incremental impact of the project as well as the environmental baseline.this case is thus unlike grand canyon trust,to which petitioners attempt to compare it.unlike the present case,in grand canyon trust the faa failed to conduct ambient monitoring.petitioners argument that the faa did not account for local aircraft operations excluded from the inm is likewise unpersuasive because the ambient measurements considered the local operations noise impact.
petitioners next argue that the faa did not consider the ceiling effect that the northwest plan procedures have on aircraft operations from satellite airports in the phoenix area.although the ceiling effect was not specifically discussed in the record,its omission does not render the faa decision arbitrary and capricious.respondents adequately explain the ceiling effect exclusion from the ea and fonsi 
before,controllers routinely descended satellite arrivals beneath phx traffic when necessary.for over a decade,these arrivals would then be radar vectored over and near cave,they are similarly descended beneath phx traffic when necessary.they are then radar vectored over the cave creek and carefree area at the same frequency and altitudes previously on the ferer an arrival procedure from the north of phx the new jcobs procedure routes the same number of arrivals as did the ferer and does not lead to any increased overflights of the area 
after,fewer satellite departures fly over or near cave cross ranch than before the plan.this is so because some satellite departures are now radar vectored directly to the west and thus depart in the opposite direction of cave cross ranch.the remaining departures,which at times may be descended below phx arrivals on the brusr the arrival procedure that replaced the old karlo star,are held there no longer than the satellite arrivals were held below drake departures 
thus,there is no such thing as a ceiling effect,rather just as before at times satellite arrivals or departures will need to be held or sequenced to avoid phx arrivals or departures.also,as faa found,the altitude of satellite operations would be the same over cave cross with the plan than they were under the old flight paths 
furthermore,petitioners suggestion that the socalled ceiling effect impacted faa analysis of aircraft altitude for noise purposes is wrong.faa uses actual flight tracks to develop the inm model runs.thus,to the extent a satellite operation must descend beneath a phx operation,the altitude of the satellite aircraft and duration of the descent are factors captured by faa analysis of flight track data for use within the inm.
inm modeling accounts for impacts from altitudes of aircraft within flight paths.in its noise analysis,faa explained that the inm is able to define descent profiles representative of the proposed procedures and also takes into account terrain data to calculate the altitude of aircraft above the ground.

petitioners also contend that the faa did not adequately consider the cumulative effects of the northwest plan because the agency failed to account properly for the location of aircraft.in other words,the agency did not analyze noise impacts as a cumulative impact of the plan.again,respondents adequately explain the agency use of radar vectors 
petitioners err in criticizing faa for not analyzing noise impacts as a cumulative impact of the plan.but because classic procedures which include radar vectoring were developed and implemented in the plan,to the extent such procedures cause any impacts,such impacts are direct impacts of the project and should be evaluated as faa did here.
the ea makes clear that the route modifications involve both classic flight routes,which use radar vectoring procedures,as well as rnav routes,which do not.likewise,within its noise analysis,faa explained that the arrival and departure routes implemented as part of the plan,and evaluated for noise purposes,are both classic and area navigation rnav procedures.
all arrival and departure procedures within the plan were developed and implemented as classic procedures where aircraft fly dispersed routes within courses that are approximately one to eight miles in width.for classic procedures,dispersion within the corridor reflects the anticipated vectoring assigned to aircraft as they move through the airspace between enroute fixes.faa disclosed that radar vectoring procedures are part and parcel of the classic routes developed for the plan.impacts related to aircraft dispersion due to radar vectoring,therefore,are not cumulative impacts but are direct impacts of the project.
faa evaluated dispersion as a direct impact of the project by accounting for any such vectoring within its noise modeling.contrary to petitioners suggestions,faa used the inm model and adequately evaluated noise impacts of aircraft dispersion related to radar vectoring procedures.in fact,faa development of its comparative flight paths for the inm model expressly accounted for the existing and projected radar vectoring within classic procedures.
for the alternative,faa dispersed the standard arrival and departure definitions published by phx and each satellite airport,through radar data depicting the actual locations including altitudes flown by aircraft to and from the airports.for alternatives and,faa developed flight tracks by defining the proposed star and dp procedures and dispersing such routes to reflect corridor widths comparable to those associated with current classic procedures.
