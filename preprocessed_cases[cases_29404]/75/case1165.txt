david douglas pearson was struck by an uninsured motorist while crossing an intersection on foot.pearson was listed as an additional driver under an automobile insurance policy issued by the mercury insurance company mercury to pearson fiancée as the named insured.asserting that the uninsured motorist provisions of the policy did not cover pearson for injuries suffered in a pedestrian accident,mercury denied coverage for pearson.mercury sued pearson for declaratory relief and pearson against mercury and the insurance agents who procured the policy.following mercury demurrer and motion for judgment on the pleadings,the trial court granted judgment in favor of mercury.
on appeal,pearson contends that mercury insurance policy is ambiguous and created a reasonable expectation of coverage on his part,and he should be permitted to amend his to allege causes of action against mercury for vicarious liability and reformation of the policy.finding no merit in these contentions,we affirm.
background 
on october,pearson and his fiancée,susan hyung,were struck by a speeding car driven by an uninsured motorist as they attempted to walk across an intersection at a crosswalk.hyung died from her injuries and pearson was badly injured.pearson had purchased an automobile insurance policy issued by mercury the policy covering hyung and himself,which was in force at the time of the accident.hyung was designated as the named insured in the policy.the policy declarations page listed pearson and hyung as drivers,and a designated persons endorsement to the policy specified that pearson was an additional person insured under the bodily injury coverage of the policy.
hyung heirs made a claim under the uninsured motorist coverage of the policy.mercury paid its full limit of on the hyung claim.pearson also made a claim for uninsured motorist benefits under the policy.mercury denied pearson claim on the grounds that the uninsured motorist benefits under the policy only applied to named insureds or their spouses,or to relatives living in their household,unless the accident occurred in or upon entering into or alighting from an insured motor vehicle and pearson did not qualify for uninsured motorist benefits because he was a pedestrian when the accident occurred and was not hyung spouse or her relative living in the same household.
mercury sued pearson for declaratory relief that pearson was not entitled to uninsured motorist benefits under the policy.pearson against mercury,insurance agent,jim schoensiegel,and vicencia buckley insurance services,an insurance agency hereafter vicencia,alleging causes of action for declaratory relief and reformation,breach of insurance contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,professional negligence,and breach of contract.mercury demurred on the grounds that as a matter of law,the policy did not provide uninsured motorist coverage for pearson pearson claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing also failed because there was no coverage under the policy and pearson causes of action for professional negligence and breach of contract failed to state a claim against mercury.
the trial court sustained mercury demurrer without leave to amend.because the issue of coverage framed by its original complaint was still before the court,mercury followed its demurrer with a motion for judgment on the pleadings,which was also granted.pearson timely appealed from the ensuing judgment against him and in favor of mercury.
ii.discussion 
pearson contends that ambiguities in the policy language and the designated persons endorsement show that his coverage was with hyung and in the alternative,the judgment should be reversed to permit him to proceed on theories of vicarious liability reformation of the policy.
policy ambiguity 
relevant policy provisions 
the relevant provisions of the policy are as follows 
under the capitalized heading,important notice,appearing on a separate page immediately following the cover page of the policy,is the following text unless drivers residing with the insured are named in the declarations,coverage may not be afforded.if you desire coverage for drivers other than those shown,request your to have your policy amended to list the additional drivers.
parts i,ii,iii,and iv of the policy provide coverage for defense and indemnity with respect to third party bodily injury and property damage liability claims part i,medical services part ii,vehicular damage part iii,and damages caused by uninsured motorists part iv.parts i,ii,and iv each contain separate clauses specifying the persons who are insured under them,while part iii specifies the vehicles that it covers.under part i,the persons insured include,with respect to accidents involving automobiles listed in the policy,the named insured or named insured spouse who resides with the named insured,persons listed as drivers in the policy declarations,persons using an owned automobile with the permission of the named insured,and persons residing with the permissive user if related to him or her by blood,marriage,or adoption.with respect to automobiles not listed in the policy,part i affords coverage to the named insured or named insured spouse who resides with the named insured,and to relatives who reside with the named insured and are listed as drivers in the policy declarations.
part ii affords medical expense coverage to the named insured,each relative of the named insured who lives with the named insured and sustains bodily injury while occupying a listed automobile or who,as a pedestrian,sustains injury caused by a moving automobile,any other person injured while occupying a listed automobile if driven by the named insured,a relative who lives with the named insured,or a person driving with the named insured permission.
the uninsured motorist coverage provisions,contained in part iv of the policy,state that mercury will pay all sums which the insured shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner,or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury,sustained by the insured,caused by accident and arising out of the ownership,maintenance or use of such uninsured motor vehicles.immediately below the description of uninsured motorist coverage provided by the policy is a list of definitions.the policy defines the unqualified term insured for purposes of part iv to include the named insured and the spouse of the named insured and while residents of the same household,relatives of either while occupants of a motor vehicle or otherwise and any other person while in or upon or entering into or alighting from an insured motor vehicle.this definition mirrors statutory definitions required by insurance code section 
the policy also contained a designated persons endorsement.this endorsement listed pearson as a designated person,and amended the definition of persons insured in part i of the policy to include the person s designated by name in this endorsement.immediately below the language amending the policy,the endorsement includes the following four sentences,each set apart in a separate paragraph it is agreed that the designated person s resides with the named insured,but is not a relative as the words named insured,and relative are defined in the policy.this policy does not provide coverage for any motor vehicle owned by,or acquired from,or available for the regular use of,a person s residing with the named insured unless such person s is occupying a motor vehicle listed in the policy declarations.the uninsured motorist coverage does not provide coverage for bodily injury sustained by a resident of the same household as the named insured,who is not a relative,unless such person s is occupying a motor vehicle listed in the policy declarations.it is agreed the designated person s is a resident of the same household as the named insured,is not a relative,and is only provided coverage when operating or occupying a motor vehicle listed in the policy declarations.italics added.the endorsement contained a warning in capital letters stating,do not sign this agreement until you read and understand it.just below the printed warning,hyung was required to write out by hand the words,i have read and understand this document and i do read english.the endorsement was signed by pearson as a resident driver and by hyung as the named insured.

pearson argues that the important notice at the front of the policy created an expectation that the coverage afforded to additional drivers named in the declarations page would be coextensive with that afforded to the named insured.in pearson view,the fact that the uninsured motorist provisions do not in fact provide coextensive coverage for additional drivers merely creates an ambiguity or conflict in the policy terms that must be resolved in favor of coverage.the designated persons endorsement,according to pearson,may be construed either as surplusage or an ineffective waiver of the additional uninsured motorist coverage provided due to the ambiguity created by the important notice placed at the front of the policy.
at the outset,we reject pearson claim that the important notice,read in combination with the uninsured motorist provisions,creates an ambiguity about the extent of uninsured motorist coverage for additional drivers.construed according to its plain meaning,the important notice is simply a courtesy warning to the policyholder that drivers residing with the named insured who are not listed on the declarations page are not necessarily afforded the same coverage under the policy as additional drivers who are listed in the declarations page.the word drivers appears three times in the notice.this notice simply warns policyholders of the fact that the liability provisions of the only provisions that apply exclusively to differently to potential drivers who reside with the named insured,depending on whether such persons are or are not listed as additional drivers in the declarations page the notice can not reasonably be construed as a promise that,notwithstanding the actual language of the policy,a driver named in the declarations automatically receives the same coverage as the named insured for every type of loss,liability,or accident covered by the policy.
the designated persons endorsement further undermines pearson position that the policy is ambiguous.the endorsement is clear and explicit that the uninsured motorist coverage would not provide coverage for bodily injury sustained by pearson unless he was occupying a motor vehicle listed in the policy declarations,and that he had no coverage under any portion of the policy unless he was operating or occupying a motor vehicle listed in the declarations.he signed the endorsement,as did hyung,and the endorsement contained a warning in capitalized lettering not to sign it until you read and understand it.
with respect to the issue of whether pearson was covered for bodily injuries he sustained when struck by an uninsured motorist while crossing a street on foot,we find no ambiguity in the policy.the policy uninsured motorist provisions mirror the statutory definitions authorized by insurance code section and any asserted ambiguity in them may not be construed against mercury.interinsurance exchange marquez d.
the trial court properly sustained mercury demurrer and granted its motion for judgment on the pleadings based on the theory that the mercury policy did not as a matter of law afford coverage for pearson injuries.we turn now to the issue of whether pearson should nonetheless have leave to amend his to plead causes of action not based on the premise that the written policy issued to him provided coverage for his injuries.
vicarious liability and reformation 
pearson concedes that he made no request for leave to amend his in the trial court,and failed to show in what manner he could have amended his pleading to state a viable cause of action against mercury.he argues,correctly,that he is entitled to make such a showing for the first time on appeal,in reliance on the following language from performance plastering richmond american homes of california th at pages,d a trial court order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend is reviewable for abuse of discretion even though no request to amend the pleading was made.code civ,subd.a.while it is the plaintiff burden to show that the trial court abused its discretion and show in what manner he can amend his complaint and how that amendment will change the legal effect of his pleading citation,a plaintiff can make such a showing for the first time to the reviewing court citation.
pearson maintains that the allegations of his are either sufficient as is to state causes of action for vicarious liability and reformation,or can be amended to state such causes of action.
with regard to vicarious liability,pearson alleged that in the event the policy did not afford coverage for his injuries,agent schoensiegel and broker vicencia were dual agents and that mercury should therefore be held vicariously liable to him for their negligent failure to procure the coverage that he had requested,individual coverage for injuries to him caused by an uninsured motorist that was coextensive with the coverage afforded to hyung.if the mere allegation of dual agency is insufficient to establish mercury vicarious liability,pearson states that he can further allege that vicencia and schoensiegel advertised to the public that they represent mercury their advertising was approved by mercury,which allows brokers to use its name and logo they are monitored and supervised by mercury and mercury lists vicencia on its internet web site.pearson points out that similar facts were held sufficient to impose vicarious liability on mercury for illegal fees charged by its.see krumme mercury ins.th,d.pearson also proposes to allege that mercury prohibits its agents and brokers from showing exemplar policies to prospective insureds and that vicencia and schoensiegel arbitrarily selected hyung as the named insured without disclosing that he and hyung would not be receiving equal coverage under the policy,as requested.
in our view,pearson,if amended as proposed,would not state a viable cause of action for vicarious liability against mercury.first,pearson makes no claim that vicencia and schoensiegel exclusively represented mercury if an insurance agent is the agent for several companies,and either selects the company with which to place the insurance or picks an insurer at the insured direction,the insurance agent is the agent of the insured,not the insurer.eddy sharp d.even if vicencia and schoensiegel were dual agents,any alleged negligence on their part in procuring the insurance pearson requested was committed,as a matter of law,in their capacities as pearson agent.see troost estate of deboer d.
