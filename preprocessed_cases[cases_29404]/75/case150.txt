background 
on january,nsrc sent a letter to ollman,a locomotive engineer in its employ.the letter alleged that ollman had engaged in conduct unbecoming an nsrc employee and that he had taken unjustified sick leave.pursuant to the procedures established in the collective bargaining agreement between nsrc and ble,nsrc summoned ollman to an investigative hearing.
a.the proceedings on the property and before the board 
the formal investigation,which consisted of testimony by several witnesses and a statement on ollman behalf,took place on february.according to the transcript of the hearing,ollman attended,and two ble local chairmen,robert linsey and price,acted as his representatives.ollman was asked at the hearing whether he desire d representation to assist him,and he replied,from bob linsey and mike price.
on february,nsrc dismissed ollman.nsrc denied ollman subsequent appeal.then ble,as provided for by the rla,see first i,petitioned the local special board of adjustment to review ollman dismissal.the record does not establish whether ble advised ollman that it had taken this action on his behalf.ble recovered a letter from its archives,dated june,and addressed from ble vice general chairman larry sykes to ollman,stating the date,time,and location of the hearing before the board the sykes letter.ollman denies ever receiving such a letter and raises questions as to its genuineness and admissibility.
on july,the board convened to review ollman appeal.ollman denies attending the hearing,and there is no record of his presence.ble representatives prepared a submission on his behalf and argued his case.on october,the board determined that,because nsrc had carried its burden of proof,ollman was not entitled to relief.
on december,ble sent ollman a certified letter advising him of the board decision.the letter further stated that ollman could seek judicial review of the proceedings but that none of the limited circumstances under which review was possible appeared to be present in his case.progression of any such appeal would be your responsibility,the letter continued,and such an appeal would have to be filed in united states district court within two years of the date this award was rendered october,ollman does not deny that he received this correspondence.
b.the district court proceedings 
acting pro se,ollman filed a verified petition in the united states district court for the western district of new york on may.and on january,pursuant to the district court direction,ollman filed an amended complaint.the complaint alleged that the board,nsrc,and ble had failed to provide him with notice of the board proceeding,and that such notice was required by the provision of the rla,which directs that the board give due notice of all hearings to the employee.first j.it also alleged that ble violated its duty of fair representation 
appellees filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint.the board argued that,as an impartial adjudicatory tribunal,it was immune from suit.ble claimed that it,also,was an improper party to the suit,and that ollman fair representation claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.ble and nsrc also argued,relying on materials attached to ble motion,that ollman had received whatever notice the rla requires.these materials included a declaration by linsey,a transcript of the february,proceeding,and a copy of the sykes letter advising ollman of the date,time,and place of the board hearing.
by order dated january,the district court converted appellees motions into motions for summary judgment,in light of the outside materials they incorporated.the court also noted that the date on which ollman was to have filed his response had passed.accordingly,it ordered ollman to file and serve his response by february.and because ollman was acting pro se,it ordered the clerk of court to send ollman both a copy of the court order and an irby warning see irby city transit,cir warning that we will vacate summary judgment dismissals against a pro se litigant when the pro se is unaware of the consequences of failing to adequately respond to the motion for summary judgment.
on march,ollman filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the motions to dismiss,in which he claimed that he had never received the sykes letter,nor had anyone at his home address,and that ble had no permission either implied or direct to peruse sic any claim on his behalf.ollman filed no documentary exhibits and no affidavits or other sworn statements.
on march,the district court granted appellees motions for summary judgment and dismissed the case.
the district court first addressed,and accepted,the board argument that it should not have been made a party to ollman petition for review of its award.based on our decision in skidmore consolidated rail,cir,cert.denied,d,and the text of the rla,see first q,judge siragusa concluded that the board,as an impartial adjudicator,had no vested interest in defending its decision on appeal,and that its role was limited by the rla to forwarding the record of the proceeding to the district court.
next the district court addressed ble arguments.the court found that,like the board,ble is not a proper party to a petition for review of a board decision.l ogically,judge siragusa explained,the union role at the adjustment board is as an advocate for the employee thus,the union is more analogous to an attorney in a lower court proceeding,than to a party.ollman special bd.of adjustment,cjs,wl,at.relying upon system federation,braidwood,he also characterized the petition for review as a continuation of the proceedings before the board,to which nsrc alone was a party defendant it followed that a person seeking review of the board decision should name as respondent his opponent below.judge siragusa therefore concluded that,o ther than the allegation that the union breached its duty of fair representation,there is no basis for having it as a party in this proceeding.id.at.
as for ollman fair representation claim,the court held that it was barred by a statute of limitations.according to the exhibits attached to ble motion,the board denied ollman claim on october,linsey received a copy of the award on december,and informed ollman of it by certified mail on december.ollman did not contest these facts.therefore,when ollman filed suit in federal court on september,he was well outside the limitations period.
last,the district court addressed nsrc argument regarding ollman assertion that he was not given notice of the hearing before the board.unlike the board and ble,nsrc conceded that it was a proper party to this action,but it maintained that ollman claim failed as a matter of law.judge siragusa agreed.he determined that when a union represents an employee before the board,the rla due notice provision is satisfied by notice from the union to the employee.judge siragusa further found,citing the linsey declaration and the sykes letter,that ble advised ollman of the board proceeding,and that,in fact,ollman was present and participated in the hearing.id.at.
c.the appeal to our court 
in april,ollman,still acting pro se,appealed the district court decision to our court.he requested appointment of counsel.we granted that request in part,and ordered appointed counsel to brief the following questions 
a where an employee is represented by his union before a special board of adjustment,whether the notice requirement of,first j of the railway labor act,first j,is satisfied by providing notice to that employee union,rather than providing actual notice to the employee himself,
b whether a union may be a proper party to a proceeding seeking review of the award of a special board of adjustment pursuant to,first q of the railway labor act,first q,and 
c related issues.
see ollman special bd.of adjustment,cir.may,unpublished order.but we denied the motion and dismissed ollman appeal with respect to his duty of fair representation claim against ble.id.
through counsel,ollman now argues that the district court erred in relieving appellees of their statutory notice obligations he urges that only notice from the board directly to him suffices under the statute that the district court incorrectly deemed the board and ble improper parties to the petition for review and that,in the interests of justice,and in light of the union misleading communications regarding how long ollman had to seek review of the board award,we should reinstate his duty of fair representation claim and remand that claim to the district court.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,utilizing the same standard as the district court.parks real estate purchasing group paul fire marine ins,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.a material fact is one that would affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law,and a dispute about a genuine issue of material fact occurs if the evidence is such that a reasonable factfinder could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.parks real estate,at alteration in original quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.a court reviewing a motion for summary judgment must construe the facts in the light most favorable to the party and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant.dallas aerospace,cis air,cir.
governing law the railway labor act 
the rla was passed in to encourage collective bargaining by railroads and their employees in order to prevent wasteful strikes and interruptions of interstate commerce.detroit united transp.union,d.it provided for the creation of local boards of adjustment to settle both the grievances that arose in the ordinary course of carrying out major agreements and policies and those that occurred incidentally in the course of a worker employment.
it soon became apparent,however,that many carriers were refusing to participate on local boards,and that those local boards that had been formed tended to become deadlocked.union pac.price,d.unadjusted disputes grew numerous.id.at.accordingly,congress amended the rla in to establish better procedures for resolving grievances,or minor disputes,between employees,unions,and carriers.elgin,ry.burley.hereinafter burley i,adhered to on reh g.hereinafter burley ii.the amended act created the national railroad adjustment board nrab,which consists of seventeen members selected by the carriers and seventeen by the employee representatives.first a.the act states that disputes may be referred by petition of the parties or by either party to the appropriate division of the nrab with a full statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the disputes.id.first i 
despite the creation of the nrab,and despite provisions of the act that allowed for the creation of local adjudicatory boards,the backlog problem persisted.in,congress amended the rla again.it now authorizes a carrier and a representative of the employees of that carrier to agree to the formation of a special adjustment board.id.second.like the nrab,the board sits in panels consisting of one person designated by the carrier,one person designated by the representative of the employees,and,in the event of a deadlock,one neutral panelist.id.a special adjustment board may resolve disputes otherwise referable to the nrab.id.
the rla governs how disputes proceed before an adjustment board.it states that p arties may be heard either in person,by counsel,or by other representatives,as they may respectively elect,and that the several divisions of the adjustment board shall give due notice of all hearings to the employee or employees and the carrier or carriers involved in any disputes submitted to them.id.first j an adjustment board award is binding on the parties and is enforceable in district court.id.first p,second.
the rla also provides for limited judicial review of nrab and special adjustment board awards.pursuant to first q,an aggrieved employee or other beneficiary of the order of the board may file a petition for review in the district court for the district where the employee resides or where the principal operating office of the carrier is located.the district court has jurisdiction to affirm the order of the division,or to set it aside,in whole or in part,or it may remand the proceedings to the division for such action as it may direct.id but the scope of district court review is limited the findings and order of the board are conclusive unless the court finds that the board has failed to comply with the requirements of the rla,that the board has exceeded its jurisdiction,or that a member of the board has engaged in fraud or corruption.id 
whether the notice provision of the rla may be satisfied by notice to an employee union,or whether the board must notify the employee directly 
according to ollman,the rla notice requirement contemplates that the board must notify an involved employee not solely the employee a pending board hearing,the employee must receive notice directly from the board.we disagree,and join the fifth and seventh circuits in holding that if an employee is represented by his or her collective bargaining representative,notice by the board to that representative satisfies the rla.see pub.law bd,cir w here an individual employee authorizes his union to represent him before such boards and to receive any notices on his behalf,section first j does not require that actual notice be given to the individual employee.of,airline clerks louis sw.ry,cir holding that the board is obligated to notify an employee or his representative of any proceeding that may result in that employee losing his position and that a letter of notification to one or two union representatives normally will ensure adequate notice see also steward mann,cir stating,in dicta,that in the usual case,when the board gives the union,rather than the employee,notice of the hearing,courts will not automatically set aside the board award for failure to give due notice to the employee united steelworkers of am.local union,cir vacating and remanding a district court dismissal of an employee petition for review of a decision of an adjustment board because t he notice requirement of the rla clearly indicates that the employee or his presently retained counsel should be given notice of the board hearing,and this was not done emphasis added.
we pause here to comment on the terminology that ollman,in his brief,has employed.he claims that the issue before us is w hether the district court erred in relieving defendants of their clear statutory notice requirements to wit,the special board of adjustment providing actual notice directly to the plaintiff.emphasis added this language,and the argument that the brief lays out,appear to conflate two concepts.the first concept involves whether,under the rla,an employee has a right to be sent notice directly what some cases have referred to as personal notice and others,confusingly,have called actual notice or whether notice can instead be served on his representative,specifically,his union representative.that is the question that this case presents whether service upon ble,rather than direct service upon ollman himself,satisfies the rla notice requirement.for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that service upon ble was sufficient.
the second conflated concept,which we need not address,is whether the due notice provision of the rla requires that an employee or the employee agent actually receive notice,or whether in some circumstances constructive notice arising from actions of the board or the employer undertaking to give notice,by mailing notice to the employee agent or the agent last known address can suffice.because we hold that service upon ble,rather than upon ollman himself,satisfied the rla notice requirement,and because the record shows that ble in fact received notice of the pending board hearing,we do not address the latter issue.
in reaching today decision,we turn first to the text of the rla.see united states nelson,cir the starting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.internal quotation marks omitted.this is not a case,however,where the language of the statute is unambiguous.while the rla requires the several divisions of the adjustment board to give due notice of all hearings to the employee or employees and the carrier or carriers involved in any disputes submitted to them,first j,it does not define due notice,and the meaning of due notice is not,see burley ii,at.the supreme court has,however,had occasion to discuss the rla and that statute use of the term due notice albeit in a slightly different the burley cases.see burley i,adhered to on reh g,burley ii.accordingly,we turn to these cases for guidance in reading the statute.
the burley cases addressed whether a collective bargaining representative had authority either to settle accrued monetary claims of certain railroad employees or to submit those claims for determination by the the exclusion of the employee statutory rights.disagreeing with the nrab and the union,the burley i court answered no the employee rights,to share in the negotiations,to be heard before the board,to have notice,and to bring the enforcement suit,would become rights more of shadow than of substance if the union,by coming to agreement with the carrier,could foreclose his claim altogether at the threshold of the statutory procedure.at.emphasis added.in other words,an individual employee has statutorily created the right to can not be nullified merely by agreement between the carrier and the union.id.at.
burley i also stated,however,that an employee may exercise independently his statutorily created rights or he may authorize the union to exercise those rights in his behalf.see also first j stating that parties appearing before the nrab may be heard either in person,by counsel,or by other representatives,as they may respectively elect.and burley ii,the decision issued on rehearing,made clear that in many situations,an employee collective agent will indeed have authority either to settle finally the aggrieved individual employee claims or to represent him exclusively before the adjustment board.at.drawing on agency principles,the burley ii court observed that a union,constitution,or other governing regulations could confer such authority on a union,as could custom and usage.id.at.
the burley cases do not,of course,resolve the question before us today.nonetheless,they are telling.the employees who brought suit in burley claimed,inter alia,that the award of the nrab ought to be vacated because they were entitled to have notice individually of the proceedings before the board and none was given.burley i,at.and faced with this claim,the court resolved the case in favor of the employees.it did so because it was unable to say as a matter of law that respondents had authorized the brotherhood to act for them whether in submitting the cause or in representing them before the board.id.at.the parties had,moreover,conceded that the employees were not given notice of the proceeding,while the employees denied knowledge of the proceedings and of the award until after it was entered.under the circumstances,the supreme court remanded the case to allow the district court to determine whether the award was effective in any manner to affect their rights.id.the crucial issue in this respect,the supreme court went on to say,will be initially whether respondents had authorized the brotherhood in any legally sufficient manner to represent them,individually,in the board proceedings id.emphasis added.the court thus suggested that if the employees had authorized the union to proceed on their behalf,notice to the union,indirect notice rather than direct notice would satisfy the rla.
drawing on burley i and ii,our prior reading of those decisions,and the persuasive decisions of two of our sister circuits,we hold that when an employee has authorized a union to take a grievance to an adjustment board and proceed before the board on the employee behalf,and when the employee has taken no steps to withdraw that authorization,the employee right to due notice of a pending board hearing is satisfied by timely notice to the employee union 
we emphasize that this holding does not leave an employee without recourse should the union fail to tell the employee of a pending board proceeding,or otherwise misrepresent the employee interests.in that event,the employee may seek relief from the union for breach of its duty of fair representation.see english burlington,cir if the union representative does not fully inform the employee about the board hearing or misleads the employee about his rights in those proceedings,the employee has a statutory remedy against the union for breach of its duty of fair representation.we have remarked before that this,since the burley decisions,has become broadly applicable to all facets of the employee relationship with his collective agent including particularly the settlement of grievances provides a more effective means of protecting the employee against arbitrary abuses of settlement procedures than assuming that an individual employee can act on her own to settle her grievance and then vacating an award when that assumption proves flawed.pyzynski cent,cir.
whether summary judgment was properly granted to appellees on ollman due notice claim 
ollman contends that even if notice through a duly authorized union satisfies the rla notice requirement,the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees because there was no evidence that ble was authorized to represent him before the board.again,we disagree.at his hearing,ollman stated that he wished to be represented by two ble officials.the record discloses no indications that ollman withdrew that authority,and several indications that ble believed that ollman desired its continued representation,its referral of the dispute to the board and its preparation of ollman case for board review accordingly,we conclude that ollman due notice claim fails as a matter of law summary judgment was properly granted.
whether,under the rla,the board and ble are proper parties to a petition for review in district court 
because the issue remains relevant to ollman claim against ble,we next address his claim that the district court erred in deeming the board and ble improper parties to the petition for review.like the district court,we believe that our decision in skidmore consolidated rail,cir,controls this issue.in skidmore,a railroad employee appealed from a district court order dismissing his petition for review of an award of the nrab.after concluding that the petitioner claim was foreclosed by prior litigation,and that in any event,the petition was properly dismissed because the district court lacked power to remedy the error c
