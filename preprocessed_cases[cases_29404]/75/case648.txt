aircraft service international,doing business as aircraft service international group asig,sought and obtained a preliminary injunction from the district court in october prohibiting asig employees from striking at seattle tacoma international airport sea tac.section of the norris laguardia act nlga strips district courts of jurisdiction to enter such an injunction unless the party seeking relief has made every reasonable effort to settle such dispute either by negotiation or with the aid of any available governmental machinery of mediation or voluntary arbitration.because the district court failed to consider whether asig satisfied this provision and the record lacks any evidence that asig did so,we reverse and vacate the preliminary injunction.
facts and procedural history 
asig is responsible for refueling about percent of the airplanes at sea tac.the dispute at issue arose when asig indefinitely suspended one of its fuelers,alex popescu,on september.popescu and other asig fuelers allege that he was suspended in retaliation for his leadership on workplace safety issues,including testifying at a public hearing of the seattle port commission.asig counters that popescu was suspended so it could investigate reports that he had engaged in inappropriate conduct at the workplace.
after his suspension,popescu and other asig fuelers decided to organize a group response to press for his reinstatement.working washington,a local coalition united in support of quality jobs and a fair economy,was heavily involved in this effort.jonathan rosenblum is working washington campaign director.after unsuccessfully advocating for popescu reinstatement for two weeks,and at working washington recommendation,the fuelers began distributing strike ballots on september.b y an overwhelming margin,the fuelers voted to approve a strike to get alex popescu back to work and to protest retaliation and intimidation by asig.working washington held a press conference soon after to publicize the fuelers vote.two days after this press conference,asig filed a complaint in the western district of washington seeking to enjoin any anticipated strike.this chain of events is summarized as follows 
september,asig suspends popescu.
september,popescu meets with the local asig station manager to discuss reinstatement and investigatory process.
september,several asig fuelers allegedly call asig human resources department to ask for popescu reinstatement.
september,working washington distributes and collects strike ballots.
september,the strike ballots are counted.
october,working washington holds a press conference publicizing the strike vote.
october,asig files a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief.
the district court issued a temporary restraining order on october,prohibiting the fuelers from engaging in any strike activity or other concerted action which is intended to interfere with asig operations.after a hearing,the district court issued the following preliminary injunction on october,
alex popescu,working washington,jonathan rosenblum,and john does,and their officers,agents,employees,and members are hereby preliminarily enjoined from in any manner or by any means directing,calling,causing,authorizing,inducing,instigating,conducting,continuing,encouraging,or engaging in any strike,work stoppage,campaign,or other concerted action in violation of the railway labor act which is intended to interfere with asi g normal operations.

in granting this preliminary injunction,the district court assessed whether asig had satisfied the four prongs of the winter test the moving party is likely to succeed on the merits irreparable harm is likely if the injunction is not granted the balance of equities tips in the moving party favor and an injunction is in the public interest.winter natural res.def.council,d.acknowledging that the parties spen t very little time briefing the other three criteria,the district court devoted the lion share of its analysis to the first prong in particular,defendants contention that the railway labor act rla does not govern the dispute.the district court relied on both the rla stated purpose of avoiding interruptions to commerce and its prohibition on tactics in concluding that the act prohibited defendants proposed strike.
the district court then addressed defendants argument that it had no authority to issue an injunction because the nlga forbids it from doing so.citing burlington northern railroad brotherhood of maintenance of way employes,d,and pittsburgh lake erie railroad railway labor executives ass n,d,the district court concluded that the rla trumped the nlga.the district court entered the injunction without analyzing or citing section of the nlga.

iii.discussion 
the nlga generally divests federal courts of jurisdiction to issue any restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute,except in a strict conformity with the provisions of the nlga.two provisions of the nlga are relevant to this case section and section.under section,in any case involving or growing out of any labor dispute,federal courts are prohibited from issuing an injunction to prohibit any person from c easing or refusing to perform any work,striking.id.a.under section,federal courts are prohibited from issuing injunctive relief to any complainant who has failed to comply with any obligation imposed by law which is involved in the labor dispute in question,or who has failed to make every reasonable effort to settle such dispute either by negotiation or with the aid of any available governmental machinery of mediation or voluntary arbitration.id.section is called the nlga clean hands provision.of trainmen,enter.lodge,toledo.quoting cong.rec.statement of john internal quotation marks omitted.

background of the norris laguardia act and the railway labor act 
the norris laguardia act was enacted to tak e the federal courts out of the labor injunction business.jacksonville bulk terminals,int l longshoremen ass n,d emphasis omitted.before its passage in,federal courts routinely enjoined labor picketing at the behest of employers.burlington santa fe ry.int l of teamsters local,cir en banc see milk wagon drivers union,local lake valley farm.citing congressional report that approximately injunctions were issued in connection with the railway shopmen strike of.this practice was derisively dubbed government by injunction.burlington santa fe ry,at quoting milk wagon drivers union,u.at.
seeking injunctive relief was popular among employers because of its unique effectiveness in stifling labor disputes.id.p reliminary injunctions enabled employers to defeat unions instantly by preventing them from using and destroying the momentum of strikes before substantive legal rights were litigated.see also felix frankfurter nathan greene,the labor injunction.employers typically sought relief in federal courts because federal judges tended to be more hostile to labor than state court judges.burlington santa fe ry,at.rather than attempt to amend the substantive law to remedy this extraordinary problem,congress felt compelled to take the extraordinary step of divesting federal courts of equitable jurisdiction over these disputes.burlington of maint.of way employes,d.thus was born the nlga.
the railway labor act was enacted with a different goal in mind t o avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier engaged therein.passed in,the rla was intended to quell the persistent labor unrest that threaten ed disruption of transportation.of trainmen chi.river,d.finding existing voluntary mechanisms inadequate,the major railroad carriers and unions came together to craft a mandatory system of dispute resolution.id.the result was the rla virtually endless process of negotiation,mediation,voluntary arbitration,and conciliation.burlington,at internal quotation marks omitted.the hope was that future labor disputes would be resolved through this process,and not through disruptive strikes.see id.at.congress extended the same benefits and obligations of this process to the fledgling air transportation industry in.int l ass of machinists cent.airlines,d see.
interplay between the railway labor act and the norris laguardia act 
the relationship between the rla with its goal of keeping the trains and planes running and the nlga with its goal of keeping federal courts out of the labor injunction business has always been somewhat unclear.see cong.rec.statement of fiorello laguardia inquiring about an apparent between the provisions of the rla and the nlga.although section of the nlga is phrased in absolute language,the supreme court consistently has held that the competing demands of the rla and the norris laguardia act must be accommodate d.burlington,at see also int l ass of machinists street,d graham of locomotive firemen enginemen.virginian ry.fed.in practice,this means that the rla has been read as creating an exception to the nlga.yet the boundaries of this exception are narrow.although the specific provisions of the railway labor act take precedence over the more general provisions of the norris laguardia act,pittsburgh lake erie ry.labor execs.ass n,d internal quotation marks omitted,t his exception is necessarily a limited one,burlington,at.in fact,e ven when a violation of a specific mandate of the rla is shown,courts should hesitate to grant an injunction unless that remedy alone can effectively guard the plaintiff right.id.quoting int l ass of machinists,at internal quotation mark omitted.
the district court concluded that the rla applied to this dispute,and that this meant that no provision of the nlga could apply thus allowing the district court to issue the preliminary injunction without considering whether section of the nlga was satisfied.this blanket conclusion,however,elided the distinction between sections and of the nlga.although the supreme court has held that the nlga general limitation on district courts power to issue injunctions in labor disputes must be accommodated to the more specific provisions of the rla,pittsburgh lake erie,at emphasis added neither this court nor the supreme court has held that the same is true with respect to section.
the vast majority of courts to consider this question have applied section to disputes that the rla governs indeed,over the years our court has treated sections and as independent limitations on a district court power to issue an injunction,even when the rla applied.see,trans int l airlines,int l of teamsters,cir kennedy,considering whether the clean hands requirement had been satisfied independently of analysis of whether the rla trumped section switchmen union of am.pac,cir considering whether section had been satisfied after determining that the rla trumped section order of ry.conductors brakemen spokane,portland seattle ry,cir noting that,even if the rla trumped section,the supreme court toledo decision foreclose d the railroad,which positively rejected mediation,from claiming an injunction butte,anaconda pac.ry.of locomotive firemen enginemen,cir noting that section would have barred injunctive relief even if the rla had trumped section see also rutland ry.of locomotive eng rs,cir relying in part on butte for the proposition that,even if the rla trumps section,a party must comply with section to obtain injunctive relief 
this approach to the relationship between the rla and section is consistent with the supreme court past efforts to accommodate the rla and section of the nlga.as noted above,the rla creates only a limited exception to section one restricted to situations in which an injunction is the only remedy that can safeguard a right that the rla grants.burlington,at see also graham,at rejecting a construction of section that would leave federal courts powerless to enforce rights granted by the rla fed.express teamster union,local,cir w hile federal courts may issue injunctions in labor disputes to compel the parties to fulfill their obligations under the rla,when no such duties exist,the norris laguardia act controls.for example,in brotherhood of railroad trainmen chicago river indiana railroad,a union chose to strike rather than submit to the dispute resolution procedures of the rla.at.if the supreme court had chosen to strictly enforce section in those circumstances,the railroad would have effectively been left with a right under the rla without a remedy.accordingly,the court instead permitted the injunction to stand despite section to prevent the specific provisions of the rla from being rendered nugatory.see id.at quoting virginian ry,at.only in such a case of irreconcilable conflict between the rla and the nlga is it necessary to choose between the rla and the nlga.see chi.ry,at.
section,however,does not conflict with any provision of the rla.on the contrary,as the circuit recognized years ago,strict enforcement of section does not trammel,but rather further s the effectuation of that railway labor act,for it ensures compliance by complainant carrier or union which can not seek an injunction until and unless it has discharged the obligations imposed by the railway labor act.akron barberton belt,at see also local,transp.workers union of am.air lines,cir section of the norris laguardia act,however,does not conflict with the rla since section is congruent with the rla,local should be held to section requirements local,transp.workers union of am.air lines,section does not conflict with the mandatory status quo provisions of the rla.rather,section is in harmony with the purposes of the rla,modified on other grounds.in applying section in brotherhood of railroad trainmen,enterprise lodge,toledo,a case that involved the rla the supreme court said the same the policy of the railway labor act was to encourage use of the nonjudicial processes of negotiation,mediation and arbitration for the adjustment of labor disputes.the policy of the norris laguardia act was the same it is dominant and explicit in section.at citations omitted see also in re dist.pac.coast,marine eng rs beneficial ass afl cio,noting that toledo held that section had not been satisfied without even mentioning section.there is thus no need to read another exception into the nlga to accommodate the rla 
consistent with our own precedent and that of many other courts,we reaffirm that a party seeking an injunction under the rla is not relieved of its obligation to comply with the provisions of section of the nlga 
application of section to this dispute 
section provides in relevant part that n o restraining order or injunctive relief shall be granted to any complainant who has failed to make every reasonable effort to settle such dispute either by negotiation or with the aid of any available governmental machinery of mediation or voluntary arbitration.though the precise requirements of this obligation vary from case to case,there are certain minimum steps that are usually required 
unfair surprise should be avoided whenever possible.the representatives of management should meet with those of labor.each side should listen to the contentions of the other side and each side should explain its position clearly and honestly,but not for as long a time as is customary in bargaining.in short,men of good faith must in good faith get together in a sincere effort to resolve their differences.rutland ry,at.these basic requirements are consistent with the supreme court broad construction of section.see toledo,at one must not only discharge his legal obligations.he must also go beyond them and make all reasonable effort.
our past decisions construing section have fleshed out these principles.in switchmen union of north america,we faced a dispute over the bumping of a railroad yardmaster.at.in dismissing the union argument that section divested the district court of authority to issue an injunction,we concluded that the carrier had fulfilled its obligations both because there was no unfair surprise in the bumping of the yardmaster and because the carrier had attempted,in good faith,to confer on the issue prior to the incident which led to the strike.id.at.san antonio community hospital southern california district council of carpenters concerned a union decision to display a banner disparaging the cleanliness of the workplace,cir.considering the section issue,we held that it was sufficient that the employer had engaged the union on a number of occasions in an effort to resolve this dispute before seeking an injunction.id.at.
in this case,nothing in the record permits us to hold that asig satisfied section reasonable effort requirement.although the district court erred by failing to undertake a section analysis,the record reveals that asig sought an injunction from the district court without first attempting to settle the dispute even if the employees lacked an identified union representative,that did not relieve asig of its obligations under section to make every reasonable effort to resolve the disagreement before seeking the injunction.we need not map out the precise contours of section here because asig failure to make any efforts to settle the dispute fell short of what section requires,and thus the district court erred by entering the injunction 
the dissent responds by seeking to divert attention away from the conduct of asig.as far as we can tell,however,there is no authority for the dissent proposition that the actions of the employees may relieve the carrier from satisfying section prerequisites.the dissent cites switchmen union of north america,trans international airlines,order of railway conductors brakemen,and butte as support for this proposition,but not one of these cases mentions the employees conduct as relevant to the section inquiry.in switchmen union of north america,we rejected the union section argument because the carrier had performed its obligations under the railway labor act.at.in trans international airlines,we rejected the union section argument because the carrier own conduct was not sufficiently likely to be found illegal or otherwise wrongful that it should be prevented from seeking injunctive relief.at.in order of railway conductors,we noted that the carrier could not claim an injunction against a strike because the carrier had positively rejected mediation.at.in butte,we noted that the carrier was also necessarily denied from seeking an injunction because the carrier had not exhausted its administrative remedies.at.neither these cases nor the dissent can deny the toledo rule that a carrier must establish that it made every reasonable effort before seeking an injunction.at if a complainant has failed to make every reasonable effort to settle the dispute,he is forbidden relief.emphasis added.in the absence of any efforts by asig to comply with section,the dissent discussion of what the employees did or did not do is simply a red herring 
we emphasize that our conclusion is modest we hold that a party must comply with section of the nlga before seeking an injunction under the rla.the dissent suggestion that our holding will disrupt commerce is fundamentally mistaken.as the supreme court has explained,the purpose of section is to head off strikes,not encourage them.toledo,at emphasis added.section salutary mandate that parties make all reasonable efforts to settle labor disputes before seeking judicial intervention will help prevent,not cause,interruptions to commerce.by contrast,allowing injunctions when the necessary steps have not been taken,not only violates the section terms,but encourages parties to act unilaterally and avoid the reasonable steps that when achieved,make unnecessary invocation of the court aid.id.this not only defeats the purposes of the nlga,but those of the rla as well.as noted above,the policy of the rla and the nlga is the same to encourage use of the nonjudicial processes of negotiation,mediation and arbitration for the adjustment of labor disputes.id.at emphasis added.permitting a carrier to obtain an injunction to block a strike without pursuing these nonjudicial processes as the dissent would have it frustrates the goals of both statutes.
iv.conclusion 
our decision will neither summon monsters from the deep nor rain frogs from the heavens to destroy the north american transportation system.we do not hold that courts are prohibited from enjoining airport strikes.rather,our narrow holding compelled by toledo and consistent with that of the vast majority of courts confronting this issue merely requires carriers to abide by section requirements before seeking an injunction.because the record lacks evidence that asig made every reasonable effort to settle the dispute,we reverse the district court order and vacate the preliminary injunction.
reversed and vacated.
i agree with the majority that the district court erred in granting an injunction,as aircraft service international group asig has not complied with its duty under section of the norris laguardia act nlga to make every reasonable effort to settle its dispute with the fuelers before seeking an injunction prohibiting the planned work stoppage.i write only to explain that,in my view,even if asig had complied with its duty under section,asig still would not have been entitled to an injunction.
the conflict underlying this case is undisputably a labor dispute for purposes of the nlga as i explain below,it is not a dispute governed by any of the specific dispute resolution provisions of the railway labor act rla,et.as the disagreement between asig and the fuelers falls wholly outside the rla regulatory framework,there is no federal labor statute that supersedes the nlga otherwise applicable prohibition on federal court injunctions during labor disputes.the district court therefore lacks authority to enjoin the prospective work stoppage,even if asig complies with nlga section.
the majority does not say otherwise.but this is an instance in which the narrow ruling may simply prolong litigation by inviting a second motion for an injunction,preliminary or permanent,after section compliance.i would prefer to put this case to rest now.
the nlga severely constrains federal courts jurisdiction to issue injunctions concerning labor disputes,see,including entirely eliminating jurisdiction to issue injunctions in certain instances,see id.
as the majority states,see op.at,where the rla unambiguously applies,the jurisdictional bar of the nlga,can give way.see,burlington of maint.of way,d.but t his exception is necessarily a limited one,and is applicable only where a party violates an unambiguous,applicable provision of the rla.id.at.given the express divestment of authority of nlga section,the command of the rla should be explicit and the purpose to afford a judicial remedy plain before a court may grant injunctive relief to enforce an obligation under the rla.comm.of adjustment of of locomotive eng rs for.m k t.this stringent rule recognizes that,f aced with a choice between an ambiguity in the rla and the unambiguous mandate of the nlga,we are to choose the latter.burlington,at.any ambiguity eliminates federal courts equitable jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief 
the rla does not regulate all relations between carriers and their employees.for example,a wrongful discharge claim is not subject to the rla minor dispute resolution provision unless the dispute is grounded in the interpretation or application of a collective bargaining agreement.hawaiian airlines,norris,d.and the rla does not regulate jurisdictional disputes between unions over the overlapping interests of two crafts.m k t,at.instead,the rla encompasses only three classes of labor disputes and establishes a different dispute resolution procedure for each.airlines,int l of teamsters,d,in chambers.
specifically,the rla governs m ajor,m inor,and r epresentation disputes.airlines,at.major disputes comprise a class of disputes concerning rates of pay,rules or working conditions,and relate to the formation of collective bargaining agreements or efforts to secure them.norris,at quoting consol.ry.conrail ry.labor execs.ass n,d last alteration in original.the second class of disputes,known as minor disputes,gro w out of grievances id.quoting first alteration in original.these involve controversies over the meaning of an existing collective bargaining agreement in a particular fact situation.id.at quoting trainmen chicago,d.therefore,under congress scheme,major disputes seek to create contractual rights,minor disputes to enforce them.conrail,at.finally,representation disputes involve defining the bargaining unit and determining the employee representative for collective bargaining.airlines,at.the dispute between asig and the fuelers here falls into none of the three relevant rla categories.
the closest fit is the minor dispute category.the fuelers concern is with the suspension of a fellow worker,popescu.the rla mandatory arbitration mechanism applies,inter alia,to the resolution of minor disputes between an employee or group of employees and a carrier growing out of grievances,first i emphasis added,and thus can cover many disputes concerning whether a certain employee should have been disciplined or discharged.indeed,employee discipline issues are often the subject of rla minor disputes.see,union pac.of locomotive eng rs trainmen comm.of adjustment,d united transp.union bnsf ry,cir ass of flight attendants,afl cio horizon air,cir.but hawaiian airlines,norris made clear that the word grievances in the rla minor dispute resolution provisions refers only to disputes involving the application or interpretation of a cba.at.left outside the rla and so subject to resolution under state law are quotidian workplace disputes that do not concern the application or interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement,such as the one at hand.precisely because the dispute here is so similar to a traditional grievance and could well be a minor dispute were a collective bargaining agreement in place between asig and the fuelers,it can not be a major dispute,one involving employees seeking the formation of a collective bargaining agreement.
the underlying dispute in this case is not a representation dispute for essentially the same reason the workers are not seeking to collectively bargain regarding future terms and conditions of employment,and have no interest in choosing a representative of their group at this time.rla sections,third,fourth,and ninth regulate the means by which employees may bind themselves to a representative for the purpose of negotiating with an employer.see,third,fourth,and ninth.but none of those provisions contains an unambiguous obligation to select a representative where there is no desire to negotiate terms and conditions of employment with the employer.see burlington,at.
section,third,could conceivably be read in isolation to require that the employees elect a representative representatives,for the purposes of this chapter,shall be designated by the respective parties without interference,third.the immediately following section,however,section,fourth,states that e mployees shall have the right to organize,rather than the duty to organize.u,fourth.in other words,section,fourth,gives the employees the right to determine who shall be the representative of the group or,indeed,whether they shall have any representation at all.of ry.clerks ass for benefit of non contract,d.read in combination with section,fourth,then,section,third,does not require representation.rather,it prohibits both the employer and the employees from in any way interfer ing with,influenc ing,or coerc ing the other in its choice of representatives,third.as the fifth circuit concluded,employees were given the right under the act not only to opt for collective bargaining,but to reject it as well t he implicit message throughout the act is that the complete independence of the employees necessarily includes the right to reject collective representation.indeed,the concept of complete independence is inconsistent with forced representation.russell mediation,cir,reh g denied,cert.denied,d quoting.
nor does section,ninth compel the fuelers to seek union representation where they do not wish to be so represented.section,ninth,provides,in part 
if any dispute shall arise among a carrier employees as to who are the representatives of such employees designated and authorized in accordance with the requirements of this chapter,it shall be the duty of the mediation board,upon request of either party to the dispute,to investigate such dispute and to certify to both parties,in writing,within thirty days after the receipt of the invocation of its services,the name or names of the individuals or organizations that have been designated and authorized to represent the employees involved in the dispute,and certify the same to the carrier.upon receipt of such certification the carrier shall treat with the representative so certified as the representative of the craft or class for the purposes of this chapter.
ninth.in terms,section,ninth,is limited to disputes among a carrier employees as to who are the representatives of such employees,and does not apply where there is no such dispute among the employees.id.emphasis added.for that reason,the circuit has explained that the representation dispute mechanisms of section,ninth,may only be initiated by employees where the requisite dispute among employees arise s section,ninth does not contemplate an role for carriers.ry.labor execs.ass mediation,en banc,amended by,cert.denied sub nom.burlington ry.labor execs.ass n.
the second circuit opinion in summit airlines,teamsters local union,cir is consistent with this understanding.in summit airlines,the second circuit held that the representation dispute mechanisms of section,ninth are not optional where a union seek s to represent a class or craft.id.emphasis added.consequently,a union can not resort directly to economic coercion of a carrier where its object is to induce the carrier voluntarily to recognize the union as the representative of its employees.id.unless a union formally seeks and obtains certification as the employees chosen representative,the employer duty to treat with,recognize,the representative,is not triggered.id.at.thus,although an employer may voluntarily recognize a representative of a group of employees,the employer duty to treat with a representative arises only where a representative is chosen through section,ninth procedures.see also galveston wharves.
in fact,according to the national mediation board,the fuelers at sea tac are incapable of choosing among themselves a representative for dealing with their employer,as they are not a nationwide craft or class.see aircraft serv.int l group.the national mediation board longstanding practice is to conduct elections across a carrier entire system,for class or craft units that are or if the carrier operates nationally.delta air lines global.because t he craft or class must include all of the employees working in the classification deemed eligible,regardless of work locations,aircraft serv.in l group,at,and because asig employees are part of a nationwide system,id.at,the fuelers at sea tac could not elect a representative for the group under section,ninth,even if they wished to do so.
it would thus be doubly nonsensical to require the fuelers to seek representation under section,ninth,where the rla imposes no such unambiguous duty and the sea tac fuelers could not validly elect a representative of themselves as a group.as the dissenter to the original panel decision in this case concluded,w hereas the rla simply grants employees a right to organize,there is no obligation on the employees to seek unwanted representation.aircraft serv.int l,int l of teamsters local,cir,dissenting.rendering unionization compulsory violates the directive to favor the unambiguous mandate of the nlga regarding enjoining labor disputes where there is ambiguity in the rla,and would impose an illogical and condition on the fuelers.burlington,at.
the district court nonetheless held that the fuelers decision to strike was prohibited by the rla because to hold otherwise would wholly frustrate rla section,first,which requires covered employers and employees to exert every reasonable effort to settle all disputes,whether arising out of the application of agreements concerning rates of pay,rules,and working conditions or otherwise,first.but as the supreme court has explained,section,first,is not a provision.see m k t,at.
longstanding precedent confirms that section,first does not impose duties to refrain from acts not connected to those covered elsewhere in the rla.m k t held that section,first,merely states the policy of the rla which those other provisions of the rla buttress with more particularized commands.at.while chicago north western railway united transportation union,d,determined that section,first,is judicially enforceable in some circumstances,that case held only that a party breaches the duty described in section,first,where that duty implements some other command in the rla.
specifically,in chicago north western railway,after the parties ha d exhausted the formal procedures of the railway labor act,the union threatened to strike.at.the carrier persuaded a district court to enjoin any such strike,arguing that the union had not engaged in a good faith effort to discharge the obligations described in other rla provisions,including the union alleged refusal to bargain with the carrier.id.at.chicago north western railway held that such an injunction would be generally permissible,describing the content of the duty imposed by section,first,by repeated analogy to the duty under the national labor relations act to bargain in good faith,which authorizes courts to pass judgment upon the quality of the negotiations.id.at quoting archibald cox,the duty to bargain in good faith,harv.it was in this sense because it required parties to satisfy in good faith their more particularized duties that the court concluded that section first was intended to be more than a mere statement of policy or exhortation to the parties.id.at.
chicago north western railway,then,rejected only the suggestion that m k t precluded reading section,first as imposing a good faith requirement as to other,express duties elsewhere delineated in the rla.id.chicago north western railway left untouched the supreme court pronouncement in m k t that section,first,does not create a freestanding,independent duty.
cases both before and after m k t and chicago north western railway confirm the understanding that rla section,first,is enforceable only in conjunction with another rla provision.virginian railway system federation,for example,held that there is a duty to negotiate a first collective bargaining agreement,relying on the combination of rla section,first,and the obligation imposed by rla section,ninth to treat with the properly chosen majority representative.summit airlines similarly determined that there is a duty to settle a demand for recognition as a collective bargaining representative in the combination of rla section,ninth,which governs the resolution of dispute resolution mechanism,and section,first.at.
accordingly,there is no basis for interpreting the word dispute in section,first,as carrying a meaning entirely divorced from the particular disputes described elsewhere in the rla.where,as here,a dispute falls into none of the categories contemplated elsewhere in the rla,section,first,imposes no obligation to settle it,in good faith or otherwise.
this conclusion has negative as well as beneficial consequences for the fuelers.although the rla does not forbid them to strike,it does not protect that activity,either.no private cause of action exists under the rla for a group of employees who assert retaliatory conduct based upon employee activities which bear no relationship to establishing a union herring delta air lines,cir accord gullickson sw.airlines pilots ass n,cir rachford evergreen int l airlines.where,as here,employees have disclaimed any effort to form a union,and in fact are incapable of electing a representative under the rla,see aircraft serv.int l group,at,they have no recourse to the rla if their employer retaliates against them for striking.
in sum,the fuelers do not need to find a particular provision in the rla to justify striking.rather,t he affected carrier must find a specific mandate of the rla that prohibits the strike to be entitled to an injunction.ry.labor execs.ass wheeling lake erie ry,cir.as no specific mandate of the rla prohibits nonunionized employees from engaging in a strike as a first step of,asig is not entitled to an injunction against this behavior.accordingly,the injunction should be vacated for that reason,as well as for the reason endorsed by the majority.
we should affirm.the district court and the panel opinion got it right.
the railway labor act protects the public from the consequences of some labor strife with an especially grave impact on those other than the companies and employees involved.that is why it mandates extensive negotiation,mediation,and arbitration procedures in any major transportation before allowing lockouts or strikes.the provisions of the later norris laguardia act can not be read into the railway labor act before that settlement process is undertaken,without gutting the railway labor act.by expanding the reach of the norris laguardia act this way,the majority creates a circuit split shutting down the seattle tacoma international airport sea tac amounts to the blockade of a major american port which imposes harms on nonparticipants in the labor dispute that vastly outweigh the interests of the company and its employees.that is why injunctions are available to enforce the railway labor act notwithstanding the norris laguardia act.
the injunction,together with the railway labor act conciliation process,provides the statutory means congress prescribed for making labor and management negotiate,whether they choose to or not.the railway labor act and the traditional test for together ensure,as they did in the district court,that airports be kept open while negotiations go on,regardless of whether one side or both may be unreasonable.the final consideration,the public interest,is in effect written into the railway labor act.
the company in this case,aircraft service international group,aircraft service,refuels about of the airplanes at sea tac.the company suspended one of its aircraft fuelers,alex popescu.the company says it suspended popescu because employees were concerned about their safety on account of his blowups at work,episodes that he attributed to a medical condition.the general manager reported receiving complaints from employees that popescu went into a fit of rage that appeared borderline psychotic and was out of control and repeatedly had screamed obscenities at a supervisor.when,after suspension,the company tried to discuss popescu situation with him,he again yelled obscenities,threw his chair across the room,and slammed the door as he left the room.
the employees have not voted to be represented by any union,so no labor union is involved.so far as the record shows,no one is authorized to speak for popescu but popescu himself,and the company attempt to speak with him failed because he walked out and slammed the door.one of the adverse parties in this case is working washington,which is not a union,but a group that describes itself as a coalition of individuals,neighborhood associations,immigrant groups,labor unions,civil rights organizations,and people of faith.working washington campaign director says that although working washington is not seeking to become the bargaining representative of the employees and has not sought recognition,it advocates for better treatment of workers at the airport.
working washington campaign director says that the employees are compelled to work with unsafe and inadequate equipment and that the company suspended popescu because he had become a leader in public advocacy for safer and better equipment for the fuelers.according to the campaign director,the obscenity incident was a mutual exchange of yelled obscenities when popescu complained of a broken drive shaft and the supervisor accused him of sabotaging it.the campaign director alleges that working washington distributed and collected strike ballots and held a press conference to announce that the fuelers had authorized a strike against aircraft service.
working washington campaign director further states in his affidavit that the fuelers,at a gathering organized by working washington,called the company human resources department in denver to request an immediate end to popescu suspension.he states,i believe that similar calls continued throughout the evening and into the next morning.the fuelers did not get a response.the record does not contain any evidence about these calls,or for that matter,evidence that there were even any company personnel in the denver office throughout the evening and into the next morning to receive such calls.this alleged barrage of phone calls appears to be the basis for the majority view that the employees sought to negotiate and that it was the company that stonewalled them.
neither working washington nor the fuelers asked the national mediation board to intervene at that time.neither did the company.a few weeks after the strike announcement,and after the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction,six of the employees,including popescu,wrote to the national mediation board,in their capacity as unrepresented individual employees,asking whether it provided any sort of dispute resolution services.the board replied that it provided mediation services to carriers and to designated bargaining representatives of their employees,but not to individual employees or groups,so services were not available to the six employees because they had not been designated as the bargaining representatives for all the employees.
we do not know,there being no findings of fact on the point,whether popescu supporters really did try to meet with or call the company representatives,or whether the company acted unreasonably in not meeting with whoever claimed to represent its employees.the majority says the strike can not be enjoined because the company made no reasonable effort to settle the dispute.that purported fact is not established.but it does not matter.the railway labor act generally requires both parties to negotiate,mediate,and arbitrate,before either of them can shut down the airport.the point of the statute is to protect the public against the externalities of the labor dispute,not merely to protect management or labor against hardheads on the other side of the table.
ii.the statutes 
the railway labor act is among the first statutes protecting labor and encouraging union organization.its first two objectives,written into the statutory language,are to avoid any interruption of commerce and to forbid any limitation upon freedom of association among employees or any denial of the right of employees to join a labor organization.the act,though encouraging unionization,applies to unrepresented employees as well,such as the fuelers in this case.the plain text of the railway labor act defines employee as every person in the service of a carrier.both carriers and employees,whether unionized or not,must try to settle their disputes to avoid any interruption to commerce 
it shall be the duty of all carriers,their officers,agents,and employees to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay,rules,and working conditions,and to settle all disputes,whether arising out of the application of such agreements or otherwise,in order to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier growing out of any dispute between the carrier and the employees thereof.
the act generally requires the parties to confer,mediate,and arbitrate their disputes 
the railway labor act provides a detailed framework to facilitate the voluntary settlement of major disputes.a party desiring to effect a change of rates of pay,rules,or working conditions must give advance written notice.the parties must confer,and if conference fails to resolve the dispute,either or both may invoke the services of the national mediation board,which may also proffer its services sua sponte if it finds a labor emergency to exist.if mediation fails,the board must endeavor to induce the parties to submit the controversy to binding arbitration,which can take place,however,only if both consent.if arbitration is rejected and the dispute threatens substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive any section of the country of essential transportation service,the mediation board shall notify the president,who may create an emergency board to investigate and report on the dispute.while the dispute is working its way through these stages,neither party may unilaterally alter the status quo 
the fuelers,or at least those persuaded by working washington,proposed to strike without going through these procedures,and they claim that they can do this because they are not unionized and because the company has not made a reasonable effort to settle the dispute.judge smith in the panel opinion noted 
here,the employees are unwilling to even go through the motions under the railway labor act rather,they wish not to bargain but to strike.in so doing,they present the very situation for which congress enacted the railway labor act carrier employees collectively threatening a strike capable of interrupting interstate commerce by shutting down an airport.
these statutory duties are clear enough.but what happens if one or both parties do not do what the railway labor act says they should do 
the subsequently enacted norris laguardia act,promulgated in,might have been read to categorically prohibit injunctions to enforce compliance with railway labor act settlement procedures after all,the norris laguardia act generally strips federal courts of jurisdiction to issue injunctions in labor disputes this could have been read as a limit on remedies available under the railway labor act.
but the supreme court did not read it that way.brotherhood of railroad trainmen chicago river indiana railroad held that the railway labor act procedures are and the district courts do indeed have jurisdiction to enjoin noncompliance the court explained that amendments strengthening the railway labor act in,subsequent to the norris laguardia act,repaired the major weakness or lack of any compulsion in the version of the railway labor act 
the court further held that the specific provisions of the railway labor act take precedence over the more general provisions of the norris laguardia act,because the norris laguardia act protects workers generally,but the railway labor act channel s the economic forces of labor and management into special processes intended to compromise them.the court explained that injunctions prohibited by the norris laguardia act strip labor of its primary weapon without substituting any reasonable alternative.the railway labor act,by contrast,provides labor with a reasonable alternative,the mediation and settlement process set out in the act.it applies to all disputes regarding rates of pay,rules,or working conditions and to every person in the service of the carrier.this reasonable alternative eliminates the need for the norris laguardia act provisions to even the playing field the employees need not be a member of a union to invoke the railway labor act because it facilitates selection of a representative for mediation regardless,so they need not have a dispute under a collective bargaining agreement to invoke it.the railway labor act establishes that employees as well as carriers must make every reasonable effort to settle disputes whether arising out of such agreements or otherwise.the or otherwise language means that a collective bargaining agreement is not a prerequisite to the act application.
any question about the breadth of chicago river was answered by the court in chicago north western railway united transportation union there,the court held that strike injunctions may issue when such a remedy is the only practical,effective means of enforcing the duty to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements.such a holding gives effect to the broad congressional policy t o avoid any interruption to commerce by premature labor strikes indeed,the chicago north western court was particularly aware of the dangers of such interruptions we now know,if we did not before this pair of cases,that the provisions of the norris laguardia act do not apply to disputes,such as this one,where the parties have not first engaged in any of the procedures of the railway labor act.
chicago north and chicago both rely heavily on legislative history in interpreting the railway labor act.such history merely confirms the meaning of the clear text of the statute.the court held that statements during the railway labor act hearings by spokesmen of the two parties should be given great weight in construing the act these statements confirm that petitioners can not evade the act settlement procedures simply because they are not unionized.
senator watson declared that both attorneys for labor and management agreed on the scope of the law they all state to me that beyond any doubt in the world,all classes and groups and individuals are covered every individual employee who has a grievance,or any group of employees,or any organization of employees,or any person not a member of any organization of employees.during the house debates over the amendments,the topic resurfaced since it was rumored that this senate amendment require s the employees of every railroad to be unionized before they can get any benefit.this supposition was again rejected,with representative crosser firmly stating that the amendment would not require any such thing.
even when an injunction is the only practical,effective means of enforcing duties under the railway labor act,the supreme court has held,in some cases,that section of the norris laguardia does indeed qualify issuance of an injunction with a codified clean hands requirement.the court held in brotherhood of railway trainmen toledo,peoria western railroad that section unclean hands provision prohibited the district court from enjoining a strike under the railway labor act because the railroad had failed to make every reasonable effort to settle the dispute.
the difference between the situation in toledo,peoria and our case is that the railroad and the union in toledo,peoria had indeed gone through the railway labor act process prior to the strike.in our case,the order of events is strike first,mediation maybe later,maybe never.in toledo,peoria,it was railway labor act procedures first,strike later,when the railroad refused to complete the railway labor act process by arbitrating.what made the unclean hands provision of section of the norris laguardia act applicable was the railroad rejection of the final and crucial step of arbitration.
we have similarly interpreted section to apply in situations where both parties have engaged in the railway labor act procedures,but then one of them has abandoned the process in bad faith.in switchmen union of north america southern pacific,we upheld a carrier injunction notwithstanding section because the carrier had not failed to perform its obligations under the railway labor act,or lacked good faith in attempting to settle this dispute.in trans international airlines,international brotherhood of teamsters,we rejected both the union and the carrier clean hands arguments in a dispute where the carrier and union had negotiated and mediated,but the union had refused arbitration in order of railway conductors brakemen spokane,portland seattle railway,we prohibited the carrier injunction when the union sought mediation,but the carrier declined in butte,anaconda pacific railway brotherhood of locomotive firemen enginemen,we prohibited the carrier injunction under section when the carrier abandoned mediation to get the benefit of toledo,peoria and to be able to bar the injunction,employees must participate in the railway labor act dispute resolution process,as the unions and carriers did in these earlier cases.
the majority argues that our emphasis on the conduct of the fuelers is a red herring because section only applies to the complainant,and that no authority relieves a carrier from the mandates of section.that reading eviscerates the statutory command that i t shall be the duty of employees,not just carriers,to exert every reasonable effort to settle all disputes in order to avoid any interruption to commerce the majority cites no case in this or any other circuit where section of the norris laguardia act barred a railway labor act injunction,where the employees went on strike without first engaging in any of the railway labor act procedures.there is no such case because such an application would frustrate the purposes of the railway labor act.the majority modest rule allows employees of a carrier to strike without fear of injunction as long as they are not unionized and some rump group without representational authority makes some late night phone calls demanding talks with the carrier.
like chicago river and chicago north western,toledo,peoria relies on legislative history in construing section narrowly in the railway labor act context.representative laguardia assured congress that the railway labor act provides every detail for the settlement of disputes and that t he workers could not and would not think of going on strike before all the remedies provided in the law have been exhausted.recognizing this,the court in toledo,peoria establishes that a carrier must have had the opportunity to engage in the railway labor act procedures before section would apply 
i n response to an inquiry whether or not section requirements would apply where it might be impossible to move for settlement by negotiation,mediation or arbitration,representative laguardia stated the answer to that is simple.in seeking a restraining order a party believed to be aggrieved comes into court and under a certain state of facts,which are enumerated in the bill itself,asks for a restraining order.if time has not permitted him or the corporation to avail itself of the existing governmental machinery for the settlement of a labor dispute,he recites that as one of his facts,which is a full compliance,of course,with the provisions of section,which makes it a condition precedent that every remedy must be exhausted to settle the strike before the injunction will issue.
contemporary methods of statutory construction might not rely as heavily on legislative history as the supreme court did in chicago river,chicago north western,and toledo,peoria.but the court did so rely,and in chicago north western held that because the railway labor act was a legislative product devised by the parties themselves,which congress enacted,it should be construed with particular attention to the legislative history of the act.we are thus required by chicago north western to use legislative history to construe the railway labor act.doing so,we should join the seventh circuit united air lines decision construing the relationship of the norris laguardia clean hands provision to the railway labor act as representative laguardia said it should be construed.united air lines holds that section of the norris laguardia act does not relieve employees of their duties under the railway labor act to settle disputes and avoid interruptions to commerce.it further holds that a carrier may be entitled to an injunction even where negotiation has not yet taken place.united air lines explains that to requir e a carrier to seek a negotiated solution before moving to enjoin an illegal work action would enable unions to use such actions to extort concessions from the carrier during the negotiation process.such a result would render the union duty under,first a nullity today,the majority does indeed render the employees duty to follow the railway labor act procedures a nullity,by depriving the courts of the ability to enforce the railway labor act.
iii.the public interest 
the reason injunctions are so important to the ra
