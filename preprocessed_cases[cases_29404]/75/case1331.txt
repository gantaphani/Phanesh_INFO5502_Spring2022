petitioners,express valet,and frank esposito,appeal from orders of the circuit court of cook county affirming the decisions of the department of administrative hearings doah.the doah initially found petitioners liable for violating multiple sections of the municipal code of chicago the code arising out the operation of a valet parking service in the city of chicago,and imposed various fines based upon those violations.on administrative review,the circuit court affirmed the doah findings as to liability,but remanded the matter to the doah for a new hearing on fines.following that hearing,the doah imposed new fines on petitioners for their violations of the code,and the doah decision was affirmed by the circuit court on administrative review.
petitioners appeal,contending that the record filed by the city of chicago the city as its answer to the initial complaint for administrative review failed to comply with section of the administrative review law ilcs b west that the doah erred by finding that the fines imposed were the individual responsibility of esposito rather than the corporate responsibility of express valet and that the fines imposed by the doah are excessive and unconstitutional.
in august,respondent,the city,issued a series of administrative notice s charging esposito and express valet with multiple violations of the code.the city filed administrative cases against esposito and express valet arising from these violations.in eight of those cases,each of which involved a location in the city of chicago where petitioners operated a valet parking service,express valet and esposito were charged with violating sections and of the code.chicago municipal code,amended december,and october,respectively.specifically,petitioners were charged with operating a valet parking service without liability insurance coverage and,therefore,without a valid valet parking operator license,from february,to june.section a of the code provides 
n o person shall conduct a valet parking service unless he has a valid valet parking operator license issued in accordance with this chapter.a separate license is required for each loading area served.chicago municipal code a amended december.
section b of the code provides 
no valet parking operator license,or renewal thereof,shall be issued unless the applicant provides proof to the commissioner that he has obtained liability insurance covering all locations at which he operates or seeks to operate.upon termination or lapse of the licensee insurance coverage,any license issued to him shall automatically expire.emphasis added.chicago municipal code b amended october.
in each of those eight cases,petitioners were also charged with violating section of the code by providing false insurance certificates to the department in order to obtain a valet parking license and thereby obstructing the commissioner of consumer services commissioner in the performance of his duties.section of the code provides no person shall obstruct the commissioner of consumer services in the performance of his duties.chicago municipal code.
in the ninth case,corresponding to another location where petitioners operated a valet parking service,express valet and esposito were again charged with violating sections,and of the code.additionally,petitioners were charged with two violations of section a of the code,which provides in relevant part that n o person shall engage in any act of consumer fraud,unfair method of competition or deceptive practice while conducting any trade or business in the city.chicago municipal code a amended november.specifically,the administrative notices alleged that petitioners took possession of adam mednis vehicle and gave him a receipt which falsely indicated that express valet had the liability insurance coverage required by the code.the notices further alleged that express valet took possession of mednis vehicle while holding itself out to be a valet parking service conducting business in accordance with municipal ordinances and returned the vehicle to an unauthorized third party.in the same case,petitioners were charged with violating section a of the code by misrepresenting to customers that express valet was a properly licensed and insured valet parking service from july,to june.section a of the code states 
it shall be unlawful for any person to act,use or employ any deception,fraud,false pretense,false promise or misrepresentation,or to conceal,suppress or omit any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment,suppression or omission,in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise.chicago municipal code a amended december.
petitioners were also charged with violating section d of the code by failing to stamp a receipt with the date and time the vehicle was returned to the patron,and by failing to return the receipt to the patron.section d of the code provides in relevant part 
when a valet parking attendant returns custody of the vehicle to the owner,the attendant must time stamp the receipt with the time and date the valet parking operator surrendered custody of the vehicle,and return it to the patron.chicago municipal code d amended october.
petitioners were further charged with violating section of the code by failing to attend an informal hearing scheduled for august,and provide the documentation requested by the department of consumer services the department.finally,petitioners were charged with violating section a by giving receipts to customers from february,to june,that falsely indicated that express valet had the required liability insurance.
in the tenth case,express valet was charged with violations of sections a and b of the code.in addition,express valet was charged with violating section d of the code by issuing receipts that failed to disclose the company correct business address.section d of the code provides in relevant part that 
all valet parking attendants must,upon taking custody of a patron vehicle,issue a numbered receipt to each customer containing the name,address and telephone number of the company providing the valet service.chicago municipal code d amended october.
in the final case,express valet was charged with violating section b of the code by illegally parking eric fiche honda civic on may.section b of the code states 
no valet parking service operator shall park or suffer its agents to park patrons vehicles upon the public way except under lawful conditions.t he fine for any parking or compliance violations incurred by a vehicle while in the custody of a valet parking operator shall be the sole responsibility of the valet parking operator.chicago municipal code b amended october.
express valet was also charged with violating section a of the code by failing to inform fiche that his car was illegally parked and had received a ticket while in custody of express valet.pursuant to section e of the code,which authorizes the commissioner to order restitution be paid to persons aggrieved by violations of a,express valet was ordered to pay to fiche for the parking ticket.see chicago municipal code e amended november.
the doah heard all of these cases at a consolidated administrative hearing on november.at that hearing,the city presented the testimony of six witnesses.
eric fiche testified that on may,express valet parked his honda civic at a restaurant and that approximately two months later he received a notice from the city that he had received a ticket for a parking violation that had occurred on may.in july,fiche contacted esposito,who acknowledged that he knew of the ticket and promised fiche that he would reimburse him for the fine.according to fiche,he was never reimbursed for the ticket.
bettina johnson testified that she is employed by the city department of consumer services and is responsible for the licensing of valet parking companies.the license period for a valet parking license is generally from july of the current year to june of the following year.johnson testified that in order to obtain a valet parking license,an applicant must fill out an application,pay a fee,and provide a number of supporting documents,including a certificate of insurance with effective and expiration dates.johnson testified that if a valet parking company insurance is cancelled,the insurance company notifies the department,which then advises both the company and the department investigators.
johnson testified that esposito was the person she dealt with from express valet regarding valet parking service licenses and that no other person represented express valet in its dealings with the department.in june or july of,esposito visited the department licensing facility to renew express valet valet parking service licenses and submitted proof of insurance for various locations where he operated a valet parking service.johnson identified the insurance certificates that esposito submitted to show that express valet was insured at different locations from june,to june.each document,titled certificate of liability insurance,was purportedly prepared by byrne,byrne,and signed by geoff olsen.
on,johnson testified that sometime after july,she received notice that express valet insurance had been cancelled.when johnson subsequently contacted esposito by telephone to inform him of this,esposito responded that he had no knowledge of any such cancellation.
geoffrey olsen,an insurance agent for byrne,byrne,testified that he sold insurance to esposito beginning in or.olsen reviewed each of the certificates of insurance that johnson identified as having been submitted by esposito and testified that none of them had been prepared by himself or anyone else from his company.among the irregularities in the certificates that led him to this conclusion,olsen noted that his name was misspelled that portions of the certificates were filled in while others appeared to have been generated by a computer that there were discrepancies between the dates on which the certificates had allegedly been prepared and the dates on which they had allegedly been filed by his office and that two of the certificates listed locations that olsen did not remember being scheduled.olsen further testified that the effective dates of the last insurance policy he sold to esposito were november,to november,and that he sold this policy to esposito over the telephone in early november.after that policy was issued,olsen made numerous phone calls to esposito in an attempt to obtain the premium for the policy.olsen spoke to esposito in december,and told esposito that he needed to send the down payment and the finance agreement immediately if the policy was to continue.olsen never received either the finance agreement or the payment from esposito.on february,olsen sent esposito a letter informing him that the insurance policy for express valet was cancelled as of february,for of premium.
albert lagunas,an investigator for the department,testified that on july,he was assigned to check the valet stand at an establishment known as the leg room.there was a sign in front of that building advertising that parking was provided by express valet.lagunas issued citations to express valet for operating without a valet license,for issuing tickets to customers that had an incorrect business address for express valet,and for not having insurance.
adam mednis testified that on june,he went to the leg room and left his car with express valet.in exchange for his car,mednis was given a ticket stating that express valet had liability insurance as required by the code.upon exiting the club,mednis was told by the valet parking attendant that his car had been given to someone else by mistake.
tina mednis tina,adam mednis mother,testified that she contacted esposito after her son car was stolen.she obtained esposito telephone number from the valet ticket given to her son in front of the leg room.tina testified that esposito refused to provide her with express valet insurance information and that she eventually obtained this information from the manager of the company that operates the leg room.tina also spoke with olsen,who told her that express valet insurance policy had been cancelled.tina further testified that her son vehicle was recovered by the police approximately three weeks after it was stolen.the vehicle was smashed,and everything was stolen out of it.shortly thereafter,tina filed a complaint with the department against express valet.she received a notice from the department to attend an informal hearing regarding the incident on july.a notice was also sent to express valet,north lincoln avenue,chicago,illinois,noting the date,time and place of the hearing and stating that failure to attend the hearing would constitute a separate violation.tina testified that no one from express valet attended the hearing.
esposito and express valet presented the testimony of adriane williams,a manager at express valet.williams testified that he was working at the leg room on the night of june,and that two people paid for the valet parking and drove off in mednis vehicle.williams further testified that he did not comply with the code requirement that a customer receipt must be and that he was not aware of this requirement until after the mednis incident.
following arguments,the doah found esposito and express valet liable on all charges in each of the cases.specifically,the doah found that esposito knew or should have known that his business was uninsured that the certificates of insurance were altered to deceive the commissioner and to obtain a license,which was deceptive to the public that esposito falsely represented to the public that express valet was insured that esposito misrepresentations obstructed the commissioner duty to issue valet parking licenses that express valet was at fault for the parking ticket issued to fiche that express valet failed to mednis valet parking ticket that esposito failed to appear at the hearing regarding the mednis incident that the mednis family was entitled to reimbursement for the damage to their vehicle and that esposito failed to have insurance,and,thus,a valid valet parking license,from february,to june.the doah entered separate orders finding petitioners liable in each of the cases and imposing in fines,costs,and restitution against esposito and express valet.
petitioners filed a petition for administrative review in the circuit court of cook county on december.the city answered and moved for a specification of errors.petitioners specification of errors asserted that the administrative record was so incomplete that it could not be reviewed,that the doah erred by failing to specify whether liability for the ordinance violations rested with express valet or esposito,and that the fines imposed were excessive and unconstitutional.the city agreed that some of the fines imposed were not consistent with the code and that the matter should therefore be remanded for the sole purpose of imposing fines.on october,the circuit court entered an order stating that the record was adequate for the court review.on december,the court entered an order affirming doah findings as to liability,but remanding the matter for the purpose of a new hearing on fines.the court instructed the hearing officer to address who the fines were imposed against.
on remand,the parties submitted briefs on the issue of fines.the city requested that,for each ordinance violation,the doah impose the maximum fine permitted under the code.the city also argued that esposito should be personally liable for the fines imposed because he personally and actively participated in deceptive and fraudulent acts.petitioners responded that the maximum fines being sought by the city were excessive and unconstitutional,and that the doah had no authority to grant the city request to pierce the corporate veil and hold esposito personally liable for the fines imposed.the doah held a hearing on the matter on march,at which no testimony or evidence was presented.at the conclusion of that hearing,the doah found that nine of the citations were issued to esposito personally and to the corporation,express valet,and that,based on esposito personal participation in the fraud perpetuated against the department,the fines in those nine cases were the joint and several responsibility of esposito and express valet.
in of the cases,the doah imposed in fines and costs.in each of those cases,the doah fined petitioners,or per offense,for violating section of the code by operating without a license for days february,to june.the doah also fined petitioners in each of the eight cases for violating section of the code by submitting fraudulent insurance certificates and therefore interfering with the department,and suspended express valet license to do business at each location for violating section b of the code by operating without insurance.
in the ninth case,the doah ordered esposito and express valet to pay in restitution to tina mednis and assessed in fines and costs.specifically,the doah fined petitioners for operating without a license at the leg room,for interfering with the department,for violating section of the code by failing to attend the hearing before the department concerning the mednis complaint,for each of three violations of section a of the code,which were based on petitioners having engaged in acts of consumer fraud or deceptive practice,for violating section of the code by misrepresenting to customers that express valet had a licensed valet parking service,and for violating section d of the code by issuing a receipt that was not stamped with the date and time the vehicle was returned to the patron.the doah also suspended express valet business license.
in the tenth case,the doah assessed in fines and costs.the doah fined express valet for operating without a valid license and for issuing receipts that failed to disclose the company correct business address and suspended its business license.in the eleventh case,the doah assessed in fines and costs.express valet was fined for parking fiche vehicle in an unlawful manner and for failing to inform fiche that his vehicle was illegally parked and had received a ticket and was ordered to pay in restitution.
petitioners filed a petition for administrative review on may.the city answered and moved for a specification of errors.petitioners specification of errors asserted that the administrative record was so inadequate that it could not be reviewed,that the doah erred by piercing the corporate veil and holding esposito and express valet jointly and severally liable for the fines imposed,and that the fines imposed were excessive and unconstitutional.following a hearing,the circuit court affirmed the fines imposed by the doah.this appeal followed.
prior to addressing the merits of petitioners appeal,we consider the appropriate standard of review.in reviewing a final administrative decision under the administrative review law ilcs et west,this court role is to review the administrative decision rather than the circuit court decision.du page county airport authority department of revenue,d.the appropriate standard of review concerning administrative decisions is contingent upon whether the question being reviewed is one of fact,one of law,or a mixed question of fact and law.city of belvidere illinois state labor relations board.in the event that the question is one of fact,our supreme court has stated 
o n administrative review,it is not a court function to reweigh the evidence or make an independent determination of the facts.rather,the court function is to ascertain whether the findings and decision of the agency are against the manifest weight of the evidence.citations.an administrative agency decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence only if the opposite conclusion is clearly evident.abrahamson illinois department of professional regulation.
if the question is one of law,however,this court standard of review is de novo.branson department of revenue.under the de novo standard,little or no deference is afforded the ruling.branson,at.
for mixed questions of fact and law,or where a case involves an examination of the legal effect of a given set of facts,the court must apply a clearly erroneous standard of review.city of belvidere,at.
clearly erroneous is said to rest somewhere between the manifest weight of the evidence and de novo,requiring us to afford some deference to the agency experience and expertise.citations.under this standard,we must accept the administrative agency findings unless we are firmly convinced the agency has made a mistake.randolph street gallery zehnder,d.
petitioners first contend that the record filed by the city as its answer to the original petition for administrative review failed to comply with section b of the administrative review law ilcs b west and was so inadequate that it prevented a meaningful review of the evidence presented at the administrative hearing.petitioners specifically complain that the transcript of the administrative hearing contains numerous inaudible portions,and request that we remand this matter to the department of administrative hearings to determine if a complete record can be obtained.
section b of the administrative review law provides that the administrative agency shall file an answer to the complaint which shall consist of the entire record of proceedings under review,including such evidence as may have been heard by it and the findings and decisions made by it.ilcs b west.in this case,petitioners were charged in cases with violating multiple sections of the code.the doah held an administrative hearing on those violations and found petitioners liable on all counts.petitioners thereafter filed a complaint for administrative review in the circuit court of cook county.the city filed an answer which it asserted consisted of a complete copy of the record of proceedings under review,and moved for a specification of errors.petitioners specification of errors argued,among other things,that the administrative record was so incomplete that it could not be reviewed,and that the circuit court could not perform its role with a transcript such as this.on october,the circuit court entered an order stating that the record was adequate for the court review.the court subsequently entered another order affirming the doah findings as to liability but remanding the matter for a new hearing on fines.on remand,the doah imposed fines against petitioners following briefing by both parties and a hearing at which no evidence was presented.those fines were upheld by the circuit court on administrative review.
we find that the record submitted by the city in response to petitioners initial complaint for administrative review fully complied with section b of the administrative review law.our review shows that the record filed in the circuit court contained all of the exhibits submitted into evidence at the administrative hearing,as well as the transcript of proceedings before the doah.we find petitioners argument that the record is inadequate because the transcript of proceedings contains inaudible portions to be without merit because petitioners have not shown how they were prejudiced.see booker department of employment security,d,finding that plaintiff was not denied due process based on inaudible portions in the transcript of the administrative hearing where plaintiff failed to demonstrate how he was prejudiced.petitioners offer only the general assertion that the gaps in the transcript relate to crucial testimony,but point to no specific argument regarding the doah liability findings that they are precluded from raising based upon the inaudible portions of the transcript.in light of petitioners failure to show prejudice,we decline to remand this matter to the doah to determine if a complete record can be obtained.
petitioners also claim that the circuit court erred in affirming the decision of the doah because the inadequate record prevented the court from perform ing its role of reviewing the evidence presented at the administrative hearing.petitioners rely on shallow police board of the city of chicago,d,and neylon illinois racing board,d,to support their argument.however,both of these cases are distinguishable.
in shallow,the transcript of proceedings filed by the board contained neither the recommendation of the hearing officer nor the findings or final decision of the board.shallow,d at.based upon that incomplete record,this court stated that it could not be judicially determined whether or not the board made findings and conclusions on questions of fact,and thus remanded the case to the circuit court to determine if a complete record could be obtained.shallow,d at.in neylon,this court found that the record filed by the civil service commission was insufficient to permit judicial review because it did not contain the exhibits that were submitted at the administrative hearing.neylon,d at.
here,in contrast,the record filed by the city contains all of the evidence presented at the administrative hearing,as well as the findings and final decision of the doah.in light of the record submitted by the city,and petitioners failure to point to any specific issue the circuit court was unable to review because of the allegedly inadequate transcript,we find that the court did not err by affirming the decision of the doah.
petitioners next contend that the doah erred by holding that the fines imposed were the individual responsibility of esposito rather than the corporate responsibility of express valet.specifically,petitioners assert that the doah lacked the authority to hold esposito personally liable for fines incurred during the operation of express valet,that esposito,in his status as a corporate officer,can not be held personally liable for express valet obligations,and that there was insufficient evidence presented at the administrative hearing to pierce the corporate veil and hold esposito personally liable for the fines imposed.
we initially note that,in making this argument,petitioners do not contest any of the doah underlying findings of liability.therefore,the only question before us is a legal one whether the code authorizes individual liability.this issue raises a question of statutory interpretation and,as such,our standard of review is de novo.see richard tire zehnder,d.
municipal ordinances are interpreted using the general rules of statutory interpretation and construction.puss n boots,mayor license comm n,d.the primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.in re marriage of rogers.the plain language of the statute is the best indicator of the legislature intent,and when that language is clear,its meaning will be given effect without resort to other tools of interpretation.metzger darosa.
in this case,the doah held that both esposito and express valet were jointly and severally liable for the fines imposed in of the cases consolidated before the doah.in each of those cases,esposito and express valet were fined for violating section of the code.section provides that n o person shall conduct a valet parking service unless he has a valid valet parking operator license.emphasis added.chicago municipal code a amended december.in the ninth case,petitioners were found to have violated section d of the code,which pertains to operating procedures.the penalties for violating these sections are contained in section of the code,which provides that a ny person convicted of a violation of any provisions of sections or shall be fined not less than and not more than for each offense.emphasis added.chicago municipal code amended december.person,as used in title of the code,is defined as any individual,partnership,corporation or entity which conducts,engages in,maintains,operates,carries on or manages a business or occupation within the city of chicago.emphasis added.chicago municipal code amended december.
in the ninth case,petitioners were also found to have violated section a of the code.section of the code provides that a ny person violating section shall be fined not less than nor more than for each offense.emphasis added.chicago municipal code amended december.person,as used in section,means any natural person or his legal representative,partnership,corporation domestic and foreign,company,trust,business entity or association,and any agent,employee,salesman,partner,officer,or stockholder.emphasis added.chicago municipal code b amended december.
in each of the nine cases where joint and several liability was imposed,petitioners were fined for violating section of the code.section provides that n o person shall obstruct the commissioner of consumer services in the performance of his duties.emphasis added.chicago municipal code.in the ninth case,petitioners were also fined for violating section,which prohibits any person from engaging in any act of consumer fraud or deceptive practice while conducting a business in the city.see chicago municipal code amended november.the penalties for violating these sections are found in section of the code,which provides 
any person who makes a deliberately false or deliberately misleading information to the commissioner or deliberately interferes with an investigation conducted by the commissioner shall be subject to a fine of not less than nor more than.any person who otherwise violates section shall be subject to a fine of not less than nor more than.emphasis added.chicago municipal code amended april.
although the code does not define person as it is used in section,the code consistently defines person in other sections to include,among other things,an individual or a corporation.see,chicago municipal code a amended march,chicago municipal code amended december,chicago municipal code amended july.based upon the consistency in these definitions,we conclude that person,as used in section of the code,includes an individual.
as the foregoing makes clear,the code imposes liability on any person who violates its provisions,and person is broadly defined to include individuals as well as entities such as corporations.accordingly,we find that the code authorizes the imposition of individual liability on corporate officers such as esposito who violate the provisions at issue in this case.see puss n boots,d at,quoting benhart rockford park district,d,when a statute defines its own terms,those terms must be construed according to the definitions given to them.
our interpretation of the code,and the doah imposition of personal liability on esposito,is supported by principles of agency law.although corporate officers are generally not liable for the corporation torts national acceptance of america pintura,d,a corporate officer is individually liable for fraudulent acts of his own or those of the corporation in which he participates allabastro cummins,d,see also citizens savings loan ass fischer,d,the rule is that whoever participates in a fraudulent act is guilty of fraud.a corporate officer is liable for the fraud of the corporation if he with knowledge,or recklessly without it,participates or assists in the fraud.people ex rel.hartigan e e hauling,quoting murphy walters,d.
petitioners argue that the doah improperly pierced the corporate veil by imposing personal liability upon esposito.however,piercing the corporate veil is necessary only when seeking to hold an officer liable for the corporation obligations.see,washington courte condominium ass washington golf,d.in this case,however,the city charged esposito individually with violating the code.each of the citations issued to petitioners clearly named both frank esposito and express valet as respondents.the record shows that esposito was the owner and sole officer of express valet and,as such,express valet necessarily spoke only through him.bettina johnson of the department testified that esposito was the only person that she dealt with from express valet,and that esposito submitted the insurance certificates indicating that express valet had the required insurance.geoffrey olsen,the agent who sold the insurance policy to esposito,testified that those certificates were fraudulent and were not prepared by himself or anyone from his company.olsen also testified that esposito never made the down payment on the last insurance policy that olsen sold to him,and that he informed esposito by letter that the policy was cancelled as of february,for of premium.esposito thereafter continued to operate express valet at various locations in the city and advertise that his company had the insurance coverage required by the code.additionally,esposito was the person that patrons contacted to discuss problems with express valet.tina mednis testified that esposito refused to give her express valet insurance information so that she could file a claim for the damage to her family car.eric fiche testified that he contacted esposito regarding the parking ticket that he received while his car was in the custody of express valet,and that esposito did not send him reimbursement for the ticket despite his promise to do so.
moreover,petitioners do not dispute the doah findings that esposito failed to have insurance for express valet from february,through june,that esposito knew or should have known that express valet was uninsured,that the certificates of insurance were altered to obtain a valet parking license,that esposito falsely represented to the public that express valet was insured from february,through june,that esposito conduct was deceptive to the public and interfered with the department duties to issue valet parking licenses,and that esposito failed to appear at the hearing regarding the mednis complaint.
this record shows that esposito personally instigated and actively participated in the fraudulent acts perpetuated upon the city and the general public.based upon this record,we conclude that the doah did not err in holding that the fines imposed were the individual responsibility of esposito as well as that of express valet.see allabastro,d at,people ex rel.ryan agpro,d,finding corporate officer liable for violations of the environmental protection act based upon his own conduct and active participation in those violations.
in reaching this conclusion,we reject petitioners argument that jmh properties,industrial comm n,d,is controlling and compels us to hold that the doah lacked authority to impose personal liability on esposito.in jmh properties,the claimant was electrocuted at work and thereafter filed claims with the industrial commission commission against jmh properties jmh and its principal stockholder.jmh properties,d at.an arbitrator denied the claim against the stockholder and found jmh solely liable for claimants injuries.jmh properties,d at.the claimant then filed a complaint in the circuit court,alleging that jmh had failed to pay the arbitrator award.jmh properties,d at.the complaint sought a judgment against jmh for the arbitrator award,and sought to pierce jmh corporate veil and enter judgment against the stockholder and his wife.jmh properties,d at.the trial court entered judgment against jmh and dismissed the count of the complaint seeking judgment against the stockholder,and the claimant thereafter filed a new complaint with the commission,asking it to pierce jmh corporate veil and enter judgment against the stockholder and his wife.jmh properties,d at.an arbitrator found the stockholder and his wife personally liable for the judgment against jmh,and that decision was affirmed by the commission and the trial court.jmh properties,d at.
on appeal,this court initially observed that the commission,as an administrative agency,had no common law powers and possessed only those granted to it by the legislature.jmh properties,d at.we noted that piercing the corporate veil was an equitable remedy,and that the workers compensation act the act did not give the commission the power to grant equitable relief or provide for individual liability against a corporation officers,directors,or shareholders.jmh properties,d at.accordingly,this court held that the commission acted outside of its statutory authority when it pierced jmh corporate veil and reversed the commission order imposing personal liability on jmh shareholder.jmh properties,d at.
in this case,unlike in jmh properties,the doah did not pierce express valet corporate veil in order to hold esposito personally liable for express valet obligations.rather,the doah held esposito personally liable based upon his own conduct and participation in the fraud perpetuated upon the department and the public.moreover,unlike the act at issue in jmh properties,we have already concluded that the code authorizes individual liability,and petitioners do not contest the doah findings that esposito own conduct violated multiple sections of the code.accordingly,jmh properties does not control our decision in this case.
petitioners final contention is that the fines imposed by the doah violate the excessive fines clause of the eight amendment to the united states constitution,amend.viii,as well as the substantive due process requirements of the united states and illinois constitutions,amend.xiv.const,art.i.petitioners do not assert that any of the penalty provisions of the code,including the mandatory fines,are unconstitutional on their face,but only maintain that the aggregate amount of fines imposed,is excessive when applied to the facts of this case and measured against that the alleged wrongdoing.petitioners request that we remand this matter to the circuit court to enter a judgment for the amount justified by the record.see ilcs a west.
when considering the validity of municipal ordinances,our analysis is guided by the same standards applicable to statutes.city of chicago morales.municipal ordinances are presumed to be constitutional,and the party challenging the validity of an ordinance has the burden of showing that it violates the constitution.city of chicago,d.courts are obligated to uphold the constitutionality of an ordinance whenever reasonably possible.city of chicago alton.we review the constitutionality of an ordinance de novo.white.
initially,we find that petitioners have waived their challenge to the constitutionality of the fines imposed by failing to comply with supreme court rule h h.supreme court rule h requires appellants brief to include a rgument,which shall contain the contentions of the appellant and the reasons therefor,with citation of the authorities and the pages of the record relied on.salgado marquez,d,quoting h.a reviewing court is entitled to have the issues on appeal clearly defined with pertinent authority cited and a cohesive legal argument presented.the appellate court is not a depository in which the appellant may dump the burden of argument and research.in re marriage of auriemma,d,quoting thrall car manufacturing lindquist,d.an issue not clearly defined and sufficiently presented fails to satisfy the requirements of supreme court rule h and is,therefore,waived.vincent doebert,d.
in this case,petitioners have offered virtually no analysis as to why the fines imposed are excessive and unconstitutional.the record shows that petitioners committed violations of the code,yet petitioners have failed to address the propriety of any of the individual fines imposed on those violations or the conduct that each represents.most significantly,petitioners have failed to address that they committed over violations of the code by operating without a valid valet parking license,that each day express valet operated in such a manner constituted a separate offense punishable by its own fine,and that the fines imposed for each violation are mandatory and provided by statute.instead,petitioners have simply aggregated the fines imposed for those violations and claimed that this amount is excessive.moreover,petitioners have cited no illinois case law applying the excessive fines clause to statutory fines such as those in this case,and they do not even argue that the clause should be applied to the type of fines involved here.the cases petitioners do cite as authority for such an application involve civil forfeiture provisions that are different from the penalty provisions in this case.see austin united states,d united states bajakajian,d.in light of petitioners failure to adequately present a challenge to the fines imposed,we conclude that this issue is waived.vincent,d at.
waiver aside,we find petitioners contentions to be without merit.petitioners first assert that the penalties imposed violate the excessive fines clause of the united states constitution.petitioners maintain that the total amount of fines imposed is excessive and represents an amount vastly greater that what would be sufficient to simply compensate the city or the oth
