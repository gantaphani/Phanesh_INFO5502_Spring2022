duane carlson carlson brought this action in state court against his former employer arrowhead concrete works,arrowhead for retaliatory discharge and failure to recall,in violation of the minnesota occupational safety and health act and the state whistleblower statute.arrowhead removed the case to the federal district court,alleging complete preemption under of the labor management relations act lmra,and then moved to dismiss.the district court denied the motion to dismiss and remanded the case after concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over carlson claims because they were not completely preempted.arrowhead appeals,but we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
arrowhead hired carlson as a pump truck operator in december.the terms of his employment were governed by a collective bargaining agreement cba between the local teamsters union and arrowhead.the cba and the accompanying memorandum of understanding provide that no driver shall be required to drive a truck that does not comply with all state and local safety regulations.there are also detailed provisions governing seniority,layoffs,and recall rights and a grievance arbitration provision for disputes about the cba.
in early arrowhead sent carlson to a safety training course conducted by the pump truck manufacturer,swing america swing.after his training carlson became concerned about the safety of two of the trucks,and he reported his concerns to arrowhead owners,jim and gerry carlson no relation to duane.carlson told jim and gerry that driving these trucks would violate various laws,including the occupational safety and health act osha.although he asked them to have the trucks inspected,they did not.carlson also contacted swing and concrete pump repair cpr to report safety issues with the trucks,and they suggested he bring the trucks in for repairs.
during the summer of carlson continued to raise safety concerns with jim and gerry,who suggested that the trucks could be serviced in the winter when they were not in use.carlson also took one truck into cpr to fix a crack on the bottom,and cpr told him that many more repairs were needed.gerry instructed carlson to return the truck without making the repairs.in august carlson noticed more serious structural problems with the truck and told jim and gerry that if the truck were not repaired,it could seriously injure or kill someone.jim responded you should keep your mouth shut and do what you are told.
after talking with the union and gaining its support,carlson informed arrowhead on august,that he was resigning from his pump truck driving position in two weeks and would exercise his seniority rights under the cba to work in another position.he added,however,that he would continue to drive the trucks if they were repaired.on september,carlson left his pump truck position and began working on a mixer truck.that same day jim told carlson to start the pump truck for a job,and carlson refused.jim responded l isten you little cocksucker,get in that truck right fucking now and get it ready.i am sick of your whining.he also told carlson that some fuckers are going down the road and getting laid off.you going to be the first one you son of a bitch.carlson reported this incident to the union,but it declined to file a grievance.later that fall carlson was given permission to get one of the trucks inspected.the mechanic at cpr found the truck extremely unsafe,but when gerry was told the cost of the repairs he ordered carlson to return the truck without having it fixed.carlson refused.in november he was laid off,along with six other workers.in june some of the workers were called back to work,but despite carlson length of service he was not among those recalled.
carlson brought this action in state court in november,alleging violations of the minnesota whistleblower act,and the state occupational safety and health act mosha,based on the circumstances surrounding his discharge and arrowhead failure to rehire him in accordance with the seniority provisions of the cba.arrowhead removed the case to the federal district court on december,contending that carlson claims were completely preempted by of the lmra.after the case had been removed arrowhead moved to dismiss,alleging that carlson claims were completely preempted because they required interpretation of the cba.it also alleged in the alternative that his claims grew out of conduct arguably protected by the national labor relations act nlra and were thus preempted under the garmon doctrine carlson responded that his case had been improperly removed to federal court which lacked jurisdiction over it.
the district court determined that carlson state law claims were not completely preempted by lmra because neither required interpretation of the cba and that subject matter jurisdiction was therefore lacking it denied arrowhead motion to dismiss and remanded the case to state court pursuant to c.arrowhead appeals.
in every federal case the court must be satisfied that it has jurisdiction before it turns to the merits of other legal arguments.krein norris,cir carney bic,cir.arrowhead asserts that this court has jurisdiction over its appeal under which grants appellate jurisdiction over appeals from a final order.alternatively,it argues that the district court order is appealable under the collateral order exception to the finality rule.carlson responds that under d this court lacks jurisdiction over an appeal from a remand order and that arrowhead appeal is not from a final order or reviewable under the collateral order exception.appellant arrowhead bears the burden to prove that appellate jurisdiction exists.reinholdson minnesota,cir.
congress addressed appellate jurisdiction over remand orders in d,which provides that except in civil rights cases,a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.emphasis added.the supreme court has instructed that d must be read in pari materia with c.things remembered,petrarca,d.section c provides that motions to remand based on a procedural defect must be made within thirty days of removal and requires that a case be remanded to state court i f at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.the district court explicitly based its remand order in this case on c.
under the statutory scheme remand orders based on a procedural defect or lack of subject matter jurisdiction are unreviewable.things remembered,at.thermtron products,hermansdorfer,d.so long as the district court remand order is based on one of these two grounds,a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of the remand order under d.things remembered,at.see also horton conklin,cir this jurisdictional bar applies even if the district court remand decision was in error.thermtron,at.this section prohibits review of all remand orders whether erroneous or not see also vincent dakota,minnesota eastern,cir transit cas.certain underwriters at lloyd of london,cir.where the district court has remanded under c,the scope of our review is limited to verifying that the actual basis for remand was lack of subject matter jurisdiction.lindsey dillard,cir kennedy lubar,cir transit cas,at mangold analytic,cir.
the doctrine of complete preemption converts an ordinary state law complaint into one stating a federal claim providing a basis for removal of the state court action to federal court.caterpillar williams,d.section of the lmra preempts state law claims where the resolution of the state claim substantially depends on the interpretation of terms or provisions of a collective bargaining agreement,hanks general motors,cir internal quotations omitted,or where it is inextricably intertwined with consideration of the cba.lueck,d.on the other hand,m ere reference to a collective bargaining agreement is not sufficient to result in preemption,thomas union pac,cir,and when the meaning of contract terms is not the subject of dispute,the bare fact that a agreement will be consulted in the course of litigation plainly does not require the claim to be extinguished.livadas bradshaw,d.co
