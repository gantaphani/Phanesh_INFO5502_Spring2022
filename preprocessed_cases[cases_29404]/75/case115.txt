plaintiffs thomas lyons lyons and celeste lyons collectively lyons,who were awarded a judgment in august in a negligence action the negligence action judgment against bus company tfd or,one of whose buses had struck a vehicle operated by lyons,appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,warren eginton,district judge,dismissing their complaint seeking a judgment declaring that defendant lancer insurance company lancer,an insurer of tfd,is obligated to pay each plaintiff or more in satisfaction of the essentially unpaid negligence action judgment,and ordering lancer to pay those amounts.the district court granted lancer motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that the relevant insurance coverage was limited to interstate trips and that the tfd bus trip that resulted in lyons injury was a trip wholly within new york state.on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against,rather than for,them,arguing principally that the bus that struck the lyons vehicle was supposed to have been traveling on an interstate mission.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the relevant facts do not appear to be in dispute.the following description of the events is taken largely from the statement each side submitted pursuant to local rule rule statement in connection with lancer motion for summary judgment,and from the undisputed evidence underlying the district court summary judgment opinion,lyons lancer insurance,cv,wl,district court opinion see id.at because the parties agree about most facts underlying this dispute,the court will accept all cited evidence,except for any logical or legal conclusions contained in the various statements.
tfd and the february,accident 
in,tfd,which ceased business operations in,was a private interstate common carrier based in mount vernon,new york,authorized to provide commercial transportation of passengers in any of the contiguous states of the united states.some percent of its revenues came from operating school buses pursuant to contracts with nearby school districts in new york state,principally for public schools in mount vernon,new rochelle,and yonkers.tfd owned odd vehicles,including yellow school buses,other buses,cars,and minivans.the yellow school buses were also used for other purposes,such as private charters that represented approximately five percent of tfd business.
during,michael thomas thomas or michael thomas was employed by tfd as a bus driver.in the school year,thomas was regularly scheduled by tfd to transport students to and from emerson junior high school emerson or emerson in yonkers,picking them up every morning from three or four specified locations in yonkers,and returning them to those locations each afternoon after picking them up from emerson.
on the afternoon of february,thomas drove a tfd yellow school bus with seating capacity for adult passengers,which tfd called bus,to emerson junior high school and picked up students to transport them to the usual locations.at approximately,before reaching the first location,bus collided with the vehicle operated by lyons,which was stopped at a red light.as a result of the accident,lyons sustained injuries that prompted plaintiffs to commence personal injury litigation against thomas and tfd.following,inter alia,a default by tfd in and a jury trial in on issues of damages,plaintiffs eventually obtained,to the extent pertinent here,the august negligence action judgment against tfd,which awarded them a total of,plus interest from.that judgment remains essentially unsatisfied.
b.the present action 
federal law required that a motor carrier for hire engaging in the interstate transportation of passengers,transportation between a place in a state and a place in another state or between two places in the same state but passing through another state,provide evidence of financial responsibility.see bus regulatory reform act of,stat,bus act or act codified as amended at,note,renumbered in code.the act provided that the secretary of transportation or secretary would establish regulations setting minimum permissible levels of financial responsibility and that,not later than three years after the effective date of the bus act,the minimum with respect to a vehicle having a seating capacity of or more passengers would be.see bus act b c.
such financial responsibility could be established by evidence of insurance,see id.d,reflected in an insurance policy endorsement on form mcs,d.that form stated that the insurer agreed to pay,within the limits of the policy to which the endorsement was attached,any final judgment recovered against the insured for public liability resulting from negligence in the operation,maintenance or use of motor vehicles subject to the financial responsibility requirements of section of the bus regulatory reform act of,regardless of whether or not such negligence occurs on any route or in any territory authorized to be served by the insured or elsewhere.illustration i emphasis added.in,tfd buses,including bus,were insured by lancer.the lancer tfd insurance policy policy included the required form mcs endorsement as quoted above.
in,with the negligence action judgment essentially unsatisfied by tfd,plaintiffs commenced the present action against lancer seeking a judgment under federal statutory law,including the bus act and regulations promulgated thereunder,declaring lancer obligated to satisfy the negligence action judgment entered in their favor against tfd federal complaint,and ordering lancer to pay each plaintiff or more.plaintiffs alleged principally that at the time of the accident,tfd bus was being used for hire as an interstate transporter id,during interstate commerce id,and that lancer was thus obligated by the federally mandated form mcs endorsement to pay the negligence action judgment.
following a period of discovery,both sides moved for summary judgment.plaintiffs,in support of their contention that the accident occurred while bus was being used on an interstate trip,submitted affidavits from thomas and from former tfd vice president albert groccia,and excerpts from depositions of thomas and groccia taken in.
groccia testified that on the morning of february,tfd had provided charter service to a group of senior citizens in mount vernon,taking them to armonk,new york.see deposition of albert groccia,january,groccia dep,at.tfd was supposed,that afternoon,to send a bus to armonk,arriving there at,to bring that group back to mount vernon.see id.at.although both mount vernon and armonk are within new york state,the most efficient route between the two included several miles on interstate highway i see id.at,and part of that stretch of i was in the state of connecticut see id.at.groccia testified that that was the route he would have recommended see id.at,and thomas stated in his affidavit that on the occasions when he had driven buses between mount vernon and armonk before and after the date of the accident he had always followed tfd recommended route,which passed through the state of connecticut affidavit of michael thomas dated june,thomas aff.
although groccia testified that he had n o idea how thomas came to be the operator of bus on the afternoon of the accident groccia dep.see id.i do know how he became the operator,groccia proceeded to testify that on the afternoon of february,michael thomas was supposed to have driven bus to armonk to pick up the senior citizens at and bring them back to mount vernon,rather than to pick up students from emerson junior high school in yonkers see,id.at.groccia stated that if thomas had gone to armonk to pick up the senior citizens,he would not have been in yonkers.see,id.at.he also testified that although bus was used for all kind s of work id.at,it lacked a yonkers permit that would have authorized it to operate within that city see id.at.
thomas was employed by tfd for some years beginning in.he testified that he sometimes drove charter buses for tfd and that his regular duty in was to transport the emerson students to and from school.the designated emerson route was entirely within the city of yonkers.thomas job was to take that route every day.deposition of michael thomas,january,thomas dep,at see also groccia dep.michael thomas was assigned to the emerson run.thomas knew automatically to go to emerson junior high school at sic the afternoon and pick up a bus load of kids.thomas dep.
thomas testified that when there was to be a charter trip,a tfd dispatcher would normally give a driver a dispatch ticket id.at instructing him where we have to go,who to pick up,so forth id.at see,id.at.thomas did not think he was given a dispatch ticket for a charter trip on february.see id.at.he testified,i just heard something i was to get a ticket,i did get it.that all i heard.id.at.accordingly,on the afternoon of february,thomas began his usual routine of picking up the students from emerson in yonkers.he drove bus,which was the bus he had driven to take the students to school that morning id.at.
in support of their motion for summary judgment against lancer,plaintiffs argued that thomas trip to pick up the students from emerson in yonkers was part of his trip to pick up the senior citizens from armonk.in support of that argument,plaintiffs submitted an affidavit from groccia dated june,stating that although bus was not scheduled to travel through the city of yonkers,due to a misunderstanding,michael thomas also transported a group of students through that city,while operating that bus on its interstate route to armonk.affidavit of albert groccia dated june,emphases added.however,in their own proffer of undisputed facts,plaintiffs also quoted the following deposition testimony of groccia who testified that an identical statement appearing in a prior affidavit was not accurate 
the last sentence of that paragraph states d ue to a misunderstanding,michael thomas also transported a group of students through that city,meaning yonkers,while operating that bus on its interstate route to armonk.is that statement accurate 
no.he was dispatched to go to armonk.he was dispatched,that the way it should have read.he was dispatched to go to yonkers armonk.
understood.
a.he went to yonkers instead of the dispatch to go to armonk 
e xactly what is it that you know michael thomas did on the day that this accident occurred 
a.he did follow dispatch.he went to yonkers.
groccia dep,emphases added.
groccia also testified that he had no reason to believe that thomas had driven on any part of i that day 
okay.at any time during that experience,was there any information that you ever received that would indicate to you that at any time that day michael thomas was on any portion of interstate did you learn any information ever that on that day while in a tfd bus,michael thomas was driving on interstate 
groccia dep.see also thomas aff.i found out later that i had been instructed by.to simply make the return trip of adults from armonk,new york to vernon,new york.i should have simply left vernon and traveled directly on the above described route to armonk,new york.groccia dep.if thomas went to armonk,he would have been in yonkers.
lancer for summary judgment in its favor.in its rule statement of facts as to which it contended there was no genuine issue to be tried,it asserted,inter alia,a that michael thomas did not drive bus to armonk at any time on february,lancer rule statement b that i nstead,michael thomas drove that bus along the route he usually drove for tfd,specifically,the emerson junior high school route id.c that t he emerson route had specific stops along a designated course entirely within the city of yonkers id.and d that a nother driver and another bus undertook to transport the senior citizens back from armonk to vernon id.plaintiffs expressly admitted all four of these assertions,although they argued as to paragraphs,and that the reason that thomas did not drive to armonk and the reason that another tfd bus was dispatched on that mission was that thomas trip was interrupted by his bus collision with the lyons vehicle.they also argued that the reason thomas went to emerson was that he erred in not carrying out tfd intent that he drive to armonk on a foreseeable trip through the state of connecticut.
c.the district court decision 
the district court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted the summary judgment motion of lancer.the court noted plaintiffs contention that thomas transportation of the student s was erroneous and part of a larger interstate trip,and lancer contrary contention that the emerson trip and the armonk mount vernon trip were two separate and distinct trips.district court opinion,wl,at.the court discussed the above testimony that tfd had dispatched thomas to armonk and observed that in fact 
thomas did not go to armonk that day.instead,he drove a bus route for emerson junior high school in yonkers,which was his usual route.plaintiff contends that this was done in error and tfd persistent intent was for bus to make the armonk mount vernon trip.groccia averred that this was due to a misunderstanding and that thomas was supposed to be operating the bus on the interstate route from armonk.groccia further testified that thomas did not follow dispatch in going to yonkers.
at his deposition,groccia commented that his affidavit was incorrect.groccia testified that thomas went to yonkers instead of the dispatch to go to armonk.
id.at emphases added.
the court pointed out that g enerally,the mcs b endorsement applies when transportation is interstate in nature and stated that if a motor carrier trip crosses a state line it is an interstate trip,whereas if the trip is entirely within a single state,it is not an interstate trip.id.at.the court concluded that the trip in question was an intrastate,not an interstate,trip 
in this case,the school children are the relevant goods being shipped.they were transported entirely within new york.any subsequent trip to transport the senior citizens was a second,unrelated trip.therefore,as a matter of law,the yonkers run was not an interstate run no matter tfd later intention for thomas and bus.the goods in the yonkers run were to remain entirely within yonkers.this single fact leads to the conclusion that the emerson run was not interstate.summary judgment is appropriate in favor of defendant.
id.emphasis added.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that summary judgment in favor of lancer,rather than plaintiffs,was error,arguing principally that when the accident occurred,tfd bus was on an interstate trip see,lyons brief on appeal at,because the fixed and persisting intent of the shipper that existed at the time of the dispatch was that bus was to perform an interstate trip involving the transportation of senior citizens id.at see,id.at,characterizing as the shipper.plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in assum ing and claiming that there were or could have been two trips on the afternoon of february,instead of one interstate trip encompassing both yonkers and armonk id.at they argue that t here was no factual basis upon which a jury could determine that two trips were involved or that bus was not engaged in interstate transportation id.we disagree.
summary judgment principles 
summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.in determining whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,the court must draw all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.see,anderson liberty lobby,d liberty lobby united states diebold,d law debenture trust of new york maverick tube,cir law debenture.in order to defeat a motion for summary judgment,the opposing party must adduce evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for th at party,liberty lobby,at.t he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the opposing party position will be insufficient,id.if the opposing party proffered evidence is merely colorable or is not significantly probative summary judgment may be granted.id.at.when both sides have moved for summary judgment,each
