plaintiff vincent curtis conyers,proceeding pro se,appeals from a july,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york sandra feuerstein,judge,dismissing his complaint against the administrator of the transportation security administration tsa,arising out of defendant refusal to hire plaintiff as an airport security screener.we agree that the district court lacked jurisdiction to review plaintiff administrative procedure act claim,and we hold that defendant is entitled to judgment on the pleadings with respect to plaintiff veterans employment opportunities act and constitutional claims.we therefore affirm.
background 
we briefly review the relevant statutory framework before discussing the factual background and legal merits of conyers appeal.
a.the aviation and transportation security act 
following the terrorist hijacking and crashes of passenger aircraft on september,which converted civil aircraft into guided bombs for strikes against the united states,congress identified a need for a fundamental change in the way the united states approaches the task of ensuring the safety and security of the civil air transportation system,at,reprinted in.accordingly,on november,it enacted the aviation and transportation security act atsa,stat.codified principally in scattered sections of.the atsa broadly expand ed the government control over,and active role in,aviation security through the creation of the tsa.kent krause,putting the transportation security administration in historical context,air com.
the tsa is headed by an administrator whom congress has made responsible for security in all modes of transportation,including,most notably,civil aviation security.d.the administrator is required,inter alia,to provide for the screening of all passengers and property that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft operated by an air carrier or foreign air carrier in air transportation or intrastate air transportation.id.a to ensure that this mandate was carried out promptly,the atsa required the administrator,n ot later than year after the passage of the act,to deploy at all airports in the united states where screening is required a sufficient number of federal screeners,federal security managers,federal security personnel,and federal law enforcement officers to conduct the screening of all passengers and property as required by statute.id.note.the instant action concerns an application for a security screener position filed by plaintiff conyers during this critical period.
the atsa contains two sets of provisions that address the means by which tsa applicants and employees are to be assessed,hired,evaluated,and terminated.first,section of the act provides,in relevant part,that 
t he personnel management system established by the administrator of the federal aviation administration under section shall apply to employees of the transportation security administration,or,subject to the requirements of such section,the tsa administrator may make such modifications to the personnel management system with respect to such employees as he considers appropriate,such as adopting aspects of other personnel systems of the department of transportation.
id.n.section of title,in turn,provides that t he provisions of title that portion of the united states code dealing with government organization and employees shall not apply to the faa personnel management system,with certain explicitly listed exceptions,including provisions concerning whistleblower protection,veterans preference in hiring,relations,and appeals to the merit systems protection board.id.g.
second,the atsa contains several provisions applicable only to security screeners.for example,the act mandates that security screeners possess a high school diploma or other equivalent experience basic aptitudes and physical abilities,including color perception,visual and aural acuity,physical coordination,and motor skills and the ability to read,speak,and write english well enough to perform various tasks.id.f.the act also requires the administrator to provide a preference for the hiring of an individual as a security screener if the individual is a member or former member of the armed forces.id.f.finally,and most broadly,section d of the atsa provides 
screener personnel notwithstanding any other provision of law,the administrator may employ,appoint,discipline,terminate,and fix the compensation,terms,and conditions of employment of federal service for such a number of individuals as the administrator determines to be necessary to carry out the screening functions required by the act.the administrator shall establish levels of compensation and other benefits for individuals so employed.
id.note internal quotation marks omitted.
the legislative history indicates that section d evolved out of an earlier senate provision intended to provide the administrator with authority to hire i any necessary number of screeners,without regard to any limitation on the number imposed by any law or executive order,ii but with the employee protections of part iii of title applicable to all screeners hired.american fed of gov t employees tsa local hawley,d,discussing original senate proposal.an amendment introduced by senator mccain on october,however,replaced the original proposal with language substantially identical to the current language of section d.id the stated purpose of this amendment was t o authorize the employment,suspension,and termination of airport passenger security screeners without regard to the provisions of title,united states code,otherwise applicable to such employees.cong.rec.daily ed.
following adoption of this revised language in the final version of the atsa,several members of congress expressed their understanding that section d left many matters concerning the employment of security screeners to the discretion of the tsa,including health care,worker compensation,and civil rights and whistleblower protection.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of rockefeller see also cong.rec.daily ed,statement of schakowsky it is my understanding that the secretary is given the authority to determine whether screeners can join a union participate in the federal employees health benefit plan and retirement options and be covered by,health and safety,and whistleblower laws.
conyers application for employment with the tsa and prior litigation 
on this appeal,we assume the truth of the facts alleged by the plaintiff in his complaint.see sharkey quarantillo,cir.
in,along with more than two million other persons,conyers applied for various airport security screener positions with the newly created tsa.see springs stone,d,describing that,between march and november,the tsa human resources provider processed applications and assessed some eligible candidates for screening positions.on july,conyers underwent an employment assessment and was determined to be for the position of supervisory transportation security screener at long island macarthur airport in ronkonkoma,new york.complaint.the letter informing conyers of this assessment,which is attached as an exhibit to the complaint,states that the tsa is not able to provide any detailed information regarding your results on the tests or interview.this is a assessment system therefore you will receive no further information by calling the agency,its employees,or its contractors.id.ex.
thereafter,conyers made numerous attempts to obtain specific information about or an administrative review of his assessment,but was unsuccessful until,when his congressional representative was informed that conyers did not pass the physical qualifications examination.id.ex.conyers further alleges that the tsa determined that his negative assessment rating was applicable for all employment positions for which he had applied.id.
on october,conyers filed an appeal with the merit systems protection board mspb challenging the tsa decision not to select him for the supervisory transportation security screener position the mspb action.an administrative judge dismissed conyers appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and the mspb denied his petition for review.conyers first appealed to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit,which affirmed,and he then unsuccessfully sought review by the supreme court.see conyers merit.prot,cert.denied,d,reh g denied,d.the federal circuit held that section d of the atsa renders inapplicable general federal statutes that otherwise would apply to the process of selecting tsa screeners,including the provisions of title of the united states code that would permit an appeal to the mspb in conyers case.id.at construing note.
c.the instant case 
two weeks after the supreme court denied conyers petition for rehearing in the mspb action,he filed the instant case against the tsa administrator in the eastern district of new york conyers principally seeks a judgment under the administrative procedure act apa,et,declaring that the administrator misconstrued the atsa insofar as he did not utilize the faa personnel management system in hiring security screeners,as conyers contends is required by atsa section,n and,more specifically,failed to give veterans a hiring preference in the manner required by the faa system,see g b.conyers also seeks an order,pursuant to the veterans employment opportunities act veoa of,et,directing the administrator to comply with the veterans preference provisions incorporated in the faa personnel management system and granting him relief pursuant to.finally,conyers seeks a declaration that the process used to evaluate his application violated his due process and equal protection rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments.conyers does not otherwise seek monetary or injunctive relief.
the administrator filed an answer on august,and,on january,moved to dismiss conyers complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or,in the alternative,for judgment on the pleadings.see.b,c.on july,the district court granted dismissal,holding that it lacked jurisdiction over conyers apa claims because the hiring of security screeners was committed to the tsa discretion under section d of the atsa,it lacked jurisdiction over conyers veoa claims because the veterans preference provisions he sought to enforce were rendered inapplicable by section d,and conyers constitutional claims were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.see conyers hawley,civ,wl july.conyers filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
apa claims 
on appeal from a judgment entered pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of jurisdiction,we review conclusions of law de novo.sharkey quarantillo,at internal quotation marks omitted.the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing that jurisdiction exists.id.quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.w here,as here,the case is at the pleading stage and no evidentiary hearings have been held,however,i n reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss under rule b we must accept as true all material facts alleged in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.id.at quoting merritt shuttle,cir.nevertheless,even on a motion to dismiss,courts are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.id.quoting papasan allain,d.

at the outset,we note that this particular restriction on the availability of apa review applies only in those rare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.sharkey quarantillo,at quoting citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d see also schneider feinberg,cir stating that exception applies where the governing statute or regulations are drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion quoting heckler chaney,d.webster doe,d,provides an example of such an instance.there,the supreme court held that a cia employee could not seek apa review of his termination because section c of the national security act permitted termination of an agency employee whenever the director shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the united states.id.at.emphasis in webster.the court observed that t his standard fairly exudes deference to the director,and appears to us to foreclose the application of any meaningful judicial standard of review.id.the court also noted that the overall structure of the national security act confirmed this result,insofar as the act was p assed shortly after the close of the second world war,and gave the director of the cia the responsibility for protecting intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure,id.at.quoting d and section c is an integral part of that statute,because the agency efficacy,and the nation security,depend in large measure on the reliability and trustworthiness of the agency employees,id.at.
with this analysis in mind,we now has every court that has addressed similar the question of whether to utilize the faa personnel management system in employing or appointing security screeners is a matter committed to the administrator discretion under atsa section d,note.see american fed of gov t employees tsa local hawley,d at holding that,in light of section d,court had no jurisdiction under apa to address claim that g should have governed procedure for terminating tsa screeners springs stone,d at same see also castro sec y of homeland,cir holding that,in light of section d,tsa was exempt from requirements of rehabilitation act conyers merit.prot,at fed.cir.holding that,under section d,mspb does not have jurisdiction to review claim of unsuccessful applicant for screener position ray dep t of homeland,no,wl,at,granting motion to dismiss federal claims regarding suspension and discharge of tsa screener daniels chertoff,no.cv,wl,at,holding that,in light of section d,tsa was exempt from requirements of rehabilitation act pino hawley,d,same yeager chertoff,no,wl,at,same tucker ridge,d,same orelski pearson,d,holding that state law claims of terminated screener were preempted by section d calvin united states,finding that section d of the atsa governs the employment of screener personnel in holding that screeners are appointees rather than contract employees united states dep t of homeland sec.am.fed of gov t employees,wl,at dismissing petition of labor union seeking to represent screeners in light of administrator unfettered discretion under section d to preclude tsa screeners from being represented by an organization for the purposes of engaging in collective bargaining american fed of gov t employees local stone,cir holding that district court had jurisdiction to hear terminated screener constitutional claims,but noting that the language congress used when it enacted atsa is quite similar to the statutory language at issue in webster getzlow chertoff,eeoc doc,wl,at june,holding that,while eeoc retained jurisdiction to hear rehabilitation act claim of unsuccessful screener applicant,under section d,the requirements of the rehabilitation act can not negate or override the qualification standards colton huntleigh usa,holding that former screeners claims against tsa subcontractor for unpaid bonuses accrued prior to full federalization of screener workforce not preempted by atsa.
focusing on the language of section d,we note first,as do many of the cases,that the phrase n otwithstanding any other provision of law is one that clearly signals the drafter intention that the provisions of the notwithstanding section override conflicting provisions of any other section,cisneros alpine ridge group,d see conyers merit.prot,at quoting cisneros springs stone,d at same,including sections of the statute in which the notwithstanding clause appears,see generally liberty maritime united states,t he language notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or any other act means the same thing as notwithstanding any other provision of law.emphasis omitted as the supreme court has observed,a clearer statement is difficult to imagine.cisneros alpine ridge group,at.internal quotation marks omitted,alteration in cisneros.
second,section d speaks broadly of the administrator authority to employ,appoint,discipline,terminate,and fix the compensation,terms,and conditions of employment of federal service for security screeners.note.this nearly comprehensive list of decisions,along with section d final sentence regarding the administrator establishment of levels of compensation and other benefits,brings within the reach of the section precisely the kinds of decisions on which conyers focuses here,including whether to make use of the faa personnel management system in hiring security screeners.indeed,it is these kinds of decisions that a personnel management system is designed to regulate.id.g providing that the faa personnel management system shall,at a minimum,provide for greater flexibility in the hiring,training,compensation,and location of personnel emphasis added.in short,we agree with the administrator,and the courts cited above,that the plain text of section d clearly signals congress intention to grant the administrator authority to design a personnel management system for airport security screeners,to include or not include at the administrator discretion provisions of other federal personnel laws,including those in the faa personnel management system in g.american fed of gov t employees tsa local hawley,d at see also american fed of gov t employees local stone,at describing section d as a catchall provision giving the tsa administrator significant discretion over the employment of security screeners.
conyers central textual argument is that these broad clauses are qualified by the immediate following such a number of individuals clause,which he contends indicates that section d is concerned only with the size and availability of the screener workforce.appellant br.at.he asks that we read section d as simply describing the authority of the administrator to employ such a number of individuals,to appoint such a number of individuals,to discipline such a number of individuals,and so on,but not as independently granting the administrator discretion regarding whom to employ,appoint,or discipline.id.at.we reject this reading and have the courts cited the language of section d plainly gives the administrator discretion both to employ,appoint,discipline,terminate,and fix the compensation,terms,and conditions of employment of federal service for screeners,and to do so for such a number of individuals as the administrator determines to be necessary to carry out the screening functions required by the act.note.
perhaps most fatal to conyers argument,his reading of the statute would render superfluous the provision of the atsa requiring the administrator to provide a preference for the hiring of an individual as a security screener if the individual is a member or former member of the armed forces.id.f.if,as conyers contends,atsa section,n,already requires the administrator to use the faa personnel management system in hiring screeners,including the veterans preference provisions incorporated in that system,see id.g b,then f is simply redundant established principles of construction preclude such a reading of this statute.see,trw andrews,d it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.internal quotation marks omitted 
we further note that the interpretation we adopt today comports with the legislative history discussed above.see supra section although it appears that the initial version of what would become section d was primarily concerned with the administrator authority to maintain a sufficient number of screeners,see american fed of gov t employees tsa local hawley,d at,senator mccain amendment significantly broadened the reach of the provision t o authorize the employment,suspension,and termination of airport passenger security screeners without regard to the provisions of title,united states code,otherwise applicable to such employees,cong.rec.daily ed.thus,when the law passed in substantially the form proposed by senator mccain,it was understood that matters that otherwise would have been governed by n,g,and the provisions of title incorporated as whether screeners can join a union participate in the federal employees health benefit plan and retirement options and be covered by,health and safety,and whistleblower laws were left to the administrator discretion.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of schakowsky.viewed in this context,it becomes clear that adopting conyers reading of section d that it is concerned with nothing more than the size and availability of the screener require us to rewrite this history and return the atsa to its form,which preserved the title rights conyers seeks to enforce here.this we can not do.
finally,the similarity between webster and the instant case confirms this result.the atsa,like the national security act addressed in webster,was passed shortly after a cataclysmic event that congress believed required it to take action to change the way in which the nation protected itself.compare webster doe,at.noting that the nsa was p assed shortly after the close of the second world war,with,at finding that the events of september,required a fundamental change in the way the united states approaches the task of ensuring the safety and security of the civil air transportation system,reprinted in.in both instances,congress created a new agency to confront these cia in webster,the tsa gave its administrator a high level of responsibility.compare webster doe,at.noting that director of the cia has the responsibility for protecting intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure quoting d,with d making the administrator of tsa responsible for security in all modes of transportation.in addition,recognizing that the new agency efficacy,and the nation security,depend in large measure on the reliability and trustworthiness of the agency employees,webster doe,at,congress also gave its administrator broad authority to control the agency workforce.compare c notwithstanding the provisions of section of title,or the provisions of any other law,the director of central intelligence may,in his discretion,terminate the employment of any officer or employee of the central intelligence agency whenever the he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the united states,with note notwithstanding any other provision of law,the administrator may employ,appoint,discipline,terminate,and fix the compensation,terms,and conditions of employment of federal service for such a number of individuals as the administrator determines to be necessary to carry out the screening functions required by the atsa.as in webster,each of these aspects of the structure of the statutory scheme,its objectives,its legislative history,and the nature of the administrative action involved,counsels against a finding that apa review of conyers apa claim is permitted.natural res.def.council johnson,at quoting block cmty.nutrition,at.
we need not decide whether apa review is unavailable with respect to all of the administrator decisions regarding screener employment.we conclude here only that the specific agency action complained of by conyers,namely,the administrator decision not to utilize the faa personnel management system in deciding whom to employ or appoint as a security screener,is committed to agency discretion by atsa section d and,thus,is not reviewable under the apa.a.
veoa claims 
conyers also sues to secure an order directing the administrator to comply with the veterans preference provisions incorporated in the faa personnel management system,g b,as well as the regulations promulgated pursuant to those provisions.the asserted jurisdictional basis for this claim is the veoa.as the federal circuit has noted,the purpose of the veoa is to provide preference eligible veterans with a method for seeking redress where their veterans preference rights have been violated in hiring decisions made by the federal government.kirkendall dep t of army.where a veteran establishes a violation,the agency is ordered to comply with the veterans preference statutes and award compensation for any lost wages or benefits suffered by reason of the violation.id.citing a.
to this end,provides,inter alia,that a preference eligible person who alleges that an agency has violated such individual rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans preference may file a complaint with the secretary of labor.subsection d,in turn,provides that i f the secretary of labor is unable to resolve a complaint under subsection a within days after the date on which it is filed,the complainant may elect to appeal the alleged violation to the merit systems protection board.after taking such an appeal,provision here relied upon by a preference eligible person,i n lieu of continuing the administrative redress procedure provided under section d to elect,in accordance with this section,to terminate those administrative proceedings and file an action with the appropriate united states district court not later than days after the date of the election.such an election may not be made,however,either before the day after the date on which the appeal is filed with the merit systems protection board under section d or after the merit systems protection board has issued a judicially reviewable decision on the merits of the appeal.b.in addition,such an election must be made,in writing,in such form and manner as the merit systems protection board shall by regulation prescribe.c 
we note at the outset that conyers does not appear to have satisfied the prerequisites for bringing a claim under.even if we were to agree with conyers and the district court that the dismissal of the mspb action for lack of jurisdiction was not a judicially reviewable decision on the merits of the appeal under b,conyers does not allege that he filed a document with the mspb elect ing,in accordance with the requirements of and the relevant mspb regulations,to pursue relief in federal court i n lieu of continuing the administrative redress procedure provided under section d.
in any event,we agree with the district court that conyers purported veoa claims fail for much the same reason his apa claims fail the veterans preference provisions he contends were violated are simply not binding on the administrator in light of section d of the atsa.see also american fed of gov t employees tsa local hawley,d at dismissing similar claim springs stone,d at same.the district court therefore did not err in dismissing conyers request for relief under the veoa 
constitutional claims 
finally,conyers seeks a declaration that the administrator willfully violated his rights by failing to abide by applicable veteran preference requirements and procedures,in violation of the due process clause of the fifth amendment,and ensure fair and equitable consideration for employment under uniform personnel practices,policies,and procedures,in violation of the equal protection guarantees of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.complaint at.
the district court held that these claims are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.on appeal,the administrator does not rely on sovereign immunity to support dismissal,recognizing that,in dotson griesa,cir,we ruled that claims for prospective equitable relief,such as the declaratory judgment sought by conyers here,are not so barred.id.at citing,inter alia,edelman jordan,d alden maine,d noting that sovereign immunity does not bar certain actions against state officers for injunctive or declaratory relief appellee br.at.
in dotson,however,we went on to hold that,with respect to federal employees covered by the civil service reform act csra,congress has clearly expressed its intent to preclude federal civil service personnel from attempting to supplement statutory remedies with separate suits at equity raising constitutional challenges to adverse employment actions.at.we decline the administrator request to decide here that atsa section d,which would appear to exempt screeners from csra coverage,similarly divests the federal courts of jurisdiction over conyers constitutional claims.see american fed of gov t employees local stone,at,holding that tsa screener constitutional claim sounding in equity was not barred by the csra and section d see generally whitman dep t of,d noting that question,then,is not whether outlining csra grievance procedures confers jurisdiction,but whether or the csra as a whole removes the jurisdiction given to the federal courts over plaintiff constitutional claims otherwise provided by.rather,mindful that the question is one of statutory rather than constitutional jurisdiction,we assume hypothetical jurisdiction over these claims,and we proceed to address the alternative argument for dismissal offered below,namely,that judgment on the pleadings is appropriate as to conyers constitutional claims.see.c see also ajlani chertoff,cir discussing hypothetical jurisdiction.
we agree with the administrator that conyers constitutional claims fail as a matter of law.first,conyers due process claim appears to be premised upon an assertion that he possesses a property right to the preferences afforded veterans under section of the atsa and g b,of which he can not be deprived without adequate procedures.complaint we have held here,however,that the administrator is not obliged to provide veterans applying for security screener positions the preferences afforded under those provisions,as would be necessary to give rise to a colorable property interest.see supra section see generally town of castle rock gonzales,d noting that claimed benefit does not give rise to a constitutionally protected interest if government officials may grant or deny it in their discretion board of regents of state colls.roth,d to have a property interest in a benefit,a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.he must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.he must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.conyers thus fails to state a claim for deprivation of property without due process.
second,conyers equal protection claim is premised upon an allegation that the tsa did not utilize uniform personnel practices while evaluating,assessing,rating,selecting,and appointing the initial fielding of the screener workforce,including in its evaluation of conyers own application.complaint.in support,conyers has attached as an exhibit to the complaint a december,report from the office of the inspector general in the department of transportation,which found that,although the tsa had done a good job of hiring a high proportion of veterans,it had not yet adopted a formal policy regarding veterans preferences.memorandum from alexis stefani,principal assistant inspector for auditing evaluation,dep t of,to admiral james loy,under sec y of transp.for sec.at.the report explained that the tsa had instead relied on a series of,verbal instructions,and informal documents to implement the preference policy,leading to misunderstandings at some tsa job fairs.id.at 
conyers does not allege,however,that he,or anyone else,was discriminate
