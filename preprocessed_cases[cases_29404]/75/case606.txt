petitioner william king,an aircraft mechanic for northwest airlines,was randomly selected for a drug test and failed to provide a urine sample.the administrator of the federal aviation administration faa issued an emergency order revoking king mechanic certificate,which was served on king and filed with the national transportation safety board to initiate proceedings for permanent revocation.king filed an answer and appealed the revocation order to the board.after a hearing,an administrative law judge alj ordered that the revocation order be dismissed.the faa appealed,and the board reinstated the revocation.king now petitions this court for review of the board order.
the federal agency respondents to king petition administer safety regulations governing the aviation industry.the faa is the primary administrative agency involved in aviation safety.it promulgates federal aviation regulations in accordance with the administrative procedure act and enforces those regulations.the board is an independent agency which also has responsibilities for aviation safety,including investigating accidents,making safety recommendations to the secretary of transportation,and reviewing faa enforcement orders.see.it is the faa which establishes and enforces certificate regulations,and the board decides appeals from faa orders.
the statutory mandate of the faa includes assigning,maintaining,and enhancing safety and security as the highest priorities in air commerce.d.in carrying out that mandate the faa has authority to promulgate legislative rules that carry the force of law,see joseph united states civil serv.comm n,and to interpret and explain existing rules and regulations.see a d and b a.in the faa promulgated a rule initiating antidrug programs,including drug testing,for aviation personnel in safety sensitive positions.the faa certifies aircraft mechanics,and it pursues enforcement actions related to certificates when the administrator determines that air transportation safety and the public interest require action.see b.
the board decides appeals from faa certificate actions and serves a function similar to that of a reviewing court.see hinson ntsb.the board rules of practice in air safety proceedings govern these appeals.see.an alj initially hears the matter and then issues a decision affirming,amending,modifying,or reversing the faa order.see d.a party may appeal the alj decision to the board,which can make new findings and issue new orders,affirm or reverse the decision,or remand the case.see b.a party dissatisfied with the board decision may petition for review by a federal court of appeals.see f.the board is not a party in interest in federal court proceedings and does not typically participate in them.see a.
prior to may,william king had worked as a northwest airlines aircraft mechanic for fourteen years.he held faa mechanic certificate and had never been disciplined,involved in an aviation incident,or tested positive for drugs.at on may,he was notified of his random selection for a drug test that day.
there is no dispute that king arrived at the testing site on time at.he talked with a union representative who was already there and completed preliminary paperwork with the collector,manuel ortiz.ortiz is a breath alcohol technician and drug screener for consolidated medical services in bloomington,minnesota,who had at that time conducted over one thousand drug tests.ortiz verified king identity,explained the basic collection procedures,and directed king to empty his pockets to ensure that nothing was present that could adulterate a specimen.ortiz then completed the custody and control form,instructed king to wash and dry his hands prior to providing a urine specimen,opened the collection kit,and secured the testing site.the collector statement prepared by ortiz stated that king collection process was started without delay.
the parties dispute the time at which king made his first attempt to provide a specimen.that time is significant because an individual is given three hours to provide a specimen,measured from the time of an initial unsuccessful attempt.king answer to the faa complaint contained an admission that his first attempt to urinate occurred at.since his final failed attempt occurred at,his admission established that he had been given a full three hours for the test.king was allowed to amend his answer at the hearing before the alj,however,and he testified there that his first failed attempt occurred between and.this testimony conflicted with the collector statement and ortiz testimony,both of which stated that his first attempt was at 
after king returned without a specimen,ortiz told him to drink water and pointed out a water fountain.when king failed on his second attempt at about,ortiz again urged him to drink water but the parties dispute whether he mentioned ounces.ortiz testified that he urged king to drink up to ounces of water,but king testified that he did not the alj found king testimony credible.there is no dispute that king had unimpeded access to the fountain,and he testified that he used it four or five times and also consumed a ounce soda,for his estimated total consumption of to ounces.king further attempts to provide a urine specimen at and at were unsuccessful.ortiz calculated that king had had a full three hours for the test and terminated the collection process at this point.
a representative of the aircraft mechanics fraternal association amfa was present throughout the entire process paul olson was there when king arrived,and joseph wagner relieved him after king first failed attempt.neither representative raised any challenge to the collection process,and both later testified at the hearing.olson,who had been present at hundreds of drug tests,testified i did see anything wrong.wagner testified that ortiz was the most intelligent of the testers that i have seen but that he had not heard him advise king to drink ounces.wagner himself urged king to drink after his second unsuccessful attempt and later urged him to drink a lot of water because the clock was ticking.at wagner told king to drink water just to the point of being sick.
just after ortiz called timothy bishop,northwest drug and alcohol program manager and designated employer representative,to report on the test.bishop questioned ortiz about whether king had been provided access to water,whether he had been given three hours to provide a urine specimen,and whether he had been told that he could drink up to ounces of fluid.bishop testified that ortiz had answered affirmatively.bishop also testified that the drug testing site had undergone an faa inspection in march and that he had confirmed with ortiz that the regulations and northwest airlines policy statement were still posted at the collection site.then bishop spoke directly with king to confirm that he had not provided a sample.then he asked king,are you sure you do have to go king said no,and bishop told him that a medical evaluation would therefore be required to determine whether there was a medical reason for his failure to provide a specimen.he also explained that failure to provide a specimen could be deemed a refusal to test and result in king discharge.
on the following day king reported for a shy bladder physical examination which includes a medical history,a brief physical exam,and laboratory tests to assess kidney function.the examining physician and medical review officer found no medical condition that would preclude king from providing a urine specimen.failure to provide a sufficient amount of urine without an adequate medical explanation for the failure is considered a refusal to test.see a.refusal to test is grounds for revocation of a mechanic certificate.see b.
as a result of king failure to provide a sample,northwest airlines terminated his employment and the faa administrator issued an emergency order on july,revoking his mechanic certificate.on july king filed a notice of appeal,and on july the faa filed the emergency order as its complaint before the board seeking permanent revocation of king certificate.king filed an answer on july in which he admitted paragraph b of the complaint which alleged that he had made his first attempt to urinate at 
at the hearing before the alj on august,king asked to amend his answer to change his admission that his first attempt had been at to a denial.the alj permitted the amendment over the faa objection,and king then testified that his first attempt had been at or.after hearing all the evidence,the alj found that king had not been given a full three hours to provide a urine sample,that he had not been advised to drink ounces of water,and that the collector had not monitored and measured king consumption of fluids.the alj concluded that the faa regulations had not been followed and dismissed the order of revocation.
the faa appealed to the board,and it reversed the alj on legal grounds,affirming the order of revocation of king mechanic certificate.the board held that the alj had erred by allowing an amendment at the hearing without a showing of good cause and by misinterpreting the regulation requiring the collector to urge water consumption when an individual has difficulty in producing a sample.king then petitioned this court for review.
in his petition king argues that the board erred by reversing the alj decision to allow his amendment,by not considering evidence that he offered after his answer was amended,and by accepting results of an inadequate medical examination.he contends that the board interpretation of the regulation dealing with the collector duty to urge water consumption is inconsistent with the regulation plain meaning and purpose and notes that the alj found his testimony credible.
the faa responds that the board correctly held that the alj erred by allowing king amendment without a showing of good cause,in violation of the rules of practice,and by permitting king to testify contrary to his earlier admission which had established that he had been given the required three hours for the test.the faa also urges that substantial evidence supports the board finding that king had no medical condition which precluded him from providing a urine specimen.finally,the faa asserts that the board interpretation of the regulation dealing with a collector duty in respect to water consumption was not arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion and therefore is entitled to deference.
although the board generally defers to the credibility findings of an alj,administrator gusek,wl,at,its review of the faa interpretation of relevant regulations has a different standard.when adjudicating aviation safety enforcement actions,the board is bound by the faa interpretation of its regulations unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise not according to law.see faa civil penalty administrative assessment act of,stat.codified as amended at,d see also garvey ntsb,congress has unambiguously directed the ntsb to defer to the faa interpretations of its own regulations.
federal appellate courts also review the faa interpretations of its own aviation regulations with deference.see garvey,at.while courts may affirm,amend,modify,or set aside board decisions when appropriate,see b and c,its decisions should be upheld unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.see a watkins ntsb,cir per curiam.factual findings are reviewed to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.see e watkins,at.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.erickson transp.interstate commerce comm n,cir citation omitted.
faa regulations provide that after an initial unsuccessful attempt to provide a specimen,an individual has three full hours to complete the test.see b and.in his answer king agreed with the timeline stated in the complaint and did not raise any issue about the amount of time he had been given,but at the hearing before the alj he asked to amend his answer so he could argue he had not been given three full hours.although the faa objected on the basis of surprise,the alj granted the motion.this permitted king to testify that he made his first attempt some minutes later than he had previously admitted.the board ruled that the alj had erred by allowing the amendment in violation of its procedural rules which require a showing of good cause and that this had been unfair to the faa 
king argues that the board violated its precedent by reversing the alj decision on the amendment without evidence of prejudice,that the faa had not phrased its objection at the hearing in terms of no good cause shown,and that the board failed to consider all relevant evidence.the faa responds that the last minute amendment to king answer was prejudicial because the administrator had relied on his admission of key facts in preparing her case.king answer was filed on july and he did not attempt to correct or amend it until the august,hearing,even though the parties had communicated and exchanged discovery in the interim.since his admissions had established that he was given three full hours to provide a urine specimen,the faa complains that the amendment put a presumptively resolved issue back into play without notice.
the board concluded that the alj had abused his discretion by allowing king to change his answer at the hearing over the faa timely objection.the board rules of practice expressly and unequivocally limit a law judge discretion to permit an amendment to a pleading at the hearing to instances where good cause for the change has been shown.belger king,wl,at,citing e.the standard in emergency matters such as king is not whether an amendment would prejudice the other party,but whether the amendment is supported by good cause.see c the law judge may permit or require a more definite statement or other amendment to any pleading at the hearing,upon good cause shown and upon just and reasonable terms.see also administrator jones,wl,at,because any amendment that adds to a respondent evidentiary burden in an emergency case could be said to be at least potentially prejudicial,given the exceptionally short discovery time available before a hearing must be held,our regulations obligate a law judge to ensure good cause supports all such amendments.administrator fuller,wl,at,alj did not abuse its discretion by rejecting amendment without cause.
the board practice rules require that a movant make a showing of good cause in order to amend a pleading at the time of the hearing.the rules expressly and unequivocally restrict the alj from granting a motion to amend in the absence of such a showing.the record does not show that king provided any reasons for his requested amendment and despite the faa timely objection,the alj made no findings in support of his decision to permit it.king claims that he had discussions with the alj before the hearing in which he provided cause,but under its governing rules of practice the board declined to consider any ex parte conversation that was not on the record.see testimony and exhibits together with papers,requests,and rulings constitute the exclusive record of the proceedings.king now argues that his purpose was to expedite the proceedings by his amendment,but a last minute change in position which surprises the other party and leads to the introduction of unexpected and potentially decisive evidence is unlikely to expedite the process in a fair way.moreover,king gave no reason on the record for his untimely request,and the alj made no findings to support his ruling.
we conclude that the board did not abuse its discretion or act arbitrarily in determining that the alj had erred by permitting an amendment at the hearing without a showing of good cause,in vacating the amendment to king answer to paragraph b and striking his new evidence,and in reversing the finding that he had received less than three hours to provide a urine specimen 
king also challenges the board interpretation of the collector obligation under b.that regulation provides that if an employee fails to provide sufficient urine,the collector must u rge the employee to drink up to ounces of fluid,distributed reasonably through a period of up to three hours or until the ind
