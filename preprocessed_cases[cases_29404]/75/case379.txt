this is an appeal from a jury verdict in favor of defendant,tennessee department of transportation,in an action for race discrimination by plaintiff,gregory cobbins,pursuant to title vii,et.on appeal,cobbins claims error in two evidentiary rulings by the district court the exclusion of an exhibit offered by plaintiff as hearsay due to the lack of an appropriate witness to lay the proper foundation for the document,and the granting of a motion in limine in which the district court prohibited the admission of certain evidence from a prior action between the same parties.because both rulings were in error,we reverse the judgment of the district court.
plaintiff greg cobbins is an male who has been employed by defendant tennessee department of transportation as a maintenance worker in lawrence county,tennessee,since february.in march,plaintiff submitted an application to the tennessee department of human resources seeking promotion to one of several career service positions at the department of transportation.the department of human resources is responsible for reviewing applications to verify that the applicants meet the minimum qualifications for the posted job.applicants who meet the minimum requirements for a particular classification receive a civil service score based upon the applicable department of human resources examination process the examination process assigns the score based on education,training and work experience typically required or associated with the job being sought.when an agency like the department of transportation needs to fill a career service position,the agency requests a certificate of eligibles from the department of human resources.this is a list of the eligible applicants for the position in rank order by civil service score.
there are two types of certificates available to tennessee agencies employment commonly referred to as appointment and promotional.an agency may request either or both types of certificates when filling vacant positions.employment certificates include the names of all eligible applicants listed in rank order of examination score and appointments from these certificates must be made from the five highest ranking eligible applicants.promotional certificates include only applicants who are already state employees with career status listed in rank order of examination scores.appointments from these certificates must be made from the three highest ranking eligible applicants.
in may,the highway maintenance county supervisor position for lawrence county became available and a certificate was issued for the position plaintiff was not among the top five candidates and was not interviewed for the position at that time.however,in april,after two applicants had declined the position,a third certificate was issued for the position and plaintiff was on the list of eligible applicants with a score of.three other applicants were on the list,and all three had higher scores than plaintiff two of the eligible applicants advised that they were not interested in the position,leaving plaintiff and bradford staggs,a white male with a score of,as the only two applicants interviewed for the job.staggs was recommended for the promotion to the highway maintenance county supervisor position.in a letter to the director of affirmative action for the department of transportation,winston gaffron,a regional director with the department of transportation,noted staggs education,three more years of experience than plaintiff as a highway maintenance worker,which is the level directly below the supervisor position,and supervisory experience.gaffron noted that plaintiff had less education,less work experience in the highway maintenance worker position,and no supervisory experience.letter dated may,from winston gaffron to sherrae hall,director of affirmative action for tennessee department of human resources.at plaintiff also had several oral and written warnings in his work file.staggs had no record of disciplinary action.
plaintiff claims that he was deprived of the opportunity to fairly compete for the promotion to supervisor based on the bias and discrimination toward him due to race by his former supervisor,wayne yocum.the warnings in plaintiff file were all received between and when yocum,whom plaintiff had accused of racial discrimination in an earlier lawsuit,was plaintiff supervisor.plaintiff claims that yocum improperly marred his work record with unfounded complaints,refused to give him supervisory responsibilities and generally treated him more harshly than white employees.
plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission on april,which alleged that he had been subjected to continuing discrimination based upon race and had been retaliated against for having previously filed a charge and bringing a lawsuit against the department of transportation in he received a letter on june,and filed his complaint in the middle district of tennessee on september,claiming denial of promotion,disparate treatment concerning the application process and retaliation for a protected activity.the district court granted in part and denied in part defendant motion for summary judgment on september,leaving only the claim for discrimination in relation to promotion to go to trial.a trial was held in november,and the jury returned a verdict for defendant.plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal to this court.on appeal,plaintiff challenges the district court grant of a motion in limine that excluded certain evidence from plaintiff earlier discrimination action against defendant and an evidentiary ruling at trial finding the promotion application of bradford staggs inadmissible as hearsay.
exclusion of staggs promotion application as hearsay 
plaintiff attempted to enter into the record the promotion application of bradford staggs,the person who ultimately received the supervisor position.plaintiff alleges that staggs lied about his educational level on his promotion application,thereby giving staggs an unfair advantage in the promotion process over plaintiff.specifically,staggs stated on his application that he had postsecondary education after high school during the years.staggs did not graduate from high school until,so any education between and could not have been postsecondary education.plaintiff plan at trial was to impute knowledge of this alleged falsehood to the neutral decisionmakers who chose staggs over plaintiff for the position plaintiff counsel attempted to introduce the document through plaintiff.the document was a form provided by the state and completed by staggs.defendant objected to the document as hearsay.plaintiff counsel stated during a sidebar that he believed the document to be a public record and,therefore,an exception to the hearsay rule under federal rule of evidence the district court suggested that perhaps counsel could get the document in under the business records exception to the hearsay rule using a state employee as a custodian of records.however,no witness present had sufficient knowledge of the state recordkeeping system to qualify as a custodian of records under federal rule of evidence.staggs promotion application was never entered into the record.
on appeal,plaintiff claims that his was greatly harmed by his inability to enter staggs allegedly false application into the record and it was error to exclude the document.he argues that an employment application submitted to the state is required to be received and maintained by the state in accordance with certain personnel rules and it is,therefore,admissible as a public record.moreover,the parties stipulated to the authenticity of the document.amended joint proposed stipulations,cobbins.dep t of,at.
we first question whether this document constitutes hearsay at is,was it introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted about the discriminatory intent of the state in not promoting plaintiff although plaintiff did not make this argument at trial or on appeal,the allegedly false application does not seem to go to the alleged discriminatory intent by either yocum or the state.plaintiff may have been merely try
