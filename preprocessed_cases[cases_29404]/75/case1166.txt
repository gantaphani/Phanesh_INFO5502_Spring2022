plaintiffs richard and angie alcala appeal from a defense verdict rendered in favor of defendant earthbound tire center in a wrongful death action.in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude that the trial court did not commit error when it declined to instruct the jury on negligence per se.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we conclude that the verdict was supported by substantial evidence,but that the trial court committed prejudicial error by refusing to admit a highly relevant and admissible statement made by defendant.accordingly,we reverse the judgment in favor of defendant and order a new trial.
background 
a.the accident.
on november,andrew alcala,who was years old at the time,sustained fatal injuries after losing control of his vehicle a cruiser in the rain and colliding with another vehicle going the opposite direction on sierra highway in santa clarita,california.
b.the trial.
richard and angie alcala,the decedent parents,brought a wrongful death action against earthbound tire center earthbound,which had serviced the cruiser just two weeks before the accident they alleged that it negligently repaired,approved,authorized,maintained,inspected,and serviced the cruiser.
at trial,the parties presented starkly different versions of the events leading up to the accident.
the june,service.
richard alcala testified that he had known the owner of earthbound,vic minassian,for years and regularly brought his family cars to earthbound for new tires and service.richard believed minassian was knowledgeable about the services he performed and usually followed minassian recommendations on june,approximately six months before the accident,richard brought the cruiser to earthbound with the intention of buying four new wheels.along with the new wheels,minassian recommended four new tires and a alignment.richard testified that he agreed with minassian recommendations and instructed him to do it all at one time.richard left the car,returned some time later in the afternoon,and paid,believing that minassian had performed the alignment and that the new tires were under warranty.
minassian testified that when richard initially brought the cruiser into earthbound in june,richard only agreed to pay for four new wheels and tires.after richard left the car for service,minassian inspected the car and saw that the front two tires had exposed steel due to extensive wear.he disposed of these worn front tires,along with the rear tires,and installed four new tires manufactured by dunlop on the car.according to minassian,when richard came to pick up the car,minassian warned him of the following it was dangerous driving on tires with exposed steel,the front axle required an alignment,if richard did not get a alignment,the new front tires would suffer the same wear as the tires minassian had just removed,and if richard did not get an alignment that day,the new tires he had just purchased would not come with a warranty.minassian testified that despite these warnings,richard elected not to have the alignment at that time.minassian,however,did not make any notations in the work order or invoice documenting his warnings to the alcalas.
the november,service.
richard testified that on november,he and his wife brought the cruiser to earthbound again because he did like the way it was driving and he wanted minassian to check the tires.the alcalas left the car at earthbound and when they returned to pay for the service,minassian informed richard that he had rotated the tires and performed a front end alignment.according to richard,minassian did not inform him that the front tires which minassian had rotated to the rear were extremely worn,did not recommend that he buy new tires,and did not warn him it was dangerous to leave the worn tires on the car.richard testified that had minassian advised him he needed new tires,richard would have purchased them without hesitation or questions.according to richard,a s long as he told me i needed tires,that was good enough for me.angie testified that she used her credit card to pay for the service,but she never spoke to minassian on that date.
in contrast,minassian testified that he did not remember seeing richard on november.according to minassian,angie brought the cruiser to earthbound and instructed minassian to perform an alignment,rotate the tires,and change the oil.after angie left and service on the cruiser began,minassian saw that the car two front tires were severely worn and unsafe.the damage extended beyond the secondary rubber and was almost to the steel.minassian testified that he went to the fast food restaurant next door to find angie and when he could not find her,he called the phone number contained in his records for the alcalas.after no one picked up,minassian went ahead and rotated the tires by moving the front worn tires to the rear,and the rear tires to the front.he performed the rotation despite his belief that the worn tires posed a danger to the occupants of the vehicle,possibly a danger to the public,and were bad under any standards.
according to minassian,when angie returned to pay for the service,he informed her that she needed two new tires to replace the worn tires and she responded i will tell richard,and we will do it later.minassian admitted that he did not explain to angie that the tires were bald,nor did he warn her of the dangers associated with driving on tires with such extensive wear.again,minassian did not document the fact that he recommended two new tires in the work order or invoice.
the expert testimony on tire placement.
harold herzlich,the tire industry expert retained by the alcalas,testified that by,there was a consensus growing in the tire industry that newer tires,tires with less wear should be installed on the rear wheels.as early as,dunlop,the manufacturer of the tires minassian sold to the plaintiffs,issued regular bulletins instructing service providers to install newer tires on the rear wheels.not all manufacturers,however,believed that newer tires should be installed in the rear and in,the rubber manufacturers association did not have a standard recommendation on the issue.
additionally,herzlich examined the worn tires on the cruiser and identified areas on the tires that go down to less than of an inch and other areas with exposed fabric.according to herzlich,this extensive wear strongly affected the traction of the tires,especially on wet roadways.herzlich further testified that when a tire retailer encounters dangerously worn tires,such as the tires minassian found on the cruiser,the retailer should convince the customer to get rid of the tires,warn the customer about the danger associated with driving on worn tires,and if the customer rejects the advice,the retailer should refuse to touch the vehicle and document his warnings to the customer.
the expert testimony on causation.
michael varat,the accident reconstructionist retained by the alcalas,testified that their son lost control of the vehicle because the rear tires,which were worn down to the steel,lost traction with the road and caused the entire vehicle to fishtail and spin.varat also testified that when a service provider rotates damaged or worn tires from the front axle to the rear axle,like minassian had done two weeks before the accident,the provider decreases the safety of the vehicle on both wet and dry roadways.according to varat,placing worn tires on the rear axle of a vehicle increases the chances that the vehicle will lose control due to inadequate traction or suffer a tire blowout.
paul guthorn,the accident reconstructionist retained by earthbound,testified that the alcalas son lost control of the car because he was driving at an excessive speed over a wet roadway,which caused the tires to hydroplane.guthorn agreed that the tires on the cruiser had worn down to such an extent that they should have been replaced under industry standards,but maintained that the accident would have occurred,given the speed and the water conditions,even if the tires had a tread depth of of an inch.
the verdict and subsequent appeal.
the jury unanimously found that earthbound was not negligent.the alcalas moved fo
