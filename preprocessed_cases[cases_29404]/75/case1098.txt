pursuant to rule of the california rules of court,we granted the request of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit for a decision addressing the following question does the duty of an insurer to investigate the insurability of an insured,as recognized by the california supreme court in barrera state farm mut.automobile ins.cal d,barrera,apply to an automobile liability insurer that issues an excess liability insurance policy in the context of a rental car transaction 
subject to our reservation of the specific question whether the barrera duty to investigate insurability applies,as a general matter,to automobile insurers issuing excess liability insurance,we conclude that where,as here,the sale of excess liability insurance in a rental car transaction occurs after the rental car customer presents a facially valid driver license and after the license inspection and signature verification requirements of vehicle code section,subdivision b,have been met,the excess insurer has no obligation to conduct a further inquiry regarding the validity of the customer driver license.in such a situation,if the excess insurer acts promptly upon discovery that the customer facially valid driver license was in fact suspended,then the excess insurer does not forfeit any statutory or contractual right to rely on the customer presentation of the invalid license as a basis for avoiding liability to third persons under the excess policy.
factual and procedural background 
the relevant facts,as stated in the ninth circuit formal order and from our own review of the record,are as follows.
in june,an arizona resident named alric burke rented a car in california from budget budget.he presented what appeared to be a valid arizona driver license.budget rental agent made a photocopy of the license and asked burke to sign the rental agreement.
at the time of the rental transaction,philadelphia indemnity insurance company philadelphia had issued a master excess policy of supplemental liability insurance that provided million in third party liability coverage,in excess of the minimum statutory amounts of per person and per occurrence for bodily injury required under the financial responsibility law et.that policy,to which we refer herein as an excess liability policy or excess policy,identified budget as the policyholder.budget,in turn,had authority under the excess policy to enroll its rental car customers under that policy as additional insureds,if the customers so opted,without submitting a written application to philadelphia.notably,the excess policy excluded coverage for injury arising out of the use of a rental car obtained through fraud or misrepresentation 
here,budget rental agent found burke qualified to rent a car after inspecting his driver license,which appeared facially valid,and verifying his signature.the rental agent,then acting as an agent for philadelphia for the limited purpose of offering and selling excess liability insurance,offered burke the option of buying such insurance.burke accepted the offer and purchased the excess insurance.
as it turned out,arizona had suspended burke driver license and driving privilege over two months earlier.four days after renting the car,burke was involved in a car accident in california that injured a number of people,including javier cortez,blanca,monica arredondo,and camilla toni harris the claimants.the claimants filed suit in state court against budget and burke to recover damages arising out of the accident 
meanwhile,philadelphia commenced an action in federal district court,seeking a judgment declaring it had no liability for damages.a bench trial was held,and the district court determined,as part of its findings of fact and conclusions of law,that burke made at least a negligent misrepresentation to budget that he had a valid driver license and the excess liability policy excluded coverage for rentals obtained through misrepresentation.accordingly,the court declared philadelphia had no liability for damages arising out of the accident.
the claimants filed an application for relief from the district court judgment.they requested relief on the basis of barrera,supra,cal d,and united services automobile pegos th,d pegos,which together establish that an automobile liability insurer has a nondelegable duty to undertake a reasonable investigation of insurability within a reasonable period of time of the issuance of a policy in order to preserve the ability to rescind the policy based on the insured misrepresentations and thereby avoid liability on the policy to a third person whom the insured injures.the district court denied the application,and the claimants appealed.
the ninth circuit filed an order requesting that this court address whether barrera recognition of a duty on the part of an insurer to investigate insurability applies to an excess insurer in the context of a rental car transaction.
discussion 
in california,the insurance code has long provided that either party to a contract of insurance may rescind on the basis of the other misrepresentation.if a representation is false in a material point,whether affirmative or promissory,the injured party is entitled to rescind the contract from the time the representation becomes false,added by stats,ch,see also,same remedy for concealment.moreover,the injured party may rescind,even though the misstatements were the result of negligence,or,indeed,the product of innocence.barrera,supra,cal d at,fn,telford new york life ins.cal d,see also,same in concealment context.when an insurer opts to rescind a liability policy on this basis,and does so in conformity with all of the requirements imposed by law,the insurer generally may avoid liability on the policy to the insured or to any third party injured by the insured.
our decision in barrera,supra,cal d,a case that did not involve a rental car transaction,held that public policy considerations warrant an important qualification on an insurer right to rescind in the context of automobile liability insurance.as explained more fully below,barrera recognized that an automobile liability insurer has a duty to reasonably and timely investigate the insurability of its insured,and that the insurer can not take advantage of a breach of that duty in order to avoid liability on a policy to an innocent victim of the insured.
before proceeding to barrera analysis,we acknowledge the insurer contention here that it is not seeking rescission of a policy based on the insured misrepresentation.rather,philadelphia claims,it seeks to enforce a policy clause that excludes coverage for injuries arising out of the use of a car rental obtained through fraud or misrepresentation see ante,fn.while that distinction may carry weight in other contexts,it is not determinative here.were we to conclude,as a matter of substantive law,that an excess liability insurer has a duty to investigate the insurability of a rental car customer,such a duty could not be circumvented,defeated,or modified by any provision which the insurer may have elected to place in its contract in derogation of or in conflict therewith.metz universal underwriters ins.cal d,fn,quoting wildman government employees ins.cal d.
in barrera,the plaintiff had previously obtained a judgment for damages caused by a negligent driver.when she sued the driver automobile liability insurer to compel payment of that judgment,the insurer filed a seeking a declaration that the insurance policy it had issued was void ab initio.the trial court entered judgment for the insurer on both the complaint and the,finding rescission of the insurance policy justified because the insurer had issued the policy in reliance on a material misrepresentation made by the insured and the insurer acted promptly to rescind upon discovery of the insured misrepresentation.barrera,supra,cal d at.
in reversing that judgment,barrera declared we conclude that an automobile liability insurer must undertake a reasonable investigation of the insured insurability within a reasonable period of time from the acceptance of the application and the issuance of a policy.this duty directly inures to the benefit of third persons injured by the insured.such an injured party,who has obtained an unsatisfied judgment against the insured,may properly proceed against the insurer the insurer can not then successfully defend upon the ground of its own failure reasonably to investigate the application.barrera,supra,cal d at.
barrera recognition of this duty on the part of automobile liability insurers rested on a combination of three public policy considerations the nature of the insurance business generally the public policy underlying the financial responsibility law former et,added by stats,ch,et see now et,added by stats,ch,et and the fact that such a duty is consistent with the extracontractual duty of all insurers to act promptly to accept or reject applications for insurance.these considerations are discussed below.
the first consideration barrera addressed was the nature of the insurance business and the insurer role as a public service entity.barrera,supra,cal d at,italics omitted.as barrera observed,the rights and obligations of the insurer can not be determined solely on the basis of rules pertaining to private contracts negotiated by individual parties of relatively equal bargaining strength.ibid.in this regard,t he reasonable expectation of both the public and the insured is that the insurer will duly perform its basic commitment to provide insurance.ibid.with respect to an insurance policy voidable under the insurance code,if an automobile liability insurer can perpetually postpone the investigation of insurability and concurrently retain its right to rescind until the injured person secures a judgment against the insured and sues the carrier,then the insurer can accept compensation without running any risk whatsoever.id.at.furthermore,under such a rule,the carrier would be permitted to deal with the insured as though he were insured,and thus to lead him to believe that he was in fact insured.ibid.
barrera next considered the public policy underlying the financial responsibility law.the decision observed that,unlike ordinary indemnity insurance,which primarily protects the insured,the law governing automobile liability insurance was enacted to protect the public,that is,such insurance represents protection for those who suffer injury or death on the highway from financially irresponsible drivers.barrera,supra,cal d at.
mindful that the chief purpose of the financial responsibility law is to provide compensation for those injured through no fault of their own,barrera sought to avoid a rule that,in practice,would produce the dangerous condition that car owners and operators would drive with the erroneous belief they are insured,and frustrate the expectation of those using the streets and highways that insurance companies would conduct their business in such a way as to fulfill,not thwart,the law public policy purpose.barrera,supra,cal d at.the only way to meet this latter expectation,barrera reasoned,was to recognize a duty on the part of automobile liability insurers to undertake a reasonable and timely investigation of insurability and to penalize breach of that duty by loss of the right to rescission.id.at.
finally,barrera concluded that a duty of investigation for automobile liability insurers would be consistent with a line of decisions imposing an extracontractual duty on all insurers to act promptly to accept or reject applications for insurance.barrera,supra,cal d at,citing cases involving life insurers and supplemental disability insurers,among others.as in the prompt action context,barrera noted,principles of fairness and sound business practice support such a duty where automobile liability insurance policies are concerned.id.at.
in finding that these public policy considerations support a duty to reasonably and timely investigate insurability,barrera emphasized the duty inures directly to the class of potential victims of the insured.thus,when an automobile liability insurer breaches that duty,it may not defeat recovery by the injured person,who has recovered a judgment against the insured,by relying on an untimely attempt to rescind.barrera,supra,cal d at.significantly,however,the insurer,upon satisfying such a judgment,retains a right to either prosecute a cause of action against the insured for damages for the latter misrepresentations,or rely on the misrepresentations as a defense in any action by the insured.id.at,see pegos,supra,th at,fn,d.
barrera concluded by reversing the judgment and remanding the matter for further proceedings.barrera explained that,ordinarily,it is a question of fact whether or not an insurer breaches its duty to reasonably and timely investigate insurability.barrera,supra,cal d at.in that case,the reasonableness of the defendant insurer failure to investigate the insured driving record would depend on various factors,including the cost of obtaining that information from the department of motor vehicles dmv the availability of that information from the dmv or elsewhere the general administrative burden of making such an investigation and whether the defendant insurer had a practice of delaying investigation until the presentation of a significant claim on the insurance policy.id.at fn.
here,there is a disagreement over whether,as in the barrera case,the insurer should have an obligation to investigate insurability.philadelphia argues that the public policy underlying the financial responsibility law is to protect those who use the highways and streets by requiring minimum liability coverage of per person and per accident for bodily injury or death,and per accident for property damage,and that this public policy does not support application of the barrera rule to insurers that sell supplemental liability insurance in excess of those mandated statutory amounts.in support of this position,philadelphia asserts that the legislature enacted a provision allowing excess policies to contain exclusions that,if included in primary mandatory coverage policies,would be void as against public policy,subd.a.philadelphia further argues that,in the context of excess insurance sold as part of a rental car transaction,compliance with the mandate of section to inspect the driver license and verify the signature of a rental car customer should be deemed sufficient to satisfy any duty to investigate insurability regarding the validity of a customer driver license.
conversely,the claimants argue that barrera did not limit its holding to primary insurers that provide automobile liability insurance coverage in the minimum statutory amounts required by the financial responsibility law.in their view,barrera reasoning concerning the public reasonable expectation that insurers will perform their basic commitment to provide insurance is just as applicable to insurers such as philadelphia that sell excess automobile liability insurance.it is the claimants position that,under barrera,it would be unfair to allow excess insurers that did not reasonably investigate insurability to keep the money they received in payment for such coverage but to not compensate the people injured by the drivers they insure.
whether excess automobile liability policies,as a general matter,warrant different treatment than automobile liability policies providing the minimum statutory coverage presents a difficult question that has significant implications for a wide range of cases beyond the rental car context,including automobile leasing and excess coverage for private automobile ownership and use.in this case,we decline to decide whether the barrera duty to investigate insurability generally applies,or does not apply,to all excess automobile liability insurers.rather,assuming for purposes of argument that the barrera duty is generally applicable where excess insurance is concerned,we conclude philadelphia did not breach that duty as a matter of law.specifically,we hold that an insurer selling supplemental liability coverage in excess of the minimum statutory amounts,in the context of a rental transaction,does not forfeit any statutory or contractual right to rely on a rental car customer misrepresentation in tendering a facially valid but suspended driver lice
