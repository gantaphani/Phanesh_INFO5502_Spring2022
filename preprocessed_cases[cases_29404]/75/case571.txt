jessica devin was employed by schwan home services,schwan as a sales and delivery driver,otherwise known as a route manager.after her resignation,she brought an action against schwan asserting claims of gender discrimination,hostile work environment,and retaliation under title vii of the civil rights act,to and the minnesota human rights act.the district court granted schwan motion for summary judgment.we affirm.
schwan sells a variety of frozen foods,meats,and dairy products via a truck delivery route system.drivers called route managers rms make deliveries,collect payments,and solicit customers.schwan employed devin as an rm from january to january at its distribution center in savage,minnesota savage depot.devin was hired by pat dero.soon after,joey gilb became the savage depot sales manager and devin supervisor.when devin was hired there was one other female rm at the savage struffert.shortly after devin started,struffert left schwan.
rms are initially compensated with guaranteed compensation for a fixed period of time.over time,such pay is stepped down and rms are compensated by relying more and more on a commission basis,until eventually being paid entirely by commissions earned based on sales volume.per a written agreement,during her first eight weeks of training,devin was guaranteed per week after which her guaranteed pay would begin to incrementally decline.it is undisputed her guarantee was in effect until she resigned.she claims,in addition to this guarantee,both dero and gilb verbally promised her pay would never fall below per week,even after her guarantee ended.she believed her pay would be supplemented if she fell short of the weekly amount and this supplemental pay would continue until she achieved to stops on her route.the record reflects gilb supplemented her pay during three weeks in when she did not meet the goal.on three other occasions,however,she did not reach the goal and gilb did not supplement her pay.devin approached gilb about the pay issue in late november when she knew her december,paycheck would be less than.gilb responded he was not going to supplement her pay because he did not believe she deserve d it as her overall sales were low and she was not making as many new customers per day as she could.the record indicates gilb did supplement her december,paycheck,paying her rather than the she earned.he also agreed to extend her a written per week guarantee provided she met certain performance criteria including working twelve hours of sell time and obtaining six new contacts each day.she was shocked by the offer as she did not know of other rms being required to meet such criteria and believed they broke department of transportation regulations.she claims three male fistrovich,bradley wolberson,and david given weekly pay guarantees outside their training periods.
one of devin primary complaints is she was not assigned a route builder during her first eight months on a route.route builders are employees who accompany rms on their routes and obtain new schwan customers by soliciting homes of.gilb testified a route builder primary function is to add new route days to an existing route in order to tak e regular routes and mak e them into split route systems that actually supported two people instead of one.route builders are also used to add customers to existing routes.in april,when devin was not initially assigned a route builder,she complained to gilb.she claims gilb told her she was not assigned a route builder because her route was not a priority and other routes needed it more.in may or june fistrovich was assigned a route builder.devin claims when she asked gilb why fistrovich was assigned a route builder instead of her,he responded it was because fistrovich had a family to support and bills to pay.devin reported this comment to schwan human resources director la verna hovance.on december,gilb did assign devin a route builder.he testified he did so a s soon as he had somebody available to top off routes.he claimed he considered devin route to be first priority because she had asked for a route builder on several occasions.she claims rms wolberson and dudley thomas were assigned route builders before her despite the fact their routes had more customers than hers.gilb claims these rms and other rms who were assigned route builders were working routes that were shifting from regular routes to split routes,and schwan had to finish building the route dates.there is evidence in the record wolberson route was shifting to a split route when he was assigned a route builder.there is no evidence to the contrary regarding thomas route.fistrovich route ultimately became a split route.devin route was not a split route and was not shifting to a split route.while she testified part of the route builder role was to create split routes,she contends gilb initially told her a route builder role was to increase all routes to to stops.
devin alleges other incidents during her tenure at schwan to support her claims.when she first met gilb in february,he said he belie ved that she would not make a very good route manager and she should consider hostessing sampling parties.gilb later indicated,after riding with her on the route,she was a lot tougher than he thought she would be.finally,in december,after devin and gilb discussed route builders,she claims he called her emotionally charged.when devin was hired,there were no available routes.she was initially trained on wolberson route,as he had indicated he was leaving schwan.this route never became available as wolberson stayed on at schwan.another he might be leaving.she claims gilb told her,instead of guaranteeing her travis route,he was considering holding a contest for the route between her and the other rms still in training.she reported this conversation to dero,and gilb never held the contest.in,travis left,and on march,devin was assigned his route.she believed this route was less profitable than others because it had many inactive customers.she concedes,however,this was the only route available and she specifically requested the route.
on june,after devin missed a morning sales meeting,gilb told her to choose her last day at schwan and said she was not route manager material.she reported the incident to hovance.later that day,gilb met with her and withdrew his request that she leave schwan.devin reported they seemed to agree that it would be in everyone best interests if they set aside past issues and worked on cultivating a better working relationship.however,on july,gilb gave her a written performance notice because she failed to meet a new contacts requirement on july,she complained to hovance about gilb disparate treatment of her and his negative attitude toward her.following this complaint,hovance met with her individually and later with both she and gilb to discuss the complaints.at this meeting,devin and gilb agreed to start on a fresh page.
devin also claims she was treated less favorably than male rms because she was not allowed to expense her pay phone calls to customers when her cell phone was out of minutes and was not given freezer drop sales large sales where the residents of an apartment complex are offered discounted ice cream or treats.christenson testified he did not receive any freezer drop sales.wolberson testified he was given a freezer drop sale but such sales were given out as prizes for winning sales contests.both wolberson and christenson testified they expensed pay phone calls.
at one point,devin claims gilb intentionally gave her a poorly organized substitute truck when her truck was being inventoried.after an rm receives a new route her truck is supposed to be inventoried.she contends her truck was not initially inventoried because,according to gilb,the warehouse staff was too busy.when her truck was finally inventoried,she claims the substitute truck was and messy and she could not complete her route.when she called gilb about the truck,she claims he laughed and said,well you the one who wanted her truck inventoried and that what we doing.she also contends gilb told her she was making too many changes to her truck inventory and directed her to make changes on the warehouse computer.wolberson and fistrovich testified they were not directed to make inventory changes on the computer.finally,she claims gilb falsely told hovance that she had twice as many customer complaints as other rms.
in late november,devin complained to hovance about her pay and about a she received from gilb regarding a customer complaint.in the following weeks,she sent several to hovance regarding her concerns.on december,hovance and vicki schwartz,schwan regional sales director held a conference call with her to address her complaints.when asked what kind of resolution she was seeking,her response was she wanted to be out from under a poor working environment,and was willing to transfer to meet that goal.they directed her to forward them her resume so they might find her an acceptable transfer position at schwan.they also explained gilb would be attending an equal employment opportunity seminar.on december,devin emailed hovance and schwartz thanking them for their assistance.on december,she again emailed them,this time expressing her disappointment with their lack of responsiveness as she had not yet heard back from them.she indicated her work environment had continued to deteriorate and she was going to file a formal complaint with the eeoc.on december,schwartz responded she was sorry for the lack of follow up and was working towards a resolution.she indicated she wanted to meet with devin and gilb to review each party concerns and devin job description.she also told devin they had forwarded her resume to schwan consumer brand division in minneapolis.when devin responded she was concerned about gilb presence at the meeting,schwartz responded it was important for gilb to attend,but offered to meet with devin to address her concerns.
on january,devin met with schwartz and gilb.at the meeting,they discussed her job description and performance as well as the assignment of route builders.at the meeting conclusion,schwartz told devin she was confident devin could succeed because devin was articulate,talented,and presented her self well.she said devin could be the best salesperson in the depot.she also told devin she and gilb had confidence in devin abilities.after the meeting,devin was disappointed because she perceived the meeting as a performance review rather than a forum to address her discrimination complaints.although at the meeting schwartz again told devin she could schedule a further meeting if she still had concerns,she did not request another meeting.on january,she started a,vacation.she claims,while on vacation,fistrovich called to inform her gilb was rifling in her truck and was going to use inventory issues to get rid of her.devin never reported this incident to schwan,and fistrovich testified he never made the call.on january,devin resigned.on october,she filed the instant action.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of schwan and this appeal followed.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,affirming only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and schwan is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.wallace sparks health,cir.in reviewing the evidence,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of devin,the party,remaining mindful summary judgment should seldom be utilized in employment cases.stidham.mining,cir.
retaliation 
to establish a retaliation prima facie case,devin must show she engaged in protected conduct a reasonable employee would have found her employer retaliatory action materially adverse and the materially adverse action was causally linked to her protected conduct.higgins gonzales,cir.the second prong is objective,requiring us to consider whether a reasonable employee in the plaintiff position might have been dissuaded from making a discrimination claim because of the employer retaliatory actions.id.citing burlington santa fe ry.white,d white.
here,the district court assumed devin engaged in protected conduct when she complained to hovance in late june and on november.the court found,however,she had failed to allege a materially adverse employment action against her,and,even if she had established such an action,there was no causal relationship between her protected conduct and the alleged retaliatory actions.we agree.she alleges several retaliatory actions by schwan she was denied pay guarantees given to male rms gilb interfered with her inventory she was unfairly disciplined gilb told hovance she had twice as many customer complaints as other rms she was denied a route builder and her complaints were not fairly considered at the january,meeting.we will consider each action in turn and thereafter evaluate their cumulative force.
as an initial matter,devin provides scant factual support for most of the alleged retaliatory actions.she claims being denied pay guarantees given to male rms.however,the record suggests schwan paid her according to the guarantee in her written agreement with dero.to the extent she claims her pay was not supplemented in a few instances when it fell below per amount she claims gilb and dero orally promised she would alleges no causal connection between these instances and her protected activity.devin claims fistrovich,wolberson and christenson were given pay guarantees she was not given.our review of the record uncovers very limited evidence regarding such guarantees.she does not suggest these rms were similarly situated to her.there is evidence these guarantees were given as either rewards for increased sales or as initial assistance after an rm shifted to a split route.more importantly,there is no evidence of a causal connection as she does not suggest being denied a requested guarantee because she engaged in protected activity.as for devin claim that gilb interfered with her inventory,there is no support for this claim in the record.devin claims fistrovich told her he saw gilb rifling through her truck and thought gilb was going to use inventory issues to fire her.the most this evidence supports is that gilb was on devin truck,which,without evidence of harm,can not constitute an adverse action under white.see white.at the provision protects an individual not from all retaliation,but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm.to the extent she is arguing gilb assignment of a poorly organized substitute truck constitutes interfering with her inventory,any harm from this incident was trivial and can not meet the white standard.id.at we speak of material adversity because we believe it is important to separate significant from trivial harms an employee decision to report discriminatory behavior can not immunize that employee from those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience.
devin also claims gilb unfairly issued her a written notice for failing to turn in six new customer postcards and falsely reported to hovance she had twice as many customer complaints as other rms.she does not allege suffering any adverse consequences because of these actions.again,under white,retaliatory actions must be material,producing significant rather than trivial harm.because she does not suggest these actions caused any harm,let alone significant harm,we conclude they would not have deterred a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity.
devin also claims the denial of a route builder constitutes a materially adverse retaliatory action.the district court found she had not shown route builders actually increased the sales or income for rms who were assigned them.as such,she failed to show gilb denial of a route builder was materially adverse such that a reasonable employee would be dissuaded from engaging in protected activity.she argues the denial of a route builder is tantamount to an opportunity to build sales.while we agree the record supports evidence of some value to having a route builder assigned to one route,the record is limited regarding the extent of this value.as noted above,to meet the white standard,it was her burden to show the denial of a route builder produced significant harm.it would follow,to meet this burden,she was required to show route b
