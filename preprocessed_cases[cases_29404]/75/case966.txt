in this case,a company argues that the federal aviation administration arbitrarily and capriciously imposed a strict test on its product but not on other,similar products.the faa responds with a laundry list of reasons why this court supposedly can not hear this challenge.the faa then argues that even if we may hear the case,substantial evidence supports its decision.because the faa jurisdictional arguments are wholly meritless and because the agency offers nothing more to justify its decision than one employee bare assertions unsupported by any actual evidence,we grant the petition for review.
federal law authorizes the federal aviation administration to prescribe minimum safety standards for operating an airport serving any passenger aircraft designed for at least passenger seats,b,and directs the agency to promote safe flight of civil aircraft by prescribing regulations and minimum standards for practices,methods,and procedure s the agency finds necessary for safety in air commerce,id.a.invoking this authority,the faa issues advisory circulars that establish testing requirements and product specifications for a range of items airports use.private labs test products to determine whether they comply with faa standards,and the faa then publishes a list of approved items.to obtain federal funding,airports must agree to buy only products on this list.thus,airports receiving federal funding virtually every public use airport,resp t br.prohibited from buying unapproved products.
among the many products the faa regulates are lights that line airport runways and the metal bases in which those lights sit.light bases used in runways must be very strong because they experience powerful as airplanes landing on them and snow plows driving over must retain their original alignment to illuminate the runway properly.also,because runways are repaved frequently,the height of the bases must be adjustable so they can remain flush with the runway surface.
petitioner safe extensions,manufactures one type of light base used in airport runways.the faa calls the light bases safe extensions produces adjustable products.other manufacturers make a competing technology that the faa calls fixed products.with both technologies,the base is placed in a hole in the runway and secured with concrete or special grout.the two technologies differ in the mechanisms used to adjust their height.adjustable ones safe extensions an extension piece at their top the bottom of the extension piece is threaded,as is the top of the base.to adjust the height,the extension piece is twisted upwards.by contrast,fixed products are made taller by stacking linked extensions on top of the base.
the faa has long required runway light bases to pass a torque test,which checks whether the base can withstand a strong force without rotating.from to,this torque test applied to all light bases,both adjustable and fixed,and the test was conducted on light bases installed in the concrete or grout that secured them.in april,however,the faa issued advisory circular,which specified that torque testing would only be required for bases that utilize a method of height adjustment that is integral to the base or extension and are designed for field adjustment.advisory circular d specification for airport light bases,transformer housings,junction boxes,and accessories.the faa apparently intended this language to mean that only adjustable products,not fixed products,had to pass the torque test.thus,though the torque test itself remained unchanged,only adjustable products now had to pass it.
thirteen months later,the faa issued advisory circular,which made the required torque test far more stringent.advisory circular e specification for airport light bases,transformer housings,junction boxes,and accessories may.specified that torque testing of adjustable products now had to be conducted on freestanding light bases,light bases not yet embedded in concrete or grout the way they would be in the field.id.at note after.according to safe extensions,this caused an outcry among companies that install adjustable products,with several complaining to the faa that the new test simply wo work and essentially eliminates the use of adjustable products.oral arg.at.after talking to the faa,some of these companies were left with the impression that the agency would address their concerns by issuing a revised advisory circular.id.at.
just two months after issuing,the faa emailed a draft advisory circular to a few companies that make or install runway light bases,though not safe extensions.email from david evans de maria,faa airport engineering division,to david edwards et.the torque testing requirements in the draft circular,however,were identical to those in that is,the draft required freestanding torque tests for adjustable products but no torque test for fixed products.draft advisory circular f specification for airport light bases,transformer housings,junction boxes,and accessories.july.
two companies offered comments criticizing the draft of.olson industries,which installs both adjustable and fixed products,argued that adjustable products could never pass the freestanding torque test and that the circular was unfair because fixed products,if subjected to the test,could pass it either.email from ted olson,president,olson industries,to david evans de maria,faa airport engineering division.the company also complained that the revised test was unjustified because it had never seen a problem with an installed adjustable product in its twenty years of experience.id.another installer of runway lights,siemens airfield solutions,made exactly the same points.email from willis trainor,certification test engineer,siemens airfield solutions,to david evans de maria,faa airport engineering division.
at some point before the faa issued the final version of,an agency employee prepared a response to these comments.because this response is the only justification the agency has provided for its decision,we quote it in full 
products have devices inherent to the physical structure of the device itself that act in bearing against the surrounding grade.adjustable products in known currently available designs have no physical features inherent to the device itself to prevent rotation,and rely on a chemical bond acting in shear.there are known examples where this bond has failed in actual application following exposure to real world loading and environmental conditions.torque testing of specimens prepared in laboratory conditions may be able to pass torque tests simulating being mounted in surrounding grade,but experience has shown that the same care and attention is not possible to control in the field.experience has also shown that required production testing of in situ torque tests designed to give a certain level of confidence are not performed.as adjustable height extensions have no inherent physical feature that bears against the surrounding grade it must demonstrate its capability free standing so that the uncontrollable quality of its installation is not relied upon for public safety.
comment resolutions for draft advisory circular f specification for airport light bases,transformer housings,junction boxes,and accessories.this response appears on a plain sheet of paper in the agency appendix to its brief.the response says nothing about when or even if the faa shared it with anyone.at oral argument,safe extensions counsel told us that the faa emailed the response to selected companies at approximately the same time the agency published the final version of.oral arg.at.according to safe extensions,it never received the response directly from the faa and had no opportunity to address it before the final circular was published.id.at.the faa counsel disputed none of this.
the faa issued the final version of on october,making no changes from the draft circular regarding the torque testing required for adjustable products used in runways.advisory circular f specification for airport light bases,transformer housings,junction boxes,and accessories.thus,adjustable products remained subject to a freestanding torque test fixed products did not have to pass.on december,safe extensions filed a petition for review of pursuant to a,which allows any person disclosing a substantial interest in an order issued by the federal aviation administration with respect to aviation duties and powers designated to be carried out by the agency to apply for review of the order by filing a petition for review in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit.safe extensions argues that the faa acted arbitrarily and capriciously by imposing a freestanding torque test on adjustable products but not fixed products.the faa responds that this court lacks jurisdiction to review safe extensions challenge and that,in any event,it acted reasonably when it decided to treat the two products differently.we address the jurisdictional issues first and then consider whether the faa acted arbitrarily and capriciously.
the faa argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear this case for four independent reasons is not an order reviewable under safe extensions lacks prudential standing addresses issues committed by law to agency discretion and because the differential treatment safe extensions objects to originated in,not,the company petition is untimely given that the company filed it more than sixty days after the faa issued.we address each argument in turn.
not an order 
the administrative procedure act,et,defines an order as the whole or a part of a final disposition of an agency in a matter other than rulemaking.id.emphasis added.to be deemed final and thus reviewable as an order under,an agency disposition must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process,and it must determine rights or obligations or give rise to legal consequences.city of dania beach faa,quoting vill.of bensenville faa.as a general principle,the term order in section should be read expansively.id.
the faa first argues that neither imposes a legal obligation upon any person nor creates any legal rights.resp t br.this is absurd.as safe extensions points out,if a manufacturer equipment does not meet specifications,it can not be placed on the list of products airports can buy.pet r opening br.thus,effectively prohibits airports from buying light bases that fail the new torque test,and it bars manufacturers like safe extensions from selling their products to airports.these are clear legal consequences of enormous significance to safe extensions.
nothing in aerosource,slater,cir,upon which the faa relies,suggests a different result.there the faa had simply issued a warning about mistakes aerosource made in its repair work.see id.at see also id.at t his case concerns nothing more than the issuance of advisory warnings and the faa refusal to withdraw the warnings.the warning neither barred anyone from contracting with the company nor barred the company from continuing to work.see id.at.thus,while the warning created bad publicity for the company and harmed its finances,it imposed no legal obligations on it or anyone else.by contrast,has the obvious legal consequences mentioned above.
next,the faa argues that to qualify as an order,an agency decision must not only be final,but also be accompanied by a record sufficient to permit judicial review,resp t br.record the faa claims lacks.this argument ignores our cases interpreting section.in both dania beach and bensenville we held that agency actions are reviewable as orders under section so long as they are final,so long as they mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process and determine rights or obligations or give rise to legal consequences.at,at.
ignoring these recent and controlling cases,the faa points to our decision over thirty years ago in deutsche lufthansa aktiengesellschaft civil aeronautics board,where,reviewing an earlier version of section,we said it is the availability of a record for review and not the holding of a quasi judicial hearing which is now the jurisdictional touchstone.id.at.the faa has taken this statement entirely out of context.in lufthansa,we considered whether we were bound by united gas pipe line federal power commission,in which this court held that it had no jurisdiction over direct appeals from the promulgation of agency regulations where there had not been an evidentiary record established in a quasi judicial proceeding before the agency.lufthansa,at.the key question in lufthansa,then,was whether we could review an agency action despite the absence of a proceeding.we held that we could,at least when an evidentiary record existed.id.at.thus,in lufthansa we set forth a sufficient condition for review when no proceeding had occurred,not a necessary condition for reviewing agency action.and now that we have rejected the united gas rule entirely,see inv.inst.bd.of governors of fed.reserve,this sufficient condition is irrelevant because there is no longer any doubt about whether we may review agency actions when the agency held no hearing.
several factors confirm this reading of lufthansa.first,as noted above,our recent cases regarding whether agency actions qualify as orders never consider the adequacy of the record,instead asking only whether the action was final.see dania beach,at bensenville,at.second,the statement in lufthansa that the faa relies on is a dead letter though we cited it a few times after lufthansa,see,city of rochester bond,and a few other circuits have picked it up,see,sierra club skinner,cir,sima prods.mclucas,cir,we have cited it for decades,most likely because the demise of the united gas rule has rendered lufthansa reasoning irrelevant.third,the faa proposed reading of lufthansa is precluded by subsequent supreme court cases making clear that the lack of an adequate agency record to review does not eliminate a circuit court jurisdiction,but rather requires the court to remand to the agency so the agency can provide a record for review.for example,in florida power light lorion,d,the court rejected the argument that if the reviewing circuit court lacks an adequate factual basis to evaluate the agency action it should require the case to be brought in a district court with factfinding powers that could make up that deficiency,id.at,explaining 
such a result can not be squared with fundamental principles of judicial review of agency action.t he focal point for judicial review should be the administrative record already in existence,not some new record made initially in the reviewing court.camp pitts,d.the task of the reviewing court is to apply the appropriate apa standard of review to the agency decision based on the record the agency presents to the reviewing court.if the record before the agency does not support the agency action,if the agency has not considered all relevant factors,or if the reviewing court simply can not evaluate the challenged agency action on the basis of the record before it,the proper course,except in rare circumstances,is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.
id.at.some citations omitted.fourth,adopting the faa additional proposed requirement for an agency act to count as an order would create perverse incentives.if an agency action qualified as an order only when accompanied by a sufficient record to permit review,agencies could escape judicial review by simply refusing to create a record to support their decisions.this can not be the law.finally,directly contradicting its argument here,the faa has itself contended elsewhere that section applies even when the agency fails to provide an adequate record for review.for example,in dania beach the faa argued that for an act to qualify as an order under section,it need only mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process and have legal consequences.resp t br,dania beach,quoting bennett spear,d.similarly,in gilmore gonzales,cir,the faa flatly stated the presence of an administrative record is not required for to apply.br,gilmore.
even if we accepted the faa argument that actions qualify as reviewable orders only when supported by an adequate factual record,however,the record here,though exceedingly thin,is sufficient to permit review.the faa assures us that its appendix includes all the documents upon which the agency relied.resp t br.although it claims that the documents can not reflect the entirety of the information and experience that the agency brought to bear in issuing the circular,we have never required that much information from just need enough to determine whether the agency decision was arbitrary.if the faa documents fail to demonstrate the reasonableness of its decision,it means that the agency either has chosen not to write down the reasons for its decision or is unable to do so.neither possibility is acceptable under the administrative procedure act.
prudential standing 
to establish prudential standing,a party grievance must arguably fall within the zone of interests protected or regulated by the statutory provision invoked in the suit.nuclear energy,epa,quoting bennett,at.the basic question is who may and who may not invoke the power of the courts to enforce the terms of a statute hazardous waste treatment council thomas.in this case,congress has already answered this question in section a a person disclosing a substantial interest in an order issued by the federal aviation administration with respect to aviation duties and powers designated to be carried out by the administrator may apply for review of the order.see also int l of teamsters transp.sec,equating prudential standing under section a with a party substantial interest in the order.here safe extensions unquestionably has a substantial interest in the order if left in place,will destroy the market for the company product.
the faa argues that safe extensions nevertheless falls outside the zone of interests protected by section a because the statute technically allows the faa to regulate airports,not manufacturers.again,this argument is absurd.effectively regulates safe extensions because it prevents the company from selling its product to airports.moreover,to have prudential standing,safe extensions must show only that its interest is arguably one regulated or protected by the statutory provision at issue.pdk,dea,quoting credit union admin.first bank,d.because safe extensions has easily met that minimal standard,the company has prudential standing.
agency discretion 
for its third jurisdictional argument,the faa claims that is unreviewable because the issues it addresses are committed by law to agency discretion.specifically,the faa claims that there is no meaningful standard for this court to apply,that advisory circulars are within the faa managerial discretion,and that judicial review of advisory circulars would greatly tax the agency resources.all three arguments lack merit.
as to the first point,the faa is certainly correct that i f no judicially manageable standard exists by which to judge the agency action,meaningful judicial review is impossible and the courts are without jurisdiction to review that action.steenholdt faa,quoting heckler chaney,d.but that is hardly the case here.the faa issued pursuant to,which authorizes the agency to b prescribe minimum safety standards for operating an airport serving any passenger aircraft designed for at least passenger seats,and directs the agency to a promote safe flight of civil aircraft by prescribing regulations and minimum standards for practices,methods,and procedure s the agency finds necessary for safety in air commerce.this provides a perfectly workable standard to guide the court,namely whether the faa actions promote air safety.
we have previously found far more ambiguous statutory directives reviewable.for example,in dickson secretary of defense,we held that we could review the army board for correction of military records refusal to waive a statute of limitations period under b,which allows the board to excuse a failure to file within three years if it finds it to be in the interest of justice.if in the interest of justice provides a judicially manageable standard,then necessary for safety certainly does as well.see,union of concerned scientists nuclear regulatory comm n,reviewing whether regulations provide d adequate protection to the health and safety of the public under a.
this conclusion finds support in the apa strong presumption of reviewability.steenholdt,at.as the supreme court has declared judicial review of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of congress.abbott labs.gardner,d.because of this presumption favoring judicial review,we require clear and convincing evidence of a legislative intention to bar such review.james madison by hecht ludwig,quoting ball,ball brosamer,reich.nothing in the federal aviation act even hints that congress intended decisions like the one at issue here to be unreviewable.indeed,demonstrating just the opposite,a gives this court jurisdiction to review faa orders challenged by any person disclosing a substantial interest in them.
the faa next argues that reflects the faa managerial choice,one not susceptible to judicial review.resp t br.not only does this argument amount to an attack on the very principles underlying the apa,including its basic presumption of judicial review for one suffering legal wrong because of agency action,abbott,at.quoting,but it also ignores that advisory circulars are no more a managerial choice than are the regulations this court routinely reviews from countless other agencies.see,asg,consumer prod.safety comm n,reviewing the consumer product safety commission regulations governing architectural glazing materials.the faa cites not a single case to support this baseless contention.
finally,the faa argues that allowing judicial review of issuances like this circular would be very disruptive to the agency operations.resp t br.if review is allowed here,the agency complains,disgruntled manufacturers will sue the faa whenever it issues new advisory circulars.given that this is,as best we can tell,the first time in the faa decades of issuing advisory circulars that a manufacturer has ever petitioned for review of a circular regulating its products,we highly doubt the factual premise underlying this argument.more fundamentally,the faa argument ignores the apa very purpose to subject agency decisions to judicial scrutiny.no one pretends that judicial review of agency action is a pleasant day at the beach for agencies,and although escaping judicial review would of course be less disruptive to the faa operations,it would also leave regulated entities,as well as the flying depends for its safety on solid,well supported faa from arbitrary and capricious agency action.
furthermore,the cases the faa cites to support its argument have nothing to do with the issue before us.both national federation of federal employees united states,and curran laird,involved military decisions about national security issues this court felt were beyond its purview.see fed n,at curran,at.and in southern railway seaboard allied milling,d,the supreme court concluded that it could find no law to apply and only then said the disruptive consequences of allowing review confirmed this position.see id.at.moreover,a ruling for the petitioner in southern railway would have required the interstate commerce commission to provide detailed justifications for millions of individual rates it approved each year,a disruption several orders of magnitude greater than the faa would suffer in this case.see id.at.in short,these cases provide no support for the ludicrous proposition that courts may not review faa advisory circulars because judicial review would create more work for the agency.like virtually every other agency,the faa must defend its decisions in court.
timeliness 
although the statute granting us jurisdiction in this case generally requires petitions for review of faa orders to be filed within sixty days of the challenged order,it provides that we may allow the petition to be filed after the day if there are reasonable grounds for not filing by the day.a.neither party discussed timeliness in their briefs,but in preparing for this case we discovered that the differential treatment safe extensions challenges stems from,not,and the company filed its petition more than sixty days after
