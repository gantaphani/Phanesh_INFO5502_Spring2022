the interlocutory appeals subject of the motion before us arise from conjoined actions in the united states district court for the southern district of new york preska.the actions arise from a march,maritime disaster the casualty,during which the rickmers genoa vessel the rickmers or rickmers genoa collided with another vessel,the sun cross,in the yellow sea.the rickmers genoa sustained flooding in one of her cargo holds,and a few hours later,an explosion and a fire occurred in the cargo hold of the rickmers genoa,resulting in the loss of cargo and a life.
owners and subrogated insurers of certain cargoes the cargo interests that had been destroyed during the rickmers genoa incident filed four individual admiralty actions in the southern district,seeking to recover for damage to the cargo in addition to amounts that were paid in salvage,against,inter alia,the entities that owned and chartered the rickmers genoa on the date of the maritime casualty,defendants and appellants,genoa schiffahrtsges mbh kg,genoa navigation company,and rickmers linie gmbh kg the rickmers interests rickmers genoa and esm group esm group and esm tianjin,esmt collectively,the esm parties.the esm parties were sued in their capacities as the manufacturer,shipper,owner of the cargo the esm group cargo that is believed to have caused the explosion in the cargo hold.among the cargo interests were chem one,et the chem one plaintiffs or chem one the owners or their subrogated underwriters of a portion of the cargoes carried aboard the rickmers genoa.the chem one plaintiffs predicated their claims on theories of common law negligence and common law strict liability the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa,ch,stat,app x at notes,pursuant to,stat,and breach of contract.
in turn,the rickmers interests filed a action asserting liability on the part of the esm parties as manufacturer,shipper owner of the esm group cargo.the rickmers interests predicated their claims on theories that included strict liability failure to warn negligent failure to warn breach of contract breach of warranty negligent misrepresentation indemnity and detrimental reliance.they sought to recover damages in compensation for their losses,along with costs and disbursements,in the total amount of million.
on november,the esm group filed a motion for summary judgment seeking the dismissal of all claims asserted against it in the con joined maritime actions arising from the collision between the vessels rickmers genoa and the sun cross in the yellow sea on march.by order dated march,the district court denied in part and granted in part the esm group motion for summary judgment,dismissing some of the direct claims against it to the extent that they were predicated on theories of common law negligence common law strict liability cogsa and breach of contract.in re rickmers genoa,d.the court denied the esm group motion for summary judgment insofar as dismissal was sought of claims brought against the esm group for the alleged actions and omissions of esmt,a subsidiary of esm group,under agency and veil piercing theories of liability.id.
on april,the esm parties filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of all remaining direct claims and claims alleged against them.by order dated november,the district court granted in its entirety the motion for summary judgment and dismissed the remaining claims to the extent that they were predicated on theories of strict liability negligent failure to warn breach of contract and detrimental reliance on a letter of indemnity.in re rickmers genoa,d.in addition,because the court dismissed all claims against esmt,the court accordingly dismissed the remaining causes of action,which had sought to hold esm group accountable for esmt actions and which the court had originally allowed to proceed in its march,order.id.at.
the chem one plaintiffs notice of appeal,filed december,in the district court,appealed both from the district court march,order and the court november,order.in their capacity as,the rickmers interests filed notices of appeal appealing from the order entered november.
in the motion before us,dated january,the esm parties moved to dismiss all of the captioned interlocutory appeals as premature,or,in the alternative,to consolidate the captioned appeals.the esm parties argue that the march,and november,decisions of the district court,which form the basis of these interlocutory appeals,do not dispose of all the claims in the underlying litigation and therefore are not eligible for appeal pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the esm parties also argue that because both the esm group and esmt alleged counterclaims and in the underlying litigation,which remain pending in the district court,there is no basis for interlocutory maritime jurisdiction pursuant to a,which provides us with jurisdiction over i nterlocutory decrees of such district courts or the judges thereof determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed.
for the reasons that follow,we deny the esm parties motion to dismiss the captioned appeals and grant the motion insofar as it seeks to consolidate the captioned appeals.

events leading up to the rickmers casualty 
esm group is a limited liability corporation organized under the laws of delaware and registered to do business in the state of new york.id.at.prior to,esm group was affiliated with a group of related companies consisting of esm ii,esm ii,and esm manufacturing,the esm companies have or have had plants in several locations around the united states and abroad.the esm companies produce,inter alia,a family of magnesium desulphurization reagent products,including a reagent product designated ss.id.
ss is u sed as a desulphurizing reagent in steelmaking and is designed to be injected into molten iron ore to remove sulphur and make the steel less brittle.because it removes sulphur and consists of approximately magnesium,it is regularly identified under the english language trade name super sul mg.id.products liberate hydrogen gas when they come into contact with water,especially sea or salt water.id.hydrogen gas is flammable and susceptible to exploding.according to a material safety data sheet msds prepared by esm manufacturing,ss poses unusual fire and explosion hazards and should be kept dry and away from water and moisture.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in,esm group formed a subsidiary,esm tianjin,esmt in tianjin,china.esmt is a limited liability corporation organized under the laws of the people republic of china.esm group allegedly formed esmt to save production costs,obtain lower prices for materials previously imported by esm group,and avoid united states regulations concerning the manufacture of ss.esm group established the esmt plant,trained esmt personnel,transferred equipment from united states sites to the esmt plant,and provided esmt with the formula for ss.id.esm group also brought esmt engineers and plant manager to the united states for technical and corporate training.esm group ceo became president of esmt.esmt board of directors included,at times exclusively,esm group employees.esm group directly paid esmt raw materials suppliers.esm group executives regularly visited the esmt plant to monitor its operations,manufacturing,and shipping procedures.id.at.
when esm group desired a shipment of a magnesium desulphurization reagent,such as ss,from esmt,esm group would send esmt a purchased material service specification outlining the chemical and physical of the desired product.aside from these purchase orders,esm group and the related united states companies corresponded with esmt managers about conforming the chemical composition of ss to esm group requirements.id.
sometime in,esm group created and provided esmt with a draft msds for the ss product.although esm group alleges that it did not get involved in providing recommendations to emst regarding safety measures in the production,storage or transportation of products which esmt produces,esm group,acting through its predecessor esm ii,directed esmt to include its own msds for shipments of ss and requested test data on the product from esmt before shipments were to be made.id.esmt created its own msds for magnesium granules but apparently never created an msds for ss.esmt plant manager acknowledged that esmt would have distributed an msds for ss upon esm group instruction to do so.id.
in,all of esmt production of ss was sold to esm group,and esm group did not allow esmt to sell ss to other buyers.of the other products that esmt produced,only half were sold to buyers other than esm group.as such,of esmt total production was sold or supplied to esm group.esmt net profits in and were and,respectively.esmt did not report the payments esm group made to esmt raw material suppliers as taxable income.id.
on or about january,esm group sent esmt a purchase order for metric tons of ss,baltimore.id.esmt then arranged for the ss to be shipped from the esmt tianjin plant to the united states aboard the rickmers.esmt contracted with pudong trans,pudong or pudong trans usa,a non vessel owning common carrier nvocc,to transport the ss from the tianjin plant to port in xingang,china,where the rickmers was docked.id.at.
on or about march,pudong issued esmt a bill of identifying esmt as the shipper and identifying to order of shipper as the consignee.id.pudong then contracted with the rickmers interests to have the rickmers carry the ss from china to camden,new jersey.sometime thereafter,the rickmers interests issued a bill of lading identifying pudong as the shipper and identifying shipping,as the consignee.shipping was to act as an intermediary nvocc and releasing agent in the united states,apparently tasked to transport the ss from camden to baltimore.id.the district court found that there was no evidence that esmt informed any of these entities about the risks associated with transporting ss by sea and that esmt also did not provide an msds on ss.id.
on or about march,esmt placed metric tons of ss,of the total metric tons of ss ordered,into sacks.esmt tested the sacks to ensure that they complied with hazardous material regulations dangerous when wet criteria.based on testing,the results were normal and within united states regulatory standards.id.esmt placed the packages into containers.then,pudong picked up the containers and delivered them to the xingang port that same day.on or about march,the containers were loaded aboard the rickmers into hold.id.
on march,after having departed from the xingang port and apparently stopping at other chinese ports,the rickmers collided with the sun cross in foggy weather in the yellow sea.id.the rickmers suffered damage to her forward plating,and flooding occurred in hold,where the ss was being stored.approximately four hours after the collision,an explosion occurred in hold,and a fire ensued.the containers of ss were completely destroyed.id.the chief officer of the rickmers died in the explosion.in re rickmers genoa,d at.the rickmers captain had not been aware,until the fire broke out,that the ss was some kind of a mixture with magnesium.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
ii.proceedings in the district court 
in the wake of the disaster,the cargo interests,the owners and subrogated insurers of cargoes,other than the esm group cargo,that had been destroyed during the rickmers casualty filed four individual admiralty actions in the district court,pursuant to rule h of the federal rules of civil procedure,seeking damages for their losses.specifically,the chem one plaintiffs plaintiff shandong industrial,plaintiff paul travelers and plaintiff atlantic coast yacht sales,collectively,the cargo interests,each filed complaints against,inter alia,the rickmers genoa and the sun cross vessel the rickmers interests the esm group and esmt and defendant pudong trans usa.the foregoing actions were joined for consideration in the district court.
on february,the esm group filed counterclaims and against the rickmers interests for failing properly to handle and carry the esm group cargo and for breaching their duty of care and thereby allegedly causing the destruction of that cargo against pudong trans usa for breaching its duty of care as the common carrier of the cargo and counterclaims against the chem one plaintiffs for failing to warn the parties about the dangerous nature of unspecified chemicals contained in the chem one plaintiffs cargo onboard the rickmers vessel.see counterclaims and cross claims of esm group,chem one,rickmers genoa et,cv lap,ecf.
on april,the rickmers interests filed an amended complaint against the esm group and esmt pudong trans usa and shipping in that complaint,the rickmers interests alleged,inter alia,that the esm parties had failed to provide any warning as to the dangerous nature of the esm group cargo.
on november,esmt counterclaimed against the chem one plaintiffs to recover for the loss of the esm group cargo onboard the rickmers genoa.in the counterclaims,esmt also sought contribution or indemnity from the chem one plaintiffs to the extent that esmt might be liable for any judgment against it.see generally in re rickmers genoa,lap cv lap cv lap cv lap,wl,at may,amended memorandum and order explaining that the rickmers interests also sued esm group and esmt,as consignee and shipper,respectively,in a action,alleging that they were liable because magnesium can explode when put in contact with water.and counterclaims abounded.in re rickmers genoa,d,a dditional and are asserted against other cargo interests whose cargo may have caused or contributed to the explosion and fire aboard the rickmers.so far,no party other than esm group has made a dispositive motion in this litigation.
in a separate filing,also on november,esmt alleged against party plaintiffs rickmers interests for contribution,indemnity,recoupment for all or part of any liability or judgment against esmt,any related payment by esmt in relation to claims arising from the casualty and defendant pudong trans usa,as nvocc,for contribution,indemnity,recoupment from for all or part of any liability or judgment against esmt,any related payment by esm group in relation to the claims arising from the casualty.cross claims of esm tianjin against the rickmers interests and pudong trans usa,chem one,rickmers genoa et,cv lap,ecf.
a year later,in november,the esm group moved for summary judgment,seeking to dismiss all of the claims asserted against it by the rickmers interests and the chem one plaintiffs.the claims against the esm group were predicated on theories of common law negligence general negligence and failure to warn common law strict liability cogsa breach of contract and agency and veil piercing.in an order dated march,the district court granted the motion in part and denied the motion in part.in re rickmers genoa,d at.in doing so,the court dismissed the common law negligence claims because the esm group did not owe a duty of care to any of the plaintiffs,as esm group was a buyer owing no duty under federal maritime common law to warn of risks associated with the buyer purchased cargo,id.at citing aslanidis lines,cir the common law strict liability claims because there was no legal authority for holding the esm group,a buyer,liable simply because of esm group knowledge of ss dangerous characteristics,id.at citing in re dg harmony,cir discussing the law of shipper strict liability for accidents relating to the shipment of dangerous goods the cogsa claims against esm group because cogsa was inapplicable as it is fundamentally concerned with efficiently and equitably allocating the contractual rights and obligations of carriers and shippers who have actually contracted with each other,and esm group was a mere consignee,id.at and the breach of contract claim because there was no evidence that esm group consented to be bound by the bill of lading between esmt and pudong trans usa or the bill of lading between pudong trans usa and the rickmers interests,id.at.
the district court permitted the claims against esm group to proceed to the extent that the esm group might be liable for the acts of esmt.id.at.specifically,the court found,with respect to the claims predicated on theories of federal maritime common law of agency and veil piercing,that the evidence was sufficient to create a triable issue as to whether veil piercing is warranted,id.at,whether esm group and esmt were sufficiently related to hold each liable for the other torts,contracts,and statutory obligations,id.at.the court found that the evidence tend ed to show that esmt was transacting esm group business rather than its own business.taking this evidence as a whole,it is sufficient to create a triable issue as to whether veil piercing is warranted in this case.id.at.
on april,the esm parties collectively moved for summary judgment to dismiss all the remaining claims alleged against them.on november,the district court granted the esm parties motion for summary judgment and dismissed all remaining claims alleged against them by the rickmers interests and cargo interests.the court started its analysis with the four claims alleged by plaintiffs rickmers interests.first,the court rejected the strict liability claims,alleged pursuant to of cogsa,note,against the esm parties because the rickmers interests either actually or constructively knew that the ss cargo had certain dangerous propensities and nevertheless exposed the cargo to the condition that activates those dangerous propensities.see in re rickmers genoa,d,citing and discussing in re dg harmony,cir contship containerlines,ppg,cir.second,the court dismissed the claims for negligent failure to warn because esmt had no duty to warn the rickmers interests of any specific dangers because the ss presented no dangers of which rickmers could not reasonably have been aware.id.at.
third,as to the rickmers interests claim that esmt breached both a bill of lading issued by rickmers to pudong trans usa and a bill of lading issued by pudong trans usa to esmt,the court dismissed the breach of contract claim because esmt was generally not bound by the rickmers pudong bill of lading as pudong trans usa was the shipper and rickmers was the carrier,and the rickmers interests had no standing to enforce the pudong esmt bill of lading,to which the rickmers interests were,id.at.fourth,the court rejected the rickmers interests claim of detrimental reliance based on a february,letter of indemnity drafted by esmt,because the court found that the rickmers interests were unable to establish that they had relied to their detriment on any letter of indemnity when they accepted the ss on the rickmers genoa.id.at.
the district court next addressed the strict liability and claims alleged by the cargo interests against the esm parties,including esmt,and ultimately dismissed those claims.in re rickmers genoa,d at.the court determined that these claims should be dismissed because the evidence revealed that the cargo interests knew or should have known of the hazardous nature and dangerous propensities of the esm group cargo and that this knowledge or constructive knowledge therefore barred the claims.see in re rickmers genoa,d at.finally,because the district court dismissed all claims against esmt,the court dismissed the remaining causes of action that had sought to hold esm group accountable for esmt actions and that the court had originally allowed to proceed in its march,order.id.at.the court directed that t he remaining parties sh ould confer and inform the c ourt by how they propose to proceed.id.at.
on december,the rickmers interests filed timely notices of appeal from the district court interlocutory november,order,resulting in the opening of docket numbers cv,cv,and cv in this court.on december,the chem one plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal from both the district court november,and march,decisions resulting in the opening of docket number cv in this court.following the district court november,order,the rickmers interests,by endorsed letter dated november,on behalf of all the parties,informed the court that the claims asserted against them by the chem one plaintiffs,atlantic coast yacht sales,and esm group remained to be adjudicated.
as to the remaining claims for loss of cargo asserted against them,the rickmers interests,on february,moved for partial summary judgment with respect to the interpretation of the terms in their bill of lading concerning the issue of the limitation of liability of a carrier engaged to transport goods.the rickmers interests contended that under their bill of lading and cogsa,a package limit of per package should be applied to any claim for damage or loss of cargo transported pursuant to the rickmers interests bill of lading between pudong trans usa and the rickmers interests.see generally cogsa,note neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of goods in an amount exceeding per package.
on march,the esm group filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the rickmers interests february,motion for partial summary judgment and in support of esm group for summary judgment as to its counterclaims and against the rickmers interests.in its opposition and for partial summary judgment,the esm group opposed the rickmers interests motion seeking to limit the rickmers interests liability to per package and sought to pursue their claims in full.the esm group argued that under the plain language of the rickmers interests bill of lading,german law should be applied,and,therefore,with regard to esm group counterclaims and against the rickmers interests,that the esm group should be entitled to recover its actual loss of the esm group cargo and that it was not limited to the per package cap under cogsa.
by order,dated may,the district court granted esm group for summary judgment and denied the rickmers interests motion for partial summary judgment,thereby allowing the esm group to proceed with their counterclaims and against the rickmers interests.in re rickmers genoa,docket cv lap cv lap cv lap cv lap,wl may.the court determined that the international hague visby rules,which were amendments to the hague rules of,international convention for the unification of certain rules of law relating to bills of lading brussels,and not cogsa governed the rickmers interests limitation of liability of the claims for loss or damage of cargo.id.at see also id.at noting that cogsa,provides for a lower limitation of liability than does german law,which applies the amendments to the hague rules of and that t he parties hope that the resolution of this legal issue will have a domino effect as they try to settle.
on june,the rickmers interests moved the district court for reconsideration of its may,order,and the esm group opposed that motion by filing a memorandum of law in support of that opposition on june.on july,the district court denied the rickmers interests motion for reconsideration,finding that they rehash ed the arguments made in the summary judgment papers.order denying motion for reconsideration,in re rickmers genoa,cv july,ecf.the court also denied the rickmers interests request for certification of an interlocutory appeal from the may,order.id.
iii.proceedings in this court 
by motion dated january,the esm parties moved to dismiss all appeals in this court for lack of jurisdiction on the grounds that the orders are and this court lacks jurisdiction under the admiralty interlocutory provision set forth in a because claims remain in the district court.in their motion,the esm parties also moved this court to consolidate the appeals in the event that their motion to dismiss is denied.the esm parties argue that section a should be construed to require that all of the rights and liabilities of all parties must be adjudicated by the district court to provide this court with appellate jurisdiction over these interlocutory appeals.the rickmers interests and the chem one plaintiffs oppose the esm parties motion to dismiss,contending that in this case,we have interlocutory jurisdiction under section a because the district court has resolved all claims against the esm parties.rickmers interests and the chem one plaintiffs do not oppose consolidation of the present appeals.
interlocutory admiralty jurisdiction 
as a general rule,we lack jurisdiction to hear an appeal unless the decision is,or is embodied in,an order or judgment that is final within the meaning of.swede rochester carpenters pension fund,cir quoting smith half hollow hills cent.sch,cir.under an exception to the final judgment rule,which is relevant to these appeals,we review i nterlocutory decrees of such district courts or the judges thereof determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed.a t here are three prerequisites to invocation of interlocutory appellate jurisdiction under section a the underlying case must be an admiralty case in which appeals from final decrees are allowed the appeal must be from an interlocutory order or decree of the district court and the order or decree must have determined the rights and liabilities of the parties.wingerter chester quarry,cir quoting foulk donjon marine,cir see also thypin steel asoma,cir accord becker poling transp,cir quoting thypin steel,at.
the section a exception to the final judgment rule has its origins in the once common admiralty practice of referring the determination of damages to a master or commissioner after resolving the issue of liability.becker,at citing roco carriers,nurnberg express,cir.it provides appellate jurisdiction when the court below,as is customary in admiralty,has entered an interlocutory decree deciding the merits of the controversy between the parties,but has left unsettled the assessment of damages or other details required to be determined prior to entry of a final decree.id.quoting thypin steel,at.t he crucial inquiry for purposes of section a is whether the district court judgment has determined the rights and liabilities of the parties,which means deciding the merits of the controversies between them.id.at quoting in re wills lines,cir.
it is undisputed that the present appeals arose under the district court admiralty jurisdiction and that the orders from which the parties have appealed are interlocutory in nature.see wingerter,at explaining that the preferred method to designate the action as being one in admiralty is by an express reference to.h in the complaint.moving for dismissal of these admiralty appeals,the esm parties contend that we lack jurisdiction under section a because the district court has not determined all of the rights and liabilities of all of the parties.in support of this claim,the esm parties note that although the district court dismissed all of the direct and claims made against them,the esm parties counterclaims against the rickmers interests and chem one plaintiffs for the loss of cargo,as well as claims by several of the cargo plaintiffs against the rickmers interests,remain to be adjudicated.the esm parties further note that by esm group against pudong trans usa and by esmt against the rickmers interests and pudong trans usa are still pending.the esm parties therefore contend that the statute should be construed to require that the rights and liabilities of the parties collectively,as in the entire group,need to be decided by the district court in order to qualify for an interlocutory appeal.reply mem.of esm parties at.
in thypin steel,we noted and seemingly rejected the eleventh circuit conclusion in bradford marine,sea falcon,cir,that a ll the rights and liabilities of all the parties do not need to be determined before such an order is appealable.bradford marine,at citing nichols barwick,th cir see also aparicio swan lake,cir.we stated in thypin steel that a narrow construction of section a better comports with the historical origin of the exception and this circuit precedent.thypin steel,at.in this connection,we opined that appellate jurisdiction exists over an interlocutory admiralty appeal where a district court has entered an interlocutory decree deciding the merits of the controversy between the parties,but has left unsettled the assessment of damages or other details required to be determined prior to entry of a final decree.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we also recognized that a noted commentator has suggested that arguments for expansive interpretation of section a are offset by the availability of rule b and the more recent adoption of section b,which allows interlocutory appeals on permission of the trial court and appellate court in admiralty cases as well as in other cases.id.at quoting charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.but see wright et,supra,only congress can decide whether these alternative means of appeal,not available in when section a was adopted,justify repeal of section a.and no doubt it is too late to limit the statute so as to permit interlocutory appeal only from orders that dispose of all the rights and liabilities asserted among all the parties.footnote omitted.
notwithstanding the foregoing,interpretation of the scope of section a was not necessary in thypin steel because in that case,we ultimately held that there was no appellate jurisdiction under section a over a seeking interlocutory review of a district court dismissal of one defendant for lack of personal jurisdiction,reasoning that the dismissal only affected how and where the defendant rights would be determined but did not conclusively resolve the parties substantive rights or liabilities or the merits of the underlying controversy.thypin steel,at.the dismissal did not preclude the plaintiff from commencing an independent action against the defendant in another forum.id.further,the district court dismissal of two claims against another defendant for failure to state a claim in thypin steel did not require this court to examine the scope of section a because the defendant rights and liabilities as to the bill of lading,and the essential question of liability,had yet to be determined.id.at.
accordingly,we reject the contention of the esm parties that language in thypin steel somehow limits section a to interlocutory appeals only from orders that dispose of all of the rights and liabilities asserted among all of the parties.thypin steel discussion of the scope of section a was dictum.it was not necessary in that case to suggest that section a might be limited to dispositions of all the rights and all of the liabilities asserted among all the parties when the at issue in thypin steel did not fully resolve the liabilities of even a single party.see alsol mukasey,cir rejecting the discussion of an issue in a prior case because it was not necessary to the court holding and therefore dictum citing cal.pub.employees ret.worldcom,cir pierre leval,judging under the constitution dicta about dicta,united states garcia,cir calabresi,concurring noting that discussing a legal issue that is not necessary to decide the case is mere dicta and should not be treated as binding on future panels 
in our view thypin steel dictum is at odds with the plain language of section a,which does not say that all rights and liabilities of all the parties must be decided before an appeal can be taken,deering maint.repair,cir emphasis in original.our sister circuits support this interpretation.see,in re compl.of pmd,cir our case law on interlocutory appeals in admiralty establishes that the language of section a regarding a final determination of rights and liabilities applies to situations such as the dismissal of parties from the litigation,grants of summary judgment even if not to all parties,and other cases where a claim has somehow been terminated.underwriters at interest on cover note nautronix,cir in an admiralty case,it is not necessary for the order appealed from to have determined all the rights and liabilities of all the parties before such an order is appealable under section a.martha vineyard scuba headquarters,unidentified,wrecked and abandoned steam vessel,cir for an
