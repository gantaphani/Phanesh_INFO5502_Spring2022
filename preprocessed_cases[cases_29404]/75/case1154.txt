background 
respondent is the local transportation authority for santa barbara county with the power,subject to voter approval,to impose a sales or use tax of up to percent to provide funding for transportation services in the county.pub,et santa barbara county coalition against automobile subsidies santa barbara county of governments th,d.on june,respondent approved measure a,consisting of ordinance ordinance and a document entitled transportation investment plan investment plan.on the same date,respondent adopted a resolution requesting that the santa barbara county board of supervisors call an election on november,for the purpose of allowing the electorate to vote on measure 
the ordinance extends for a period not to exceed thirty years an existing of one percent local transportation sales and use tax.the existing sales and use tax will expire on march.the ordinance provides that the investment plan is hereby adopted as the county transportation expenditure plan expenditure plan for the expenditure of revenues expected to be derived from the tax imposed pursuant to this ordinance,in accordance with california public utilities code section.section provides that,prior to the call of an election to approve a local transportation sales and use tax,an expenditure plan shall be prepared and adopted.the expenditure plan must show the expenditure of the revenues expected to be derived from the tax imposed,together with other federal,state,and local funds expected to be available for transportation improvements,for the period during which the tax is to be imposed.id.at subd.a.

basic ceqa principles 
with narrow exceptions,ceqa requires an eir environmental impact report whenever a public agency proposes to approve or to carry out a project that may have a significant effect on the environment.citations.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d,fn.omitted.approval means the decision by a public agency which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any person.ceqa guidelines,subd.a.an activity that is not a project as defined in the public resources code see and the ceqa guidelines see is not subject to ceqa.ceqa guidelines,subd.c.muzzy ranch solano county airport land use,supra,cal th at,d.
trial court ruling 
the trial court determined that,pursuant to ceqa guidelines section,subdivision b,measure a does not qualify as a project.section,subdivision b,provides that a project for purposes of ceqa does not include t he creation of government funding mechanisms or other government fiscal activities,which do not involve any commitment to any specific project which may result in a potentially significant physical impact on the environment.the trial court noted that measure a is indisputably a governmental funding mechanism the court concluded that measure a falls within the funding mechanism exclusion of the guidelines because it does not constitute a binding commitment to construct the projects set forth in the investment plan.
the trial court ruling was consistent with section of the ordinance,which provides in part pursuant to the state ceqa guidelines section b,adoption of this retail transactions and use tax ordinance as a government funding mechanism is not a project subject to the requirements of ceqa.
on september,three months after its approval of measure a,respondent certified a final eir for the santa barbara county regional transportation plan.a regional transportation plan is deemed to be a project for purposes of ceqa,so an eir is required prior to its adoption.see edna valley san luis obispo county.coordinating council d.the final eir purported to consider all of the projects in the investment plan.respondent argues that,since the voters had an opportunity to review the final eir before the november election,there is no effective remedy this court can offer that has not already been implemented.at this point,a ruling requiring respondent to conduct environmental review on measure a would be purely academic,as no practical relief can result.therefore,respondent contends,t he case is moot.an appeal becomes moot when,through no fault of the respondent,the occurrence of an event renders it impossible for the appellate court to grant the appellant effective relief.citations.in re esperanza th,d.
the appeal is not moot.if measure a constituted a project within the meaning of ceqa and if respondent approved that project on june,environmental review would have been required prior to its approval,not three months later.ceqa should not be interpreted as allowing an eir to be delayed beyond the time when it can,as a practical matter,serve its intended function of informing and guiding decision makers.save tara city of west hollywood cal th,d,save tara.a t a minimum an eir must be performed before a project is approved,for i f postapproval environmental review were allowed,eir would likely become nothing more than post hoc rationalizations to support action already taken.ibid.if an eir is prepared after the approval of a project subject to ceqa,the approval must be vacated.id.at,d.thus,respondent certification of a final eir after its approval of measure a does not preclude this court from granting appellant effective relief.id.at,d.
moreover,on october,appellant filed in the trial court a petition for a writ of mandate challenging the adequacy of the final eir.sustainable transportation advocates of santa barbara santa barbara county association of governments.if appellant prevails in the trial court proceeding,respondent certification of the final eir will be set aside.accordingly,we consider the instant appeal on its merits.
standard of review 
whether an activity constitutes a project under ceqa is a question of law that can be decided de novo based on the undisputed evidence in the record.citation.plastic pipe fittings california building standards com.th,d accord,muzzy ranch solano county airport land use,supra,cal th at,d.the instant appeal,therefore,presents no question of deference to agency discretion or review of substantiality of evidence.citation.citation.association for a cleaner environment yosemite community college dist.th,d.
discussion 
section of the ordinance provides prior to commencement of any project included in the investment plan,any necessary environmental review required by ceqa shall be completed.in save tara,supra,cal th,d,our supreme court considered the impact of a similar ceqa compliance condition in an agency agreement allowing private development.the court concluded that the agreement conditioning of final approval on ceqa compliance is
