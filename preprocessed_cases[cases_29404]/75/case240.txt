opinion of the court 
in this consolidated bankruptcy appeal,the trustee for the debtor,kiwi international air lines,appeals the dismissal of three preference actions he brought against a number of kiwi creditors to recover nearly million in payments kiwi made to the creditors before it filed a petition for reorganization.kiwi made the payments in all three cases pursuant to a number of written agreements that were essential to its efforts to stay in business.some time after kiwi filed its bankruptcy petition,it assumed the agreements.the trustee claims that,in each case,the payments constituted preferential transfers and were thus voidable under section b of the bankruptcy code.both the bankruptcy court and the district court disagreed.because we concur with these courts that the assumption of a contract under bars a preference claim by a trustee and section of the code precludes a trustee from bringing a preference action to recover payments made on aircraft equipment leases,we affirm.
facts and procedural background 
on september,kiwi international air lines kiwi or debtor filed a petition for reorganization pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code.prior to seeking bankruptcy relief,kiwi had been in the business of operating a commercial airline offering both scheduled and chartered air transportation and related services.some time within days before kiwi filed its chapter petition,it made a number of payments to different creditors pursuant to existing arrangements that it had with those creditors to the port authority of new york and new jersey port authority to the sabre group,or its predecessor sabre and to the cit group capital transportation,cit group or cit.these transactions are at the center of the dispute between the trustee and the defendants.shortly after its bankruptcy filing,kiwi suspended operations due to a lack of cash necessary to fund its daily operations.the company resumed flight operations only after obtaining substantial outside capital from an investor named charles edwards who owned an entity named kiwi international holdings,kih.trustee br.in cit,at.in june,kiwi filed a motion for an order approving the sale of its assets to kih.
after numerous days of hearings,on july,the bankruptcy court approved a compromise among kiwi,kih,the creditors committee,and northwest airlines,a creditor of kiwi bankruptcy estate.consistent with the compromise,the bankruptcy court entered a consent order approving the settlement as well as a sale order authorizing kiwi to sell substantially all of its assets to kih.the sale transaction resulted in,among other things,the debtor assumption and then assignment to kih of several contracts which it had entered into with each of the defendant creditors.kiwi assumption of these contracts is important because it enabled kiwi to compel its creditors to continue performing under the assumed agreements,for the purpose of receiving contract benefits necessary to its operation as a going concern.specifically,here,kiwi assumed and assigned to kih its operating agreement with the port authority in order to continue aircraft operations at newark international airport.kiwi also assumed and assigned to kih operating agreements it had with sabre,under which sabre provided the debtor with integrated technology services,including a computerized reservation system,inventory control,scheduling,baggage management,flight operations and communications,and electronic distribution of kiwi inventory to travel agents and consumers.as a prerequisite to the assumption and assignment of the various agreements,the bankruptcy court ordered kih to cure kiwi existing monetary defaults under the agreements and to provide adequate assurance of future performance under the agreements.
additionally,in connection with the sale,the debtor assumed and assigned to kih leases with the cit group for four airframes and twelve aircraft engines aircraft equipment.previously,the bankruptcy court had approved a stipulation between the debtor and cit under which cit agreed to permit the debtor to retain possession of the aircraft equipment it had leased to it and kiwi agreed to cure any and all defaults under the aircraft equipment leases and to make lease payments going forward.
the sale order entered by the bankruptcy court also approved the terms and conditions of a document it referred to as the term sheet.according to the term sheet,all causes of actions,including preference actions,would not be transferred to kih in the sale but would remain with the debtor estate.thus,potential preference claims against creditors were to be preserved for later prosecution by an estate representative such as the trustee.notably,the term sheet provided that only preference actions against northwest airlines and greater orlando airport were settled and that these creditors were to obtain releases from liability from kih,kiwi,and the creditors committee all other preference actions were preserved by the term sheet.according to the trustee,northwest airlines paid in consideration for the release it obtained.
on september,two years after kiwi filed its bankruptcy petition,the creditors committee filed a motion with the bankruptcy court seeking appointment of a chapter trustee or,in the alternative,conversion of the case to chapter.the committee asked the court to immediately appoint a chapter trustee lest causes of action of the debtor estate which have been preserved by the creditors committee for the benefit of creditors be virtually lost by the lapse of time port authority app.at.in response,on september,the court appointed simon kimmelman as the chapter trustee for the debtor.a month later,the debtor chapter case was converted to a chapter liquidation and kimmelman was appointed chapter trustee for the debtor estate 
on april,kimmelman,in his capacity as chapter trustee,filed separate adversary proceedings against the port authority,sabre,and the cit group,seeking to recover,pursuant to,payments made by the debtor to each of the defendants during the day period preceding its chapter filing.the trustee sought to recover from the port authority,from sabre,and from the cit group.
following defendants dismissal motions,the bankruptcy court dismissed each of the three actions brought by the trustee the bankruptcy court held,in all three cases,that the trustee could not recover payments made by the debtor pursuant to agreements which the debtor later assumed and assigned to the buyer of its assets.with respect to the preference action against the cit group,the bankruptcy court held that the trustee recovery was also barred by the debtor earlier entry into a stipulation allowing it to retain possession of its leased aircraft equipment.the district court affirmed the dismissal of each of the actions brought by the trustee.both courts reasoned that,because the debtor was required to pay the defendants all amounts in arrears in order to compel their continued performance of its agreements with them,the payments by the debtor did not improve their positions in the bankruptcy and,therefore,did not constitute preferential transfers.the trustee timely filed a notice of appeal in each of the adversary proceedings.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court orders dismissing the trustee complaints pursuant to a.this court has jurisdiction to review the district court judgments under d and.
our standard of review over the district court bankruptcy decision is the same as that exercised by the district court.see in re woskob,cir,cert.denied,d.accordingly,we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and exercise plenary review over the bankruptcy court legal determinations.see see also in re continental airlines,cir,cert.denied.
the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants was proper only if it appears that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that each of the moving part ies is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in evaluating the evidence,we view the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.bartnicki vopper,cir citation omitted,aff,d.
iii.analysis 
the consolidated appeals before this court concern the interplay between,the provision of the bankruptcy code authorizing a trustee or debtor in possession to recover certain preferential transfers made by the debtor,and and,provisions of the bankruptcy code,authorizing a trustee,after curing defaults,to assume and assign executory contracts and unexpired leases,and to retain aircraft equipment,respectively.the trustee primary contention is that the bankruptcy and district courts erred in concluding that the debtor assumption of the agreements pursuant to precluded him from recovering payments made by the debtor pursuant to.
we begin by turning to of the bankruptcy code.the purpose of this section is to facilitate the prime bankruptcy policy of equality of distribution among creditors of the debtor.any creditor that received a greater payment than others of its class is required to disgorge so that all may share equally.collier on bankruptcy ed.section b provides,in pertinent part 
b except as provided in subsection c of this section,the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property 
to or for the benefit of a creditor 
for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made 
made while the debtor was insolvent 
a on or within days before the date of the filing of the petition 
that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if 
a the case were a case under chapter of this title 
b the transfer had not been made and 
c such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of this title.
defendants do not dispute that the requirements of the first four subsections of b are satisfied.rather,they assert that the trustee can not establish a prima facie case for recovery because he can not meet the requirements of b.to satisfy the requirements of b,the trustee must establish that the transfer yielded the creditor a greater return on its debt than it would have received if the transfer had not taken place and it had received a distribution under a chapter liquidation.see mellon bank,metro communications,cir see also in re el paso refinery,cir same palmer clay products brown.under section of the bankruptcy act,a payment was considered to be a preference if it enabled the creditor to obtain a greater percentage of its debt than any other of such creditors of the same class.in other words,when a trustee commences a preference action,the court is to compare what the creditor actually received and what it would have received under the chapter distribution provisions of the code in order to determine whether the creditor received more than its fair share.collier on bankruptcy a ed.
the trustee asserts that the hypothetical liquidation analysis of b should be conducted as of the filing date of the bankruptcy petition.he maintains that,since the debtor here had not yet decided,as of the filing date,whether to assume or reject its agreement with the defendants,they were in no better position than general unsecured creditors and were entitled to only a pro rata distribution on account of their claims.the trustee reasons that,by making the payments to the defendants,the debtor preferred them over other unsecured creditors because the unsecured creditors of kiwi estate will not be paid on account of their claims.
we disagree with the trustee characterization of defendants as being similarly situated to general unsecured creditors for purposes of a b.we believe the trustee analysis disregards the unique set of rights provided to the defendants by,and,in the case of the cit group,by as well.
section authorizes trustees or debtors in possession,such as kiwi,to assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor,subject to court approval.a.in order to assume such an agreement,the debtor in possession must cure defaults and provide assurance of future performance.specifically,b provides 
b if there has been a default in an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor,the trustee may not assume such contract or lease unless,at the time of assumption of such contract or lease,the trustee 
a cures,or provides adequate assurance that the trustee will promptly cure,such default 
b compensates,or provides adequate assurance that the trustee will promptly compensate,a party other than the debtor to such contract or lease,for any actual pecuniary loss to such party resulting from such default and 
c provides adequate assurance of future performance under such contract or lease.
once an assumption order is entered,the creditor must perform in accordance with the terms of the assumed agreements.however,as a matter of fairness,before requiring the creditor to perform,courts require the debtor in possession to give the other contracting party the full benefit of its bargain,at,reprinted in,see also matter of superior toy,cir.in other words,the debtor must cure all defaults,assure future performance,and make the other contracting party whole before it may be permitted to assume the agreement.as we explained in columbia gas system,b ecause assumption acts as a renewed acceptance of the terms of the executory bargain,the bankruptcy code provides that the cost of performing the debtor obligations is an administrative expense of the estate,which will be paid first out of the assets of the estate.in re columbia gas system,cir.by contrast,general unsecured creditors are entitled to receive only a pro rata distribution of the debtor unencumbered assets that remain after such priority claims and others are paid.see generally.see also in re baker getty financial services,cir.for this reason,a creditor whose contract is assumed under is not similarly situated to general unsecured creditors.
the trustee characterization of the defendants claims as unsecured on the filing date seems to presuppose that a hypothetical chapter trustee would have elected to reject the debtor agreements with them.had the agreements been rejected,the breach of the agreements would have been deemed to have occurred immediately before the filing of the petition and the defendants would have been allowed general unsecured claims.see g nlrb bildisco and bildisco,d.however,the agreements here were not rejected and they would not necessarily have been rejected in a hypothetical chapter liquidation once the debtor assumed the agreements,the defendants were no longer unsecured creditors because the defendants had more than a simple unsecured claim for a sum of money.in re lco enterprises,cir.rather,all of the were entitled,pursuant to,to full payment of the amounts owed under the agreements.
in addition to being in a more favorable position than general unsecured creditors because of its entitlement under,the cit group was also in a better position for another reason.it was entitled to payment in full of all amounts owing under its leases with the debtor or to a return of its property under the stipulation approved by the bankruptcy court,which allowed the debtor to retain possession of aircraft equipment at the time that the debtor and the cit group entered into the stipulation,section provided that 
a t he right of a secured party with a security interest in equipment described in paragraph or of a lessor or conditional vendor of such equipment to take possession of such equipment in compliance with a security agreement,lease,or conditional sale contract is not affected by section,or or by any power of the court to enjoin the taking of possession unless 
a before the date that is days after the date of the order for relief under this chapter,the trustee,subject to the court approval,agrees to perform all obligations of the debtor that become due on or after the date of the order under such security agreement,lease,or conditional sale contract and 
b any default,other than a default of a kind specified in section b,under such security agreement,lease,or conditional sale contract 
i that occurs before the date of the order is cured before the expiration of such period and 
ii that occurs after the date of the order is cured before the later of 
i the date that is days after the date of the default or 
ii the expiration of such period.
we have explained the purpose of in the context of another airline bankruptcy 
section was designed in part to increase availability of capital to the transportation industry.toward this end,renders automatic stay effective for only days following the filing of the petition in bankruptcy.after that time,the lessor is free to repossess the aircraft in the event of breach by the debtor unless,within those days,the debtor enters into what is referred to as a agreement.if a agreement is executed,which requires court approval but not the lessor consent,the automatic stay remains in effect.in return for this protection,the debtor or its trustee must perform all obligations of the debtor that become due on or after such date on which the agreement is entered into under such lease and cure any prior or future defaults.a.
in re trans world airlines,at citations omitted.thus,allows aircraft lessors to repossess their collateral sixty days after the filing of the debtor bankruptcy petition.in the alternative,the debtor and the lessor may enter into a stipulation which allows the debtor to retain possession of the leased aircraft equipment by curing defaults and making the required lease payments.see,at,reprinted in,see also seidle gatx leasing,cir.
in this case,the period expired on november,and,thereafter,the cit group did not exercise its right to take possession of the aircraft equipment.following the expiration of the period,the debtor and the cit group negotiated the terms under which the debtor would be permitted to retain possession of the aircraft equipment.on january,the bankruptcy court entered an order approving the stipulation between the debtor and the cit group.pursuant to the stipulation,kiwi agreed to perform all of its obligations under the cit leases,as modified,going forward and to cure any and all and defaults.on july,the bankruptcy court entered an assumption order in which the court authorized the debtor to assume its leases with the cit group and assign them to kih in connection with the bankruptcy sale.the order provided that events of default existed under the cit leases and the stipulation,but that,notwithstanding the defaults,the cit group would accept payments from the debtor and kih in amounts set forth in a letter agreement in satisfaction of the requirements of.
the trustee contends that notwithstanding,the payments from the debtor to cit constituted preferential transfers of its property under.we disagree.we find instructive the eleventh circuit opinion in seidle gatx leasing,which addressed the relationship and tension between and.at.in seidle,with bankruptcy court approval,the debtor entered into a stipulation with a creditor from which it had purchased aircraft equipment.the stipulation provided that the debtor would cure defaults owing under a promissory note it executed when it bought the aircraft equipment and that the debtor would make payments going forward in order to retain possession of the aircraft equipment.see id.at.the bankruptcy court subsequently appointed two chapter to replace the debtor management,one of whom later resigned.see id.the trustees continued using the aircraft equipment,but did not make the payments required under the stipulation.after the creditor repossessed the aircraft equipment and obtained an administrative expense claim for amounts not paid by the trustees,one of the trustees filed a preference action against it,seeking to recover payments made by the debtor.see id.at.the eleventh circuit upheld the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant.see id.at.
the court reasoned that allowing the trustee to set aside the payments would undermine the protection that section provides for creditors.pursuant to the section stipulation,a creditor is entitled to unpaid payments,as defaults a trustee may not later thwart the effect of the statute by challenging the validity of these transfers as preferences.id.at.the court explained that the trustee could not satisfy b because the payments did not improve the creditor position under the distributive provisions of the bankruptcy code because,had it not received the payments,it would have received payment reflecting their amount when the bankruptcy court approved the stipulation.see id.
we agree with the seidle court that entry of a stipulation precludes the trustee from bringing a preference action against a creditor who received payments from the debtor for the same reason that precludes such a suit.in sum,the payments to all three of the defendants here are not recoverable as preferences because,had the creditors not received the payments,they would have received amounts reflecting those sums,in any event,when the bankruptcy court approved the cures of the assumed agreements.and,further,in the case of the cit group,both the order approving the stipulation and the assumption order preclude recovery by the trustee.
the preference 
in support of his claim that the payments made by the debtor in this case were preferential transfers,the trustee directs the court attention to the provisions of the term sheet,which he refers to as the preference.he asserts that the term sheet creates a fact issue as to whether he may recover under because it provides that all preference actions which were not settled at the time of the july,consent order would remain with the estate after the bankruptcy sale.the trustee asks the court to conclude that he may prosecute his actions against the defendants because they did not secure releases from preference liability at a time when similarly situated,prudent creditors did.in this regard,he argues that the bankruptcy court would not have ordered northwest airlines to pay in consideration for release from preference liability if all parties had been subject to automatic releases.additionally,the trustee notes that his reading of the term sheet is consistent with the creditors committee representation to the bankruptcy court,in its application for appointment of a trustee,that the committee had preserved avoidance actions for prosecution for the benefit of the estate.
we agree with the bankruptcy and district courts that,as a matter of law,the term sheet did not carve preference claims out of payments made on account of the assumed agreements.the bankruptcy court,which was familiar with the terms of the bankruptcy sale over which it had presided,read the term sheet,rather,as providing that avoidance actions,such as suits,would remain in the estate and would not be transferred to kih in the bankruptcy sale.in other words,the term sheet was read as carving preference claims out of the assets sold to kih,rather than as preserving the ability of a subsequently appointed trustee to carve them out of cure payments made on account of the assumed agreements.
in assessing the trustee reading of the term sheet,the bankruptcy court noted that defendants were not similarly situated to northwest airlines,the creditor who obtained a release from preference actions.the important distinction which the court relied upon in regard to the northwest release was that the debtor did not assume and assign to kih its agreements with northwest airlines,as it did its agreements with the defendants.rather,the consent order entered into by the debtor,kih,northwest airlines,and the creditors committee provides that northwest airlines will execute new agreements with kih.sabre app.at.based on this distinction,northwest airlines might have decided to secure a release in recognition that any payments it received from the debtor could give rise to colorable preference claims because they were not on account of assumed agreements.
after distinguishing northwest airlines situation from that of the defendants,the bankruptcy court reasoned that,in any event,the provisions of the term sheet could not invalidate the legal effect of the assumption of the debtor agreements with the defendants.the bankruptcy court based its reasoning on lco enterprises.in lco enterprises,the nint
