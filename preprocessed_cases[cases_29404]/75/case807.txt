we must decide whether federal law preempts a local ordinance regulating advertisements borne by aircraft.
skysign international,skysign,a hawaii corporation,was a provider of aerial advertising on the island of oahu.its helicopters carried lighted signs beneath their fuselages,bearing advertisements for skysign clients.
at all times relevant to this appeal,skysign operated under the authority of certificates of waiver issued by the federal aviation administration faa.federal regulations prohibit the operation of restricted category civil aircraft in certain locations o ver a densely populated area i n a congested airway or n ear a busy airport without a certificate of waiver from the faa.e.the faa issued skysign a certificate of waiver good for about nine months on january,and a subsequent certificate on august.
the two certificates waived the restrictions of e and permitted skysign to engage in night time aerial advertising.each certificate included a standardized note indicating this certificate constitutes a waiver of those federal rules or regulations specifically referred to above.each certificate also included a set of special provisions,provisions not a standard part of the waiver form.the lists of special provisions differed slightly,but each included the following language the operator,by exercising the privilege of this waiver,understands all local laws and ordinances relating to aerial signs,and accepts responsibility for all actions and consequences associated with such operations.
the city and county of honolulu,hawaii,bars by municipal ordinance various types of signage,including a ny sign which advertises or publicizes an activity not conducted on the premises on which the sign is maintained,a ny portable sign,and a ny flashing sign.honolulu,ordinances b,c,e supp honolulu also bars the use of aircraft to display any sign or advertising device.id.
in both and,when considering amendments to the latter ordinance,honolulu sought the faa advice as to whether the ordinance was or would be preempted by federal law.in both cases,the faa regional counsel replied that in his agency view,because of the pervasive federal regulation of navigable airspace,any local attempt to restrict the way in which aircraft operate within that airspace would be.
in july,skysign ran afoul of the honolulu ordinances for the first time.it received a citation charging it with violating,the signage ordinance,and assessing a civil fine of,the statutorily prescribed amount for a first violation.it did not pay the fine,continued to operate,and subsequently received two further citations,each assessing a fine of.
skysign appealed only the first citation to honolulu zoning board of appeals zba,but disputed the zba jurisdiction over the issue,citing the waiver issued by the faa.the zba upheld the validity of the citation and fine but did not decide the federal preemption issue.skysign did not appeal the zba judgment to the state circuit court.rather,it filed a complaint in the district court for the district of hawaii,seeking a declaration that federal law preempted honolulu from seeking to regulate navigable airspace,an injunction barring the enforcement of any local ordinance to the contrary,and damages on various causes of action under hawaii law.
the district court granted honolulu motion to dismiss the federal claims on the ground that no case or controversy existed.by that time,skysign business was no longer operating,and the court held that skysign could point to no likelihood of future injury.the court held in the alternative that even if a live controversy existed,the ordinances were not preempted,because the references to local law in skysign certificates of waiver meant that there was no conflict between federal and state regulation.having disposed of the federal questions,the district court accordingly declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims and dismissed them without prejudice.
skysign filed this timely appeal.
we must first address the jurisdictional question of whether a live case or controversy exists.an action for a declaratory judgment is live,not moot,if the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.pub.utils.comm ferc,cir quoting.cas.pac.coal oil.internal quotation marks omitted.honolulu contended,and the district court held,that this dispute lacked the requisite immediacy because skysign has ceased operation.
we note as an initial matter that the district court and the parties appear to have conflated the question of redressability,a component of initial standing to sue,with the doctrine of mootness,the requirement that the controversy remain live even after the plaintiff demonstrates initial standing.as the supreme court has noted,these two inquiries are quite similar the doctrine of mootness has even been called the doctrine of standing set in a time frame.parole comm geraghty,d quoting henry paul monaghan,constitutional adjudication the who and when,yale,internal quotation marks omitted.however,as the supreme court recently noted,the distinction,though subtle,is an important one,in part because mootness admits of certain exceptions that standing does not.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.in this case,skysign appears to have ceased its helicopter operations in the early stages of its dispute with honolulu,such that the relevant inquiry is into standing and,specifically,the redressability component.
undertaking that inquiry,we conclude that skysign has alleged facts sufficient to support federal jurisdiction.skysign personally would benefit from the court intervention,warth seldin,d,in at least two ways.first,skysign complaint fairly can be read to allege that the challenged ordinance itself is what caused it to cease operations,and that the removal of that obstacle would put it back in business.city of erie pap,d simply closing kandyland is not sufficient to render this case moot pap is still incorporated under pennsylvania law,and it could again decide to operate a nude dancing establishment in erie.further,honolulu can not collect the in outstanding fines if the ordinance under which it assessed them is preempted by federal law.although the district court correctly noted that the assessed fines are for skysign past conduct,that distinction does not in and of itself deprive a federal court of jurisdiction to hear a declaratory judgment action challenging the enforceability of the law under which the penalty is assessed.see,edgar mite,d.we thus conclude that skysign had standing to bring this action and,for the same reasons,that the case has not become moot.we therefore have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.
honolulu argues that skysign is precluded from bringing this action because the zba decision was a final and binding decision on the merits entitled to preclusive effect.although the zba expressly declined to address the preemption issue and reserved it for the courts,honolulu contends that skysign failure to appeal the zba decision to the state circuit court pursuant to.rendered the decision final as to all issues that skysign could have pursued on appeal,including the preemption question.
federal courts must accord a state court judgment the same preclusive effect that the judgment would receive in the rendering state courts.this rule extends to state administrative adjudications of legal and factual issue.misischia pirie,cir.hawaii state courts accord preclusive effect to the findings of administrative agencies if the issue decided in the prior action is identical to the issue in the current action,a final judgment on the merits was issued,and the parties in the current action are the same or in privity with the parties in the prior action.see santos state of hawaii,dep t of,haw.
because the first of these three requirements is not met,we reject honolulu contention that skysign claim is precluded.in this action skysign seeks a determination only of whether the federal government,through comprehensive regul
