procedural history facts 
the essential facts are undisputed.because we agree with its analysis,we rely substantially on the trial court written opinion,which is essentially a statement of decision.
the presidio parkway project project involves the replacement of the existing southern approach to the golden gate bridge,known as doyle drive,with a new parkway.doyle drive is part of a state highway,state route.the trial court found that the current doyle drive approach,which is years old,does not meet current highway standards and is seismically deficient.
the project began in with a feasibility study conducted by the san francisco county transportation authority sfcta pursuant to a memorandum of understanding mou with caltrans,which provided funding along with oversight,reviews and approvals.
sfcta and caltrans entered into a series of cooperative agreements in,and regarding phase i of the project.these agreements gave sfcta a lead role in the project,but also gave caltrans a substantial degree of oversight and control over the development of the project.while sfcta was the lead agency for preliminary project development design and environmental studies,the resulting documents had to be submitted to caltrans for its review and concurrence and its ongoing review.caltrans retained the right to monitor and participate in the selection of personnel and was to provide quality assurance.the trial court found that t hese general terms in varying degrees of detail may be found in all of the various cooperative agreements by which sfcta and caltrans proceeded with the planning and implementation of phase i of the project.
preliminary design,engineering and environmental documents that were necessary precursors to the beginning of construction were completed in.phase i of the project includes part of the permanent facility and a detour to accommodate traffic during phase ii.phase i construction was underway at the time of trial below under the set of existing contracts.
in,the legislature amended section to greatly expand the statutory authorization of for state highway transportation projects.bill.as the trial court found,the amendments deleted previous limitations on the number and type of transportation projects eligible to be.the amendments expanded the purpose of to include projects primarily designed to achieve improved mobility,improved operations or safety,and quantifiable air quality standards.stats,ch,west cal.legis.service.
specifically,section,subdivision c provides,in pertinent part the projects authorized pursuant to this section shall be primarily designed to achieve the following performance objectives a improve mobility by improving travel times or reducing the number of vehicle hours of delay in the affected corridor.b improve the operation or safety of the affected corridor.c provide quantifiable air quality benefits for the region in which the project is located.
as the trial court also found,the amendments authorized caltrans to enter into an unlimited number of without legislative approval provided that any proposed be released for public comment at a hearing and thereafter be submitted to the legislature and the newly established public infrastructure advisory commission piac for comment at least sixty days before execution,subd.c.
the amendments included new section,subdivision f a notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,for projects on the state highway system,caltrans is the responsible agency for the performance of project development services,including performance specifications,preliminary engineering,prebid services,the preparation of project reports and environmental documents,and construction inspection services.caltrans is also the responsible agency for the preparation of documents that may include,but need not be limited to,the size,type,and desired design character of the project,performance specifications covering the quality of materials,equipment,and workmanship,preliminary plans,and any other information deemed necessary to describe adequately the needs of caltrans or regional transportation agency.
caltrans began to implement phase ii of the project as a,contemplating that the construction of the remainder of the project and the maintenance of the facility would be the responsibility of the private contractor which entered into the agreement with caltrans and sfcta.caltrans and sfcta entered into a new cooperative agreement that provided responsibility to caltrans for project development services under section,subdivision f a.the parties agreed that caltrans would be the implementing agency for the project with responsibility for developing and implementing technical specifications and procurement procedures,including directing and controlling the work of any consultants hired by sfcta.
on may,the california transportation commission approved the project as a pursuant to section,subdivision c.on october,caltrans announced it would award the contract for the project to golden link partner on october,caltrans released the final agreement on its website.on october,there was a public hearing.on october,the agreement was submitted to the legislature and to piac for review and comment,pursuant to section,subdivision c.the piac and certain legislators provided comments to caltrans.
the agreement would make the private contractor the lessee of the project for the term of the agreement.
on november,plaintiffs filed a complaint challenging further implementation of phase ii of the project as a,on the ground that the project violates section.plaintiffs filed a combined petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.after a hearing,the trial court denied plaintiffs relief in a detailed written order.the court then entered a judgment dismissing the complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief and denying the petition for writ of mandate.
we have expedited plaintiffs appeal because,as the trial court noted,any delay in the implementation of phase ii delays the entire project.furthermore,caltrans has negotiated rights of entry onto the federal land surrounding the project and those rights expire in.the agreement has a number of deadlines to keep the project on track for completion before the entry rights expire.
ii.discussion 
plaintiffs raise three challenges to the project,claiming it does not qualify as a.all of the challenges involve questions of statutory interpretation.
