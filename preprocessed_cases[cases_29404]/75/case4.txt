alabama imposes sales and use taxes on railroads when they purchase or consume diesel fuel,but exempts from those taxes trucking transport companies motor carriers and companies that transport goods interstate through navigable waters water carriers,both railroad competitors.motor carriers pay an alternative tax on diesel,but water carriers pay neither the sales tax nor the excise tax.respondent csx,an interstate rail carrier that operates in alabama,sought to enjoin state officers from collecting sales tax on its diesel fuel purchases,claiming that the state asymmetrical tax treatment discriminates against a rail carrier in violation of the railroad revitalization and regulation reform act of,or act,b.this court held that a tax discriminates under subsection b when it treats groups that are similarly situated differently without sufficient justification for the difference in treatment,csx transp.of revenue,csx i.on remand,the district court rejected csx claim.reversing,the eleventh circuit held that csx could establish discrimination by showing that alabama taxed rail carriers differently than their competitors,but rejected alabama argument that imposing a tax on motor carriers,but not rail carriers,justified imposing the sales tax on rail carriers,but not motor carriers.
the eleventh circuit properly concluded that csx competitors are an appropriate comparison class for its subsection b claim.
all general and commercial taxpayers may be an appropriate comparison class for a subsection b claim,but it is not the only one.nothing in the ordinary meaning of the word discrimination suggests that it occurs only when the victim is singled out relative to the population at large.context confirms this reading.the act is an asymmetrical statute.csx i,supra,at.in subsections b to b which specify prohibitions directed toward property taxes the comparison class is limited to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.but subsection b contains no such limitation,so the comparison class is to be determined based on the theory of discrimination alleged in the claim.thus,when a railroad alleges that a tax disadvantages it compared to its transportation industry competitors,its competitors in that jurisdiction are the comparison class.because subsection b requires a showing of discrimination,however,the comparison class must consist of individuals similarly situated to the claimant.
subsection b would be deprived of all effect if similarly situated were given the same narrow construction the concept has in the equal protection clause context,where it would be permissible for a state to tax a rail carrier more than a motor carrier,despite their seemingly similar lines of business.the category of similarly situated b comparison classes must at least include the commercial and industrial taxpayers specified in the other subsections.but it also can include a railroad competitors.discrimination in favor of that class both falls within the ordinary meaning of discrimination and frustrates the act purpose of restor ing the financial stability of the nation railway system while foster ing competition among all carriers by railroad and other modes of transportation,stat.contrary to alabama argument,normal rules of interpretation would say that the explicit limitation to commercial and industrial in the first three provisions,and its absence in the fourth,suggests that no such limitation applies to the fourth.alabama additional arguments are also unavailing.
the eleventh circuit erred in refusing to consider whether alabama could justify its decision to exempt motor carriers from its sales and use taxes through its decision to subject motor carriers to a tax.it does not accord with ordinary english usage to say that a tax discriminates against a rail carrier if a rival who is exempt from that tax must pay another comparable tax from which the rail carrier is exempt,since both competitors could then claim to be discriminated against relative to each other.the court negative commerce clause cases endorse the proposition that an additional tax on third parties may justify an otherwise discriminatory tax.gregg dyeing query.similarly,an alternative,roughly equivalent tax is one possible justification that renders a tax disparity.csx counterarguments are rejected.on remand,the eleventh circuit is to consider whether alabama tax is the rough equivalent of alabama sales tax as applied to diesel fuel,and therefore justifies the motor carrier exemption.although the state can not offer a similar defense with respect to its water carrier exemption,the court should also examine whether any of the state alternative rationales justify that exemption.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
federal law prohibits states from imposing taxes that discriminat e against a rail carrier.b.we are asked to decide whether a state violates this prohibition by taxing diesel fuel purchases made by a rail carrier while exempting similar purchases made by its competitors and if so,whether the violation is eliminated when other tax provisions offset the challenged treatment of railroads.
alabama taxes businesses and individuals for the purchase or use of personal property.code,a.alabama law sets the general tax rate at of the value of the property purchased or used.ibid.
the state applies the tax,at the usual rate,to railroads purchase or use of diesel fuel for their rail operations.but it exempts from the tax purchases and uses of diesel fuel made by trucking transport companies whom we will call motor carriers and companies that transport goods interstate through navigable waters water carriers.motor carriers instead pay a tax on diesel water carriers pay neither the sales nor tax on their diesel.a,and b a cum.supp.the parties stipulate that rail carriers,motor carriers,and water carriers compete.
respondent csx transportation,a rail carrier operating in alabama and other states,believes this asymmetrical tax treatment discriminates against a rail carrier in violation of the alliterative railroad revitalization and regulation reform act of,or act.b.it sought to enjoin petitioners,the alabama department of revenue and its commissioner alabama or state,from collecting sales tax on its diesel fuel purchases.
at first,the district court and eleventh circuit both rejected csx complaint.csx,alabama of revenue,fed.appx.on this lawsuit first trip here,we reversed.we rejected the state argument that tax exemptions can not discriminate within the meaning of subsection b,and remanded the case for further proceedings.csx,alabama of revenue,csx i.
on remand,the district court rejected csx claim after a trial.supp.nd.the eleventh circuit reversed.it held that,on csx challenge,csx could establish discrimination by showing the state taxed rail carriers differently than their competitors which,by stipulation,included motor carriers and water carriers.but it rejected alabama argument that the taxes offset the sales taxes in other words,that because it imposed its tax on motor carriers,but not rail carriers,it was justified in imposing the sales tax on rail carriers,but not motor carriers.ibid.
we granted certiorari to resolve whether the eleventh circuit properly regarded csx competitors as an appropriate comparison class for its subsection b claim.we also directed the parties to address whether,when resolving a claim of unlawful tax discrimination,a court should consider aspects of a state tax scheme apart from the challenged provision.ibid.
the act provides 
b the following acts unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce,and a state,subdivision of a state,or authority acting for a state or subdivision of a state may not do any of them 
assess rail transportation property at a value that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the rail transportation property than the ratio that the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction has to the true market value of the other commercial and industrial property.
levy or collect a tax that may not be made under paragraph of this subsection.
levy or collect an ad valorem property tax at a tax rate that exceeds the tax rate applicable to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.
impose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the board under this part.b.
in our last opinion in this case,we held that discriminates in subsection b carries its ordinary meaning,and that a tax discriminates under subsection b when it treats groups that are similarly situated differently without sufficient justification for the difference in treatment.csx i,supra,at.here,we address the meaning of these two quoted phrases.
the first question in this case is who is the comparison class for purposes of a subsection b claim.alabama argues that the only appropriate comparison class for a subsection b claim is all general commercial and industrial taxpayers.we disagree.while all general and commercial taxpayers is an appropriate comparison class,it is not the only one.
nothing in the ordinary meaning of the word discrimination suggests that it occurs only when the victim is singled out relative to the population at large.if,for example,a state offers free college education to all returning combat veterans,but arbitrarily excepts those who served in the marines,we would say that marines have experienced discrimination.that would remain the case even though the marines are treated the same way as members of the general public,who have to pay for their education.
context confirms that the comparison class for subsection b is not limited as alabama suggests.the act is an asymmetrical statute.at.subsections b to b contain three specific prohibitions directed towards property taxes.each requires comparison of railroad property to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.the act therefore limits the comparison class for challenges under those provisions.even if the jurisdiction treats railroads less favorably than residential property,no violation of these subsections has occurred.subsection b contains no such limitation,leaving the comparison class to be determined as it is normally determined with respect to discrimination claims.and we think that depends on the theory of discrimination alleged in the claim.when a railroad alleges that a tax targets it for worse treatment than local businesses,all other commercial and industrial taxpayers are the comparison class.when a railroad alleges that a tax disadvantages it compared to its competitors in the transportation industry,the railroad competitors in that jurisdiction are the comparison class.
so,picking a comparison class is extraordinarily easy.unlike under subsections b,the railroad is not limited to all commercial and industrial taxpayers all the world,or at least all the world within the taxing jurisdiction,is its oyster.but that is not as generous a concession as might seem.what subsection b requires,and subsections b do not,is a showing of discrimination of a failure to treat similarly situated persons alike.a comparison class will thus support a discrimination claim only if it consists of individuals similarly situated to the claimant.
that raises the question of when a proposed comparison class qualifies as similarly situated.in the equal protection clause context,very few taxpayers are regarded as similarly situated and thus entitled to equal treatment.there,a state may tax different lines of businesses differently with,even if they are apparently similar.we have upheld or approved of distinctions between utilities including a railroad and other corporations,new york rapid transit city of new york,between wholesalers and retailers in goods,caskey baking virginia,between chain retail stores and independent retail stores,state bd.of tax comm rs of jackson,between anthracite coal mines and bituminous coal mines,heisler thomas colliery,and between sellers of coal oil and sellers of coal,southwestern oil texas.as one treatise has observed,we recognize a wide latitude state legislatures enjoy in drawing tax classifications under the equal protection clause.hellerstein hellerstein,state taxation,ed.this includes the power to impose widely different taxes on various trades or professions.at to.it would be permissible as far as the equal protection clause is concerned for a state to tax a rail carrier more than a motor carrier,despite the seeming similarity in their lines of business.
the concept of similarly situated individuals can not be so narrow here.that would deprive subsection b of all effect,providing protection that the equal protection clause already provides.moreover,the category of similarly situated b comparison classes must include commercial and industrial taxpayers.there is no conceivable reason why the statute would forbid property taxes higher than what that class enjoys or suffers,but permit other taxes that discriminate in favor of that class railroads.and we think the competitors of railroads can be another similarly situated comparison class,since discrimination in favor of that class most obviously frustrates the purpose of the act,which was to restore the financial stability of the railway system of the united states,a,stat,while foster ing competition among all carriers by railroad and other modes of transportation,b.we need not,and thus do not,express any opinion on what other comparison classes may qualify.sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
alabama claims that because subsections b and b and b through reference to b establish a comparison class of commercial and industrial property,subsection b must establish a comparison class of general commercial and industrial taxpayers.this inverts normal rules of interpretation,which would say that the explicit limitation to commercial and industrial in the first three provisions,and the absence of such a limitation in the fourth,suggests that no such limitation applies to the fourth.moreover,alabama interpretation would require us to dragoon the modifier commercial and industrial but not the noun property from the first three provisions,append general in front of it and taxpayers after,both words foreign to the preceding subsections.we might also have to strip away the restrictions in the definition of commercial and industrial property,which excludes land primarily used for agricultural purposes and timber growing.a.this is not our concept of fidelity to a statute text.
alabama responds that the introductory clause of b which declares that the following acts unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce,binds its four subsections together,brief for petitioners emphasis deleted,and gives them a common object and scope.the last time this case appeared before us,alabama made a similar argument in support of the claim that,because subsections b cover only property taxes,so too does subsection b.see brief for respondents in csx,alabama of revenue.we rejected this argument then,and we reject it again now.
alabama persists that a inquiry allows a railroad to its comparison class,brief for petitioners,which would be unfair a windfall to railroads.ibid.as we have described above,picking a class is easy,but it is not easy to establish that the selected class is similarly situated for purposes of discrimination in taxation.the eleventh circuit properly concluded that,in light of csx transportation complaint and the parties stipulation,a comparison class of competitors consisting of motor carriers and water carriers was appropriate,and differential treatment that class would constitute discrimination.we therefore turn to the court refusal to consider alabama alternative tax justifications.
a state tax discriminates only where the state can not sufficiently justify differences in treatment between similarly situated taxpayers.as we have discussed above,a rail carrier and its competitors can be considered similarly situated for purposes of this provision.but what about the claim that those competitors are subject to other taxes that the railroads avoid we think alabama can justify its decision to exempt motor carriers from its sales and use tax through its decision to subject motor carriers to a tax.
it does not accord with ordinary english usage to say that a tax discriminates against a rail carrier if a rival who is exempt from that tax must pay another comparable tax from which the rail carrier is exempt.if that were true,both competitors could claim to be disfavored discriminated against relative to each other.our negative commerce clause cases endorse the proposition that an additional tax on third parties may justify an otherwise discriminatory tax.gregg dyeing query.we think that an alternative,roughly equivalent tax is one possible justification that renders a tax disparity nondiscriminatory.
csx claims that because the statutory prohibition forbids impos ing another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier,b tax in the singular the appropriate inquiry is whether the challenged tax discriminates,not whether the tax code as a whole does so.it is undoubtedly correct that the tax singular must discriminate but it does not discriminate unless it treats railroads differently from other similarly situated taxpayers without sufficient justification.a comparable tax levied on a competitor may justify not extending that competitor exemption from a general tax to a railroad.it is easy to display the error of csx approach.under that model,the following tax would violate the act all railroads shall pay a sales tax.all other individuals shall also pay a sales tax.
csx would undoubtedly object that not every case will be so easy,and that federal courts are ill qualified to explore the vagaries of state tax law.we are inclined to agree,but that can not carry the day.congress assigned this task to the courts by drafting an antidiscrimination command in such sweeping terms.there is simply no discrimination when there are roughly comparable taxes.if the task of determining when that is so is sisyphean,as the eleventh circuit called it,at,it is a sisyphean task that the statute imposes.we therefore can not approve of the eleventh circuit refusal to consider alabama justification,and remand for that court to consider whether alabama tax is the rough equivalent of alabama sales tax as applied to diesel fuel,and therefore justifies the motor carrier exemption.
while the state argues that the existence of a tax justifies its decision to exempt motor carriers from the sales and use tax,it can not offer a similar defense with respect to its exemption for water carriers.water carriers pay neither tax.
the state,however,offers other justifications for the water carrier exemption for example,that such an exemption is compelled by federal law.the eleventh circuit failed to examine these justifications,asserting that the water carriers were the beneficiaries of a discriminatory tax regime.we do not consider whether alabama alternative rationales justify its exemption,but leave that question for the eleventh circuit on remand.
the judgment of the eleventh circuit is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice thomas,with whom justice ginsburg joins,dissenting.
in order to violate b,a tax exemption scheme must target or single out railroads by comparison to general commercial and industrial taxpayers.csx,alabama of revenue csx i,thomas,dissenting.because csx can not prove facts that would satisfy that standard,i would reverse the judgment below and remand for the entry of judgment in favor of the alabama department of revenue.
last time this case was before the court,i explained in detail my reasons for interpreting another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier in b to refer to a tax that targets or singles out railroads as compared to other commercial and industrial taxpayers.at.i briefly summarize that reasoning here.
because the meaning of discriminates is ambiguous at first glance,i look to the term context to resolve this uncertainty,at.both the structure and background of the statute indicate that subsection b prohibits only taxes that single out railroads as compared to other commercial and industrial taxpayers.
subsection b is a residual clause,the meaning of which is best understood by reference to the provisions that precede it.subsection b begins by announcing that t he following acts discriminate against interstate commerce and are prohibited.b.subsections b through then list three actions that single out rail carriers by treating rail property differently from all other commercial and industrial property.b,at.subsections b and b explicitly identify commercial and industrial property as the comparison class,and subsection b incorporates that comparison class by reference.b,at.subsection b refers back to these provisions when it forbids i mpos ing another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.b emphasis added,at.the statutory structure therefore supports the conclusion that a tax discriminates against a rail carrier within the meaning of subsection b if it singles out railroads for unfavorable treatment as compared to the general class of commercial and industrial taxpayers,at.
the statutory background supports the same conclusion.when congress enacted the act,it was apparent that railroads were easy prey for state and local tax assessors in that they are nonvoting,often nonresident,targets for local taxation,who can not easily remove themselves from the locality.at internal quotation marks omitted.subsections b through thus establish a political check by preventing states from imposing excessive property taxes on railroads without imposing the same taxes more generally on voting,resident local businesses.ibid.subsection b is best understood as addressing the same problem in the same way,at.
alabama tax scheme can not be said to discriminat e against a rail carrier.at.to begin,the scheme does not single out rail carriers.although one would not know it from the majority opinion,the tax is not directed at rail carriers,their property,their activity,or goods uniquely consumed by them.it is instead a generally applicable sales tax.it applies with other exemptions not at issue here to all goods purchased,used,or stored in the state of alabama.code,a.the only relevant good exempted from the tax is diesel on which the motor fuel tax has been paid,b,and no provision of law prevents rail carriers from buying such diesel.see brief for respondent,acknowledging that csx pays the motor fuel tax on the diesel fuel it uses in trucks and other vehicles.water carriers,it is true,enjoy a special from this sales tax,a cum.supp,but that exemption singles out water carriers,not rail carriers.
even if this constellation of exemptions to alabama sales tax could be said to single out rail carriers from the general class of their interstate competitors,the tax surely does not single out rail carriers as compared to commercial and industrial taxpayers.those taxpayers are subject to exactly the same generally applicable sales and use tax regime as are rail carriers.
the court started off on the wrong track in csx i when it relied on a generic dictionary definition of discriminates in the face of a statutory context suggesting a more specific definition.see,at.today decision continues that error.
the court uncritically accepts the conclusion that the discriminat ion ad
