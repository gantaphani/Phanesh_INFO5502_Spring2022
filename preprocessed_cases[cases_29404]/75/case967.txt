in order to ensure highway safety and protect driver health,congress has charged the federal motor carrier safety administration with regulating the hours of commercial motor vehicle operators.in,the agency promulgated a final rule revising its existing regulations in a number of respects.two led by public citizen and the other by the independent drivers seek review of the portion of the rule that applies to truck drivers.
we reject the challenges raised by the,but grant the petition filed by public citizen.we conclude that the agency violated the administrative procedure act because it failed to give interested parties an opportunity to comment on the methodology of the model that the agency used to justify an increase in the maximum number of daily and weekly hours that truck drivers may drive and work.we also find that the agency failed to provide an explanation for critical elements of that methodology.
this is the second time this court has considered a challenge to the federal motor carrier safety administration attempt to modify its regulations.much of the relevant background is set forth in our opinion in public citizen fmcsa,which vacated a prior iteration of the rule now before us.we first review that background and then describe the development of the current rule.
the federal government has regulated the hours of service hos of commercial motor vehicle operators since the late,when the interstate commerce commission icc promulgated the first hos regulations under the authority of the motor carrier act of.see b authorizing the prescription of maximum hours of service for motor carrier employees.jurisdiction over hos regulations passed from the icc to the federal highway administration fhwa in,and then to the newly created federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa in.along the way,congress added to the statutory basis for the hos regulations.the current rule was promulgated under the authority of both the motor carrier act of and the motor carrier safety act of,which,as amended,directs the secretary of transportation to prescribe regulations on commercial motor vehicle safety,a,and provides that a t a minimum,the regulations shall ensure that 
commercial motor vehicles are maintained,equipped,loaded,and operated safely the responsibilities imposed on operators of commercial motor vehicles do not impair their ability to operate the vehicles safely the physical condition of operators is adequate to enable them to operate the vehicles safely and the operation of commercial motor vehicles does not have a deleterious effect on the physical condition of the operators.
id.in addition,fmcsa is required to consider the assignment and maintenance of safety as the highest priority,id.b,and to consider the costs and benefits of its safety regulations,id.d see id.c a.
between and,the hos regulations applicable to truck drivers remained largely unchanged.five aspects of the regulations are relevant to the petitions before us 
the daily driving limit.drivers were not allowed to drive for more than a total of hours without taking a required period.a superseded.
the daily limit.even if they had not reached the driving limit,drivers could not drive after they had been on duty for hours.id.a.drivers could,however,take periodic breaks during the day,thus extending the on duty period beyond fifteen hours.public citizen,at.
the daily requirement.in order to restart the driving limit and the limit,drivers were required to take at least consecutive hours off duty.a superseded.
the exception.the regulations contained an exception to the requirement for drivers who took their time in a sleeper berth,a compartment in the cabin of a truck with space for a driver to rest.drivers could accumulate their required hours of time in two separate periods in a sleeper berth as long as each was at least hours long.id.g.
the weekly limit.drivers were not allowed to drive after having been on duty for hours in the past days.id.b 
all of these requirements were limits on the time drivers could work and still drive so far as the rules went,drivers who worked more than the daily or weekly limits could still work as long as they did not drive.public citizen,at.
in the icc termination act of,congress directed the fhwa to revise these regulations by conducting a rulemaking dealing with a variety of issues pertaining to commercial motor vehicle safety.note.congress specifically instructed the agency to address the following issues 
hours of continuous sleep after hours of driving,loading and unloading operations,automated and recording devices,rest and recovery cycles,fatigue and stress in longer combination vehicles,fitness for duty,and other appropriate regulatory and enforcement countermeasures for reducing incidents and increasing driver alertness.
id.fhwa issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anprm in.see.jurisdiction over the hos regulations then passed to fmcsa,which issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm in.see.may,nprm.the nprm explained that t here is general consensus that modifications to current hos regulations would substantially improve commercial motor vehicle cmv safety by reducing the fatigue factor in crashes.id.at.
in the nprm,the agency made a number of specific findings that identified shortcomings in the hos regulations.first,fmcsa found that people are much more alert and have better reaction times when they are on regular,circadian schedules.public citizen,at see also nprm.at.the regulations allowed drivers to alternate between driving shifts and periods,creating the potential for a backward rotating schedule in which they started each day six hours earlier than the one before.second,the agency concluded that e ach driver should have an opportunity for eight consecutive hours of uninterrupted sleep every day.nprm.at.in the agency view,the old regulations period was too short to allow drivers to eat,commute,and conduct other personal activities while still getting enough sleep.see id.third,fmcsa concluded that drivers need weekly recovery periods to negate the effect of accumulated sleep deprivation and restore alertness.id.at.the old regulations contained no weekly requirement.finally,fmcsa found that performance degrades and crash risk increases markedly after the hour of any duty time during a work shift.id.at.the regulations permitted only hours of driving per shift,but allowed an operator to drive anytime up to his or her hour on duty,and to extend the window by taking breaks.
based on these findings,the nprm proposed significant changes to the existing hos regulations.instead of a daily driving limit and a daily limit,the nprm proposed allowing up to hours of working or driving time,and requiring an additional hours of time at some point during each shift.id.at tbl.the nprm also proposed increasing the daily requirement to consecutive hours and mandating a new weekly requirement of between and consecutive hours,with the required length depending on the amount of time needed to include two sleep periods between midnight and id.finally,the nprm proposed eliminating the exception for solo drivers.team work in teams and often use the sleeper berth to allow one driver to obtain the required time while the other continues to still use the exception,but each period of time in the sleeper berth would have to be at least hours up from hours under the old regulations.see id.at.
fmcsa issued a final rule in april.see hours of service of drivers,rule.as we explained in public citizen,the rule was still a significant revision to the old rules,but differed markedly from the nprm.at.the rule modified three of the five aspects of the regulations discussed above,and added a sixth 
the daily driving limit.the rule increased over the regulations the daily driving limit from hours to hours.see rule.at.
the daily limit.the rule reduced the daily limit from to hours and prohibited drivers from extending that limit by taking breaks during their shifts.see id.
the daily requirement.like the nprm,the rule increased the daily requirement from hours to hours.see id.
the exception.the rule abandoned the nprm proposed changes to the exception.instead,it preserved the same kind of exception that existed under the regulations a driver using a sleeper berth could satisfy the requirement in two separate periods as long as each of them was at least hours long.see id.at.
the weekly limit.the rule preserved the weekly limit,but created a new exception to this requirement,the restart provision.see id.at.
the restart provision.the rule allowed drivers to restart their weekly clocks whenever they took consecutive hours off duty.see id.this was a significant shift from the nprm instead of requiring a to period each week a change that would have decreased average hours worked,the rule permitted drivers to restart their limit anytime they took hours off duty.this change allowed drivers to work substantially longer hours per many as more hours over days.see public citizen,at.
a group of petitioners led by public citizen challenged the rule on a variety of grounds.we agreed with them that the rule was arbitrary and capricious because the agency failed to consider the impact of the rule on the health of drivers,a factor the agency must consider under its organic statute.id.at see a.because the agency ha d wholly failed to comply with this specific statutory requirement,we found this single objection from petitioners sufficient to establish an decision requiring vacatur of the rule.public citizen,at.
this disposition made it unnecessary for us to enter final judgment on public citizen other objections to the rule.id.we noted,however,that several of those objections also raise d troubling concerns about fmcsa decisionmaking process,and that the agency could consider the objections on remand.id.first,we expressed very real concerns about the increase in the daily driving limit from to hours.id.at.we noted that the agency freely concedes that studies show that performance begins to degrade after the hour on duty and the degradation increases geometrically during the and hours.id.at quoting rule.at.but d espite this finding,the agency cited absolutely no studies in support of its notion that the decrease in the daily tour of duty from fifteen to fourteen hours will compensate for the conceded and documented ill effects from the increase in driving time.id.
second,we also found suspect the agency claim that the increase in the daily driving limit to hours could be justified by the analysis it conducted.id.the model employed in that analysis,we noted,assume d,dubiously,that time spent driving is equally fatiguing as time spent is,that a driver who drives for ten hours has the same risk of crashing as a driver who has been resting for ten hours and then begins to drive.id.in other words,the model disregarded the effects of time on task,and thus understated the risks of driving hours.id.
third,o ur doubts extend ed as well to the agency justification for retaining the exception,which permitted solo and team drivers to obtain the necessary ten hours of time by splitting their rest in two periods of time spent in sleeper berths.id.at.public citizen argue d persuasively,we said,that the agency justification for retaining this exception was not rational in view of the conceded central premise of the hos regulations that e ach driver should have an opportunity for eight consecutive hours of uninterrupted sleep every day.id.quoting rule.at.
finally,we regarded as problematic the fact that fmcsa justification for the restart provision did not even acknowledge,much less justify,that the rule dramatically increases the maximum permissible hours drivers may work each week.id.at.that increase,we said,is likely an important aspect of the problem,a nd the agency failure to address it makes this aspect of the rule rationality questionable.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
after our july,decision in public citizen vacated the rule,fmcsa sought and received temporary relief from the vacatur in congress.the surface transportation extension act of,signed by the president on september,provided that the rule shall be in effect until the earlier of the effective date of a new final rule addressing the issues raised by public citizen or september,f,stat.
fmcsa issued a new nprm in january.see,nprm.the nprm used the rule as its proposal and sought comment on what changes to that rule,if any,were necessary to respond to the concerns raised by the court in public citizen.id.at.
in august,fmcsa promulgated the rule now under review.see hours of service of drivers,rule.with a single exception,the rule is identical to the rule.the rule preserves the daily driving limit,the daily limit,the daily requirement,the weekly limit,and the restart provision.see id.at.the only difference between the two rules is the exception.the the drivers using a sleeper berth to split their daily requirement into two periods as long as each period was at least hours long.the rule,by contrast,requires that one period consist of at least hours in the sleeper berth.the other period can be spent either in the sleeper berth or elsewhere and must be at least two hours long.see id.at.
although the rule was largely unchanged from the rule,fmcsa said that it had considered and addressed the concerns identified by this court in public citizen.as to driver health,the agency explained that it had conducted an extensive literature review to determine the effect of the rule on a variety of health issues,and concluded that the rule would either have no effect or yield a net improvement over the regulations.see id.at.
fmcsa also determined that the rule would improve highway safety by reducing accidents.first,it explained that the rule change to the exception would reduce driver fatigue.it cited evidence that sleep accumulated in short time blocks is less refreshing than sleep accumulated in one long time period,and studies indicating that drivers using the provision of the regulations were more likely to be involved in fatal accidents.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.second,fmcsa contended that the longer hours permitted by the restart provision would not be detrimental,pointing to evidence that a recovery period of consecutive hours is sufficient for recovery from moderate cumulative fatigue due to several days of limited sleep.id.at.
finally,fmcsa relied on a new analysis that it described in a regulatory impact analysis ria released along with the rule.see fmcsa,regulatory impact analysis and small business impact analysis for hours of service options ria.based on this analysis,fmcsa concluded that the economic costs to industry of rescinding the two provisions of the rule that this court had criticized in public increase over the regulations in the daily driving limit from hours to hours,and the addition of the restart the safety benefits that rescission would bring.see rule.at.as explained below,a key component of the analysis was an model that the agency used to analyze crash risks under different hos regimes.
public citizen petitioned for review of the rule,challenging the daily driving limit and the restart provision.the independent drivers association ooida also petitioned for review,challenging the provision that renders the daily limit nonextendable and the provision that modifies the exception.a group led by the california trucking association intervened in support of ooida.we consider public citizen challenge in part ii and ooida challenge in part iii.
we have jurisdiction to review the rule pursuant to a.our standard of review is governed by the administrative procedure act apa.see advocates for highway auto safety fmcsa,public citizen,at.under the apa,we must set the rule aside if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a,or if it was promulgated without observance of procedure required by law,id.d.
public citizen challenges the rule,and specifically its daily driving limit and restart provision,on four grounds.the petitioner contends that fmcsa violated the apa requirements for rulemaking by failing to disclose in time for comment the methodology of a model that was central to the agency justification for the rule when the methodology finally was disclosed,fmcsa failed to provide a reasoned explanation for some of its critical elements,thus rendering it and the rule arbitrary and capricious fmcsa treatment of a number of other safety considerations was also arbitrary and capricious and the rule is contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious because it fails to protect driver health.as explained below,we reach only the first two arguments.
public citizen first contention is that fmcsa violated the apa requirements for rulemaking by failing to disclose the methodology of the agency model,a analysis that was a central component of the justification for the rule.
the apa requires that an agency publish notice of proposed rulemaking,including either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved,b,and that it give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data,views,or arguments,id.c.as we have explained,i ntegral to these requirements is the agency duty to identify and make available technical studies and data that it has employed in reaching the decisions to propose particular rules an agency commits serious procedural error when it fails to reveal portions of the technical basis for a proposed rule in time to allow for meaningful commentary.solite epa,quoting connecticut light power nrc,see chamber of commerce sec,see also air transp.ass of am.faa,t he most critical factual material that is used to support the agency position on review must have been made public in the proceeding and exposed to refutation.quoting association of data processing serv.orgs.bd.of governors of the fed.reserve.
in order to assess the costs and benefits of alternative changes to the hos rules,fmcsa created a model for estimating the costs to industry of each option,as well as an model for calculating the crash risks under each option.the benefits of avoiding crashes were then monetized and incorporated into the analysis.the agency explained the models in the ria that it released along with the rule.see ria see also rule.at.fmcsa summarized its analysis as follows 
to produce a realistic measurement of the impacts of each option,we divided the industry into broad segments,collected information on operations within these segments,and then created a model of carrier operations 
the model was used to simulate carrier operations under different conditions and hos rules w eighted changes in productivity from this procedure were then used to estimate the cost increases imposed on the industry by each option 
safety impacts were measured by feeding the on duty and driving schedules from the carrier simulation model into an operator fatigue model to project driver effectiveness levels,and then using the fatigue model results to estimate the resulting changes in crash risks under each hos option changes in crash risks were then multiplied by the value of all affected crashes to yield estimates of total benefits.
many of the details of the models were unchanged from those used in the analysis of the rule.see fmcsa,regulatory impact analysis and small business analysis for hours of service options ria.in several important respects,however,fmcsa modified the model.in part,those modifications represented an effort to respond to criticisms this court leveled in our opinion vacating the rule.one of those criticisms was that the agency had excluded effects from the analysis.public citizen,at.the agency model had estimated a driver crash risk solely by reference to his or her sleep patterns,and thus assumed that time spent driving was no more fatiguing than time spent resting.id.we found the decision to ignore effects puzzling,because the agency admits that studies show that crash risk increases,in fmcsa words,geometrically,after the eighth hour on duty,and the agency does not deny that this geometric risk increase results at least in substantial part from effects.id.quoting rule.at.
in its analysis,fmcsa modified its model to account for effects.to do so,the agency commissioned a study of crash data from a national database known as trucks involved in fatal accidents tifa.see kenneth campbell,estimates of the prevalence and risk of fatigue in fatal crashes involving trucks from the tifa files tifa study.the database includes over accidents over the years.ria at.the tifa study generated what fmcsa referred to as the crash risk for each successive hour of driving.id.at.for each driving hour,the study calculated the percentage of all fatal truck crashes in which it was determined that the driver was fatigued at the time of the crash.this calculation yielded the risk that a crash will be for each of the first twelve hours of driving time,plus an aggregated figure for all driving in hour and beyond.the figures ranged from less than for hour,to for hour,to for hour,to for hour and beyond.id.at.as fmcsa observed,the risk of a crash in the hour of driving or later is notably higher than in the hour of driving.rule.at.
but in the ria that it released with the rule,fmcsa did not use the crash risk figures contained in the tifa study.instead,the agency plotted the aggregate figure for hour and beyond at hour,and then fit a cubic curve derived a regression equation for that and the other figures from the tifa study.ria at.the curve is reproduced in part below.like the tifa study,the curve estimated the actual percentage of crashes related to fatigue for each hour of driving.the curve figures,however,were different from those in the tifa study.see id.in particular,the percentage difference between the figures for the and hours was substantially smaller than in the tifa study.finally,fmcsa divided each of the hourly figures from the curve by the average risk for hours through,creating a risk increase relative to average driving hours.id.at.the resulting tot crash risk multipliers were then used in the model to determine the safety impact of different hos rules.id.
fmcsa used the model,along with the model,to determine the benefits and costs of four regulatory options.option was the rule.option was the rule.option was the same as option,but with a rather than daily driving limit,with a rather than restart provision,and without a exception.finally,option was the same as option,but with a restart provision.see rule.at ria at.fmcsa concluded that option the most of the options.see rule.at ria at.
in addition to examining these four options,fmcsa considered a variant of option,which differed only in that it imposed a as in the regulations rather than daily driving limit.applying the same models,the agency concluded that reducing the driving limit to hours was considerably less than the basic version of option.ria at see rule.at.
public citizen objects to fmcsa reliance on the model because fmcsa did not disclose inter alia the methodology by which it would derive multipliers until it published the late for interested parties to comment.because the multipliers were an integral part of the model,and because the output of that model was central to fmcsa decision to adopt the rule and particularly the daily driving limit and restart provision,the model and its methodology were unquestionably among the most critical factual material that was used to support the agency position.air transp.ass of,at citation and internal quotation mark omitted.the failure to provide an opportunity for comment on the model methodology therefore constitutes a violation of the apa requirements.see chamber of commerce,at finding a violation where materials suppl ied the basic assumptions used by the agency to establish the range of costs of complying with a rule conditions.
fmcsa contends that petitioners can hardly express surprise at the use of the model for assessing safety benefits,since that model is an update of the one used in the ria.fmcsa br.it is true that an agency does not violate the apa if its methodology remain s constant and new data is merely used to check or confirm prior assessments.solite,at see chamber of commerce,at stating that further notice and comment are not required when additional fact gathering merely supplements information in the rulemaking record without changing methodology.but fmcsa methodology did not remain constant.the model may have employed an update of the methodology disclosed in the ria,but the nature of the derivation of the multipliers,and even the use of entirely new.moreover,the addition of the element to the model was not a minor modification used to check or confirm prior analyses it constituted the agency response to an important defect in its previous methodology identified by this court in public citizen.see at.
although fmcsa concedes that the multipliers were nowhere to be found in the ria,it contends that our opinion in public citizen should have put interested parties on notice that the agency would have to adjust the model to account for effects.fmcsa br.this,too,misses the point.although interested parties may have known that fmcsa would incorporate effects into its model,they had no way of knowing that the agency would calculate the impact of time on task in the way that it did.in particular,there was no way for public citizen to foresee the following elements of the agency methodology,the import of which we discuss in part 
instead of using the figures from the tifa study to determine crash risk as a function of time on task hours driving,fmcsa fit the figures to a cubic curve.none of the studies in the rulemaking record derived such a curve.an earlier version of the tifa study,which was in the record,simply presented its risk figures for each directly from the crash form.see kenneth campbell michael belzer,hours of service regulatory evaluation analytical support tifa study.the same is true of the final tifa study,which was not released in time for comment.see tifa study at.
the agency drew its curve by plotting all of the data regarding crashes at hour and beyond at hour.the tifa studies,by contrast,aggregated all such data at hours.see final tifa study at tifa study at.
after deriving hourly estimates using its curve,fmcsa divided each of those figures by the average risk for the first hours.the tifa studies did not do so.see final tifa study at tifa study at.
the model did not take into account cumulative fatigue caused by the increased weekly driving and working hours permitted under the restart provision.
in light of these undisclosed elements,we can not say that the agency model was made public in the proceeding and exposed to refutation as required by the apa.air transp.ass of,at citation,internal quotation mark,and emphasis omitted.
finally,before we may vacate an agency action for failure to disclose supporting documents like the methodology of the model during the period,we must take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.to show that error was prejudicial,a petitioner must indicate with reasonable specificity what portions of the documents it objects to and how it might have responded if given the opportunity.gerber norton,internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,a petitioner must show that on remand it can mount a credible challenge and was thus prejudiced by the absence of an opportunity to do so before the agency.id.at quoting utility solid waste activities group epa.
we have no difficulty in concluding that the agency failure to disclose the methodology of the model in time for comment was prejudicial.the arguments that the petitioner has raised before this court amply demonstrate that it would have mounted a credible challenge had it been afforded an opportunity to do so.see chamber of commerce,at finding a sufficient showing of prejudice where the petitioner objections had creat ed enough uncertainty as to whether its comments would have had some effect if they had been considered citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we discuss those arguments in the following subpart.indeed,as we explain below,public citizen critique of the model persuades us not only that it was prejudiced by fmcsa failure to provide an opportunity for comment,but also that fmcsa failed to provide an adequate explanation for its decision to adopt the daily driving limit and the restart provision.
public citizen charges that when fmcsa finally disclosed its methodology in the ria that accompanied the rule,it failed to provide a reasoned explanation for a number of the methodology critical elements.to satisfy the apa arbitrary and capricious standard,an agency must articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d quoting burlington truck lines,united states,d.the agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner,id.at,and that explanation must be sufficient to enable us to conclude that the agency action was the product of reasoned decisionmaking,id.at.
public citizen notes that the tifa data,upon which fmcsa multipliers were ultimately based,indicates that the risk of involvement more than doubled from the hour to the.public citizen br.citing ria at.the actual multiplier for the eleventh hour used in fmcsa model,however,was only higher than the multiplier for the hour.id.at citing ria at.public citizen contends that the two steps fmcsa used to transform the tifa data into the multipliers were unexplained,and that they had the effect of improperly minimizing the crash risk associated with the hour of driving.
first,as explained above,instead of using the crash risk figures for each hour of driving that the tifa study had calculated directly from the actual crash data,fmcsa derived a cubic curve of crash risk as a function of time on task.to derive the curve,fmcsa first plotted the tifa figures for hours through,and then used an aggregate measure for hour and beyond.it did not,however,plot the figure at hour,but rather at hour.see ria at.as shown in the accompanying graph,the curve that fit those points yielded a crash risk at hour that was substantially below the figure that the tifa study had calculated directly from the actual crash data 
ria at.moreover,as public citizen points out,if the agency had plotted the figure for hours at hour rather than hour,the resulting curve would have produced a significantly higher estimate of the risk of a crash at hour figure close to that which the tifa study had calculated directly.see public citizen br,displaying alternative curve.
fmcsa decision to plot the data point for hour and beyond at hour of at hour or some other point was entirely unexplained in the ria and final rule.this complete lack of explanation for an important step in the agency analysis was arbitrary and capricious.when an agency uses a computer model,it must explain the assumptions and methodology used in preparing the model.air tour ass faa,quoting small refiner lead task force epa.although the agency brief defends the use of a cubic curve on the ground that the margin of error in the underlying tifa data was relatively large this again misses the point the issue is not whether a curve should have been used,but why the agency chose to draw the curve by plotting the hour data at hour.on that point,the brief is entirely silent 
second,after deriving an estimate of crash risk for each hour of driving using a cubic curve,fmcsa divided those figures by the average risk for hours through,creating an estimate of risk relative to average driving hours.ria at see id.at.public citizen objects that fmcsa gave no explanation for its decision to divide each hourly risk figure by the average for the first hours,and points out that the effect of this step was to diminish the increase d risk of driving in hour by dividing the heightened risk at the hour by an average that includes that heightened risk.public citizen br.we express no view on the validity of fmcsa statistical method,but we agree with public citizen agency offered no explanation for its decision during the rulemaking and failed even to respond to the petitioner argument in its brief.although we apply a deferential standard of review to an agency use of a statistical model,we can not uphold a rule based on such a model when an important aspect of its methodology was wholly unexplained.see air tour ass n,at holding that,when a model methodology is challenged,the agency must provide a complete analytic defense quoting small refiner lead task force,at internal quotation mark omitted 
public citizen further contends that the ria model also ignored cumulative fatigue from increased weekly driving and working hours allowed by the restart.public citizen br.in public citizen,we respect to the identical restart provision of the this increase in weekly hours was likely an important aspect of the problem,and that the agency failure to address it made the rule rationality questionable.at quoting state farm,at.indeed,in the nprm,fmcsa expressed concern about evidence that many drivers were exceeding the weekly limit of hours in days.see nprm.at.in particular,the agency was troubled by a study showing,inter alia,that t percent of drivers reported working at least hours in the last days.id.yet,as fmcsa acknowledges,the restart provision of the rule could allow another hours of driving time in a work week,compared to the limit of hours of driving time without the restart provision.rule.at.in light of these statements by the agency,public citizen argues that the model should have taken into account the increased crash risk caused by cumulative fatigue associated with the increased driving and working hours that it would permit.
fmcsa counsel responds with a single conclusory sentence denying that the agency ignored cumulative fatigue and citing three pages of the ria.see fmcsa br.citing ria at.the cited pages,however,address a different kind of cumulative fatigue the sleep deficit that accumulates with successive days.ria at.public citizen argument,which it pressed in the rulemaking,is that longer hours spent driving over the course of a few days have a effect that is independent of that caused by insufficient sleep.there is no indication that the model considered this kind of cumulative fatigue,and fmcsa offers no explanation for the omission.
of course,it could be that cumulative fatigue due to longer weekly service hours will not constitute a significant problem because,for example,the number of such hours will be minimal.indeed,in the final rule,fmcsa declared that it believes the average driver is not,and can not realistically,drive and work the longer weekly hours,on a regular basis,as described by some of the commenters.rule.at.but whatever the average driver will do on a regular basis,it is clear that fmcsa contemplates that many drivers will work those longer those hours are the basis for the agency conclusion that the restart provision will have economic benefits.see id.at ria at to.fmcsa concedes as much.see ria at m any drivers work and drive longer hours than the averages.id.at m ore than half of operations,and somewhat less than half of private fleet operations,are intensive enough to press the hos limits,and should therefore be affected by those limits.
in any event,fmcsa gave no explanation for the failure of its model to account for cumulative fatigue due to the increased weekly driving and working hours permitted by the restart provision.this court may not attempt itself to make up for such deficiencies we may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given.state farm,at.internal quotation marks omitted see sec chenery.accordingly,the agency failure of explanation renders the restart provision arbitrary and capricious.air tour ass n,at i n the absence of any reasonable justification for excluding aircraft from its noise model,we must conclude that this aspect of the faa methodology is arbitrary and capricious.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude both that fmcsa failed to provide an opportunity for comment on the methodology of its model,and that it failed to provide an explanation for the elements of that methodology that public citizen disputes.because the model is the basis for the analysis that led fmcsa to adopt the two provisions of the rule that public citizen increase in the daily driving limit from to hours,and the restart must vacate those provisions.and because those are the only provisions of the rule that public citizen challenges,we have no occasion to address the balance of its arguments.
we turn next to ooida petition,which challenges three aspects of the rule.first,ooida contends that fmcsa failed to deal with loading and unloading issues,as required by congress.second,ooida asserts that the daily limit is arbitrary and capricious,because fmcsa failed to consider its negative effects on driver health and safety.finally,the petitioner objects to the modification of the exception on several grounds.the following subparts address each of these challenges.
ooida first contention is that the rule is arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise contrary to law because fmcsa did not deal with the effects of loading and unloading operations on driver fatigue as required by congress.ooida br.this argument refers to congress instruction to the agency to conduct a rulemaking and issue a rule dealing with a variety of issues pertaining to commercial motor vehicle safety including loading and unloading operations.note.loading and unloading operations contribute to driver fatigue primarily by prolonging drivers hours.because most drivers are paid by the mile or by the load rather than by the hour,it costs a shipper or receiver nothing to keep drivers waiting to load or unload their vehicles.the resulting delays associated with loading and unloading can reduce the time available for sleep and require drivers to stay awake longer in order to finish their trips.
an agency acts arbitrarily if it ignores an issue that congress directs it to address.see public citizen,at.in this case,however,the record confirms that fmcsa complied with the congressional mandate by considering the implications of loading and unloading operations for the problem of driver fatigue.in fact,fmcsa adopted the daily limit,and eliminated the provision in the regulations that extended the daily limit when the driver took breaks,in part because of those concerns.as the agency explained 
under the rules,drivers were allowed a duty period but could extend their maximum duty period indefinitely by taking time during their workday.this perpetuated the problem of excessive waiting time for pick up and delivery of freight at shippers and receivers,because the drivers were expected to place themselves in status while waiting.
rule.at.under the rule,drivers can no longer extend their period by taking breaks while waiting to load or unload.fmcsa concluded that,as a consequence,the rule prevents shippers,receivers,and companies from abusing the hours and forcing drivers to use them as unpaid time.id.at.
in support of this conclusion,the agency reviewed comments from drivers and industry associations regarding how the limit was working in practice.it was instituted as part of the rule.fmcsa explained that t he general consensus among drivers was that their workday,on average,is shorter under the new rules.they no longer work days due to the consecutive requirement.see also id.the national industrial transportation league commented that operations at loading docks have been reconfigured to decrease dwell time and to expedite loading and unloading in order to minimize driver time not devoted to driving citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
we conclude that,by expressly considering issues pertaining to loading and unloading operations,and by reasonably identifying the nonextendable limit as responsive to those issues,the rule satisfied congress mandate to deal with this problem.although ooida may have preferred that fmcsa deal with the problem in a different manner,the statute does not mandate that the agency reach any particular substantive result.
ooida next contention is that fmcsa acted arbitrarily and capriciously by ignoring adverse health and safety effects of its decision to make the daily limit nonextendable through the use of breaks.specifically,ooida contends that this provision discourages drivers from taking short rest breaks and naps,because they can no longer exclude such breaks from their daily limit.ooida br.in support of this argument,ooida cites a study of its members i
