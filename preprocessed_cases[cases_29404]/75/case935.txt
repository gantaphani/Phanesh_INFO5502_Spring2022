the secretary of labor,acting through the mine safety and health administration,cited the national cement company of california for its failure to install guardrails along a private road leading to its cement plant.the question before us is whether msha has jurisdiction over the road.the answer depends on whether the road falls within the definition of mine in the federal mine safety and health act of mine act,b,stat,codified at h.we hold that the secretary view that it does is a reasonable interpretation of the statute and remand this matter for proceedings on the merits of the citation.
the mine act requires the secretary of labor to develop and promulgate mandatory safety and health standards for the nation mines.see.msha,acting on behalf of the secretary,ensures compliance with these standards by,among other things,conducting regular mine inspections and issuing citations to noncompliant mine operators.see id.a,a.a mine operator is any owner,lessee,or other person who operates,controls,or supervises a mine.id.d.a mine is defined as 
a an area of land from which minerals are extracted,b private ways and roads appurtenant to such area,and c lands,excavations,underground passageways,shafts,slopes,tunnels and workings,structures,facilities,equipment,machines,tools,or other property used in the work of extracting such minerals,or used in the milling of such minerals 
the federal mine safety and health review commission is an independent adjudicatory body that resolves disputes arising under the mine act.see id.mine operators may contest msha citations before a administrative law judge,id.d,and any person aggrieved by an alj decision is entitled to request commission review,id.d a.persons aggrieved by an order of the commission may obtain judicial review in an appropriate court of appeals.see id.a b.
the national cement company of california owns and operates a cement processing plant located on the southern portion of a ranch owned by tejon ranchcorp national cement occupies the land pursuant to a lease agreement that includes an easement to use an access road that runs miles north from state route to the cement plant.the access road is the only paved road that runs from the state highway to the plant.under the terms of the easement,only national cement,tejon,and persons authorized by the state of california may use the access road.signs posted at the entrance from the highway and along the initial segment of the road provide notice of this restriction.national cement has built a guardhouse and gate where the road ends at its facility.
most of the traffic along this access road is related to the cement plant.national cement customers,contractors,vendors,and employees use the road to travel to and from the plant,which operates continuously,and heavy trucks drive on the road day and night for more than round trips a year.but as one of the few paved roads on the ranch,the access road is also used on occasion by tejon and its associates for purposes unrelated to mining.the federal aviation administration uses the road to reach a communications tower,and the california department of water resources uses the road to maintain an aqueduct and bridge.
the lease agreement grants national cement the right to alter,maintain,and repair the access road,and national cement has generally kept the road in useable condition without seeking tejon permission.past maintenance includes resurfacing,resealing,and repaving the road,as well as installing speed bumps and speed limit signs.national cement has not,however,installed protective barriers on sections of the road by omission that led msha to cite the company for violating a,which states berms or guardrails shall be provided and maintained on the banks of roadways where a exists of sufficient grade or depth to cause a vehicle to overturn or endanger persons in equipment.
national cement challenged the citation,and tejon intervened in support.the alj granted the secretary motion for summary judgment that msha has jurisdiction over the road,ruling that the road is a mine under subsection b of the mine act definition of that term because it is a private road appurtenant to an extraction area.see cement of cal.sec y of labor.the commission ordered interlocutory review and vacated the alj decision,concluding that the secretary interpretation of subsection b would lead to results that are absurd or inconsistent with the purpose of the mine act.see sec y of labor cement of.the commission determined that only those sections of the access road over which national cement and its customers have exclusive use can be considered appurtenant to an extraction area and remanded the matter for the alj to determine whether any such section exists.id.at.
the secretary responded by filing the first of two petitions for review in this court,arguing that subsection b unambiguously includes the access road.we disagreed,concluding that the statute is not clear on the issue.see sec y of labor cement of.we noted that under subsection b,a road is a mine if it meets two criteria it must be private and appurtenant to an extraction area.id.we also pointed out that each of these terms is capable of a broad reading and a narrow reading.private means intended for or restricted to the use of a particular person or group or class of persons see id.quoting webster third new international dictionary.this could be read broadly to mean use restricted to a particular group or class of persons,or it could be read narrowly to mean use restricted to a particular person.id.appurtenant means a annexed or belonging legally to some more important thing a land or buildings b incident to and passing in possession with real of certain profits or easements.see id.quoting webster third at.this definition,we stated,could be read broadly to encompass easements benefiting some more important thing or more narrowly to include only easements dedicated exclusively to use by some more important thing.see id.we determined that although the broad readings of private and appurtenant would cover the access road,the narrow readings would not.id.
because the secretary failed to recognize this ambiguity in subsection b and erroneously thought its meaning was plain,we could not defer to her interpretation.id.at d eference is reserved for those instances when an agency recognizes that the congress intent is not plain from the statute face.quoting peter pan bus lines,fed.motor carrier safety.we vacated the commission decision and remanded the matter for the commission to obtain from the secretary a chevron step interpretation made in light of the statute possible meanings.id.at.we also observed that the secretary broad interpretation of subsection b raised three concerns about how the exercise of msha jurisdiction over the access road might relate to the mine act overall enforcement scheme.first,does national cement,which does not own the road,have authority to alter the road as msha might require second,would national cement be responsible for all road users,not just those it controlled third,would msha jurisdiction extend to those with no connection to the cement plant but who exert some control over the access road see id.at.we instructed the secretary to address these questions on remand and explain how her interpretation of subsection b could be harmonized with the act enforcement provisions 
on remand,the secretary took the view that private roads are those restricted to a particular group or class of persons not to a particular person and that appurtenant to requires only that the road belong and provide a right of way to some more important thing not dedicated exclusively to use by some more important thing.see sec y of labor cement of,see also br.of sec y at.under those broad readings,the secretary concluded once again that the access road is a mine because its use is limited to a particular group of persons,making it private,and it is subject to a transferable easement benefiting national cement plant,making it appurtenant to an extraction area.the secretary tried to address our concerns by explaining that she would apply subsection b to the road itself and subsection c,which covers equipment used in mining,to those vehicles that use the road to support mining activity.see cement,at.under this interpretation,the secretary would hold national cement responsible only for the conditions of the road itself and for vehicles on the road that are under its control and covered by subsection c as mining equipment.
the commission again found the secretary interpretation unreasonable and vacated the citation.it considered the secretary use of subsection c a contravention of the act because it seemed to limit the reach of subsection b to only certain kinds of road uses.see id.at.according to the commission,subsection c is clear and has been interpreted to plainly mean that mine act jurisdiction extends beyond subsections a and b see id.at.the commission also determined that the secretary view did not do nearly enough to prevent msha jurisdiction from potentially attaching to the possible uses of the access road should the road be subject to msha regulation as a mine.id.at.thus the commission concluded that the secretary interpretation not only misconstrued the statute but failed to address our concerns.
the secretary has again petitioned for review,arguing that her interpretation of subsection b is reasonable.we have jurisdiction to consider her petition under b.
as noted,previously we held that it is not clear subsection b covers the access road.see cement,at.accordingly,we proceed to chevron step two and determine whether the secretary interpretation of that provision,advanced in this litigation,is reasonable.see chevron natural res.def.council,d see also sec y of labor excel mining,llc,t he secretary litigating position before the commission is an exercise of her delegated lawmaking powers and is therefore deserving of deference.quoting rag cumberland res.lp fmshrc,second alteration in original.
tejon asserts that chevron does not apply because the secretary failed to follow this court remand mandate.br.of tejon at.rather than harmonizing her interpretation of subsection b with the overall enforcement scheme of the mine act,so the argument goes,the secretary engage d in interpretative alchemy and created an entirely new rationalization for her actions.id.at.as tejon sees it,her reasoning is nothing more than a rationalization.id.at.
distilled from its rhetoric,tejon is making two separate but related points that the secretary impermissibly changed both the rationale for the citation and her interpretation of subsection b.but the secretary rationale on remand used the same reasoning for citing national cement as the first instance.the access road fell within the definition of a mine under her broad reading of subsection b.tejon is correct that the secretary read subsection b differently in response to our concern that her broad interpretation might extend msha jurisdiction in problematic ways.she had originally interpreted subsection b to cover private roads appurtenant to extraction areas and everything on those roads.see cement,at see also reply br.of sec y at.this interpretation tracked her longstanding view that subsection a covers extraction areas and everything within their boundaries.see br.of sec y at.but now the secretary interprets subsection b to cover the access road but not the vehicles on it.a change in interpretation,however,is no reason to withhold chevron deference provided the agency explained the basis for its reconsidered view.see cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d.the reason for the secretary change is obvious.following our directions,she tried to read subsection b in a way that addressed our concerns and still made sense within the overall enforcement scheme of the mine act.see cement,at fcc fox television stations,d stating that an agency changing course must ordinarily display awareness that it is changing position but need not demonstrate to a court satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old one.
tejon also argues that chevron does not apply because the secretary interpretation of subsection b does not reflect a policy choice.br.of tejon at.assuming for the sake of argument that such a rule exists,the secretary decision to adopt the broad interpretation of subsection b clearly involves a policy choice at the core of her regulatory mission under the mine act.congress directed the secretary to protect the safety and health of the nation miners.see.the secretary interpretation of subsection b to encompass roads,like the access road,that have a significant connection to mining implements this policy.otis elevator sec y of labor,calling the decision to subject personnel who are servicing mine elevators to msha jurisdiction the kind of expert policy judgment courts are to make.
accordingly,the secretary interpretation of subsection b is entitled to chevron deference.
applying the standard of review called for by chevron step two,we ask in part a whether the secretary has advanced a reasonable interpretation of subsection b.in part b,we consider whether the secretary adequately addressed the concerns we raised when this matter was last before us.
subsection b provides that private ways and roads appurtenant to extraction areas are mines.h b.on remand the secretary adopted the broad reading of this provision to bring the access road within msha jurisdiction.we held before that such a reading was not inconsistent with the language of subsection b and we will not revisit that decision.see pnc fin.servs.group,comm r,w hen a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.quoting arizona california,d.
but there is more to the matter.we also expressed concern whether a broad reading of private and appurtenant,although consistent with the wording of subsection b,could be harmonized with the mine act overall enforcement scheme.for example,we wondered if operators of roads used for both mining and purposes would be responsible for all road users.see cement,at.the secretary tried to address this concern by reinterpreting subsection b to cover roads but not the vehicles on them.national cement and tejon assert that the secretary can not limit subsection b in this way.this is an odd argument coming from these parties,whose effort throughout this litigation has been to oppose the extension of msha jurisdiction to the access road.yet now they argue that subsection b compels a more expansive interpretation of msha jurisdiction than that advanced by the secretary on remand.of course,their intent is to show there is no reasonable interpretation of subsection b that covers the access road.in their view,subsection b necessarily includes vehicles,such that the secretary broad reading can not avoid the problem we raised.operators of roads not used exclusively for mining purposes will be responsible for vehicles outside of their control.this,they claim,is unreasonable,as our previous opinion suggested,leaving the secretary no choice but to adopt the narrow reading of subsection b in which only private roads used exclusively by mining vehicles fall within the jurisdiction of msha.
we must thus consider whether the secretary acted reasonably in reinterpreting subsection b to cover the road but not vehicles.the parties arguments highlight three distinct questions for us to consider.is the secretary decision to exempt vehicles consistent with the language of subsection b is it reasonable for the secretary to interpret subsection b differently than a and is the secretary reliance on subsection c to cover vehicles on the road a permissible construction of the statute we take each question in turn.
first,the secretary argues that we must defer to her interpretation that subsection b does not cover vehicles on the access road because the statute is not clear on that point.we agree.national cement and tejon argue that the phrase ways and roads,like the term area in subsection a,is geographically and covers everything on the road.see,br.of cement at.perhaps.but the secretary view is also reasonable and has the added virtue of being more consistent with the common meaning of road,which is not
