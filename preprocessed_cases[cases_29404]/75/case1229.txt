may the department of motor vehicles dmv reject certificates of completion from students who take a driver education correspondence course from a private high school,on the ground that correspondence courses are per se inadequate we hold that it may not.the legislature has expressly declined to regulate the format and content of private school driver education courses.the dmv may not regulate what the legislature has chosen to leave unregulated.the trial court issued a writ of mandate compelling the dmv to rescind its policy and accept certificates of completion from pacific high school,and we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
for persons under the age of in california,learning to drive entails two forms of instruction,driver education and driver training,subd.a.driver education covers the classroom aspects of learning to rules of the road,the causes and consequences of accidents,and the like,subd.j.driver training involves the practical or laboratory aspects,including time behind the wheel.
pacific high school pacific is a private high school.it offers a full curriculum of correspondence courses,including a correspondence course in driver education.pacific does not offer driver training courses.myron jackson is a student at a san francisco high school that does not offer driver education.he enrolled in and completed pacific driver education correspondence course.
students seeking a learner permit generally must demonstrate enrollment in or completion of a driver education course to the dmv.applicants seeking a provisional license also need to demonstrate completion of a driver education course,subd.a.the dmv has created a form,dl also known as a certificate of completion,for these purposes.
until,the dmv accepted certificates of completion from pacific.on august,the dmv wrote to pacific,raising questions about pacific compliance with various provisions of the vehicle and education codes.pacific responded in writing and by telephone,addressing the alleged shortcomings.its response failed to satisfy the dmv,and on october,the dmv notified pacific that all certificates of completion in its possession were cancelled and that as of october,the dmv would no longer accept certificates of completion from pacific.the dmv took the position that correspondence courses did not satisfy the requirements of the vehicle and education codes,and therefore it could not accept the certificates of completion issued by pacific.it rejected jackson october,certificate of completion.
pacific and jackson sued,seeking a writ of mandate to prevent the dmv from enforcing its new policy.the trial court granted the writ,and we denied a petition for writ of supersedeas that would have allowed the dmv to enforce its policy during the pendency of this appeal.the dmv has timely appealed from the trial court order

we are asked to decide whether the dmv may refuse driver education certificates of completion for correspondence courses.in short,must the classroom component of learning to drive actually take place in a classroom the parties agree on all material facts,but disagree over the application of the vehicle code and education code to those facts.presented with pure questions of law,we review the trial court decision de novo.
ii.the vehicle code does not authorize the dmv to refuse private school correspondence course certificates of completion 
we must answer two questions with respect to the vehicle code does it prohibit private school driver education correspondence courses,and if not,does it give the dmv discretion to adopt a rule barring such courses in each instance,we conclude that the answer is no.
a.the vehicle code does not regulate the format or content of driver education courses 
we begin with vehicle code section,which the dmv relies on as the primary source for its authority to reject private school certificates of completion based on the method of instruction.section governs the issuance of provisional licenses to californians between and years of age.to obtain a provisional license,a person must meet,inter alia,one of two requirements a satisfactory completion of approved courses in automobile driver education and driver training maintained pursuant to provisions of the education code in any secondary school of california,or equivalent instruction in a secondary school of another state,or b satisfactory completion of six hours or more of instruction by a driving school or an independent driving instructor licensed under chapter commencing with section of division and either an accredited course in automobile driver education in any secondary school of california pursuant to provisions of the education code or satisfactory completion of equivalent professional instruction acceptable to the department,subd.a a b.
on its face,vehicle code section does not set standards for the format or content of driver education courses.under subdivision a a,the course must be approved and maintained pursuant to provisions of the education code in any secondary school of california.under subdivision a b,the course must be accredited and provided in any secondary school of california pursuant to provisions of the education code.vehicle code section incorporates by reference the requirements of the education code,but it does not add its own requirements.
the dmv argues that vehicle code section precludes acceptance of correspondence courses because the section use of the word in requires driver education courses to be conducted in the physical confines of the classroom a driver education course must be maintained pursuant to provisions of the education code in any secondary school of california,subd.a a,italics added accord,subd.a b.the dmv reads this use of the word in too narrowly.the word connotes not only presence in a physical place,but also enrollment in an institution.the phrase in school carries the meaning receiving education at a school.oxford english dict.ed.the legislature has given each local school board the responsibility of enforc ing in its schools the courses of study and the use of textbooks and other instructional materials prescribed and adopted by the proper authority.we do not read this to mean that when students are on field trips,the school board is without jurisdiction.the state department of education exercises general supervision over the courses of physical education in elementary and secondary schools of the state.we have no doubt that those duties extend to courses and sports,such as,conducted almost exclusively outside the confines of the classroom or gymnasium.in this context,in is not shorthand for in the classroom.nothing in vehicle code section precludes completion of driver education through a correspondence course.
in re shinn d.and people turner,d supp,upon which the dmv relies,do not support its interpretation of the word in.in each case,parents home schooling their children were found to have violated the versions of various state compulsory education laws.in re shinn,at.people turner,at.these cases did not interpret the phrase in school,and they shed no light on the issue at hand 
like vehicle code section,other provisions in that
