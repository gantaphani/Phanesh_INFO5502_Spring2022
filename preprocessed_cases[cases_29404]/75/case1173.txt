this lawsuit concerns a drainage channel constructed by the department of transportation department when it rerouted highway to bypass the center of the city of cloverdale city.nearby property owners plaintiffs sued the department and the city for flooding caused by the drainage channel,and the city against the department for indemnity,damages,and declaratory relief.plaintiffs settled with the city and obtained a judgment on jury verdicts for damages against the department.judgment was entered for the department on the city.
a threshold issue in the case was whether the department,after completing the bypass project,effectively relinquished title to the drainage channel to the city.that issue was tried to the court,and the court determined that title was in fact relinquished.the court subsequently ruled for the department on the city indemnity claim,and granted in part the department motion to dismiss other city causes of action.this appeal by the city contests the relinquishment,indemnity,and dismissal rulings.
in the published portion of this opinion,we set forth our reasons for affirming the relinquishment ruling,which include the city failure to exhaust an administrative remedy by which the relinquishment could have been challenged.in the unpublished portion,we explain our reversal of the indemnity ruling and affirmance of the dismissal ruling.the court determined from an analysis of the settlement agreement and the jury verdicts that the city was not entitled to equitable indemnity from the department.we disagree with that ruling and conclude that a retrial of the indemnity issue is required.
relinquishment 
background 
the department and the city entered into a freeway agreement in august providing for the bypass project the project was completed in.the drainage channel at issue is in cloverdale and was built as part of the bypass project.the project included construction of asti road,a frontage road that disrupted the natural course of heron creek,so the creek was reconfigured to run through the drainage channel,which lies next to the frontage road.
robert perrault,city manager from to,told the department in a june letter that the city will maintain the constructed improved channels within the city limits upon their relinquishment from caltrans to the city.it is the city understanding that this relinquishment will occur after the cloverdale bypass is completed and after the three year plant establishment phase and the five year monitoring for assessing the success of the riparian vegetation.
perrault advised the department in a february letter of a drainage problem with the channelization at heron creek.he said that the present system is not working.after very modest rainfall,substantial ponding is occurring at the bottom of the channel.the city believes this ponding presents a potential health and safety problem and will also inhibit the city ability to maintain the channel once it is relinquished.i am requesting caltrans resolve these issues.prior to the city assuming any responsibility for the channel,it must drain properly and be in a state that will enable easy maintenance.
the city received a notice of intention to relinquish highway right of way pursuant to streets and highways code section from the department on december.section provides for relinquishment to a county or city by the california transportation commission commission of any portion of any state highway within the county or city that has been deleted from the state highway system by legislative enactment any portion of any state highway that has been superseded by relocation certain frontage or service road s or outer highway s and certain nonmotorized transportation facilit ies.the frontage road provision,and the relevant balance of the statute,are as follows 
whenever the d epartment and the county or city concerned have entered into an agreement providing therefor,or the legislative body of the county or city has adopted a resolution consenting thereto,the commission may relinquish,to that county or city,any frontage or service road or outer highway,within the territorial limits of the county or city,which has a of at least feet in width and which has been constructed as a part of a state highway project,but does not constitute a part of the main traveled roadway thereof 
relinquishment shall be by resolution.a certified copy of the resolution shall be filed with the board of supervisors or the city clerk,as the case may be.a certified copy of the resolution shall also be recorded in the office of the recorder of the county where the land is located and,upon its recordation,all right,title,and interest of the state in and to that portion of any state highway shall vest in the county or city,as the case may be,and that highway or portion thereof shall thereupon constitute a county road or city street,as the case may be.
prior to relinquishing any portion of a state highway to a county or a city,except where required by legislative enactment,the department shall give days notice in writing of intention to relinquish to the board of supervisors,or the city council,as the case may be 
within the period,the board of supervisors or the city council may protest in writing to the c ommission stating the reasons therefor,including,but not limited to,objections that the highway is not in a state of good repair,or is not needed for public use and should be vacated by the c ommission.in the event that the c ommission does not comply with the requests of the protesting body,it may proceed with the relinquishment only after a public hearing given to the protesting body on days written notice.
attached to the notice to the city was a copy of the relinquishment resolution to be presented to the commission.in accordance with the statute,the notice advised that the resolution would not be taken up by the commission until days after the notice was received.the notice specified where objections should be sent.
the relinquishment resolution recited that,in the freeway agreement,the city had agreed to accept title to frontage roads,reconstructed and relocated city streets and upon relinquishment by the state of california,and that the state ha d acquired right of way for and ha d constructed the collateral facilities in the city pursuant to the agreement.the property to be relinquished was all of the state of california right,title and interest in and to said collateral facilities in said city,together with the right of way and appurtenances thereof,described as follows segments,and,as shown on that certain set of maps of sheets to be filed in the sonoma county county recorder office.the maps were attached to the resolution.the first map gave an overview of the segments to be relinquished,some to the city and some to the county,and showed how the areas to be received by the city and county were shaded differently maps of the individual segments followed.
the maps were interpreted at the trial of the relinquishment issue by matthew goetz,a land surveyor working in the section of the department.goetz did not prepare the maps he was asked to review them and assess what they revealed.he testified that the maps depicted the boundaries of the areas to be relinquished,and constituted a technical description of the real property to be transferred.he said that the drainage channel in question was located within segment,one of the segments to be given to the city as shown on the maps.one of the maps of segment bore the label frontage road,but no topographical features were shown and the drainage channel was not identified by any words or markings.goetz said that the letters fr on the maps were shorthand for frontage,and the fr line shown on the maps of segment was the center line of asti road.he said it was readily apparent from the size of the shaded area around this center line that the area to be relinquished was much wider than the that are normally associated with a road.one could have taken the maps and a tape measure out to the center of the road,walked the length of the shaded area shown on the maps,and determined that it included the drainage channel.
the city did not protest the
