driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs,or driving while having percent or more of alcohol in one blood is a misdemeanor,subds.a b.however,the same offense may be charged as a felony if the offense occurred within seven years of three or more separate driving under the influence dui violations that resulted in convictions.former,subd.a repealed by stats,ch,to,operative july,now.in this case of first impression,we are asked to determine whether the three separate dui violations and the current violation must all occur within a period or whether the only requirement is that each of the three separate violations occur within seven years of the current offense,effectively allowing for felony prosecutions in cases where some convictions occurred as many as years apart.although we are mindful of the serious dangers posed by drunk drivers,we conclude that it is for the legislature to determine whether the period the legislature has set should be extended.accordingly,because the separate dui offenses in the instant case spanned a period of more than seven years,we reverse the judgment.
procedural background 
on june,defendant ubaldo vazquez munoz was charged in a refiled criminal complaint with driving under the influence of alcohol,subd.a,while having a blood alcohol level of or more,subd.b,and without a license,subd.a.the first two counts were charged as felonies on the ground that the current offense,which took place on september,occurred within seven years of three separate dui violations which had resulted in convictions.one of these separate violations occurred prior to the current november.the other two occurred subsequent to the current october,and september,had already resulted in convictions before the criminal complaint was filed in this case.
at the preliminary hearing,defense counsel moved for a determination that former section should not apply to elevate the charged offenses to felonies,based on the equal protection clauses and on the fact that more than seven years separated the priors of and.the magistrate expressed his concern to the district attorney,stating,the court concern at this time is one of the priors occurred november,and another one occurred october.the time difference which would exceed the seven year period in which the statute refers to in regards to priors separate offenses.the district attorney answered,what the reference point should be for the seven year period,and our position is that that reference point is the offense,the offense that is being addressed in the complaint.and that that seven year period goes from the offense,you could look after the offense as well as before the offense.the court then asked,if we go both ways,both before and after seven years,that would be a total of years possibly the district attorney responded,yes.as long as each of those offenses is within seven years of the charged offense.
after questioning defense counsel,the court asked the district attorney if defendant would have been prosecuted only for misdemeanors if the offenses had been tried in the order they were committed.the district attorney acknowledged,that correct,but pointed out that defendant was responsible for the cases not being tried in order,as he had failed to appear.the court then stated,i agree with you that a criminal defendant should not escape criminal responsibility for his failure to appear.in our case we have two things going on.the defendant did fail to appear and also the district attorney failed to serve the warrant prosecute the defendant.so there two wrongs there but my question to you is,and i agree with you,he should face up to his criminal responsibility for what he has done,but should it now be elevated to a felony because the district attorney did not prosecute him the district attorney replied,whether it fair or not,i not going to argue that.but i believe the statute on its face requires that.
the court then explained its concern,as a judicial officer looking at this argument,i ca make my ruling based on a narrow interpretation or just looking at the statute.i must look at all the law including equal protection and due process.i concerned that another defendant in his same position would have been,or if this defendant had been properly prosecuted and served then he be criminally responsible for misdemeanors.and by prosecuting him in this manner he suddenly elevated to a felony charge.under the equal protection due process of both california and the united states constitution,should such a result occur because the district attorney has failed to prosecute a defendant however,even by mistake or happenstance or negligence or an oversight,should he be punished because of the oversight of the district attorney from a misdemeanor to a felony 
the district attorney explained that he was not looking at it as he being punished because of his failure to appear or because of the oversight.he being punished because he has three offenses within seven years.he conceded once again,however,that if defendant had been prosecuted in order,he would have been liable only for misdemeanor driving under the influence.
after taking the matter under submission,the magistrate dismissed counts one and two and instead held defendant to answer to misdemeanor violations of sections,subdivisions a and b based on the magistrate determination that the prior convictions relied on by the people did not occur within a seven year period of time as required by the statute.
in the superior court,the people filed a motion to compel magistrate to reinstate the complaint pursuant to pc,which the court granted.full capitalization omitted.subsequently,the court set aside the magistrate dismissal of counts one and two and reinstated the felony charges.
defendant waived his right to a jury trial on the three prior convictions,which the court found to be true.defendant then pleaded no contest to counts and and admitted that he had a blood alcohol level of percent or more at the time of the offense.the people dismissed count.defendant was admitted to probation for five years on various conditions,including that he serve months in county jail.he timely appealed.
discussion 
on appeal,defendant renews his contentions that since he did not have three separate convictions for violating section within a period,the evidence is insufficient to elevate the offense to a felony under former section.he also renews his claim that due process and equal protection require that former section apply only when a defendant separate offenses occur within the period described in section.
we begin with a brief history of the legislation that allows recidivist drunk drivers to be treated as felons.in,when former section was first enacted,the section allowed for enhanced penalties for driving under the influence if the offender had three or more prior offenses for driving under the influence within five years of the current offense.due to the use of the word prior,the statute sometimes resulted in uneven application where a defendant had his cases resolved out of order.an individual who had his fourth driving under the influence conviction resolved before his third could not have either offense elevated to a felony.when the fourth was resolved,there were only two prior first and second.when the third was resolved,again there were only two prior offenses as the fourth offense was subsequent,not prior,to the others.
as a result of this unequal treatment,the legislature in amended former section to provide that individuals who committed four or more separate violations of dui laws within a period of the current offense would be subject to felony treatment.at the same time,the legislature amended several other dui recidivist statutes,and it added section,which set forth the legislative intent in enacting the changes.
section provides the legislature finds and declares that some repeat offenders of the prohibition against driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs,when they are addicted or when they have too much alcohol in their systems,may be escaping the intent of the legislature to punish the offender with progressively greater severity if the offense
