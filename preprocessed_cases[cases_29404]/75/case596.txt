michael and terri lynn chapman and daniel howell brought actions in state court alleging various state causes of action against labone,labone and union pacific railroad company union pacific.the defendants removed the actions to federal district courts in iowa and nebraska,respectively.the district court in iowa dismissed the chapman case on the ground that the claims were preempted by the federal railroad safety act frsa,as amended by the federal omnibus transportation employee testing act of foteta,and the railway labor act rla.the district court in nebraska ruled that removal of the howell case was proper based on the doctrine of complete preemption under the frsa and the foteta,and then dismissed the case on the ground that the foteta provided no private right of action.the chapmans and howell appeal these dismissals,and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
the facts of these two actions are similar.both daniel howell and michael chapman are former employees of union pacific.howell was a freight conductor,and chapman was a switchman and freight conductor.howell and chapman each were required to undergo a random drug test by providing a urine sample to their employer on or about january,and august,respectively.the urine samples were forwarded to labone for testing.labone tested the samples,and found that they were not consistent with human urine.labone reported the results to union pacific,and union pacific subsequently terminated howell and chapman.claiming that the test results were inaccurate,howell and chapman each filed an action in state court alleging various state theories,including negligence,breach of contract,defamation,negligent misrepresentation,fraudulent misrepresentation,interference with business relations,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and invasion of privacy.the crux of each of these claims was that labone did not properly test the urine samples and reported inaccurate results to union pacific.
the procedural postures of the two cases are slightly different.howell brought his action in nebraska state court against both labone and union pacific.his complaint alleged that union pacific was vicariously liable for the actions of its agent,labone.the defendants removed the action to the united states district court for the district of nebraska based on an assertion of federal question jurisdiction.the district court denied howell motion to remand,concluding that under the doctrine of complete preemption,howell claims should be considered federal claims arising under federal law.the district court then granted motions to dismiss filed by labone and union pacific on the ground that the foteta does not provide for a private right of action.the court also granted union pacific motion for summary judgment on the alternative ground that howell claims against union pacific were preempted by the rla.
michael chapman and his wife filed an action in iowa state court against labone only.labone removed the action to the united states district court for the southern district of iowa based on diversity and federal question jurisdiction.the district court then granted labone motion to dismiss.the court reasoned that the chapmans claims were predicated on the manner in which labone tested the urine specimen and reported the results to union pacific,and that the frsa and its corresponding regulations substantially subsumed the subject matter of state tort law regarding the standards for drug testing railroad employees.accordingly,the district court found that the chapmans state claims were preempted.
on appeal,the chapmans and howell contend that the district courts erred in holding that their state law claims were preempted by the frsa,the foteta,and their implementing regulations in addition,howell asserts that because his claims are not preempted by federal law,his case was improperly removed to federal court and his motion to remand the case to state court should have been granted.because the two cases present closely related issues,we consolidated their appeals.see fed.b.we review de novo a district court decision that state claims are preempted by federal law.thacker louis southwestern ry,cir.
in,the secretary of transportation,through the federal railroad administration fra,adopted regulations to control the use of alcohol and drugs in the operation of our nation railroads.control of alcohol and drug use in railroad operations,to be codified at pts.these initial regulations required toxicological testing of railroad employees under certain circumstances,such as after an accident or upon reasonable cause.id.at.the regulations required an employee to sign a consent form in connection with drug testing,but the fra commented that o bviously,this requirement does not require an employee to waive any claim for malpractice with respect to the drawing of blood or proper handling of the samples matters for which the practical exposure is,in any event,negligible.id.at.
the fra implemented the random drug testing program in.random drug testing,to be codified at pts.the fra discussion of preemption in connection with its regulations focused on state legislation.after observing that some states have enacted laws which limit or regulate drug testing by private employers,the fra explained that issuance of this random drug testing rule will preempt any state legislation regarding random drug testing for railroad employees,whether or not inconsistent with the final rule.at.
the fra amended its drug testing regulations in,in part to remain consistent with the drug testing procedures issued by the department of transportation.regulations,to be codified at pts.at that time,the fra added the following provision 
an employee required to participate in body fluid testing shall evidence consent to taking of samples the employee is not required to execute any document or clause waiving rights that the employee would otherwise have against the employer,and any such waiver is void.the employee may not be required to waive liability with respect to negligence on the part of any person participating in the collection,handling,or analysis of the specimen or to indemnify any person for the negligence of others.
id.at emphasis added see also d.the fra believed that as a practical matter,the employee will be fully protected from possible harm by virtue of the employer responsibility for selection of the collection entity and the provision of clear standards for acceptable collections,but also recognized that fra can not require that employees sign away their rights against third parties.at.in addition,the fra incorporated the secretary of transportation scientific and technical drug testing guidelines set forth in pt,which by then included an identical provision at f ii.at see also c.
the fra provision is still in effect.d.the department of transportation revised its general drug testing regulations in,but continues to prohibit employers from requiring an employee to sign a waiver of liability with respect to any part of the drug or alcohol testing process.
in,congress for the first time mandated drug testing in the railroad industry by passing the foteta,which amended the frsa and required the secretary of transportation to promulgate regulations establishing programs for drug testing railroad employees.b see also omnibus transportation employee testing act of,stat.congress specifically required the secretary of transportation to develop comprehensive regulations regarding controlled substance testing and laboratory procedures.c.the statute provided,however,that its mandate of drug testing did not prevent the secretary of transportation from continuing in effect,amending,or supplementing any of the drug testing regulations that were in effect prior to the foteta.f.
the preemptive effect of the fra regulations is governed by,which provides that a state may adopt or continue in force a law,regulation,or order related to railroad safety until the secretary of transportation prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the subject matter of the state requirement.in its regulations regarding drug testing of railroad employees,the fra provides that issuance of these regulations preempts any state law,rule,regulation,order or standard covering the same subject matter,except for certain provisions directed at local hazards.a.
the doctrine of preemption arises from the supremacy clause of the constitution,which requires that state law must give way when it conflicts with or frustrates federal law.const.art.vi,cl.csx,easterwood,d.state law is preempted when congress expressly prohibits state regulation,when congress implicitly leaves no room for state involvement by pervasively occupying a field of regulation,and when state law directly conflicts with federal law.freightliner myrick,d internal citation omitted heart of am.grain inspection serv.of,cir.federal regulations also may preempt state law,if the agency intends its regulations to have preemptive effect,and the agency is acting within the scope of its delegated authority.capital cities cable,crisp,s,d fid.fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d.in the ordinary case,federal preemption is merely a defense to a plaintiff claim,and it does not alter the jurisdiction of the federal court.see metropolitan life ins.taylor,d.
the doctrine of complete preemption establishes more than a defense to a claim.on occasion,the supreme court has concluded that the force of a statute is so extraordinary that it converts an ordinary state complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the complaint rule.caterpillar,williams,d quoting metropolitan life,at.when an area of state law has been completely preempted,then any claim purportedly based on that state law is considered,from its inception,a federal claim,and therefore arises under federal law.id.as such,complete preemption of a cause of action provides a basis for removal of an action to federal court.
we address first whether federal preemption is a defense to the state claims advanced in the complaint filed by the chapmans.because the foteta contains an express preemption clause,we focus in the first instance on the plain language of the statute,because it necessarily contains the best evidence of congress intent.easterwood,at.the preemption clause in applies to a law,regulation,or order relating to railroad safety,which may remain in effect until the secretary of transportation prescribes a regulation or issues an order that covers the subject matter of the state requirement.
in easterwood,the supreme court held that the preemption clause of the frsa as then in effect authorized the secretary to preempt claims.at.according to former,applicable regulations could preempt any state law,rule,regulation,order,or standard relating to railroad safety.the court held that these broad phrases encompassed duties,at,and that power to preempt state common law was clearly conferred on the secretary by.id.at.
after easterwood,congress superseded in the amendments to the foteta.the current preemption clause omits the terms rule and standard,thus narrowing the preemption clause to a law,regulation,or order relating to railroad safety.our court has said in dicta,however,that although is worded slightly differently than,it is identical in substance.cearley am.trans,cir.without discussing the change in text,both the supreme court and our court have applied,in conjunction with federal regulations,to find preemption of state claims.norfolk ry.shanklin,d bryan norfolk ry,cir.
one might question whether the text of provides authority for the secretary to preempt state common law.while the terms standard and rule seem naturally to encompass the common law,and thus support the supreme court conclusion in easterwood,the revised text extends only to a law,regulation,or order.in sprietsma mercury marine,d,the supreme court held that a preemption clause in the federal boat safety act that applied to a state or local law or regulation was most naturally read as not encompassing claims for two reasons.id.the court observed that the article a before law or regulation implied a discreteness that is not present in the common law.the court also concluded that statute use of the terms law and regulation together showed that congress intended to preempt only positive enactments,because a broader reading of law that encompassed the common law would have rendered the term regulation unnecessary.
nonetheless,the chapmans and howell have not urged that the text of alters the authority of the secretary,recognized in easterwood under former,to preempt state common law.therefore,particularly in light of our court previous statement in cearley,we will assume for purposes of this decision that there is a clear and manifest purpose of congress in the frsa and the foteta to authorize preemption of state claims relating to drug testing.see rice santa fe elevator.
assuming the secretary has authority to preempt state claims concerning drug testing,a cause of action is preempted when the secretary prescribes a regulation or issues an order that covers the subject matter of the state requirement.under this standard,will lie only if the federal regulations substantially subsume the subject matter of the state common law.easterwood,at.
labone points to federal drug testing regulations that set forth requirements for federally mandated drug testing,including preparation for testing,specimen collection procedures,laboratory analysis procedures,quality assurance and quality control,and requirements for reporting of test results.see.labone asserts that these regulations substantially subsume the subject matter of the state claims brought by the chapmans and howell,or demonstrate an intent by the secretary impliedly to preempt the field of drug testing regulation.
in considering whether the regulations preempt state common law,we bear in mind that as with the original frsa provision before it,the foteta preemption provision is employed within a provision that displays considerable solicitude for state law in that its express clause is both prefaced and succeeded by express savings clauses.easterwood,at.that solicitude for state law,together with the presumption against in an area traditionally governed by state law,id.at,counsels hesitation before we conclude that a subject matter governed by state law is substantially subsumed by federal regulations.
we conclude that the secretary regulations do not preempt the claims pleaded by the chapmans.important to our decision is a drug testing regulation promulgated by the secretary that specifically contemplates the existence of negligence actions arising from the drug testing process.in,the secretary directed that a federal employee required to participate in body fluid testing may not be required to waive liability with respect to negligence on the part of any person participating in the collection,handling or analysis of the specimen or to indemnify any person for the negligence of others.d emphasis added.when congress passed the foteta in,this provision already was in effect,and congress provided that the foteta did not prevent the secretary of transportation from continuing in effect,amending,or further supplementing a regulation prescribed or order issued before october,governing the use of alcohol or a controlled substance in railroad operations.f see also,at.thereafter,the secretary continued in effect this regulatory provision,which prohibits a service agent like labone from requiring an employee to waive liability with respect to negligence.see d f ii.in,the secretary went further,amending the regulations to ensure that an employer,acting on behalf of a service agent,could not require such a waiver,to be codified at pt,a.
we agree with the ninth circuit that n egligence is a state common law tort,and it would make no sense for the regulation to prohibit requiring the employee to waive negligence claims if those claims were preempted and could not be made.ishikawa delta airlines,cir,amended,cir see also drake lab.of am.holdings,d.because the regulations specifically contemplate the existence of a cause of action for negligence,we do not interpret them to subsume substantially the subject matter of negligence.nor do we discern an intent of the secretary impliedly to preempt such cau
