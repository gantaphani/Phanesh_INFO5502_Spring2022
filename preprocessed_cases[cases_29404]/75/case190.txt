petitioner railroad port authority trans hudson corporation path challenges a decision and order of the administrative review board of the united states department of labor,which held that path violated the federal railroad safety act when it suspended one of its employees for excessive absenteeism.specifically,path was held to have violated an provision,c,which prohibits railroads from disciplining employees for following orders or a treatment plan of a treating physician.the physician order which the employee was following related to treatment for an injury.reading subsection c in context,we agree with path that only physicians orders which stem from injuries are covered.
accordingly,we will grant the petition.
intervenor christopher bala is a unionized signal repairman who has worked for path since.per path agreement with bala union,signal repairmen of bala seniority are entitled to paid holidays and paid vacation days per year.separate from this allotment of paid holidays and vacations,bala took in excess of sick and personal days through in alone,bala took sick days,compared to the days of sick leave per year taken by unionized signalmen at path,on average,between and.as a result of these absences,path issued numerous warnings to bala over the years that if his attendance did not improve formal disciplinary action might be taken.
on june,bala experienced back pain while moving boxes at his home.the next day,bala physician ordered him off work through july.on july,path followed through on its prior warnings,and notified bala that an internal hearing would be held regarding his absenteeism.as a result of that hearing,path suspended bala for up to six days partially contingent on improved attendance,without pay,for violating path attendance policy.the suspension was based on the sum total of bala absences,including but not limited to those following his june,back injury.
bala filed a complaint with the respondent in this case,the united states secretary of labor,alleging that the suspension was retaliation for taking statutorily protected sick leave.the federal railroad safety act frsa,et,provides that a railroad carrier may not discipline an employee for following orders or a treatment plan of a treating physician.c although subsection c immediately follows a provision prohibiting railroads from deny ing,delay ing,or interfer ing with the medical or first aid treatment of an employee who is injured during the course of employment,c emphasis added,bala argued that subsection c applies regardless of where an employee is injured.an administrative law judge alj agreed and held that path violated the frsa by disciplining bala for following his physician orders not to work after his injury and awarded bala just over in back pay for the days he was suspended.the administrative review board arb of the united states department of labor dol upheld the alj award in bala port authority trans hudson corp,arb case,wl.
in upholding the award,the arb rejected path argument that subsection c is limited to physicians orders stemming from injuries.however,a mere months earlier,in santiago metro north commuter railroad,arb case,wl july,a different arb panel albeit comprised of two of the same three members stated just the opposite,that subsection c identifies protected activity as complying with treatment plans for work injuries.id.at emphasis added.the bala panel,while citing santiago seven times,failed to address this clear contradiction.
path petitioned this court to set aside the arb decision and order,and presented two questions whether subsection c applies to orders of treating physicians that stem from injuries and assuming the statute application to injuries,whether there was sufficient evidence to find that path disciplined bala because of such protected absences.we conclude that congress intended the entirety of subsection c to apply only when an employee sustains an injury during the course of employment.it is,therefore,unnecessary for us to reach the second question of the sufficiency of the evidence.we will grant path petition.
the arb had jurisdiction,as delegated to it by the secretary of labor,pursuant to d.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to d.
we review the arb decision to determine if it was,inter alia,arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.see a doyle sec y of labor,cir.while we exercise plenary review in deciding questions of law,id.at,our review is potentially subject to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.however,when we are called upon to resolve pure questions of law by statutory interpretation,we decide the issue de novo without deferring to an administrative agency that may be involved.patel ashcroft,cir superseded by statute on other grounds.
before the frsa was amended by the rail safety improvement act of rsia was exclusively an provision.subsections a and b of provided and still provide protections to employees who assist in investigations into railroad safety,refuse to violate laws pertaining to railroad safety,notify a railroad or the secretary of transportation about injuries or illnesses,and report refuse to work in hazardous conditions.the rsia inserted a new subsection c,containing both an provision,subsection c,and a more direct worker safety provision,subsection c 
c prompt medical attention.
prohibition.a railroad carrier or person covered under this section may not deny,delay,or interfere with the medical or first aid treatment of an employee who is injured during the course of employment.if transportation to a hospital is requested by an employee who is injured during the course of employment,the railroad shall promptly arrange to have the injured employee transported to the nearest hospital where the employee can receive safe and appropriate medical care.
discipline.a railroad carrier or person covered under this section may not discipline,or threaten discipline to,an employee for requesting medical or first aid treatment,or for following orders or a treatment plan of a treating physician,except that a railroad carrier refusal to permit an employee to return to work following medical treatment shall not be considered a violation of this section if the refusal is pursuant to federal railroad administration medical standards for fitness of duty or,if there are no pertinent federal railroad administration standards,a carrier medical standards for fitness for duty.for purposes of this paragraph,the term discipline means to bring charges against a person in a disciplinary proceeding,suspend,terminate,place on probation,or make note of reprimand on an employee record.
c emphasis added.we are the first federal appeals court to consider a case involving this subsection 
we are confronted here with a statute that specifically references at subsection c injur ies during the course of employment,while subsection c does not.path argues that the treatment in subsection c refers back to the treatment in subsection c and thereby incorporates the during the course of employment limitation into subsection c the dol,contending that the two paragraphs are distinct provisions,argues that the absence of the during the course of employment limitation in subsection c reflects a deliberate choice by congress to extend protections even to workers who sustain injuries.since,under subsection c,a physician order could include a direction that an employee not work as the physician order did in this case,and because there is no temporal limitation in the statute,the dol interpretation would functionally confer indefinite sick leave on all railroad employees who can obtain a physician note 
we agree with path that the during the course of employment limitation applies to subsection c.as we explain below,because subsection c is an provision obviously related to subsection c,it should presumptively be interpreted only to further the objectives of subsection c.the dol broad interpretation of subsection c would not further the objectives of subsection c,and the dol is unable to rebut the aforementioned presumption.the arb,relying on russello united states,d,concluded that the absence of any express limitation in subsection c,in contrast to the presence of such a limitation in subsection c,means that congress did not intend for that limitation to apply to subsection c.but,for reasons we explain below,russello is unhelpful here.
moreover,further examination of the statutory text affirmatively supports the conclusion that subsection c is limited to addressing injuries.we do recognize that the dol advances a logical policy argument in support of its position that railroad safety could be threatened if injured workers are pressured to return to work by the absence of indefinite sick leave.but there is no evidence congress ever considered that reason,and provisions suggest that congress would have written subsection c differently if that were its intent.
subsection c,entitled prohibition,is a substantive provision while subsection c,entitled discipline,is an antiretaliation provision.see burlington santa fe ry.white,d analyzing the relationship between and of title vii.generally,an antiretaliation provision seeks to secure the primary objective advanced by the substantive provision.id.at.dellinger sci.applications int l,cir the provision is included in the fair labor standards act,not as a freestanding protection but rather as an effort to foster a climate in which compliance with the substantive provisions of the act would be enhanced.quoting mitchell robert demario jewelry,d.
the plain text of subsection c,which covers an employee who is injured during the course of employment,makes clear that its primary objective is to ensure that railroad employees are able to obtain medical attention for injuries sustained.subsection c furthers that objective by encouraging employees to take advantage of the medical attention protected by subsection c,without facing reprisal.interpreting subsection c to also cover injuries would not further the purposes of subsection c,which is explicitly limited to injuries.
we think this much is beyond reasonable debate.although the dol contends that the provisions are distinct,it does not contest the fact that subsection c effectuates the purposes of subsection c.nor does the dol contest the fact that its broad interpretation of subsection c would not further the purposes of subsection c indeed the dol emphasizes that subsection c protection for following the orders or a treatment plan of a treating physician is a distinct protection only appearing in subsection c.respondent br.at emphasis added.so,the real issue becomes the extent to which despite their obvious relationship subsection c is a provision intended by congress to also advance an objective that is independent from those advanced in subsection c.consistent with the construction of provisions in general,and in particular provisions immediately following a related substantive provision as in burlington and here,we presume that congress did not intend subsection c to be a vehicle for advancing an independent objective 
as t he best evidence of the purpose of a statute is the statutory text adopted by both houses of congress,wyeth levine,d thomas,concurring in the judgment internal brackets omitted quoting,casey,d,we begin our search for evidence that congress actually intended subsection c to advance an independent objective by examining the textual analysis in the arb decision below.that analysis focused on an extension of the supreme court decision in russello.russello set s out a canon of interpretation that where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.kapral united states,cir alito,concurring quoting russello,at internal brackets omitted.because subsection c is explicitly limited to injur ies during the course of employment and subsection c is not,applying russello,the arb concluded that congress clearly intended subsection c to apply without such limitation we disagree.
at issue in russello was a racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico forfeiture provision,a,which extended to any interest the person has acquired or maintained in violation of the rico statute.the petitioner argued that one can only have an interest in something,and that per the language of subsection a that interest must be an interest in the enterprise itself and not in money or profits derived therefrom.the supreme court rejected that analysis on its face,and then stated w e are fortified in this conclusion by our examination of the structure of the rico statute.at.unlike subsection a,subsection a extended only to interests in any enterprise which were connected to a person rico violation.thus,the supreme court concluded that if congress wanted to restrict subsection a to only interests in enterprises,it would have done so explicitly as it did in subsection a.
we acknowledge a similarity between this case and russello but that similarity is superficial.the russello presumption only applies when two provisions are sufficiently distinct that they do not either explicitly or implicitly incorporate language from the other provision.see clay united states,d in russello t he qualifying words in any enterprise narrowed a,but in no way affected a emphasis added second omission in original.since the critical question here is whether subsection c operates to cabin the scope of subsection c,russello can only be meaningfully invoked after we resolve that inquiry consequently,it is of little help here 
moreover,the russello presumption is based on s tatutory context,carter welles bowen realty,cir,and a hypothesis of careful draftsmanship.kapral,at alito,concurring.but that hypothesis is at least partially eroded by numerous examples of inexact drafting in.see city of columbus ours garage wrecker,d not following the russello presumption,in part because of perceived drafting inconsistencies.for example,faced with stronger arguments from the plain text of the statute than the dol advances here,other federal courts have rejected railroads contentions that i employees have no remedy if they fail to receive the medical treatment subsection c entitles them to and ii railroads may bring disciplinary charges against employees who report accidents and safety violations 
the basis for rejecting the dol interpretation is not merely a presumption against it and the unpersuasiveness of the dol textual arguments.rather,a close examination of the statutory text affirmatively supports the conclusion that subsection c is limited to addressing injuries.see kasten saint gobain performance plastics,d interpretation of a phrase in an provision depends upon reading the whole statutory text,considering the purpose and context of the statute,and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.quoting dolan postal service,d.subsection c has two different segments subsections c and c which each provide similar protections to employees.moreover,one segment is expressly limited to matters,while the other has no such explicit limitation.strikingly,the same is also true of subsection b,making for an illuminating comparison 
b hazardous safety or security conditions.
a railroad carrier engaged in interstate or foreign commerce,or an officer or employee of such a railroad carrier,shall not discharge,demote,suspend,reprimand,or in any other way discriminate against an employee for 
a reporting,in good faith,a hazardous safety or security condition 
b refusing to work when confronted by a hazardous safety or security condition related to the performance of the employee duties 
b emphasis added.
the dol contends,consistent with its approach to interpreting subsection c,that because there is no express qualification in subsection b a,an employee is protected for reporting any hazardous safety or security condition.at oral argument the dol was presented with a reductio ad absurdum a path employee,wearing a path sweatshirt,protests pollution at a power plant entirely unrelated to railroads,his conduct at that protest impugns path reputation since he was wearing a path sweatshirt,and path disciplines him as a result.the dol,remaining consistent,responded that such discipline would violate subsection b a.we can not agree.
i t is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish.pub.citizen dep t of justice,d quoting cabell markham,cir hand.the purpose of the entirety of the frsa is as obvious as it is express to promote safety in every area of railroad operations and reduce accidents and incidents.accordingly,we think that subsection b a must be read as having at least some limitation,even though no such limitation appears on the face of the statute.and if a limitation must be applied to subsection b a,it would be consistent to also apply a limitation to subsection c.
subsection c itself also supports the conclusion that an limitation applies therein.although not the portion directly at issue here,subsection c protects employees who request medical or first aid treatment.emphasis added.it seems unlikely that congress was concerned about railroads disciplining employees for requesting medical treatment for injuries indeed,at oral argument,the dol conceded that such a scenario was unlikely as a practical matter and could not articulate even a hypothetical situation where an employee would be disciplined for requesting medical treatment for an injury if congress likely did not consider the application of the phrase requesting medical or first aid treatment in subsection c to injuries,it is unlikely that congress would have shifted course without any textual indication to have the phrase orders or a treatment plan of a treating physician apply to injuries.
although lacking in textual support,the dol does provide a logical policy basis for how a broad interpretation of subsection c would advance railroad safety.the dol argues that if subsection c does not cover injuries,employees may be forc ed to choose between violating employer attendance policies and compromising railroad safety by working while injured.respondent br.at.indeed,certain railroad employees are engaged in such tasks,that the supreme court has compared the safety implications of their performance to those who have routine access to dangerous nuclear power facilities.skinner ry.labor exec.ass n,d finding a compelling interest in subjecting such employees to suspicionless drug testing.
in passing the rsia,congress was clearly concerned about the safety implications of how employees perform their duties.see,requiring a fatigue management plan to be included as part of railroads risk reduction programs requiring the secretary of transportation to establish minimum training standards rsia requiring the secretary of transportation to study the safety impact of the use of cell phones and other potentially distracting electronic devices.but all of these employee safety provisions are expressly limited to railroad employees a term of art under the frsa these provisions build on the longstanding commonsense recognition that only certain categories of railroad employees pose unique dangers if they work while impaired strikingly,subsection c contains no such limitation,which means it may extend even to railroad accountants.had congress intended to provide sick leave to workers in positions in order to combat potential impairment,it likely would have placed a limit in subsection c to that effect as it has regularly done when concerned about impaired railroad employees.
the alternative is that congress meant to provide sick leave to all railroad employees.providing an entire industry workers a right to unlimited sick leave is a substantial policy undertaking,and we are unaware of any other federal laws conferring such a right on workers in any industry rather,the default rule under the family and medical leave act,et,is that workers regardless of industry are provided with up to weeks of sick leave every months.a.congress does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions it does not,one might say,hide elephants in mouseholes.whitman am.trucking ass ns,d.we are not prepared to assume that congress decided to enact such a significant change by inserting an sentence fragment between much more limited protections,from which such a change could be deduced.i t is highly unlikely that congress made a decision of such economic and political significance in so cryptic a fashion.fda brown williamson tobacco,d internal quotations and citations omitted.
the dol further suggests that the rsia legislative history supports its position.although,in light of the foregoing analysis,resort to the legislative history is unnecessary to decide this case,our inquiry in that regard discloses no support for the dol position.in re pelkowski,cir.subsection c was modeled on two similar state statutes which were held preempted by federal law in like subsection c,both statutes were broken into two paragraphs a deny,delay or interfere paragraph,followed by a discipline paragraph.in both state statutes,both paragraphs contained an injured during the course of employment limitation.by contrast,in the federal version,only subsection c has such a limitation.the dol,echoing its earlier arguments,contends that this is evidence of a deliberate choice by congress 
however,the dol concedes that both of the state statutes and the federal hearings before the adoption of subsection c were focused on injuries,and it has been unable to point to any express evidence that the policy it now advances was ever considered by anybody at any point in the legislative process.rather,because of the broader safety purposes behind the statute,the dol asks us simply to assume that congress would have wanted this result.aside from the separation of powers issues raised by that proposition,how do we know that congress would not have been more concerned about potential safety issues caused by absenteeism,thus outweighing the potential benefits of the dol stance we do which is one reason why this court does not formulate public policy.
the dol argues that even if we do not agree that the statute necessarily extends to injuries,the arb interpretation is entitled to chevron deference.but whether two different statutory provisions have the same scope is a pure question of statutory construction for the courts to decide,which warrants e mploying traditional tools of statutory construction.cardoza fonseca,d.if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.chevron,at.only if the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,does the question become whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.employing traditional tools of statutory construction we have concluded that subsection c applies only to injuries.accordingly,the arb is not entitled to chevron deference 
having concluded that the administrative review board misinterpreted the statute,we will grant the petition challenging the board september,order,and remand with instructions that the proceeding against petitioner be dismissed.
under the union agreement,if bala is prevented from performing his duties by reason of sickness,he is to be paid in full for up to days of sick leave annually,and to receive for an additional days annually.bala did not bring a claim pursuant to that agreement.
claimants alleging retaliation for taking statutorily protected sick leave often rely on the family and medical leave act fmla,which provides workers protected sick leave and is accompanied by an provision.but at oral argument,bala counsel expressed some skepticism that bala would have qualified under the fmla due to his prior absences.
the alj heard arguments that because bala had previously injured his back at work,his subsequent back injury at his home constituted an aggravation of an injury,and accordingly would still be covered even if subsection c only applied to injuries.as this issue was n
