plaintiffs jill lindsay,carol johnson,constance lamattina,daniel santiago,deborah whittington,dottie long,janet gold,judith alexander,karen rivoira,laurence salomon iii,patricia kennedy,patty gentry,and rebecca smith,proceeding individually,and in lindsay case,also on behalf of a putative class of flight attendants,filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york nina gershon,judge,challenging the validity of a restructuring participation agreement reached between their former employer,defendants american airlines and its parent amr corporation collectively,american airlines,and their union,defendant association of professional flight attendants,and its former president defendant john ward collectively,apfa or the union.plaintiffs now appeal an award of summary judgment entered on july,in favor of american airlines on plaintiffs claims under the railway labor act rla,et in favor of american airlines and apfa on plaintiffs state law claims and in favor of apfa on plaintiffs claim of a breach of the duty of fair representation.we conclude that plaintiffs challenge fails because the statutory sections relied on by plaintiffs to support their rla claim,first and seventh,do not provide for a private cause of action the rla preempts plaintiffs state law claims and plaintiffs failed to adduce sufficient evidence of a material fact on their fair representation claim to defeat summary judgment.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court in favor of defendants.
background 
the district court thorough opinion fairly chronicles the complex events giving rise to defendants restructuring participation agreement,which plaintiffs challenge in this action.see marcoux am.airlines,d,wl.we assume familiarity with that opinion,and we do not ourselves repeat the facts except as necessary to discuss plaintiffs appeal of the award of summary judgment.

plaintiffs railway labor act claims 
plaintiffs contend that american airlines violated those provisions of the rla codified at,first and seventh by supplanting an existing collective bargaining agreement with the restructuring participation agreement.section,first states as follows 
it shall be the duty of all carriers,their officers,agents,and employees to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay,rules,and working conditions,and to settle all disputes,whether arising out of the application of such agreements or otherwise,in order to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier growing out of any dispute between the carrier and the employees thereof.
section,seventh states as follows 
no carrier,its officers,or agents shall change the rates of pay,rules,or working conditions of its employees,as a class,as embodied in agreements except in the manner prescribed in such agreements or in section of this title.
id,seventh.
no party has pointed us to any case law addressing whether these sections provide for a private right of action by individual employees,nor have we identified any.in considering this question of first impression,we begin by reviewing the general enforcement structure of the rla.
arbitral resolution of major and minor disputes under the rla 
the railway labor act was passed in to encourage collective bargaining by railroads and their employees in order to prevent,if possible,wasteful strikes and interruptions of interstate commerce.detroit toledo shore line united transp.union,d see also amending rla to apply to interstate air carriers.toward this end,the rla provides an arbitral mechanism for the prompt and orderly settlement of two classes of disputes between unions and employers.hawaiian airlines,norris,d quoting.the first class,referred to as major disputes,relates to the formation of collective bargaining agreements or efforts to secure them.consolidated rail ry.labor executives ass n,d internal quotation marks omitted.the second class,known as minor disputes,see id.at,grow s out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements covering rates of pay,rules,or working conditions.in other words,major disputes seek to create contractual rights,minor disputes to enforce them.hawaiian airlines,norris,at.
private enforcement of the rla 
beyond the arbitral scheme for resolving disputes between employers and unions,the rla also provides for federal criminal enforcement.see,tenth it shall be the duty of any united states attorney to whom any duly designated representative of a carrier employees may apply to institute in the proper court and to prosecute under the direction of the attorney general of the united states,all necessary proceedings for the enforcement of the provisions of this section.although the rla does not explicitly provide a private civil cause of action,the supreme court has found such an action by a union implicit in the statutory scheme.
in texas new orleans railroad brotherhood of railway steamship clerks,the supreme court recognized a private right of action by a union alleging that the defendant company was interfering with,influencing,or coercing the clerical employees of the railroad company in the matter of their organization and designation of representatives in violation of,third.the court concluded that congress,in the legislation of,while elaborating a plan for amicable adjustments and voluntary arbitration of disputes between common carriers and their employees,thought it necessary to impose,and did impose,certain definite obligations enforceable by judicial proceedings.id.at.in fact,private civil proceedings constitute the bulk of cases arising under the rla.see united states winston,cir noting t he paucity of criminal proceedings under,when contrasted with the active pursuit of civil relief thereunder.
although much of the case law involving private causes of action under concerns claims brought by or against a certified union,our sister circuits have recognized an implied private right of action for individual employees against their employer under certain rla provisions,notably,third and fourth.see,bensel allied pilots ass n,cir collecting cases fennessy sw.airlines,cir stepanischen merchs.despatch transp,cir.the third circuit explained that i mplying a private cause of action for individual employees under,third fourth is appropriate given that those sections prohibit carriers from discriminating against employees in connection with union organizing activities.bensel allied pilots ass n,at emphasis in original.by contrast,the third circuit declined to find an implied private cause of action for individual employees in,second and ninth because,although the statute may indicate a congressional intent to create a private cause of action for a duly certified representative that is injured pursuant to these provisions,that does not imply that congress intended to create a private right of action for any group or groups of individual employees claiming to act on behalf of the relevant employees.id.at.
section,first and seventh do not provide a private cause of action 
against this background,we consider whether,first or seventh provides an individual employee with a private right of action against his employer.because our task is to ascertain congress intent,we look first to the text and structure of the statute.see alexander sandoval,d.if congress has manifested no intent to provide a private right of action,we can not create one.see id.we identify nothing in the rla text or structure suggesting congress intent to create a private remedy.we next proceed to consider whether a private remedy is implicit in the statute.cort ash,d.in undertaking this second inquiry,four factors guide our analysis 
first,is the plaintiff one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was is,does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff second,is there any indication of legislative intent,explicit or implicit,either to create such a remedy or to deny one third,is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff and finally,is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law,in an area basically the concern of the states,so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law 
id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted for the reasons stated in the next three subsections of this opinion,we conclude that congress did not intend to create a private cause of action for employees to enforce,first or seventh.the appropriate remedy for injuries of the sort plaintiffs allege is a claim against their union for breach of the duty of fair representation 
text and structure 
the text of,first and seventh reveals no congressional intent to create a private right of action.statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.alexander sandoval,at.internal quotation marks omitted see also bellikoff eaton vance,cir t he absence of language indicates a lack of congressional intent to create private rights of action.section,first imposes a duty on all carriers,their officers,agents,and employees.likewise,seventh bars certain actions by a carrier,its officers,or agents.because both provisions focus on the regulated parties,we discern no intent to confer privately enforceable rights.
the statute structure also supports this conclusion.as the supreme court has recognized,t he express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that congress intended to preclude others.alexander sandoval,at.here,congress expressly contemplated that the rla would be enforced through arbitral panels,see,and criminal prosecution,see,tenth congress failure to provide similarly for private enforcement signals caution in inferring any such right of action.the prior implication of private rights under other subsections of warrants no different conclusion.indeed,sandoval involved title vi of the civil rights act of,et.in an earlier title vi case,the court had noted that private plaintiffs could sue under.see cannon of chicago,d.nevertheless,that consideration was not relevant to sandoval textual and structural analysis of whether created a similar private remedy.we therefore conclude that the rla text and structure does not manifest congress intent to create a private enforcement mechanism for all provisions of the statute.
section,first 
our analysis of the four cort ash factors bolsters this conclusion.the statutory requirement in,first that carriers strive to maintain agreements concerning rates,rules,and working conditions,may well benefit individual employees,the first relevant factor under cort ash,at.this is not sufficient,however,to imply a private right of action because the statutory scheme achieves its purpose by collectivizing employees individual interests.see nlrb,d noting that concept is today unquestionably at the center of our federal labor policy internal quotation marks omitted.thus,first is distinguishable from,third and fourth,for which private rights of action have been recognized,in that the latter provisions are specifically aimed at preventing employer interference with individual employees ability to join a collective bargaining scheme.with that interest protected,however,congress clearly intended that individual preferences give way to the collective position embodied by the certified union representative.it is agreements reached by such representatives with employers that are the focus of,first.see virginian ry.fed.observing that,first is concerned with negotiations between an employer and the authorized representative of its employees.
indeed,the second cort ash factor signals that congress did not intend to provide a private cause of action for individual employees in,first.see at.section,second states that a ll disputes between a carrier and its employees shall be considered,and,if possible,decided,with all expedition,in conference between representatives designated and authorized so to confer,respectively,by the carrier and by the employees thereof interested in the dispute,second emphasis added.section,fourth explains that the very right to organize and bargain collectively is accomplished through representatives of the employees own choosing,fourth emphasis added.that provision further states that t he majority of any craft or class of employees shall have the right to determine who shall be the representative of the craft or class for the purposes of this chapter.id.taken together,these provisions leave no doubt that,where,as here,a craft or class of employees has selected a representative union,congress intended the power to make and the duty to maintain agreements concerning rates of pay,rules,and working conditions,id,first,to run between the representative union and the company.indeed,the supreme court has explained that members of a craft or class can not bargain individually on behalf of themselves as to matters which are properly the subject of collective bargaining.steele louisville.see also virginian ry.fed,at.
relatedly,we conclude under the third cort ash factor that it would not be consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply a private cause of action for employees under,first.by its terms,first links its requirement to make and maintain agreements to the larger rla purpose to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier growing out of any dispute between the carrier and the employees thereof,first see also id.as described above,the statute seeks to achieve this goal by vesting collective bargaining authority in representative unions.the supreme court has explained that,in enacting the rla,congress has seen fit to clothe the bargaining representative with powers comparable to those possessed by a legislative body both to create and restrict the rights of those whom it represents,but it has also imposed on the representative a corresponding duty.steele louisville,at.as such,the rla is consistent with a 
n ational labor policy built on the premise that by pooling their economic strength and acting through a labor organization freely chosen by the majority,the employees of an appropriate unit have the most effective means of bargaining for improvements in wages,hours,and working conditions.the policy therefore extinguishes the individual employee power to order his own relations with his employer and creates a power vested in the chosen representative to act in the interests of all employees.
nlrb,at.the union ability to exercise this vested authority is protected by the rla.at the same time,it is the union corresponding duty to those it represents that ensures the fair exercise of this authority.steele louisville,at.it could not be otherwise in a statutory regime that prioritizes continuity and over the complete satisfaction of all who are represented.nlrb,at.
the facts of this case demonstrate why individual employee actions under,first would be inconsistent with a statutory scheme embodying these principles.the restructuring participation agreement,which plaintiffs complain fails to maintain a collective bargaining agreement cba,was agreed to by apfa on april,and approved by apfa members on april.in that document,the parties agree that the cba shall remain in full force and effect except as modified herein.among the modifications here at issue was the date for possible amendment of the cba,with the union and its membership agreeing to an extension from november,to april.following the disclosure of the special executive retirement plan on april,the union extracted a concession from american airlines on the point,making the cba amendable one year earlier,on april.
however dissatisfied individual employees may be with these modifications to the cba,allowing them to sue american airlines under,first to set aside a restructuring participation agreement agreed to by their union representative and ratified by the union membership would risk the very disruption in commerce that the rla seeks to avoid.indeed,under the modifications,american airlines can not simply revert to the original terms of the cba.plaintiffs dispute is thus not with american airlines,which could not take the action plaintiffs seek without violating the modified cba,but rather with the union,which negotiated for the modified cba terms that now bind american airlines and that form the basis of plaintiffs claim.a claim of this nature is appropriately brought against the union for breach of the duty of fair representation.see nlrb,at.it was because the national labor policy vested unions with power to order the relations of employees with their employer that this court found it necessary to fashion the duty of fair representation.see also infra discussing plaintiffs duty of fair representation claim.
section,seventh 
the statutory provision prohibiting carriers from changing rates of pay,rules,or working conditions except as prescribed by agreement or statute,seventh,may also benefit employees,but here too we do not recognize an implied private right of action by individual employees against an employer.
as the supreme court has observed,the purpose of,seventh is twofold it operates to give legal and binding effect to collective agreements,and it lays down the requirement that collective agreements can be changed only by the statutory procedures.detroit toledo shore line united transp.union,at.thus,seventh is a status quo provision,requiring that parties to a cba governed by the rla maintain objective working conditions during the pendency of any dispute arising under or during the of their cba.in re nw.airlines,cir.more specifically,in the event of a major dispute,seventh preserves the status quo while the employer and the union engage in the negotiation required by and.see consolidated rail ry.labor executives ass n,at.
precisely because the statutory scheme as interpreted by the courts recognizes the representative union as the proper party to invoke,seventh,we conclude that the second and third cort ash factors weigh heavily against recognition of a private right of action by individual employees.see at.the provision is only implicated where a craft or class of employees has already selected a representative to bargain collectively on its behalf,fourth,and where an employer attempts to make changes that affect the employees as a class,seventh.under those circumstances,an individual employee power to order his own relations with his employer is extinguishe d in favor of a power vested in the chosen representative to act in the interests of all employees.nlrb,at.
because we conclude that neither,first nor,seventh provides a private cause of action to individual employees against their employers under the circumstances presented here,we affirm the district court dismissal of these claims and its entry of judgment in favor of defendants.
plaintiffs state law claims 
plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in concluding that their state law claims against american airlines were preempted by the rla.see marcoux am.airlines,d,wl,at.in their reply brief,plaintiffs clarify that they appeal only the dismissal of claim eleven,in which they charge apfa with breach of its contractual relationship with plaintiffs as set forth in the union constitution and bylaws claim twelve,in which they charge american airlines with intentional interference with the contractual relationship between apfa and its members and claim sixteen,in which plaintiffs charge american airlines with intentionally causing apfa to breach certain provisions of its constitution and bylaws relating to balloting and electioneering practices.accordingly,we limit our discussion to those claims.see maloney cuomo,cir noting that claims not pursued on appeal are deemed waived.like the district court,we conclude that these claims are preempted by the rla,and we therefore affirm their dismissal.
preemption in labor cases generally 
the supreme court established the basic tenets of federal preemption in the labor context in san diego building trades council garmon,d.in garmon,the court considered whether california could provide damages under state law to an employer based on employee picketing,which the california supreme court determined was an unfair trade practice.see id.at.the employer had begun a simultaneous proceeding before the national labor relations board nlrb,over which the regional director had declined to exercise jurisdiction presumably because the amount of interstate commerce involved did not meet the board monetary standards in taking jurisdiction.id.at.
the court identified the issue as t he extent to which the variegated laws of the several states are displaced by a single,uniform,national rule,namely,the national labor relations act.id.at.the court concluded as follows 
when it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a state purports to regulate are protected by of the national labor relations act,or constitute an unfair labor practice under,due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield.to leave the states free to regulate conduct so plainly within the central aim of federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict between power asserted by congress and requirements imposed by state law.
id.at.stated differently,t he governing consideration is that to allow the states to control activities that are potentially subject to federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict with national labor policy.id.at.this principle,the court explained,applies regardless of whether the state law at issue was tort law of general application or specialized labor relations statutes.id.at.finally,the court explained that,even if application of state law in a particular situation would not,in fact,conflict with the active assertion of federal authority,it would nevertheless involve a conflict with federal policy in that it involves allowing two sources to govern.id.at.
the garmon rule is subject to two exceptions.first,states retain power to regulate activity that is a merely peripheral concern of the labor management relations act.id.at.second,federal labor law does not preempt state law where the regulated conduct touched interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that,in the absence of compelling congressional direction,the court could not infer that congress had deprived the states of the power to act.id.at.as an example of the second exception,the court pointed to states continued ability to regulate violence and imminent threats to the public order.id.at.
preemption in rla cases 
although garmon was decided in the context of the national labor relations act,similar reasoning animated the supreme court application of preemption to the railway labor act in brotherhood of railroad trainmen jacksonville terminal,d see,bensel allied pilots ass n,at suggesting that garmon was extended to the rla in jacksonville terminal.in jacksonville terminal,the court considered whether,in the context of a major labor dispute governed by the rla,a florida court had the authority to enjoin the picketing of a freight rail terminal facility under state tort and labor laws.at.the court concluded that it did not because the exercise of plenary state authority to curtail or entirely prohibit would frustrate effective implementation of the rla processes.id.at.the court reached this conclusion even while acknowledging that,unlike the situation presented in garmon,in a major dispute under the rla there is no administrative agency equivalent to the nlrb with jurisdiction over railway labor disputes.id.at.
