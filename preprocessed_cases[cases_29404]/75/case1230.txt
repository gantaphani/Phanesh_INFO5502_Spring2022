in this wrongful death action against an interstate motor carrier,we hold that the carrier,having undertaken an activity which can be lawfully carried on only under a public franchise or authority and which involves possible danger to the public,is liable to the plaintiffs for harm caused by the negligence of the carrier independent contractor notwithstanding that the carrier cargo was exempt from certain economic regulations 
background 
the surface transportation board formerly the interstate commerce commission and the secretary of transportation enforce the united states government transportation policy with regard to transportation by motor carrier a,and the board has jurisdiction over the transportation of property by motor carrier between a place in one state and a place in another state.a.although there are several exemptions from this jurisdiction,and although there is a specific statutory exemption for the transportation by motor carrier of agricultural or horticultural commodities,including poultry a b gold kist,united states,affd.sub nom.interstate commerce commission gold kist,d it is the cargo that is exempt,not the carrier,and the exempt nature of the commodity has no bearing on the application of financial responsibility and safety regulations adopted by the surface transportation board.exempt motor carrier means a person engaged in transportation exempt from economic regulation by the federal motor carrier safety administration under.exempt motor carriers are subject to the federal motor carrier safety regulations century indem.carlson cir,safety regulations govern trucks,and exemptions apply only to cargo royal indem.jacobsen,braden turner.dallum farmers trucking ass.
in november,in georgia,harrison poultry,asked pettey leach trucking,plt to arrange transportation to california for a load of frozen poultry.plt agreed,and harrison poultry issued a bill of lading in which plt was identified as the carrier.plt arranged for sky transportation,to pick up the poultry,which it did the bill of lading was signed by a driver employed by sky and driving a truck registered to sky.when it reached california on december,the truck negligently collided with a motorcycle driven by juan manuel serna,killing serna.serna widow and children collectively serna sued sky and the truck driver but not plt for wrongful death damages and settled that action for about million serna i.serna then filed this action serna ii against plt,claiming plt is vicariously liable for sky negligence plt answered,alleging as an affirmative defense that it was acting as a broker,not a carrier 
at plt request,the trial court tried plt affirmative defense first and without a jury.at the conclusion of serna evidence,plt moved for nonsuit and the motion was granted,the trial court finding as serna claimed that plt was acting as a carrier,not as a broker,and finding on undisputed evidence as plt claimed that sky was an independent contractor,but then concluding as a matter of law that plt was not vicariously liable for sky negligence.
the court reasoned thus the truck involved in this accident was by stipulation a commercial motor vehicle within the meaning of the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act see also id.and ordinarily would have been subject to the surface transportation board registration and permit requirements.but because this truck was transporting frozen poultry,it was exempt from the act registration and permit requirements a b gold kist,united states,supra.and,therefore,not at the time of the accident carrying on an activity which can be lawfully carried on only under a franchise granted by public authority within the meaning of eli murphy cal d,fn,and gamboa conti trucking,th,fn,d.hence,said the trial court,plt is not liable for the negligence of sky,an independent contractor.millsap federal express d.fonseca county of orange d.
judgment was entered in favor of plt.serna appeals,and plt has filed a protective.
discussion 
the essence of serna primary claim is that exempt and unregulated are not synonymous,that the frozen poultry exemption does not leave plt unregulated by a statutory scheme enacted for the protection of the public,and that plt was at the time of the accident carrying on an activity which could be lawfully conducted only under a public franchise or authority and which involved an unreasonable risk of harm to others.it follows,according to serna,that plt is vicariously liable for the torts of sky,its independent contractor.we agree,and therefore do not reach serna other claims of error.
taylor oakland scavenger.
the seminal california case is taylor oakland scavenger cal d.in taylor,a garbage truck struck a high school student on the school premises.the student sued the truck driver,the truck owner,the school district,and oakland scavenger company,a garbage collector working under a contract with the city of oakland.on oakland scavenger appeal following a verdict in favor of the plaintiff,oakland scavenger claimed it was not liable for the driver negligence because the truck owner was an independent contractor over whom oakland scavenger exercised little supervision or control.id.at.the supreme court disagreed 
an employer is generally liable for negligent acts of an employee performed within the scope of employment,but if an independent contractor rather than master and servant relationship exists,the independent contractor usually is alone liable for his negligent acts.if,however,an individual or corporation undertakes to carry on an activity involving possible danger to the public under a license or franchise granted by public authority subject to certain obligations or liabilities imposed by the public authority,these liabilities may not be evaded by delegating performance to an independent contractor.the original contractor remains subject to liability for harm caused by the negligence of the independent contractor employed to do the work.taylor oakland scavenger,supra,cal d at,emphasis added.
gaskill calaveras cement.
in gaskill calaveras cement d,the court of appeal refused to apply the rule announced in taylor to a defendant who was not operating under a franchise.according to gaskill,the taylor rule is principally applicable to public service corporations,which,as such,are permitted by their franchises to use instrumentalities which are peculiarly dangerous unless carefully operated,and the rule does not apply to the carrying on of activities which involve no special danger and which can be lawfully carried on by private persons without liability for the misconduct of the contractors to whom they are entrusted.id.at.
eli murphy 
the rule articulated in taylor was reaffirmed by the supreme court in eli murphy,supra,cal d,in eli,the plaintiffs were injured when their car was struck by a tractor and semitrailer driven and owned by the murphys and used to transport freight under a contract between the murphys and,a highway common carrier licensed by the california public utilities commission puc.id.at.on appeal following a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs,the supreme court agreed with the plaintiffs that under both the common law and certain regulations of the puc,as a highway common carrier,could not delegate its duties to an independent contractor so as to escape liability for their negligent performance.id.at.
the common law principle upon which plaintiffs rely has been enunciated in section of the restatement of torts,and has frequently been applied to impose liability upon franchised common carriers who have engaged independent contractors to transport goods over the public highways.citations.we have concluded that it is applicable here,operating as a highway common carrier,is engaged in a business attended with very considerable risk citations,and the legislature has subjected it and similar carriers to the full regulatory power of the puc to protect the safety of the general public.citations.the effectiveness of safety regulations is necessarily impaired if a carrier conducts its business by engaging independent contractors over whom it exercises no control.if by the same device it could escape liability for the negligent conduct of its contractors,not only would the incentive for careful supervision of its business be reduced,but members of the public who are injured would be deprived of the financial responsibility of those who had been granted the privilege of conducting their business over the public highways.accordingly,both to protect the public from financially irresponsible contractors,and to strengthen safety regulations,it is necessary to treat the carrier duties as nondelegable.citations.
the legislature has classified highway common carriers such as apart from others,and by so doing has indicated special concern with the safety of their operations in view of the more extensive and regular operations of highway common carriers as compared with others,the legislature could reasonably conclude that the safety of their operations is of special importance and legislate accordingly.highway common carriers may not,therefore,insulate themselves from liability for negligence occurring in the conduct of their business by engaging independent contractors to transport freight for them.eli murphy,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
snyder southern cal.edison.
in snyder southern cal.edison cal d,the supreme court quoted at length from eli murphy,supra,cal d,then expanded the nondelegable duty rule this way 
the rule of nondelegable duty has been applied to the maintenance of premises by a landlord through an independent contractor with respect to his tenants or their employees citations to the owner of an amusement concession operated by an independent contractor when a patron was injured citations and to the owner of property who,through an independent contractor,so repaired part of the premises as to cause damage to the one occupying the floor below citation.where an activity involving possible danger to the public is carried on under public franchise or authority,the one engaging in the activity may not delegate to an independent contractor the duties or liabilities imposed on him by the public authority citations and generally speaking there are many situations in which the person can not absolve himself from liability by delegating his duties to an independent contractor.citations.snyder southern cal.edison,supra,cal d at,emphasis added.
klein leatherma 
in klein leatherman d,where the subhauler permit had been revoked and he was operating without the required public liability insurance,the court of appeal noted that snyder southern cal.edison,supra,cal d at page,spoke in terms of an activity carried on under a public franchise or authority.klein leatherman,supra,d at,emphasis in original.the court of appeal then held that,in consonance with the trend of such decisions,the facts and public policy involved in this case require us to hold that the duties of care of the defendant leatherman,as a common carrier operating with a permit and as a contract carrier citation were nondelegable and that he is chargeable with the negligence of his subhauler and its driver at the time of the plaintiff injury,the subhauler had forfeited its legal permission to operate on the highways.therefore,its performance can only be legalized by inferring the subhauler was an agent of leatherman,operating under his permit.citations.a highway contract carrier engaging another as a subhauler thus is under a practical compulsion to verify that the subhauler possesses an unrevoked permit and the required insurance coverage.this is in the public interest,as well as his own.id.at.a petition for review was denied by the supreme court.id.at.
millsap federal express.
the plaintiff in millsap federal express,supra,d,was injured when her car was struck by a car driven by christopher pence.at the time of the accident,pence worked for nce as an independent contractor and was delivering a package that had been flown to california by federal express.millsap sued pence,nce,and federal express on the theory that pence was an employee of nce acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident,and that federal express had contracted with nce for the work done by pence id.at.nce and federal express prevailed on motions for summary judgment,and nce judgment was affirmed on appeal.after holding that pence was in fact nce independent contractor,the court of appeal explained the rules this way 
it has been held that the general rule of nonliability of an employer of an independent contractor for the contractor negligence is subject to exceptions of such magnitude as to leave only a small area in which the general rule operates.citations.millsap contends liability resulting from pence delivery of packages is nondelegable because the operation is regulated by a public agency.the basis for this argument is found in section of the restatement second of torts an individual or a corporation carrying on an activity which can be lawfully carried on only under a franchise granted by public authority and which involves an unreasonable risk of harm to others,is subject to liability for physical harm caused to such others by the negligence of a contractor employed to do work in carrying on the activity.
this rule ordinarily applies where a public service corporation attempts to delegate its duty to an independent contractor.citation.the rule has,however,also been held to apply if an employer is subject to regulations enacted for the protection of the public.an employer is generally liable for negligent acts of an employee performed within the scope of employment,but if an independent contractor rather than master and servant relationship exists,the independent contractor usually is alone liable for his negligent acts.if,however,an individual or corporation undertakes to carry on an activity involving possible danger to the public under a license or franchise granted by public authority subject to certain obligations or liabilities imposed by the public authority.these liabilities may not be evaded by delegating performance to an independent contractor.the original contractor remains subject to liability for harm caused by the negligence of the independent contractor employed to do the work.citation.
in eli murphy,supra,cal d,for example,the activity at issue was the operation of a tractor and semitrailer an activity which is attended with very considerable risk citation,and is highly regulated in order to protect the public safety.citation.the court in that case found that the effectiveness of those regulations would be impaired if the carrier could circumvent them by having the regulated operations conducted by an independent contractor.it followed that highway common carriers may not,therefore,insulate themselves from liability for negligence occurring in the conduct of their business by engaging independent contractors to transport freight for them.citation.
millsap introduced evidence that federal express carried a certificate from the interstate commerce commission and,accordingly,was required by that agency to carry liability insurance.citation.from this she argues that federal express must be held responsible for any negligence attributable to nce.federal express,however,is not a party to this appeal.
the pivotal issue is whether nce operations were subject to certain obligations or liabilities imposed by the public authority such that nce must be held responsible for the negligence of an independent contractor to whom it delegated those duties.the relevant statutes,and the record,indicate that it should not be held so responsible.thus,united states code section,provides a the interstate commerce commission does not have jurisdiction under this subchapter over b transportation of property including baggage by motor vehicle as part of a continuous movement which,prior or subsequent to such part of the continuous movement,has been or will be transported by an air carrier that nce was not regulated makes inapplicable the rule stated in section of the restatement second of torts and in eli murphy and related cases.millsap federal express,supra,d at,emphasis added.
