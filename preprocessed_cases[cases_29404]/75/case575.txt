the petitioners challenge the decision of the surface transportation board,which,after considering the issues that we remanded to it in mid states coalition for progress surface transp,cir,and certain other issues,again approved a proposal of the dakota,minnesota eastern railroad corporation dm e to construct approximately miles of new rail line to reach the coal mines of wyoming powder river basin prb and to upgrade nearly miles of existing rail line in minnesota and south dakota.the petitioners contend that in giving its approval the board violated and the national environmental policy act nepa,see.we deny the petition.
dm e is required to obtain approval from the board before constructing the new rail line.see.because granting such approval is a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,nepa requires the board to evaluate the environmental impact of the project.c.the board therefore prepared both a draft environmental impact statement deis and a final environmental impact statement feis examining the environmental effects of the proposal,and after imposing conditions designed to mitigate the project environmentally adverse effects pursuant to its authority under c,the board approved the project in.
we reversed the board approval of the project for failure to comply with nepa and remanded the case to the board.as relevant here,we directed the board to give further consideration to its decision not to impose mitigating conditions for horn noise as distinct from wayside noise and to consider the expected environmental effects of increased coal consumption due to the availability of shorter and cheaper rail routes for prb coal distribution.mid states,at.petitioners do not challenge the board disposition of the other remanded issues.
on remand,the board issued a draft supplemental environmental impact statement dseis,and after receiving comments to the dseis,it issued a final supplemental environmental impact statement fseis.the board thereafter approved the dm e project based on the analysis in the dseis and the fseis,specifically addressing the remanded issues as well as additional issues raised during the supplemental environmental review.the board reimposed the mitigating conditions that it initially imposed in its approval,modifying one of the conditions to require dm e community liaisons to assist communities or other entities interested in establishing and funding quiet zones zones in which horn noise is eliminated.
relatedly,after the board initial approval of the construction project in,it separately approved dm e acquisition of over miles of existing rail line in minnesota,iowa,kansas,missouri,wisconsin,and illinois from i m rail link imrl,with which dm e has a connection at owatonna,minnesota.as discussed below,petitioners raise this addition to dm e rail lines as an alternative routing to the contested route through rochester,minnesota the rochester route connects to points east at winona,on minnesota eastern border.
the administrative procedure act governs our review of the board compliance with nepa,and requires us to hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
in reviewing the board decision,we keep in mind that nepa requires the board to take a hard look at the environmental consequences of a major federal action before approving such action.baltimore gas natural res.def.council,d internal quotations marks and citation omitted.as we remarked in mid states,o ur role in the nepa process is simply to ensure that the agency has adequately considered and disclosed the environmental impact of its actions and that its decision is not arbitrary or capricious.mid states,at quoting baltimore gas,at.
we turn first to the argument raised by the mayo foundation,the city of rochester,and olmsted county,that dm e acquisition of imrl constitutes significant new circumstances that should give rise to the consideration of this new line as an alternative to routing trains through rochester,see c ii.the board disagreed,stating that it was not necessary to delay the seis to include consideration of the impacts of the imrl acquisition the imrl acquisition and the dm e construction project are separate and distinct,and each has its own utility and benefit.dakota,eastern.into the powder river basin,stb finance docket at,wl,at stb served,hereafter stb decision.
the board is required to consider all reasonable alternatives.see a.it is not required,however,to consider alternatives that would frustrate the very purpose of the project.as we said in city of richfield,cir,an alternative is unreasonable if it does not fulfill the purpose of the project.see also missouri mining,cir citizens against burlington,busey,cert.denied,d.
even though the board decision does not explicitly state that it did not consider the imrl alternative because that route is simply inconsistent with the project purposes,we believe that this is implicit in its decision.for one thing,the board noted that it had made a preliminary finding in that there would be transportation and other public benefits from the proposed new line due to improved productivity and efficiency over this shorter route.stb decision at,wl,at.furthermore,in stating that the construction and acquisition projects are separate and distinct,and each has its own utility and benefit,we believe that the board was relying on and implicitly importing into its decision its earlier findings in both the acquisition and construction proceedings.
the board recognized in its decision that central to the success of dm e proposed construction project would be its ability to have multiple routing options,including routing trains over the lines of other railroad companies.there,the board stated that dm e plan depends on its ability to interchange cars with other railroads,and noted that dm e application identifies three primary interchange points with other railroads up at mankato,mn i m rail link at owatonna,mn and up,cp and i m at city,mn.dakota,eastern.into the powder river basin,stb finance docket,wl,at,emphasis added hereafter stb decision.removing the ability to route trains through rochester,minnesota,to the connection point at winona,minnesota,would therefore frustrate the purpose of the construction project.
the board also discussed at length in its decision the competitive advantages of a prb connection added to the dm e line,primarily focusing on dm e shorter,more direct route as compared to its competitors transporting prb coal to eastern markets.for example,the board concluded that b ased on dm e mileage advantage to the great lakes we find adequate support in the record for dm e claim that it could gain a share of the coal delivered to this market.stb decision at,wl,at.the board further found that dm e assertion that it would gain a share of the tonnage of the upper midwest rail market is based on its mileage advantage to plants accounting for a majority of the tonnages in that market we think that dm e argument that it would become the dominant rail carrier of coal in the upper midwest market is supported on the present record.id.at,wl,at.again,with respect to the upper mississippi river market,the board stated because the plants in this market currently ship of their coal from wyoming and the dm e route is at least miles shorter than either bnsf or up from wyoming origins,it appears that dm e could have the upper hand in this market.id.at,wl,at.
the board relied on these findings in determining the public benefit and financial soundness of the prb construction project.and,as the board points out in its brief in this appeal,the dm e route through rochester would be about miles shorter for movements to certain key plants in wisconsin than a circuitous dm route through owatonna that petitioners would have the board force on dm 
with respect to the imrl acquisition,the board decision in that case points to multiple justifications for the acquisition that are unrelated to dm e prb construction.for example,the board concluded that s hippers on the dm e syst
