over the objection of raytheon aircraft company raytheon,the circuit court of clair county ruled that a settlement agreement entered into by the administrators of the estates of johnson,carlson,fries,berger,beville,desalle,hefflebower and reed plaintiffs herein and the city of quincy quincy was made in good faith within the meaning of the joint tortfeasor contribution act contribution act.ilcs et west.that determination was affirmed by the appellate court.unpublished order under supreme court rule.raytheon now appeals the finding of good faith before this court,arguing that the circuit court abused its discretion when it refused to allow discovery or to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding quincy relative culpability before deciding that the settlement and release were made in good faith.raytheon also asks this court to decide whether a nonsettling tortfeasor who challenges the good faith of a settlement has the burden of proving the absence of good faith by a preponderance of the evidence or by the higher clear and convincing standard.
for reasons that follow,we affirm the appellate court judgment upholding the circuit court finding of good faith.
background 
on november,united express flight,carrying passengers and a crew of two,attempted to land on runway at baldwin field,a towerless municipal airport owned and operated by the city of quincy in adams county,illinois.runway runs northwest and southeast.as united express flight was attempting to land,a small privately owned aircraft,beechcraft king air,registration no,piloted by neil reinwald and laura brooks winkleman,attempted to take off at baldwin field on runway,which runs northeast and southwest.the two aircrafts collided at the intersection of the two runways,killing everyone aboard both aircrafts.
representatives of eight of the passengers aboard the united express aircraft filed wrongful death and survival suits in clair county,naming as defendants united airlines,and great lakes aviation,alleged to have operated united express flight as a joint enterprise katherine gathje and darin mccombs,the pilot and copilot of the united express plane neil reinwald and laura brooks winkleman,the pilot and alleged copilot of the king air aircraft robert clarkson and harvey imber,of the king air private aircraft and raytheon aircraft company,successor to beech aircraft corporation,the manufacturer of the united express aircraft.none of the plaintiffs filed suit against the city of quincy.
raytheon filed contribution claims against quincy,alleging that quincy was subject to liability in tort for the wrongful deaths of plaintiffs decedents.the gravamen of the complaints was that quincy negligently failed to discharge its duty to business invitees to use ordinary care to provide reasonably safe ingress and egress from the airport.more specifically,raytheon alleged that united express flight attempted to land at baldwin field using a approach,which violated standard traffic pattern procedure for towerless airports,that quincy had been informed by the national transportation safety board that commercial aircraft were landing at baldwin field using a approach,and that quincy negligently failed to give appropriate or effective notice to all commercial airlines that they were required to conform their landings with standard traffic pattern procedures.raytheon also moved to transfer venue in all of the cases to adams county on grounds of forum non conveniens.
quincy moved for the dismissal of the actions.quincy first argued that dismissal was required because clair county was not the proper venue.suit could only be brought against quincy in adams county because a ctions must be brought against a municipal corporation in the county in which its principal office is located or in the county in which the transaction or some part thereof occurred out of which the cause of action arose.ilcs west.as an alternative argument,quincy contended that the contribution actions could not be maintained against it because it is absolutely immune from liability in tort pursuant to the local governmental and governmental employees tort immunity act ilcs et west.
before the trial court ruled on quincy motion to dismiss or raytheon motion to transfer venue,quincy settled with each of the eight plaintiffs for a sum of plus costs,conditioned on the plaintiffs release of quincy from all claims.plaintiffs were also required to obtain a court ruling on the good faith of the settlement agreements and a dismissal of all claims.
as required by the settlements,each plaintiff filed a motion seeking a ruling.the motions brought by plaintiffs johnson,carlson,and fries were argued at a hearing before circuit court judge lloyd cueto.the motions brought by the remaining five,beville,desalle,hefflebower and argued at a hearing before circuit court judge michael.arguments presented at both hearings were substantially similar.raytheon opposed the plaintiffs motions,arguing that the settlements were not made in good faith or,alternatively,that a ruling would be premature at this juncture.raytheon asked both judges to allow discovery and to conduct an evidentiary hearing to develop a factual basis for deciding whether the settlements were made in good faith.
ruling independently,both circuit court judges denied the request for discovery and an evidentiary hearing.both judges held that,in light of all the surrounding circumstances,the settling parties had established that the settlements were made in good faith and that raytheon had not presented any evidence to overcome the presumption of good faith.the settlements were approved and raytheon claims against quincy were dismissed.the circuit court orders contained an express finding,pursuant to supreme court rule a a,that the judgment dismissing quincy from all claims was final and appealable.raytheon appealed and the cases were consolidated for review.
the fifth district of our appellate court affirmed the circuit court ruling.the appellate court agreed that the settling parties had made a sufficient preliminary showing that the settlements had been made in good faith.the court also held that raytheon had not met its burden of proving the absence of good faith by clear and convincing evidence.the appellate court rejected raytheon argument that a finding could not be made without determining the relative liability of the settling party and,consequently,held that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing before deciding the good faith of the settlements.
raytheon petitioned for leave to appeal and we granted the petition.a.
raytheon raises two issues for our consideration.first,raytheon asks this court to resolve a split among the lower courts as to the burden of proof imposed upon a nonsettling tortfeasor who challenges a settlement on the grounds that the transaction was not executed in good faith within the meaning of the contribution act.raytheon contends that when challenging the good faith of a settlement,a nonsettling party has the burden of proving the absence of good faith by a preponderance of the evidence instead of the higher clear and convincing standard.second,raytheon asks this court to reverse the circuit court ruling that the settlement between plaintiffs and quincy was made in good faith.raytheon contends that the settlement constitutes bad faith because the settlement amount of per plaintiff is grossly disproportionate to the overall damages claimed by each plaintiff.raytheon also contends that the circuit court could not have determined whether the settlement was made in good faith within the meaning of the contribution act without determining quincy relative culpability.thus,raytheon argues that the circuit court should have allowed discovery and conducted an evidentiary hearing so that a factual basis for determining quincy relative culpability could have been developed before a determination was made.
the contribution act was enacted by our legislature in as a codification of this court decision in skinner division package machinery.see in re guardianship of babb.the contribution act creates a statutory right of contribution in actions where or more persons are subject to liability in tort arising out of the same injury to person or property,or the same wrongful death ilcs,a west,to the extent that a tortfeasor pays more than his pro rata share of the common liability ilcs b west.
the act provides in section c 
c when a release or covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith to one or more persons liable in tort arising out of the same injury or the same wrongful death,it does not discharge any of the other tortfeasors from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless its terms so provide but it reduces the recovery on any claim against the others to the extent of any amount stated in the release or the covenant,or in the amount of the consideration actually paid for it,whichever is greater.ilcs c west.
the good faith of a settlement is the only limitation which the act places on the right to settle and it is the nature of a settlement that extinguishes the contribution liability of the settling tortfeasor.ilcs d west dubina mesirow realty development,in re guardianship of babb,at.the act,however,does not define the term good faith,nor does it provide any procedural guidelines as to when or how a determination is to be made.
burden of proof 
in the case at bar,raytheon asks this court to resolve a conflict which has arisen with regard to the burden of proof imposed on a nonsettling tortfeasor to show that a settlement was not made in good faith within the meaning of the contribution act.raytheon contends that the preponderance of the evidence standard should be imposed,rather than the stricter clear and convincing evidence standard.we agree.
in barreto city of waukegan,d,one of the first cases in this state to consider the issue of good faith within the context of the contribution act,the court,relying on fisher superior court,d,formulated a basic procedure for deciding the issue of good faith.rejecting the notion that a jury or bench trial was required to determine whether a settlement was made in good faith,the barreto court held that,when a trial court is notified that a settlement has been reached and a ruling is sought,the trial court should rule on the good faith of the settlement as soon as practicable,apart from and in advance of any trial on the tort issues.barreto,d at.further,the barreto court held that the settling parties seeking discharge from contribution liability should bear the initial burden of making a preliminary showing of good faith,but that once a preliminary showing is made,the burden of proof on the issue of good faith of the settlor shifts to the party who claims that the settlement was not made in good faith or is collusive.barreto,d at.
this has been the basic scheme employed by courts of this state when deciding the issue of good faith.see wilson v.the hoffman group.however,this court has never articulated what quantum of evidence must be produced,either by the settling parties to establish a preliminary showing of good faith,or by the nonsettling challengers of the settlement to prove the absence of good faith.there are,however,a number of appellate court decisions which have spoken to these issues.
in wasmund metropolitan sanitary district of greater chicago,d,the court held that,because public policy strongly favors the peaceful and voluntary resolution of claims,w here there is a resolution of a claim by virtue of a release or covenant,a presumption of validity is created and the party challenging the release must carry the burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.subsequently,courts,citing wasmund and its progeny,have applied these same standards when deciding the good faith of settlements.see warsing material handling services,d,after a preliminary showing of good faith by the settling parties,the burden shifts to the challenging party to prove the settlement invalid by clear and convincing evidence higginbottom pillsbury,d,after a preliminary showing has been made,the party opposing the settlement must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the settlement is invalid pritchard swedishamerican hospital,d,when settling parties represent to the court that they have reached a settlement,identify the terms and show that consideration was given,a presumption of validity arises,which must be overcome by the party challenging the settlement by clear and convincing evidence melzer bausch lomb,d,once a preliminary showing of settlement has been made,the burden shifts to the party challenging the settlement to establish that it was not made in good faith by presenting clear and convincing evidence of fraud or mutual mistake ruffino hinze,d,where a preliminary showing of good faith is made,a presumption of validity arises which must be overcome by clear and convincing evidence mckanna,d,assertion that an agreement is invalid must be proved by clear and convincing evidence bituminous insurance ruppenstein,d,presumption of validity arises when a claim is settled by release or covenant and,thereafter,one challenging the release bears the burden of proving invalidity pinto trucking service,d,the party challenging the settlement has the burden of producing clear and convincing evidence to establish the invalidity of the settlement.
in general,for a preliminary showing of good faith,courts have required only that the settling parties prove the existence of a legally valid settlement agreement.in some instances,this included the obligation to prove that consideration was given and received.proof of consideration was then held to be prima facie evidence of validity,which gave rise to a presumption that the settlement was in good faith.see wreglesworth arctco,d,solimini thomas,d,mcdermott metropolitan sanitary district,d.
with regard to the standard of proof imposed on the nonsettling tortfeasor challenging the good faith of the settlement,clear and convincing evidence was generally recognized as the appropriate standard.that standard,however,was called into question in bowers murphy miller,d.in bowers,the court held that,because of the competing policy considerations which must be weighed when deciding good faith within the meaning of the contribution act,it would be more appropriate to require nonsettling tortfeasors to prove the bad faith of a settlement by a preponderance of the evidence.following bowers,other panels of the first district have adopted the preponderance standard.see wreglesworth arctco,d at,stickler american augers,d,evans tabernacle god church of holiness in christ,d,the burden of proof rests on the nonsettling tortfeasor to establish a lack of good faith by a preponderance of the evidence.
having reviewed the relevant case law,we conclude that,when a court determines whether a settlement was negotiated in good faith within the meaning of the contribution act,the settling parties carry the initial burden of making a preliminary showing of good faith.at a minimum,the settling parties must show the existence of a legally valid settlement agreement.however,not all legally valid settlements satisfy the requirements of the contribution act.see stickler american augers,d,stickler american augers,d,bowers,d at.therefore,other factual evidence may be necessary before the court may determine,as an initial matter,whether the settlement is fair and reasonable in light of the policies underlying the contribution act.
further,we are persuaded by the decision in bowers that,once a preliminary showing of good faith has been made by the settling parties,the party challenging the good faith of the settlement need prove the absence of good faith by a preponderance of the evidence.the clear and convincing standard,when traced back to its genesis in wasmund,rests on a body of law where the burden was on a party to a settlement attempting to set aside the settlement upon a claim of fraud,misrepresentation,or mistake of fact.see mccomb seestadt,d,martin,d.the bowers court concluded 
when we address setting aside a release on the application of a party to the agreement,we take into consideration the rights of the contracting parties tempered by a public policy favoring settlement.
