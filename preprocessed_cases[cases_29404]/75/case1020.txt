learned hand once remarked that agencies tend to fall into grooves,and when they get into grooves,then god save you to get them out.judge hand never met the national transportation safety board.in this case,we grant the petition for review because the board has failed adequately to explain its departures from its own precedent in no fewer than three significant respects.
petitioner tilak ramaprakash was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in doraville,georgia,in december,and was convicted of that offense on february.as a licensed pilot,he was subject to federal aviation regulation far codified at,which requires pilots to provide the federal aviation administration faa with a written report of any motor vehicle action within sixty days.id.e.the regulation defines motor vehicle action to include a conviction for the violation of any federal or state statute relating to the operation of a motor vehicle while intoxicated by alcohol or a drug,while impaired by alcohol or a drug,or while under the influence of alcohol or a drug.id.c.
ramaprakash admits that he did not file the required report.his violation of far e occurred on april,when the period for filing the report ended.twelve months later,on april,the faa formally initiated administrative proceedings to suspend his pilot certificate by issuing a notice of proposed certificate action nopca.the nopca proposed to suspend his certificate for thirty days in accordance with far f,which provides that a violation of e is grounds for s uspension or revocation of any certificate issued under far part.in february,the faa ordered that ramaprakash license be suspended for thirty days.he appealed to the national transportation safety board ntsb or board.
before the ntsb,ramaprakash conceded that he had committed a far violation,but moved for dismissal of the faa action against him in light of the board stale complaint rule rule of the ntsb rules of practice in air safety proceedings,codified at.that rule provides,in pertinent part 
where the complaint states allegations of offenses which occurred more than months prior to the faa administrator advising respondent as to reasons for proposed certificate action,respondent may move to dismiss such allegations pursuant to the following provisions 
a in those cases where a complaint does not allege lack of qualification of the certificate holder 
the administrator shall be required to show by answer filed within days of service of the motion that good cause existed for the delay,or that the imposition of a sanction is warranted in the public interest,notwithstanding the delay or the reasons therefor.
if the administrator does not establish good cause for the delay or for imposition of a sanction notwithstanding the delay,the law judge shall dismiss the stale allegations and proceed to adjudicate only the remaining portion,if any,of the complaint 
it was undisputed that the faa had failed to meet rule deadline the nopca was issued nearly one year after ramaprakash far violation.the question before the ntsb was whether good cause existed for the delay.
answering that question requires some understanding of how the faa monitors compliance with the far reporting requirement.one way it does so is by compiling and periodically sending to the national driver register ndr lists of individuals who seek to obtain or renew their medical certifications.the ndr then matches the names against its own records,which contain information on individuals whose drivers licenses have been denied,revoked,suspended,or canceled for cause,or who have been convicted of serious driving offenses.see a.the information in the ndr is not detailed enough to show whether the offense involved is one for which a report must be filed under far when the faa receives a computer tape from the ndr with a list of the names that have matched an ndr record,an faa investigator must then check the national law enforcement telecommunications system nlets database for details of each airman motor vehicle incident.if the nlets data show that the incident was a reportable offense,the faa investigator then searches the agency records to determine whether the airman filed the required report.
a detailed affidavit from faa official mark sweeney described the course of the faa investigation of ramaprakash violation.on may,the faa received from the ndr a computer tape indicating a motor vehicle incident in georgia involving ramaprakash.the tape was routed to an faa investigator in may,but apparently no action was taken until september,when the investigator was transferred to a new faa assignment.a second investigator took possession of the tape,but this investigator too was reassigned in october,and the tape was passed on to a third investigator.after working through a backlog of prior tapes,this investigator turned to the tape that included ramaprakash record and conducted the nlets query on february.the nlets database revealed that the incident disclosed on the ndr was in fact a dui conviction,and by february,the investigator had searched faa records and learned that ramaprakash had failed to report it.see sweeney aff.at,ja.
the board,by a vote,concluded that the faa had shown good cause for the delay in issuing the nopca.the board stated that under rule,the administrator must show that good cause existed for the delay in discovering the offense and that,upon discovery,she investigated the matter with due diligence.administrator ramaprakash,ntsb order no.february,at,available at wl order denying appeal.the ntsb further found that the faa did not have an indication of a possible section e violation until the nlets query indicated that the ndr listing was in reference to a reportable motor vehicle action,and that the faa had been sufficiently diligent in proceeding to issue the nopca after receiving the nlets information.id.at.the board then observed that there was no evidence that the delay had affected ramaprakash ability to defend against the faa complaint,and concluded that the faa was entitled to some but not unlimited leeway in prioritizing its enforcement efforts.id.at.in dissent,member goglia joined by member hammerschmidt rejected the majority contention that rule allowed a balancing of the faa interest in prioritizing enforcement against pilots need for timely prosecution there either is a stale complaint rule,or there is not.id.at.
ramaprakash sought reconsideration,but the board refused to reconsider its decision.in its brief order,the board stated 
as we explained in our original decision,we decline to extend the stale complaint rule under these circumstances,where the delay is to respondent ability to defend against the charges and accrued,essentially,because the administrator chose to delegate her resources in a manner that would not immediately,but eventually,detect airmen with a mandatory reporting requirement that respondent admits to not adhering to.
administrator ramaprakash,ntsb order no.july,at,available at wl order denying reconsideration.member goglia,again joined by member hammerschmidt,dissented.id.at.this petition for review followed.
under the administrative procedure act apa,a court may set aside agency action found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.our review under the apa is highly deferential,but agency action is arbitrary and capricious if it departs from agency precedent without explanation.agencies are free to change course as their expertise and experience may suggest or require,but when they do so they must provide a reasoned analysis indicating that prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed,not casually ignored.greater boston television fcc,see also philadelphia gas works ferc.an agency failure to come to grips with conflicting precedent constitutes an inexcusable departure from the essential requirement of reasoned decision making.columbia broad.fcc.
in the orders challenged here,the board deviated from its precedent in three respects.the first is in the ntsb answer to the question whether faa delays should be more readily excused if the alleged far violation is relatively serious.in administrator jet,ntsb,wl a case involving an alleged lack of qualification the board unequivocally rejected the argument that it should bend its procedural rules because the alleged violation was serious.in dismissing the faa appeal on the grounds that the faa had failed to show good cause for its failure to meet the prescribed deadline for filing its appeal brief,the ntsb stated 
we decline the invitation to carve out for the administrator benefit alone a public interest exception to our policy of dismissing appeals that are not prosecuted with due diligence.
we recognize that even cases involving important air safety issues can fall victim to procedural however,we think the public interest and basic principles of fairness favor rules that treat litigants equally over those that,based on presumptions flowing from the seriousness of alleged conduct,create procedural advantage for one party.that circumstance counsels against both the necessity and the propriety of modifying the good cause standard in a way that,in effect,would allow the administrator to escape responsibility for compliance with rules of practice we strictly apply to all others.
in a nearly identical case four years later,the board again refused to find that the public interest in air safety could create an exception to the board requirement that good cause be shown to excuse a delay 
p rocedural decisions should not be based on generalities or presumptions about the importance or the desirability of reaching the merits of a case a party ha s not handled in accordance with applicable rules.
we continue to believe that requiring parties to exercise a high level of diligence in the prosecution of their appeals to us is the best way to ensure that all cases,and especially those that may involve extraordinary air safety concerns,will be heard by the full board.
petition of white,ntsb order no,wl,at.
in its order denying appeal in this case,however,the ntsb considered the nature and seriousness of ramaprakash far violation in determining whether the faa had shown good cause.the board emphasized that it would be particularly difficult to justify applying the stale complaint rule to bar the faa complaint,given the importance to air safety of monitoring the infractions of certificated airmen,and the likelihood that they would go undetected but for the requirements of far section e.order denying appeal at.
this suggestion that the board is more willing to find good cause in cases that have serious implications for air safety is inconsistent with jet and white,and the board did not attempt to explain that departure from precedent.nor did the board explain how its statement comports with the text of rule.the rule allows a stale complaint to escape dismissal if the faa can show good cause for the delay,but it also states that a stale complaint can survive if the faa can show that the imposition of a sanction is warranted in the public interest,notwithstanding the delay or the reasons therefor.a.there would appear to be little need for the public interest to be weighed in any determination of whether good cause exists for delay,when the rule provides an independent and adequate avenue by which stale complaints found to implicate the public interest can proceed.
indeed,the board in the past has found the seriousness of a violation to be a reason to be less,rather than more,lenient in finding good cause for delay.the board noted in administrator dill,ntsb order no,wl,that the stale complaint rule stems from the fact that unsafe conditions require speedy remedy and that the rule is meant to advance,not retard,safety enforcement.id.at.an ntsb administrative law judge later took dill to mean that justice delayed is safety denied.neel administrator,ntsb docket,wl,app.administrative law judge opinion at.in ramaprakash case,by contrast,the board accepted the argument that serious violations can serve to excuse investigative delays that even when justice is delayed,safety is enhanced.
the board second departure from its precedent lies in its analysis of the role that prejudice plays under the stale complaint rule.for more than twenty years,the ntsb has explained that a party seeking dismissal of a stale complaint is not required to show prejudice from the delay.in administrator zanlunghi,ntsb,wl,the board was unequivocal rule does not impose on a respondent the burden of demonstrating that a specific delay has in fact prejudiced his defense.id.at.administrator parish,ntsb,wl,is equally clear rule reflects our recognition that a respondent ability to defend against faa charges can be seriously prejudiced through unreasonable delay the rule thus creates a presumption that prejudice does exist when six months have passed and a respondent has not been informed that action is contemplated id.at emphases added see also dill,wl,at the stale complaint rule does not impose on a respondent the burden of demonstrating that a specific delay has in fact prejudiced his defense.instead,a respondent is presumed to have been prejudiced citing zanlunghi administrator brea,ntsb order no,wl,at rule raises a presumption that a lapse of more than six months between the occurrence of an alleged far violation and the issuance of a nopca prejudices a respondent citing parish.
the board approach here is a complete.in the order denying appeal,the board stated 
ramaprakash does not assert that,had the complaint been filed sooner,he would have answered differently or been better equipped to defend against the administrator allegations.
in these circumstances,specifically,where a respondent ability to defend against a charge has not been compromised by the passage of time between the admitted violation and the action to sanction it,it would be arbitrary to dismiss the complaint under a rule designed to forestall evidentiary difficulties that can arise because of prosecutorial delay.
order denying appeal at.the board reiterated this holding in the order denying reconsideration as we explained in our original decision,we decline to extend the stale complaint rule under these circumstances,where the delay is to respondent ability to defend against the charges having admitted all factual allegations order denying reconsideration at.this language is impossible to square with zanlunghi,parish,and their progeny.those cases make it clear that prejudice is presumed when a complaint alleges violations that occurred more than six months before the nopca.applying the stale complaint rule to ramaprakash case would not extend the rule at all unless the board is no longer adopting a presumption of prejudice.
the faa argues that the board did not impose a requirement of prejudice that it simply concluded that the presumption of prejudice had been overcome in ramaprakash case.faa br.at.the ntsb has indeed indicated that the presumption of prejudice is rebuttable.see,dill,wl,at citing zanlunghi,ntsb at.contrary to the faa assertion,however,the board did not characterize its decision as a finding that the presumption in ramaprakash case had been rebutted.both of the challenged orders simply noted that prejudice was absent not that it had been presumed and then rebutted.order denying appeal at order denying reconsideration at.
the third,and perhaps most consequential,respect in which the board departed from its precedent involves the longstanding requirement of prosecutorial diligence in stale complaint cases.in denying ramaprakash appeal,the board noted that the stale complaint rule is designed to forestall evidentiary difficulties that can arise because of prosecutorial delay,order denying appeal at,but avoiding such prejudice is not the only purpose of the stale complaint rule.at least as important,the board has emphasized for decades,is the incentive that the rule provides for the faa to improve air safety by promptly investigating and punishing those who violate the far.as long ago as,the ntsb declared that i t is the purpose of the stale complaint rule to assure that the administrator investigation and prosecution of alleged regulatory violations is pursued with reasonable diligence and that prospective charges not be held over an
