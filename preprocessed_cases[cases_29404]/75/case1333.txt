this case is before the court on appeal from a decision of the fourth district court of appeal,liner workers temporary staffing,so d dca,which declared a state statute invalid.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.for the reasons expressed in our analysis,we reverse the fourth district with regard to the constitutional issue but hold that workers temporary staffing,wts is not liable to larry liner concerning its alleged violation of section b,florida statutes 
facts and procedural history 
from approximately december to march,liner worked as a day laborer for a labor hall that was operated by wts in broward county,florida.see liner,so d at.wts charged day laborers a fixed,uniform price of each way for transportation from this broward county labor hall to any of the worksites it serviced in the palm beach,broward,and dade county area area.see id.
on may,liner filed an original complaint against wts,alleging that it had violated section b,florida statutes,by overcharging liner and other day laborers for transportation to various worksites from its broward county labor hall and other workers for transportation from various labor halls located throughout the,the city of tallahassee,brevard county,pasco county,marion county,manatee county,johns county,and the city of gainesville.liner alleged that the class contained more than day laborers and sought relief in the amount of per violation pursuant to section.on august,liner filed a first amended complaint in which he limited the claim to the labor halls that wts operated in broward,brevard,marion,and volusia counties.
on january,the trial court held a conference with regard to whether class discovery should proceed before class certification.the trial court ruled that liner was required to make a preliminary showing during an evidentiary hearing that a valid cause of action existed under the act before the court would proceed to matters.on february,wts filed a counterclaim for declaratory relief.specifically,wts sought a judicial declaration that it had complied with the act section b is unconstitutionally vague and the provision of section is unconstitutionally excessive.wts also asserted that its transportation service was more similar to a carrier,which would deliver day laborers directly to a designated worksite,than a bus system that followed fixed routes.
on june,liner filed a second amended complaint.in this complaint,liner limited the claim to those day laborers overcharged by wts for transportation from the broward county labor hall to broward county worksites.liner asserted that wts overcharged in violation of section b because the cost of bus travel on the broward county transit system at that time was,while,in contrast,wts charged each way for its transportation.
on november,the trial to the earlier an evidentiary hearing on liner individual claim and the counterclaim of wts.see liner,so d at.the evidence revealed that liner was seeking in actual damages and in statutory damages arrival at the worksites for job assignments was crucial for those job assignments that commenced prior to,there was no bus service to ensure arrival liner worked job assignments for wts in the area between december and march and the average by the least expensive form of public transportation that would ensure public transportation to a random sample of these job assignments was 
after the evidence was presented,the parties stipulated that the trial court should consider the evidentiary hearing as a bench trial on the issue of wts liability to liner under section b.thus,the parties contemplated that any order of the trial court would constitute a judgment on liability only,not damages.the trial court subsequently ruled that wts had complied with the act section b is unconstitutionally vague and the provision of section is unconstitutionally excessive.
on appeal,the fourth district only affirmed the ruling of the trial court that section b,florida statutes,violates the due process clauses of both the united states and florida constitutions.see liner,so d at the district court reasoned that section b is unconstitutionally vague.see id.on august,liner filed a notice of appeal with this court.
ii.analysis 
wts liability to liner under the acti.introduction 
liner asserts that wts violated section b,florida statutes,by overcharging him for transportation from the labor hall in broward county to various worksites within that county.the trial court ruled that wts is not liable to liner under section b.we agree.we review the statutory interpretation conducted by the trial court to reach this ultimate ruling de novo,while we defer to those factual findings of the trial court that are supported by competent,substantial evidence from the record.see.women health counseling,state,so d.
at the outset,we emphasize that our statutory analysis applies exclusively to the version of the florida labor pool act that applied when wts allegedly overcharged day laborers for transportation to and from its broward county worksites between december and march.at that time,section b read 
no labor pool shall charge a day laborer 
b more than a reasonable amount to transport a worker to or from the designated worksite,but in no event shall the amount exceed the prevailing rate for public transportation in the geographic area 
b.stat.this version of section b was in effect from the act was.see ch,at,laws of.in,the legislature amended section b by making the following changes 
no labor pool shall charge a day laborer 
b more than a reasonable amount to transport a worker to or from the designated worksite,but in no event shall the amount exceed each way the prevailing rate for public transportation in the geographic area 
ch,at,laws of fla b.stat.
ii.remedial or penal in nature 
wts asserts that the labor pool act is penal in nature.in florida,the general rule is that any ambiguity present in a civil statute of a penal nature is construed in favor of the party alleged to have violated the statute.see diaz de la portilla.elections comm n,so d,dca.conversely,a remedial statute should be liberally construed to suppress the evil targeted by the legislature and to fulfill the intended remedy.see golf channel jenkins,so d.in opposition to wts,liner asserts that the legislature intended for the act to be remedial in nature 
the legislature finds that this part is necessary to provide for the health,safety,and of day laborers throughout the state and to establish uniform standards of conduct and practice for labor pools in the state,and this part shall be carried out in accordance with this purpose.
stat.entitled legislative intent.while the act is designed to remedy a specific evil,we nevertheless conclude that section b is a civil statute that is penal in nature because of the potentially extreme punitive damages provided by section.therefore,we must construe any ambiguity present in the act in favor of wts.
the statutory language present in section is not dispositive.instead,the determinative factor is the nature of the provision for damages imposed for violations of the act 
any worker aggrieved by a violation of shall have the right to bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the labor pool responsible for such violation.in any action commenced pursuant to this part,the worker shall be entitled to recover actual and consequential damages,or,whichever is greater,for each violation of this part,and costs.
stat.entitled remedies damages costs emphasis supplied.due to the nature of a claim filed pursuant to section b,the actual damages suffered by a complainant will usually be significantly less than the statutory damages per violation afforded by section.here,liner claimed that wts violated section b when it overcharged him cents for each instance of transportation to a broward county worksite on separate occasions,which produced only in actual damages.however,those separate transportation overcharges would produce in statutory damages.the amount of actual damages claimed by liner is minimal when compared to the amount he has claimed in statutory damages.it must also be remembered that the fee that wts charged for tr
