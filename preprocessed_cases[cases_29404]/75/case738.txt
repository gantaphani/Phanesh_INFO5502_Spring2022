these consolidated appeals involve suits against the city and county of san francisco,san francisco municipal transportation agency muni,and various individual defendants collectively,defendants for race and national origin discrimination in violation of.plaintiffs allege that defendants discriminated against them by giving preferential hiring treatment to asian and filipino workers.we do not consider the merits of the plaintiffs allegations,however,as the only issue before us is whether their claims are barred by the statute of limitations,as the district court found.we agree with the district court that the cause of action accrued and the statute of limitations began to run when the plaintiffs received notice they would not be hired,and equitable estoppel does not prevent the defendants from asserting a statute of limitations defense.accordingly,we affirm the district court in all respects.
facts and procedural history 
zolotarev,appeal 
in through,muni advertised various provisional positions for electrical transit system mechanics positions.muni considered applications and tests,as well as some interviews.in october,muni obtained funding to hire several permanent mechanics,and issued a job announcement for these permanent positions.the announcement contained the following requirement 
verification proof of all experience training needed to qualify must be submitted with the application verification may be waived if impossible to obtain.the applicant must submit a signed statement with the application explaining why verification can not be obtained failure to submit the required verification or request for waiver in a timely manner may result in the rejection of the application.
two plaintiffs,anatoliy zolotarev and yevgeniy skuratovsky,filed their initial complaint in january,together with several other plaintiffs who are not a party to this appeal the lukovsky action these plaintiffs alleged that the defendants discriminated on the basis of preferential treatment to asian and filipino applicants for the provisional and permanent positions by hiring asian and filipino applicants who did not meet the minimum qualifications.they also alleged defendants failed to provide information about the openings to potential candidates who were not asian or filipino.
plaintiff skuratovsky applied for two provisional positions in and,but was ranked below the hiring cutoff for both.he applied for a permanent position in october,but failed to include an experience verification or seek a waiver of the requirement.he received notice in november that his application had been disqualified for failure to provide the verification.
plaintiff zolotarev did not apply for any of the positions in or,however,he had previously applied for a similar mechanic position in,and claims to have been informed that his application would remain in the active file should a vacancy occur in the division.he was not contacted by muni about any jobs in or.
the lukovsky plaintiffs sought and were denied class certification.the court order,however,permitted the plaintiffs counsel to send letters to other individuals who could potentially have similar claims,so that all such claims might be tried by the same judge.the district court then granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants as to skuratovsky and zolotarev on statute of limitations grounds,concluding that these plaintiffs knew or should have known of their,that they had not been hired for the permanent several years before they filed their complaint.
glassman,appeal 
four glassman,morris jacobs,michael hall and ignacio applicants for positions with muni during.glassman applied in june and was disqualified in november,purportedly for failing to provide a written verification of his prior work experience.jacob application was rejected in october on the same grounds,as was reyes application in november.hall applied for a position in october and claims he never received notification that his application was rejected.
these plaintiffs received letters regarding the lukovsky action in and filed their complaint on march,alleging that defendants gave preferential treatment to asian and filipino applicants who did not meet the minimum qualifications for the job.they also contend defendants modified the requirements for positions in late to purportedly make it easier to hire asian and filipino applicants,and that the defendants failed to provide sufficient information about the positions to and candidates.
the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint under rule b of civil procedure on statute of limitations grounds,concluding that the plaintiffs had notice of their injury when they received the notices informing them they were not being hired,or,in the case of hall,by early when those accepted for the position would have reported to work.

discussion 
i.when did plaintiffs claims accrue 
when,as here,a federal civil rights statute does not include its own statute of limitations,federal courts borrow the forum state limitations period for personal injury torts,which the parties agree in this case is one year under california law.taylor regents of.of,cir applying limitations period to claims brought pursuant to,and although california law determines the length of the limitations period,federal law determines when a civil rights claim accrues.olsen idaho state bd.of,cir quoting morales city of los angeles,cir.accrual is the date on which the statute of limitations begins to run under federal law,a claim accrues when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action.id.quoting tworivers lewis,cir.
plaintiffs argue that their claims did not accrue until they knew both that they were not being hired and of the defendants alleged discriminatory intent.in other words,plaintiffs contend that knowledge of injury includes both the actual injury failure to hire and the legal wrong racial discrimination.the zolotarev plaintiffs assert they had no reason to know of the legal injury until informed years later by a muni employee that allegedly unqualified asians and filipinos had been hired the glassman plaintiffs claim they had no reason to know of the defendants discriminatory conduct until they received the letter informing them of the zolotarev lawsuit.
plaintiffs frame their argument in terms of the discovery rule,which postpones the beginning of the limitations period from the date the plaintiff is actually injured to the date when he discovers or reasonably should discover he has been injured.see boeing north,cir.however,this rule is already incorporated into federal accrual law.see cada baxter healthcare,cir.the real question,as noted above,is what do we mean by injury,that is,what must the plaintiffs discover that there has been an adverse action,or that the employer acted with discriminatory intent in performing that act 
this issue has not been expressly addressed in this circuit.see lyons england,cir noting that prior cases dealing with accrual under title vii had not resolved the more subtle question of when the date of a plaintiff notice that the act was discriminatory,and not the date of the act occurrence should be the preferred date for commencing the statute of limitations nor has the supreme court had occasion to clarify the issue.see passenger morgan,d id.at,concurring recognizing that although supreme court precedents seem to establish a relatively simple notice rule,courts continue to disagree on what the notice must be of quotations omitted emphasis in original but see id.at.noting that discrete acts,such as termination and refusal to hire,are easy to identify.
however,numerous other circuits have explicitly addressed this precise question in a variety of employment co
