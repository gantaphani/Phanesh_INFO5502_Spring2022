this case asks us to determine whether an arbitration proceeding touching on the interests of at least three parties but directly involving only two violates either the railway labor act rla,or basic notions of procedural due process or both.we conclude that the plain language of the rla contemplates public law boards comprised of only two partisan members and a neutral arbitrator with other interested parties participating as advocates at the hearings.we also conclude that this participation structure is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the underlying dispute in this case centers on which categories of railroad employees should perform the work of repairing signal systems.railroads,including csx transportation,csxt,have traditionally assigned this type of work to signalmen.the work required to perform the repairs,however,began to implicate a number of specialities as technology evolved.signals today involve rather sophisticated electronics,and some railroads,including csxt,now assign the work to communications employees.since both categories of workers have relevant expertise,it is unclear which is better suited to perform the maintenance.and it is inevitable that,regardless of which category of worker the railroad chooses,another category will object.
the work dispute here involves the choice of a single employee.csxt assigned work related to removing and installing a data radio near roanoke,alabama,to an electrician represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew.the brotherhood of railroad signalmen brs objected to this assignment,contending that under its collective bargaining agreement,csxt may assign this work only to a signalman.csxt asserted that it was free to assign this work either to a signalman or to an electrician.brs and csxt could not resolve this dispute and agreed to present it to public law board the board,a special board of adjustment they had previously established to resolve disputes arising between them.
neither csxt nor brs notified ibew that this dispute was before the board.pursuant to the rla,csxt and brs selected arbitrator david vaughn as the chair and neutral third member of the board.vaughn notified ibew of the dispute on march,and invited ibew to submit its position on the issue and attend the hearing as a.ibew objected to the proceedings on the ground that the board had no jurisdiction to interpret ibew collective bargaining agreement because ibew was not a party to the arbitration.vaughn rejected these objections and notified the parties that he intended to go forward with ibew participating as an interested.ibew participated in the hearing but was not represented on the board and maintained its objections.
on april,vaughn sent his signed proposed award to csxt,brs and ibew,which became final on may.this award sustained brs position and rejected the arguments of ibew and csxt.specifically,vaughn concluded that the collective bargaining agreement required csxt to assign the work to a signalman.he accordingly rejected csxt argument that it had discretion to assign the work as it saw fit and ibew that the work was within the province of an electrician.ibew now appeals.

the rla recognizes that the transportation industry is critical to the nation economy and that labor disputes have the power to cripple the economy if strikes result.see.accordingly,the rla establishes a comprehensive framework to control labor relations and resolve labor disputes involving railroads and airlines.see herbert northrup,the railway labor for repeal,harv.pub.pol yy,chronicling the history of the act and explaining its provisions.section,which establishes the national railroad adjustment board nrab and outlines arbitration procedures,is the portion of the statute relevant to this dispute.
section establishes a system of compulsory arbitration for minor disputes generally those disputes stemming from the interpretation of collective bargaining agreements but gives parties a choice of methods to use for this purpose.united transp.union gateway western ry,cir.one option,set forth in first,involves arbitration by the nrab,a bipartisan agency comprised of members,half appointed by unions and half by carriers.the parties may also choose to submit to a voluntary ad hoc public law board pursuant to second,as brs and csxt did here.
disputes are fairly common in the context of railroad arbitrations.in general,such disputes involve at least three parties the railroad,the union to which the railroad has assigned the work and the union that believes it should have been assigned the work.these disputes typically proceed in the manner that this one has,with the union believing it was entitled to the work demanding arbitration of the railroad,and the union selected by the railroad participating as an interested.the rla deals with arbitrations between unions and carriers,not among unions.thus,the participatory structure envisioned by the rla fundamentally requires the disputing union and carrier to participate as partisan members but does not envision partisan membership for other interested unions.
ibew argues that this participatory structure violates both the text of the rla and fundamental strictures of due process,both of which require participation in all aspects of the arbitration by all interested parties.but these contentions are misguided.in support of its contentions,ibew points primarily to an eighth circuit case that concluded that all interested parties must participate as partisan members of the arbitration panel.of locomotive engrs.int l union union pac,cir ble.there the eighth circuit explicitly noted that its own reading of the statute left it somewhat discomforted by this resolution,because the plain language of the second paragraph of second seems to envision only a public law board.id.at.ibew additionally contends that only the nrab has the power to bind a nonconsenting to an arbitral award.the text of the rla,however,simply does not support ibew arguments.
we initially note that the first paragraph of second states that if either party to such a system,group,or regional board of adjustment is dissatisfied with the public law board,it may upon ninety days notice to the other party elect to come under the jurisdiction of the adjustment board.congress use of the word either is notable in this context,for it suggests that congress intended that these boards be nothing more.
but congress did more in this statute than merely suggest that these boards be bilateral.the third paragraph of second plainly states that the public law boards shall consist of one person designated by the carrier and one person designated by the representative of the employees.second emphasis added.parties electing to use second will either resolve their grievances through a voluntary board or choose a neutral to mediate their dispute.if they can not either resolve the dispute or choose a neutral,then the national mediation board will appoint an arbitrator.nothing in the statute contemplates more than two partisan board members.
ibew does not focus on the text of second but instead directs its argument toward conformity with a line of eighth circuit cases that is virtually unique to that circuit although ibew is correct that ble granted an interested union status on an arbitration board,that opinion quite clearly states that eighth circuit the this conclusion.the eighth circuit explicitly noted that t he plain language of the rla anticipates a board,ble,at,but concluded that other that it was not able to a different result.given the eighth circuit discomfort with the ble line of cases,we see n
