on january,at,a cirrus aircraft with identification number crashed near hill city,minnesota.the pilot and owner of the aircraft,gary prokop,and his passenger,james kosak,were both killed in the crash.their trustees,thomas gartland and rick glorvigen,appointed under the minnesota statute,brought claims against cirrus,the airplane manufacturer,alleging,among other things,that cirrus had improperly designed the airplane and had failed to instruct prokop properly in its operation.cirrus then brought a complaint against two federally employed flight service station fss specialists for negligence,alleging,among other things,that they were at fault for failing negligently to apprise prokop adequately of the weather conditions and weather forecast the morning of the crash.acting pursuant to the federal tort claims act,the united states certified that these specialists had been acting in the scope of their employment at the time of this incident and,based on that certification,the court substituted the united states as the sole defendant,in place of the two fss specialists,and removed the case to federal court.see glorvigen cirrus design,wl,unpublished.
after the case was removed to federal court,the united states moved for summary judgment,arguing that the fss specialists had not been negligent in briefing prokop and that,even if they were negligent,that negligence did not cause the crash.the district court granted the united states motion for summary judgment and remanded the remaining issues to the minnesota state courts.
on appeal,cirrus challenges both the grant of summary judgment for the united states and the order remanding the remaining issues to state court.neither of the initial plaintiffs has on the grant of summary judgment for the united states.thomas gartland,the trustee of prokop wrongful death estate,filed a brief addressing the remand issue urging only that this court affirm the district court decision to remand the remaining issues to state court.
we hold that neither specialist was negligent in providing weather information to prokop.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for the united states.since we hold that the specialists were not negligent,we do not reach the separate question of causation.we also affirm the district court decision remanding the remaining issues to the minnesota state courts.
background 
the following factual summary is based on facts which are either undisputed or viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff cirrus.vaughn ruoff,cir.
on january,amateur pilot gary prokop and his passenger,james kosak,attempted to fly from grand rapids,minnesota,to cloud,minnesota,in order to see their sons play in an hockey game.the flight appears to have started smoothly.they took off at,and the plane climbed fairly steadily to about feet above mean sea level msl.however,the plane then began moving up and down erratically,and prokop apparently attempted to turn it around.those efforts proved to be of no avail the plane crashed into the ground at,killing both its occupants.
a.prokop qualifications as a pilot 
gary prokop was certified to fly in visual flight rules vfr conditions only.in other words,he was not trained to fly simply by reading the instruments also called instrument flight rules or ifr and,therefore,could only fly when visibility was fairly good.
a vfr pilot is only permitted to fly if visibility is at least three miles and cloud ceilings are at least feet above ground see webb united states.additionally,when flying at night,a vfr pilot flying in the sort of airspace prokop flew in that e and class g maintain a minimum distance of feet below any clouds,feet above any clouds,and feet horizontally from any clouds.see a.the sun did not rise that morning until,so it was still nighttime when the crash occurred.
prokop had logged a total of hours of flight time,only of which were in an,the type of plane he flew the morning of the crash.to ensure that he only flew in conditions he was prepared to handle,prokop and his flight instructor developed a set of personal minimums.personal minimums set forth guidelines for the weather conditions in which a pilot will fly that are more restrictive than the legal weather minimums for vfr flight.shipek,prokop cirrus flight instructor,advised prokop to maintain personal weather minimums of foot ceilings and visibility of at least miles.further,shipek advised prokop not to fly at night when there was snow on the ground because it is difficult in those conditions to distinguish between clouds and the ground.the parties agree that the weather reports that morning called for at least some ceilings below feet,some areas of visibility below four miles,and that it was still dark with snow on the ground when prokop crashed.
b.the weather briefings 
prokop received two weather briefings before he began his flight.he received his first briefing,from fss specialist havelka,at am.he called in again for an abbreviated briefing from fss specialist hertzog at.the relevant portions of both of these briefings are reproduced in full in the district court opinion,so we will only briefly recount the most important portions here.
specialist havelka told prokop there was an airmet for the area warning of the potential for some i f aplt.appx.at.he conveyed the content of a recent for grand rapids,reporting visibility of three miles and ceilings of feet.he further stated that the forecast for the grand rapids airport through six or so ah occasional lower stratus and possible light snow.a s the day goes on conditions are expected to become about five to six thousand scattered to broken.aplt.appx.at.he continued to give prokop information about other lower stratus clouds around the nearby aitkin and brainerd airports,the forecast for the cloud airport,where prokop had planned to land,as well as some additional information.id.finally,he advised prokop that it looks like ah you know if you waited a couple hours ceilings should lift some for ya.id.
prokop received his second briefing,from fss specialist hertzog,at early in the briefing,prokop mentioned that he had already received a briefing that morning,after which hertzog offered to give him an abbreviated briefing,and prokop agreed that he only wanted an abbreviated briefing.nonetheless,the briefing contained a lot of the information conveyed in the earlier full briefing.for example,specialist hertzog warned prokop of the airmet for i f r that specialist havelka had mentioned.aplt.appx.at.however,he indicated that although there were some reports of marginal conditions at grand rapids and low visibility at the aitkin airport,there were no reports of actual ifr conditions along prokop route at that time.id.finally,he informed prokop that there were no relevant pilot reports,and updated him on the current conditions at the airports near his route.
c.the district court decision 
the district held that,although the specialists could have given prokop some additional information,neither of them breached his duty of care to prokop.the district court held,in the alternative,that any breach of the duty of care in the briefings could not have been a substantial cause of the accident.
in a separate order,the district court remanded this case to the state courts.the district court found that,after dismissing cirrus case against the united states,there were no remaining federal questions justifying the continued attention of the federal courts.further,after weighing factors of judicial economy,convenience,fairness,and comity,the district court determined that remand was appropriate in part because the court denial of summary judgment in favor of cirrus primarily involved a legal analysis,and the court analysis was centered not on the remaining claims against cirrus but on cirrus claims against the government.glorvigen cirrus design,doc.at.june.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
the original plaintiffs and cirrus do not have complete diversity of citizenship,and the original complaints do not raise any questions of federal law.those complaints were,accordingly,filed in state court.cirrus then filed a complaint against two federally employed specialists and,pursuant to d,the united states was substituted for those specialists as a party to this case.section d further provides that,once the united states is substituted as a party in a case involving its employees negligence,the case shall be removed without bond at any time before trial by the attorney general to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place in which the action or proceeding is pending.id.the district court had jurisdiction over cirrus claims against the united states pursuant to b stating,in pertinent part,that the federal courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the united states,for money damages,for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.and the federal court had supplemental jurisdiction over the claims under a.
this court has jurisdiction to review the district court decision to remand the claims back to state court.see carlsbad,hif bio,d holding federal court of appeals has jurisdiction to review district court decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims,but instead to remand those claims to state court.
this court also has jurisdiction,pursuant to,to review the district court decision granting summary judgment for the united states when the rest of the case is remanded.an order is severable from a remand order and subject to appellate review under if it precedes the order of remand in logic and in fact and was issued while the district court had control of the case,and if the order sought to be separated is conclusive.carlson arrowhead concrete works,cir quoting city of waco united states fid.guar.here,the district court decision granting the united states summary judgment did precede,and in fact precipitated,the court order remanding the remaining claims to the minnesota courts.and this summary judgment decision is separate from those claims,conclusively resolving instead the ftca claims against the united states.see id.at noting a federal court ruling is conclusive if it is functionally unreviewable in state court,citing,city of waco,at,and affected the parties substantive rights.
standard of review 
this court reviews the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.summary judgment is affirmed if,viewing the evidence most favorably to the party,there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.summary judgment is not appropriate if the prima facie case is supported by specific facts sufficient to raise a genuine issue for trial.this court accepts as true all facts presented to the district court by the party,if properly supported by the record.
thompson hirano tecseed,cir citations omitted.it was the united states,as the moving party,which bore the initial burden of informing the district court of the basis for its motion,and identifying those portions of the pleadings,the discovery,disclosure materials and affidavits which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.celotex catrett,d.but having met that burden,it was left to cirrus,as the party with the burden of proof at trial,see,wear river watershed,to present sufficient evidence to establish the elements essential to its claims.see celotex,at.thus,cirrus,even though the party for purposes,must still present evidence sufficiently supporting the disputed material facts such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict in its favor.pope esa,cir quoting gregory city of rogers,cir.the fact that,at trial,this case would be decided by a judge,not a jury,see,does not increase the deference we give to the district court decision at summary judgment.see med.inst.of ass of trade tech,cir.
we review the district court decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims for an abuse of discretion.see carlsbad.at.
c.the fss specialists duties 
this negligence case is governed by minnesota law.see budden united states,cir budden ii courts decide ftca claims under the law of the state where the tort occurred.citing b.under minnesota law,n egligence requires the existence of a duty of care a breach of that duty an injury and the breach of the duty being the proximate cause of the injury.msk eyes wells fargo bank,cir quoting engler.farmers ins.
although state law governs in ftca cases,because the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over such claims,see b,the minnesota courts have not had an opportunity to analyze the scope of the duties that fss specialists owe to pilots and passengers.therefore,like other federal courts addressing similar claims,we are forced to look primarily to other federal cases for guidance on this question.see,pierce united states,cir relying on federal cases to support the conclusion that fss specialists have the duty to advise pilots accurately of known and predicted weather conditions,although the case was actually governed by indiana law gill united states,cir citing federal cases in support of the court analysis of an air traffic controller duties,and noting that w hile principles of texas law control,federal regulations may impose duties and standards of conduct upon the actors.
fss specialists have a duty to provide pilots with an accurate and complete summary of the relevant weather information.this court has quoted with approval the sixth circuit statement that s ince the faa has undertaken to advise requesting pilots of weather conditions,thus engendering reliance on facilities such as the indianapolis fss,it is under a duty to see that the information which it furnishes is accurate and complete.norwest capital mgmt.trust united states,cir quoting pierce,at cir.emphasis added see also budden united states,cir budden i quoting with approval the standard articulated in norwest capital aplt.br.at noting that the government agrees that the faa,through its fss specialists,has assumed a general duty to provide accurate and complete weather briefings to pilots quotation omitted.these duties are rooted in both the faa manual that instructs specialists on how to conduct their briefings,and on the reliance that pilots and airplane passengers place on the faa.see tinkler by,cir fss specialist duty arose from both the dictates of the flight services manual as well as the reliance pilots place on fss briefers.moorhead mitsubishi aircraft int,cir stating that an fss specialist duties are rooted in both general pilot reliance for the service,and the briefers manual citation omitted.
although an fss specialist must provide accurate and complete weather information,a specialist does not need to recite verbatim the contents of every weather report before him.see moorhead,at noting that b riefers are instructed not to read weather reports and forecasts verbatim,unless it is specifically requested by the pilot.in fact,a verbatim recitation would likely overwhelm a pilot with information,thereby confusing rather than clarifying the prevailing weather conditions.further,a verbatim recitation would make fss specialists superfluous,since the rote recitation of weather reporting information could probably be accomplished more effectively through the use of a computer or automated phone system.therefore,our statement that a specialist must provide accurate and complete weather information does not mean that a specialist must provide a pilot with every detail from every relevant weather source.rather,it means that the specialist must provide a complete synthesis or summary of the relevant weather information.inevitably,therefore,some information will be left out.however,as a synthesis,it must be accurate and complete with regards to the information that would appropriately be included in a summary report.the material information must be included,but additional details or repetitive facts may be left out.
