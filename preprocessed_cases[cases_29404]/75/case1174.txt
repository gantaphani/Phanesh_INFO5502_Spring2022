medrazo filed a class action lawsuit against hnh on behalf of herself and other purchasers of motorcycles alleging,among other things,that hnh failure to attach hanger tags to the new motorcycles it sells violates the unfair business practices act upa bus,et and the consumer legal remedies act clra,et she seeks under the upa injunctive relief and restitution disgorgement of the additional charges hnh imposed without disclosing them on a hanger tag.she also seeks damages under the clra.
a little more than a year after she filed the complaint,medrazo moved to certify the class,which she defined as follows all purchasers of new motorcycles who were charged for destination,assembly or other dealer added accessories that were not disclosed on a hanger tag since august,being four years prior to the filing of this lawsuit.she argued that the proposed class is ascertainable because the class definition is objective and and numerous it includes thousands of individuals.she also argued that common issues of law and fact predominate over any individual issues because hnh engaged in a single practice that affected all of the class members,that her claim is typical of the other class members claims,that she can adequately represent the class,and that adjudication on a class basis is superior to individual actions.
she supported her motion with,among other things,her declaration,in which she stated that there was no hanger tag attached to the motorcycle she bought the sales agreement for her motorcycle showing charges of hnh answers to special interrogatories,in which hnh stated that in the four years prior to june,hnh had sold honda,yamaha,and suzuki motorcycles and deposition testimony of david denman,designated by hnh as the person most knowledgeable regarding hnh procedures and practices regarding attaching hanger tags on new motorcycles.
in his deposition testimony,denman testified that hnh did not attach hanger tags on any new suzuki and yamaha motorcycles because those manufacturers did not provide any hanger tags.with regard to honda motorcycles,denman admitted that hnh received hanger tags for all of the motorcycles,but it only put the tags on some of them.he said there were no procedures to determine which motorcycles would have hanger tags attached to them he explained that if he was caught up on all of his work and noticed a lot porter standing around doing nothing,and if all of the motorcycles were clean,he might direct the porter to attach hanger tags to some of the honda motorcycles he could not estimate what percentage of new honda motorcycles had hanger tags attached to them at any given time.
hnh opposed medrazo motion on several grounds.it argued that medrazo did not have standing to assert claims on behalf of purchasers of suzuki or yamaha motorcycles because she bought a honda.it also contended that her claims were not typical of the claims of those purchasers because,it argued,section is violated only when the manufacturer supplies hanger tags and the dealer fails to attach them,and suzuki and yamaha did not supply any hanger tags.finally,it relied upon hnh practice of putting hanger tags on some,but not all,of the honda motorcycles it sold to argue that individual issues predominate because each honda purchaser would have to show that there was no hanger tag attached to the motorcycle he or she bought the class is not ascertainable because hnh did not keep records of which honda motorcycles had hanger tags attached to them and there is no evidence that there was anyone other than medrazo who purchased a honda without a hanger tag attached to it.in reply,medrazo filed a supplemental declaration stating that when she bought her motorcycle in september,she saw at least four or more new honda motorcycles,none of which had a hanger tag or any other label showing the suggested retail price or additional charges.
at the hearing on medrazo motion,the trial court began by stating its understanding that a dealer is not required under section and section to attach hanger tags to motorcycles unless the tags are supplied by the manufacturer,and that suzuki and yamaha did not supply hanger tags for its motorcycles.it also noted that all of the costs were listed in the sales agreement medrazo signed,and therefore she had notice of those costs before she entered into the agreement.it then concluded that medrazo claims were not typical of the class and she did not have standing to pursue claims of the class because she only bought one motorcycle,a honda.the court also concluded that individual issues predominate and the class is not ascertainable because there is nothing in hnh records to indicate which motorcycles had hanger tags attached to them.therefore,the court denied the certification motion.medrazo timely filed a notice of appeal from the court order.

rules governing class actions and standard of review 
courts long have acknowledged the importance of class actions as a means to prevent a failure of justice in our judicial system.citations.by establishing a technique whereby the claims of many individuals can be resolved at the same time,the class suit both eliminates the possibility of repetitious litigation and provides small claimants with a method of obtaining redress citation.generally,a class suit is appropriate when numerous parties suffer injury of insufficient size to warrant individual action and when denial of class relief would result in unjust advantage to the wrongdoer.citations.but because group action also has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.citations.linder thrifty oil cal th,d,linder.
the criteria for class certification are well established.code of civil procedure section authorizes class actions when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court the
