in april,the transport workers union of greater new york,local local,a local union affiliated with the transport workers union of america twu,modified its employee benefit plan to stop providing health insurance benefits to local retirees if they received health insurance benefits elsewhere.in response,the plaintiffs,who are retired staff employees of local the retirees and the wives of of them the wives,sued local,twu,and the transport workers union of greater new york local staff benefit plan the plan in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.the plaintiffs alleged claims based on denial of benefits and breach of fiduciary duty under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,as well as promissory and equitable estoppel claims.
the plaintiffs now appeal from two orders of the district court shira scheindlin,which together dismissed all the claims.the district court july,opinion and order partially granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed the erisa and equitable estoppel claims,but retained the promissory estoppel claims of seven of the retirees and their respective wives alleged against local.bouboulis transportation workers union of greater new york,local,wl july.in an order dated july,the district court on its own initiative dismissed the remaining promissory estoppel claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.on appeal,the plaintiffs contend that granting summary judgment was improper because there was an ambiguity in the plan summary plan description spd when it is read in conjunction with an april,letter from the former local president sonny hall the hall letter,as to whether there was a contractually vested promise of lifetime health insurance benefits.the plaintiffs also argue on appeal that local and twu were plan fiduciaries under erisa who beached their fiduciary duties through misrepresentations and inaction.the plaintiffs have not appealed the dismissal of the promissory and equitable estoppel claims.
we conclude that summary judgment was inappropriate only with regard to the breach of fiduciary duty claim against local because local was a plan fiduciary.we therefore vacate the district court order to the extent it dismissed that claim and remand the case to the district court.
background 
defendant twu is a national union that represents transportation workers.defendant local is a local union that represents employees of the new york city transit authority transit authority,and is affiliated with twu.although local is governed by twu constitution,it is an autonomous union with its own bylaws,elected officers,employees,and revenue stream from membership dues.the defendant plan is an employee benefits plan sponsored by twu that provides health and life insurance coverage,in which local participates.both local and twu are listed as plan administrators in the plan spd.
the plaintiff retirees are retired former staff employees of local who were enrolled in the plan after leaving jobs at the transit authority.many of the retirees claim that they were told or promised by local officers or staff either before they were hired,upon being hired,when considering retirement,or at various other times during their employment,that they would have lifetime health insurance coverage under the plan.all retirees believed that they were guaranteed lifetime health coverage from the plan,which was superior to the health benefits provided to retirees as active and retired employees of the transit authority.
the terms of the plan,as they existed from through,are set out in two documents.the complete terms and conditions of the plan are detailed in a group insurance certificate.the terms of the plan are also summarized in a summary plan description the spd that was distributed to plan participants.a revised spd took effect on january,but plaintiffs contend that their benefits vested under the original spd,and that to the extent the revised spd states that their benefits are not vested,it does not apply to them.the spd contains no express reservation of the right to amend or terminate coverage under the plan.
in the hall letter,then local president sonny hall announced a modification to the terms of the plan.under the spd,when a participant died,his or her spouse insurance coverage under the plan continued for only one year after the participant death.the hall letter announced that effective january,a surviving spouse of a participant who died would continue to be covered for the remainder of the spouse life.in december,local stopped providing free health insurance to its active employees,although it continued to provide coverage to its retirees.also in,various officers of local allegedly promised orally and in writing that retirees of local would continue to receive plan coverage.
new leaders of local were elected in december,and took office in january.on april,local decided to terminate health insurance coverage for retirees who were entitled to receive health insurance from other employers.this decision became effective on or shortly after september.as active or retired employees of the transit authority,the plaintiff retirees were entitled to health insurance at no cost through the transit authority,and as a result,they ceased to be covered under the plan on september.
the plaintiff retirees and their wives filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,which stated three counts.count one alleged an erisa denial of benefits claim against all defendants for termination of coverage.count two alleged an erisa breach of fiduciary duty claim against local and twu for misrepresentations regarding the coverage.count three alleged promissory and equitable estoppel claims against local and twu the district court dismissed the erisa and equitable estoppel claims in its july,opinion and order,and dismissed the remaining promissory estoppel claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in its july,order.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.state street bank and trust salovaara,cir.summary judgment may not be granted unless the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d.the substantive law governing the case will identify those facts that are material,and o nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.anderson liberty lobby,d.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
as an initial matter,the defendants challenge this court appellate jurisdiction.the defendants argue that appellate jurisdiction is lacking because the plaintiffs appealed the district court july,opinion and order,which did not dismiss all the claims in the case.while the plaintiffs submitted notices of interlocutory appeal on august,appealing both the july and july,orders,the defendants argue that the appeal of the july,order was abandoned,and that the present appeal is only from the july ruling,which they argue is not an appealable final order.see west goodyear tire rubber,cir a grant of partial summary judgment that resolves only some of the issues raised by a complaint is not an appealable final judgment.chapple levinsky,cir per curiam dismissing for lack of appellate jurisdiction an appeal of an order that adjudicated fewer than all the claims in the action,where the district court did not direct entry of a final judgment of dismissal pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
the process of appeal was complicated by the fact that the clerk of the district court never entered a final judgment from which the plaintiffs could appeal.the district court july,order disposed of all the remaining claims in the case,and concluded p laintiffs complaint is dismissed in its entirety for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the clerk of the court is directed to close this case.at that point,the clerk should have promptly entered judgment dismissing the action.see fed civ.a a iii.on appeal from a final judgment concluding the action,earlier summary dispositions merge in the judgment and are reviewable.west,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
despite the failure to enter judgment,it was plain when the plaintiffs filed notices of interlocutory appeal on august,from both the july,order and the july,order that the entire action had been dismissed.the failure of the clerk to enter a separate judgment does not require this court to dismiss the appeal.see bankers trust mallis,d if,by error,a separate judgment is not filed before a party appeals,nothing but delay would flow from requiring the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal.
in light of the fact that the district court did,indeed,dismiss the plaintiffs action in its entirety,the defendants jurisdictional argument fails.even if the plaintiffs appealed the district court dismissal prematurely,a premature notice of appeal from a nonfinal order may ripen into a valid notice of appeal if a final judgment has been entered by the time the appeal is heard and the appellees suffers no prejudice.iue pension fund herrmann,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the defendants do not allege that they have been prejudiced.appellate jurisdiction is therefore proper.
iii.erisa denial of benefits claim 
we first address the erisa denial of benefits claim,which was alleged against local,twu,and the plan.the district court examined the relevant plan found that there was no affirmative written language that could reasonably be interpreted as a promise to vest contractually the plaintiffs lifetime health benefits.bouboulis,wl,at.the district court ruled that the hall letter was not sufficiently formal to be considered along with the spd as a plan document,and that even if the hall letter were considered,there still was no language that affirmatively operates to create the contractually vested promise.id.we have frequently addressed the question of when an alleged promise of lifetime health or welfare benefits is contractually vested so that the subsequent termination of the benefits gives rise to a denial of benefits claim under erisa.see devlin empire blue cross and blue shield,cir joyce,cir american federation of grain millers,int l multifoods,cir schonholz long island jewish medical center,cir.the standard that we have adopted is whether the plan documents contain specific written language that is reasonably susceptible to interpretation as a promise to vest the benefits.devlin,at quoting joyce,at.
as an initial matter,we address the defendants argument that the spd must be interpreted in conjunction with the group insurance certificate,which explicitly reserved the right to amend the plan.this argument is unavailing.as we have previously noted 
it is of no effect to publish and distribute a spd designed to simplify and explain a voluminous and complicated document,and then proclaim that any inconsistencies will be governed by the plan.unfairness will flow to the employee for reasonably relying on the summary booklet.we conclude that where the terms of a plan and those of a spd conflict,it is the spd that controls.therefore,if the spd promised vested medical benefits to the retirees,the spd would control.
multifoods,at internal citation omitted.thus,much like the district court did in this case,we look to the spd and any alleged amendments to the not to the the relevant plan documents.
the spd itself is silent regarding vesting of lifetime benefits.the spd lists two circumstances under which benefits may be terminated ceasing employment and death.the plaintiffs argue that because they are already retired,the only applicable termination event is death,and that it is reasonable to infer that lifetime benefits are being promised.the plaintiffs try to bolster this conclusion by arguing that b requires the spd to list the circumstances which may result in loss of benefits.this analysis is incorrect for reasons largely explained in the district court opinion,namely that the absence of such language alone can not create a promise to vest.bouboulis,wl,at.moreover,the spd does not contain any affirmative language resembling the lifetime language found to create an ambiguity in devlin,at spd stated that life insurance benefits will remain at the annual salary level for the remainder of their lives.thus,we conclude that the spd by itself does not vest lifetime health benefits.
the next issue is whether the hall letter modifies the spd and provides specific written language that is reasonably susceptible to interpretation as a promise.devlin,at.the hall letter announced an increase in plan benefits for the surviving spouse and dependents of a deceased employee or retiree.the letter provided 
prior to january,twu local staff benefit plan provided that upon the death of a participant whether active or retired,insurance coverage would be continued for his or her spouse and dependent children for a period of one year following the date of the participant death.
for deaths occurring on or after january,the plan provides that,upon the death of a participant whether active or retired,insurance coverage will continue to the participant spouse for the remainder of lifetime.
the district court found that the hall letter did not rise to the level of formality of the plan documents,and thus did not create a legally cognizable promise to vest benefits.bouboulis,wl,at citing schonholz,at.the plaintiffs argue that the hall letter,which was distributed to all plan members on official stationery,served as a formal notice of material modification as required by a and b.
section a states that a summary of any material change in must be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant,and shall be furnished in accordance with b.section b,in turn,provides that summaries of modifications must be given to each participant ninety days after becoming a participant,every fifth year,and if there is a modification that does not materially reduce benefits,a summary description of such modification or change shall be furnished not later than days after the end of the plan year in which the change is adopted to each participant,and to each beneficiary who is receiving benefits under the plan.b.in this case,the hall letter states that the change in the plan was effective january.the plan was changed with an increase in plan benefits for the surviving spouse and dependents of the deceased employee or retiree.thus,a notice of modification was required to be provided to each participant and beneficiary.the defendants do not appear to dispute that the hall letter appears to be the only notification that could meet the requirements of a and b.
while we and other courts have concluded that certain communications to plan participants did not effectively modify erisa plans,the communications in those cases were much less formal than the hall letter,which was on official stationery and sent to all plan participants.see moore metropolitan life insurance,cir filmstrips and presentations not formal enough to override or amend the spd gable sweetheart cup,cir finding that the schedule ii forms distributed to retiring employees describing level of health benefits to be received after retirement was an informal communication because it did not describe the plan terms in a way to qualify as an erisa plan document under,and could not override or amend the spd alday container of america,cir individual summary of personal benefits booklets and letters sent to retiring employees could not modify the terms of a plan because they did not qualify as an plan documents under erisa fitch chase manhattan bank,d,individualized letters accompanying spds are not themselves part of the spd and therefore do not create binding obligations under erisa.unlike those cases,the communication here could potentially be construed as a statutorily required notice of a material modification,and thus sufficiently formal to be considered.
in any event,we need not decide whether the hall letter was a statutorily required notice o
