appellants,bus riders union,strategy center,and natural resources defense council hereinafter collectively referred to as bus riders union,appeal following the trial court denial of their petition for a writ of mandate.through its petition,bus riders union challenged the use by respondent los angeles county metropolitan transportation agency mta of a statutory exemption from the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et 
this statutory exemption,subd.b,in pertinent part,removes from ceqa review an agency setting of rates,tolls,fares,or other charges which the public agency finds are for the purpose of meeting operating expenses including employee wages and benefits,purchasing supplies and equipment,meeting financial reserve needs,and obtaining funds for capital projects necessary to maintain service within existing service areas.the statutory exemption also requires the agency to incorporate written findings in the record of any proceeding in which the exemption is claimed,and that the agency set forth with specificity the basis for the claim of exemption,subd.b.mta use of this ceqa exemption in may of permitted,without an environmental impact report or compliance with other ceqa requirements,mta first fare increase in many years.this rate increase was authorized by mta board of directors,which also passed a resolution specifying why the fare increase was needed and how the additional revenue would be used.
contrary to bus riders union contentions,we find,as did the trial court,that the administrative record contains substantial evidence that mta fare increase was enacted for one or more permissible purposes under section,subdivision b,and that mta findings satisfy the specificity requirement in that provision.
factual and procedural summary 
in may of,mta raised the base fare for bus and rail riders by cents,instituted small increases for monthly passes,and approved similar fare increases for subsequent fiscal years.but for a cash fare increase from to followed by a fare reduction,the fare increase was the first increase in approximately years.
prior to adopting the fare increase,mta held several fare forums and public hearings to allow various parties to be heard on the proposed fare increase.bus riders union attended some of those hearings and objected to any fare increase,asserting an increase would disadvantage bus riders in favor of rail riders.mta concluded,however,that a modest fare increase was warranted to address the budget deficit and to avoid reducing services.after extensive debate,the mta board passed a resolution specifying why the fare increase was needed and how the additional revenue would be used.
mta sought to fit within the statutory exemption that excepts public transit fare increases from ceqa compliance despite any possible increase in pollution arising from people driving rather than using public transit.thus,mta declared that the proceeds from the fare increase would be used only for those purposes authorized by the,for operational expenses and capital projects necessary to maintain service within existing service areas.mta did not declare a rate increase to fund capital projects for the expansion of a system,tit,subd.b which is the opposite of the exemption and thus within the scope of the ceqa.
specifically,in adopting the fare increase plan,on may,the mta board passed a resolution which explained why this fare increase was needed and long overdue.the resolution was entitled,resolution in accordance with ceqa finding that the purpose of the fare restructing plan is to pay operating expenses.the resolution cited the following factors that mta operating expenses exceeded its operating revenues by million over the past five years that mta projected operating deficit over the next years is billion that mta average cost per boarding,on a basis was but the base cash fare was,and the average mta rider paid only cents a boarding due to deep discounts for various pass holders that fares now cover only percent of the cost of an mta ride,and percent of the cost is subsidized by taxpayers in comparison to when the taxpayers subsidized only percent of each passenger ride that mta had reduced its reserves,slashed more than administrative positions in the past five years,dramatically reduced its workers compensation costs and aggressively pursued revenue raising measures such as advertisements on bus and rail stations that mta funds typically programmed for future capital investments had already been used to augment mta bus operations budget for years,and if such resources are used to offset the deficit in fiscal year,minimal fund balances would remain that mta massive operating deficit was siphoning funds that could be leveraged with state bond money or other state and federal dollars to fast track critical relief on the region congested highways and transit system and that mta will not be able to meet its operating expenses as soon as fiscal year or add any new transit services if action is not immediately taken to offset or eliminate the operational deficit.
the resolution concluded by language largely parroting section,subdivision b that the fare increase will be used only for the purposes of meeting operating expenses,including employee wage rates and fringe benefits,purchasing or leasing supplies,equipment or materials,meeting financial reserve needs and requirements,and obtaining funds for capital projects,necessary to maintain service within existing service areas.
the administrative record reveals,in pertinent part,that since,mta fuel costs rose nearly percent,employee benefit costs increased dramatically,and the consumer price index rose nearly percent.during that same time,mta had raised its base fare by cents or percent.for many years mta managed to keep fares artificially low by tapping contingency funds.for example,mta diverted funds that would otherwise have been used to fund capital projects for expansion of its bus and rail systems,cut administrative costs,reduced certain employee levels,deferred capital maintenance projects to maintain existing levels of service,and dipped into reserve balances and revenues.nonetheless,mta ran an increasing deficit in its bus and rail operations that was estimated to approach billion by fiscal year.
significantly,mta fare recovery ratio,the percentage of operating costs covered by fare from percent in to only percent in,resulting in taxpayers subsidizing the remaining percent.thus,even after accounting for all revenue from the modest fare increase approved,the fare recovery ratio would increase only slightly and operating costs would still have to be subsidized from other sources.
in september of,the trial court denied bus riders union petition for writ of mandate and entered judgment rejecting the ceqa challenges to the fare increase.the court found that mta fare increase was exempted from ceqa by operation of section,subdivision b,and california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision b,in light of its conclusion that t here is substantial evidence that mta uses all of its fare revenue solely to pay operating expenses.in support of its conclusion,the court cited mta recent funding matrix showing revenue sources,allocations,grants,financing proceeds,which indicated that all of mta capital projects were funded from sources other than fare revenue,and that revenue was used to cover operating expenses.the court additionally cited several funding documents for mta three existing capital projects,which indicated that funding of future expansion has been secured from other sources.
the court concluded that bus riders union had failed to show that the fare increase would be used to fund capital projects for the expansion of a system,and found that mta use of the statutory exemption was appropriate and in compliance with ceqa.
bus riders union appeals the judgment denying its petition for a writ of mandate.
