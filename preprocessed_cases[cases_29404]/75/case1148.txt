plaintiffs counsel argued in closing argument,among other things,that an ordinary consumer would not have recognized the potential risk of sustaining a significant head or neck injury in a rollover accident in a.defendants counsel argued that an ordinary consumer knew that driving was dangerous and that a driver could be injured in an accident,including a rollover accident.
the jury submitted a question a short time after beginning its deliberations.the question stated does the term in question potential risk refer to this roll over accident,or to all potential risks plaintiffs counsel argued that the answer should be that the term potential risk referred to the particular risk of contact in a rollover accident or to the risk of significant head or neck injury in a rollover.defendants counsel disagreed and argued that the question was unclear.after further discussion,the court stated i think we should say we unable to answer this question as posed.that what i think we should say.let them let us know what they really asking.that what i think we should do.
the court answered the jury in writing we are unable to answer this question as phrased.the jury later asked several additional questions,but did not rephrase its first question.
the jury returned a special verdict answering yes to questions,and,and no to questions,and.the court polled and then excused the jury.the court entered a judgment on the special verdict in favor of defendants on september.
motions for new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
plaintiffs filed a notice of intention to move for a new trial,listing all of the statutory grounds code civ.they argued in their memorandum of points and authorities in support of the motion that the court failure to answer the jury first question was prejudicial error the jury failed to apply an objective standard of the ordinary consumer in answering special verdict questions,and,and instead applied a subjective standard based on bell education and intelligence the evidence was insufficient to support the finding that an ordinary consumer would have been aware of the potential risks defendants counsel committed misconduct by questioning kang regarding bell insurance jurors committed misconduct by intimidating a juror,misrepresenting the law,failing to deliberate,and failing to follow the instructions the polling of the jury showed that it failed to reach a verdict on special verdict question and the court ruling on defendants requested modification of a jury instruction caci was error.plaintiffs filed declarations by three jurors in support of the motion.
defendants opposed the new trial motion and filed declarations by nine jurors stating,generally,that the jury had followed the instructions and that there was no misconduct.defendants also objected to portions of the juror declarations filed by plaintiffs to the extent that they purported to reflect the jurors internal thought processes.plaintiffs objected to portions of the juror declarations filed by defendants.defendants filed two supplemental juror declarations before the hearing on the motion.
plaintiffs also moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,arguing that the evidence compelled the conclusion that an ordinary consumer would not have been aware of the potential risks of head or neck injury in a rollover accident.they argued that the evidence also required other findings in their favor on the issue of liability and that a new trial should be granted solely to determine the amount of damages.defendants opposed the motion.
the trial court sustained in part and overruled in part the parties evidentiary objections the court concluded that defendants counsel had committed misconduct by questioning kang regarding bell insurance and that the misconduct was an irregularity in the proceedings code civ.the court stated that the question raises inferences kang asked for insurance because bell was negligent in operating his vehicle and that bell may have been compensated for his injuries by his insurance company.the court concluded that despite its prior instruction to the jury not to consider insurance and its instruction at the time of the question to disregard the question,the prejudice was incurable.
the court also concluded that its failure to respond to the jury question regarding the meaning of potential risks was prejudicial error.the court stated,the declaration of juror joyce fox indicates jurors verbally expressed that they understood potential risks to include any risks associated with driving a vehicle.thus,similar to bartosh banning d,it was clear the jury was confused regarding the scope of potential risks and it was incumbent on the court to provide proper guidance on this important issue of law.the court identified five factors for a court to consider in determining whether instructional error was prejudicial lemons regents of university of california cal d,and stated 
a review of the record in light of these factors demonstrates the probability the failure to properly instruct the jury as to the scope of potential risks may have misled the jury.as pointed out by plaintiffs,the court recognized the confusion may have resulted from defendants argument it could not warn against all risks moreover,according to fox,after the jury received the court response,the jury vote changed from no to yes on special verdict form question with jurors arguing potential risks must be interpreted broadly.after we received the court response to the first question,the jurors in the majority verbally argued that the term potential risks must be interpreted broadly instead of the particular risk of a head strike in a rollover which i had advocated.the jury vote changed after the court response to the question,with a consensus of nine now being reached to answer yes to special verdict form question number three,declaration of fox,page,lines see also declaration of wayne sic porter,iii,page,line through page,line.the probability of confusion is further supported by the closeness of the jury verdict.the court therefore granted the new trial motion.
the court also concluded that substantial evidence supported the finding that an ordinary consumer would have been aware of the potential risks,that there was no juror misconduct,and that plaintiffs had failed to establish other grounds for a new trial.the court stated that in light of its granting of the new trial motion,the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was moot,effectively denying that motion.
defendants appealed the order granting a new trial.plaintiffs appealed the judgment and the denial of their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
contentions 
defendants contend the trial court relied on inadmissible juror declarations in granting a new trial the instructions and special verdict form were proper,the court properly declined to answer the jury question,and any error was harmless any new trial should be limited to the count for strict liability based on failure to warn and the reference to insurance was neither improper nor prejudicial.
plaintiffs contend the trial court properly granted a new trial based on both its failure to answer the jury question and attorney misconduct and the new trial order was proper for reasons other than those relied on by the trial court,including that i jurors committed misconduct by failing to follow the instructions,refusing to deliberate,intimidating another juror,and misrepresenting the jury instructions ii the evidence compels the conclusion that an ordinary consumer would not have been aware of the potential risks iii the polling of the jury showed that it failed to reach a verdict on special verdict question and iv the court ruling on defendants requested modification of caci was error.
discussion 
new trial motion legal framework 
a verdict may be vacated,in whole or in part,and a new trial granted for any of the grounds listed in code of civil procedure section materially affecting the substantial rights of a party.ibid.those grounds are irregularity in the proceedings,misconduct of the jury,accident or surprise,newly discovered evidence,excessive or inadequate damages,insufficiency of the evidence,and error in law.ibid.
a court granting a new trial motion must specify both the grounds on which the motion is granted and the court reasons for granting the motion on each of those grounds code civ.an order granting a new trial must be affirmed on appeal if a new trial should have been granted upon any ground stated in the motion,whether or not specified in the order or specification of reasons,except that an order can be affirmed on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or excessive or inadequate damages only if such ground was stated in the order and can be affirmed on those grounds only for the reasons specified in the order or specification of reasons.ibid.
we generally review the trial court decision to grant a new trial for specified reasons under the abuse of discretion standard.oakland raiders,supra,cal th at lane hughes aircraft cal th.we defer to the trial court resolution of conflicts in the evidence if the decision is supported by substantial evidence and reverse only if there is no reasonable basis for the court decision or the decision is based on a legal error.oakland raiders,supra,at conner southern pacific cal d.
an order granting a new trial will not be disturbed unless a manifest and unmistakable abuse of discretion clearly appears.this is particularly true when the discretion is exercised in favor of awarding a new trial,for this action does not finally dispose of the matter.so long as a reasonable or even fairly debatable justification under the law is shown for the order granting the new trial,the order will not be set aside.jiminez sears,roebuck cal d.
we can not affirm the new trial order based on attorney misconduct 
misconduct of counsel is an i rregularity in the proceedings of the court,jury or adverse party,or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial code civ,subd.city of los angeles decker cal d.attorney misconduct can justify a new trial only if it is reasonably probable that the party moving for a new trial would have obtained a more favorable result absent the misconduct.cassim allstate ins.cal th,cassim decker,supra,at.
evidence that a person was insured against liability for another person injury is inadmissible to prove negligence or other wrongdoing.such evidence is irrelevant to both the question of liability and the amount of damages.productions cna ins.companies th.evidence or statements by counsel suggesting that the defendant was insured against liability could cause the jury to find liability more readily or to inflate its award of damages in some circumstances.although the insured liability is not at issue if the evidence or statements by counsel relate to the plaintiff insurance rather than the defendant,evidence or statements suggesting that the plaintiff was insured could cause the jury to believe that the plaintiff will be compensated by insurance,which could cause the jury to find no liability more readily or to award lower damages.blake thompson petroleum repair d.we believe that in the circumstances presented here,however,it is exceedingly unlikely that any prejudice resulted from the brief mention of insurance.
it is common knowledge today that most drivers in california carry automobile insurance protecting them from liability causey cornelius d.we believe that jurors ordinarily would assume that a driver with the financial means to pay for insurance,such as bell,is insured even if there is no explicit mention of insurance at trial.absent aggravating circumstances,the brief mention of the plaintiff insurance in an action against an automobile manufacturer and distributor for negligence and products liability is very unlikely to cause the jury to conclude either that the plaintiff will be fully compensated for his injuries by insurance or that the defendant should be relieved of liability for any reason.moreover,the trial court instructed the jury not to consider insurance on two the commencement of trial,and after the close of promptly admonished the jury to disregard the question regarding insurance on.such admonitions ordinarily are effective except in cases of extreme misconduct whitfield roth cal d,and we presume that the jury followed the instructions absent some indication to the contrary cassim,supra,cal th at.we believe that the trial court could not reasonably conclude,despite the repeated instructions and admonition,that the brief mention of insurance in these circumstances was prejudicial.we therefore conclude that the order granting a new trial can not be affirmed based on attorney misconduct 
we can not affirm the new trial order based on the court failure 
to clarify the special verdict question 
rules applicable to erroneous or misleading jury instructions 
and special verdict questions 
when a new trial is granted based on an erroneous or misleading jury instruction,the order will not be disturbed unless the questioned instruction was absolutely accurate and under no reasonable interpretation could possibly have misled or confused the jury.citations.christian bolls d.if the challenged instruction was erroneous in any degree,or even if it is only fairly debatable that such instruction may have been misleading,the broad discretion of the trial court may not be disturbed citations.shaw pacific greyhound lines cal d,shaw.
the california supreme court in shaw affirmed an order granting a new trial because of minor defects in an instruction.shaw,supra,cal d at.the shaw court stated that it probably would have affirmed the judgment if the trial court had not granted a new trial,but concluded that the new trial order was within the broad discretion of the trial court.the determination of a motion for a new trial rests so completely within the court discretion that its action will not be disturbed unless a manifest and unmistakable abuse of discretion clearly appears,and the order will be affirmed if it may be sustained on any ground,although the reviewing court might have ruled differently in the first instance.citation.id.at.moreover,the power of the judge to do justice by ordering a new trial is not impaired even though the moving party is technically estopped to claim error or has waived his right to complain.citations.id.at accord,malkasian irwin cal d.we conclude that the same rules apply when a new trial is granted based on an erroneous or misleading special verdict question.such a question has the same potential to misguide the jury and result in a miscarriage of justice as an erroneous or misleading jury instruction.the trial court must consider the special verdict form and jury instructions as a whole,and the particular circumstances of the case,and decide whether the question was erroneous or misleading and,if so,whether the defect materially affected the substantial rights of the party moving for a new trial code civ.
b.the court granted a new trial based on inadmissible evidence 
evidence of jurors internal thought processes is inadmissible to impeach a verdict,subd.a people hutchinson cal d,hutchinson.only evidence as to objectively ascertainable statements,conduct,conditions,or events is admissible to impeach a verdict,subd.a in re hamilton cal th.juror declarations are admissible to the extent that they describe overt acts constituting jury misconduct,but they are inadmissible to the extent that they describe the effect of any event on a juror subjective reasoning process.in re stankewitz cal d.accordingly,juror declarations are inadmissible to the extent that they purport to describe the jurors understanding of the instructions or how they arrived at their verdict.people dillon th,fn.mesecher city of san diego th,mesecher.
the trial court here,to a large degree,based its determination that the jury was misled by the special verdict question and that its failure to provide proper guidance in response to the jury question was prejudicial on statements in two juror declarations.
juror fox declared 
during the deliberations of this case by myself and the other jurors,an issue arose with respect to the meaning of the term potential risks as used in the first four questions of the special verdict form.many of the jurors in the majority made statements that just driving a car is dangerous and riding a bike is dangerous and presents a risk.these jurors verbally expressed that they understood potential risks to include any risks associated with driving a vehicle.i believed their understanding of the term was wrong,so i formulated the first question to the court i believed and verbally advocated for the position that the term potential risks meant the particular risk of the occupant head striking the ground during a rollover.
after we received the court response to the first question,the jurors in the majority verbally argued that the term potential risks must be interpreted broadly instead of the particular risk of a head strike in a rollover which i had advocated.the jury vote changed after the court response to the question,with a consensus of nine now being reached to answer yes to special verdict form question number three.
juror porter declared 
during the deliberation of the jury there was significant verbal discussion regarding the meaning of the term potential risks as used in the first four questions of the special verdict form.i understood this to mean the specific risk of striking one head on the ground during a rollover of the car.but several of the jurors in the majority expressed a broader definition of the term by making verbal arguments that just driving itself is unsafe and that potential risks means the risk of getting into an accident,including the risk of the car rolling over.
the trial court cited and quoted part of this quoted language in its order granting a new trial,as stated ante.the portions cited by the trial court describe some of the jurors purported understanding of the words potential risks as used in the special verdict form.those portions of the declarations reflect the jurors subjective reasoning processes and therefore are inadmissible,subd.a.
c.the record does not justify a new trial based on the failure 
to clarify the special verdict question 
an order granting a new trial ordinarily is entitled to great deference,as we have stated,but such deference is inappropriate if the order is based in substantial part on inadmissible evidence.we conclude that the trial court reliance on the cited portions of the juror declarations was neither insignificant nor harmless.moreover,we believe that excluding the inadmissible portions of the juror declarations,the record compels the conclusion that the special verdict form was not misleading and did not confuse the jury.
the purported confusion concerned whether potential risks as used in the special verdict form referred specifically to the particular risk of contact in a rollover accident or referred more generally to all potential risks.question asked whether the had potential risks that were known or knowable through the use of available scientific knowledge.question asked whether the potential risks presented a substantial danger to users of the.question asked,would ordinary consumers have recognized the potential risks.the jury answered yes to all three questions.
in our view,the plain language of these questions clearly conveyed to the jury that the potential risks in questions and referred to the same potential risks initially referenced in question.the jury affirmative response to question indicates that the jury found that ordinary consumers recognized all of the potential risks,including the risk of contact in a rollover accident,regardless of the precise scope of the term potential risks.accordingly,we conclude that the failure to clarify the special verdict question can not justify a new trial.
we can not affirm the new trial order based on another ground 
legal framework 
we must affirm the order granting a new trial if a new trial should have been granted on any ground stated in the motion,regardless of the trial court stated reasons,except that we can not affirm the order based on insufficiency of the evidence or excessive or inadequate damages because the order did not specify those grounds.code civ.a ground was stated in the motion ibid.for purposes of the statute if the ground was listed in the notice of intention to move for a new trial,regardless of whether the ground was stated in the memorandum of points and authorities supporting the motion.code civ,final hand electronics,snowline joint unified school dist.th.
if the trial court failed to timely specify the grounds for a new trial order or failed to timely specify the reasons for granting a new trial on those grounds,the moving party bears the burden on appeal to show that the order should be affirmed on a ground stated in the motion.oakland raiders,supra,cal th at bank of america cal d,thompson friendly hills regional medical center th.similarly,if the trial court specified the grounds and reasons for granting a new trial but the order can not be affirmed on those grounds or for those reasons,as here,the moving party bears the burden on appeal to show that the order should be affirmed on another ground stated in the motion or for reasons other than those specified by the trial court.gaskill pacific hosp.of long beach d,see meiner ford motor d.accordingly,we will consider only the grounds and reasons asserted by plaintiffs on appeal.as we will explain,we conclude that the trial court properly denied the new trial motion on those other grounds.
juror misconduct 
plaintiffs contend some of the jurors held bell to a subjective standard of knowledge based on his education and intelligence rather than the objective standard of an ordinary consumer.three jurors declared that some jurors stated during deliberations that bell was educated and intelligent,that he should have known of the potential risks,and that they understood the term ordinary consumers to mean persons such as themselves and bell,who are knowledgeable and intelligent.plaintiffs contend this shows that the jurors failed to follow the instructions and committed misconduct.
an express agreement not to follow the instructions or extensive discussion evidencing an implied agreement to that effect would constitute juror misconduct.krouse graham cal d.there is no evidence of such an express agreement here,and we do not believe that the declarations show an implied agreement.rather,the cited statements in the juror declarations purport to reflect other jurors understanding and application of the instructions,and therefore are inadmissible.mesecher,supra,th at.we conclude that the evidence does not support a new trial based on failure to follow the instructions.
juror declarations submitted by plaintiffs also stated that some jurors repeatedly referred to bell comparative fault before the jury had reached that question in the special verdict form.plaintiffs contend this evidence shows that some jurors committed misconduct by failing to follow the court instruction to answer the special verdict questions in order and by expressing a firm conviction at the beginning of deliberations and refusing to consider other points of view.
the court instructed the jury to answer the special verdict questions in order but did not instruct the jury to limit its discussion of the pertinent issues in any manner or to discuss some of those issues only after discussing others.we conclude that there was no jury misconduct in this regard.moreover,the jurors purported statements concerning bell comparative negligence might have shown their conviction at the time but did not show a refusal to deliberate or constitute juror misconduct.
juror declarations submitted by plaintiffs also stated that another juror,letitia armas,changed her vote to side with the majority and break the deadlocked jury and stated at that time that she felt intimidated by another juror comments to her.the juror declarations did not quote or describe the other juror comments.this statement attributed to juror armas reflected her subjective reasoning process and therefore was inadmissible.hutchinson,supra,cal d at.
plaintiffs also contend a juror committed misconduct by misrepresenting the jury instructions to other jurors.juror declarations submitted by plaintiffs stated that juror rebecca morris stated to the jury that the instructions required the bells to prove that there was another car that would have saved bell from his injuries in order to prevail.juror morris declared that she never made that statement and that the instructions were available for all jurors to review.in our view,the purported statement by juror morris reflected her understanding of the instructions and therefore was inadmissible.mesecher,supra,th at.
awareness of the potential risks 
defendants presented testimony by two engineers.jurgen kubler participated in the construction of the prototype that became the.he testified that,at the time,he could see no danger to the occupants of the car in the event of a rollover.lothar heiner designed rollover protection systems for possible use in the.he testified that it was not his responsibility to determine whether the vehicle was safe.he stated further yes,we inspected it,yes,but that did not mean that you have that which determined that this vehicle is so safe that you do not need rollove
