defendant michael kesler,a state trooper,appeals the denial of immunity on plaintiff claims and state law claims.we reverse because defendant kesler was entitled to qualified immunity on the claims and immunity on the state law claims.
factual background 
traffic stop 
on march,plaintiff melvin alan wood wood was driving a large tractor truck called a mobile home hauler.instead of a mobile home,wood was carrying a pickup truck piggyback,and the pickup truck was completely off the ground.wood passenger was bob payne.traveling behind wood,david martin was driving another mobile home hauler,also without a mobile home.
both wood and martin were driving their tractor trucks northbound on in alabama to pick up mobile homes for transport in nashville,tennessee.kesler,a state trooper in alabama,was monitoring northbound traffic on north of athens,alabama.this stretch of interstate highway was under construction and had been reduced to a single lane of traffic on the northbound side.only the left lane of the northbound interstate was open.marker barrels were positioned between the left lane and the closed right lane of the northbound interstate.trooper kesler was parked in the closed right lane with his vehicle at the bottom of a hill and facing the oncoming northbound traffic.because of the construction and barrels,the normal speed limit of mph was reduced to mph for the single open lane of the northbound side.
trooper kesler stopped both wood and martin for speeding.they each produced a driver license,log book,and medical card.kesler cited wood and martin for speeding and not having updated log books.the citation for wood charged him with speeding at mph in a mph zone.trooper kesler advised both drivers to update their log books at the nearest truck stop.
in his deposition,plaintiff wood denies that he was speeding.wood testified that he was traveling around the zone,maybe less,because i had been through that zone.and i knew that the troopers had been working it strongly.upon seeing trooper kesler blue lights flashing,wood did hit his brakes or anything,but just went on down the hill and pulled off.according to wood,kesler never informed him that his conduct constituted reckless driving 
further,wood passenger payne testified that wood did not lock his brakes,swerve or lose control of his truck.martin,driving behind wood,testified that wood slowed his vehicle to approximately to mph.
reckless driving citation 
trooper kesler traffic citations set plaintiff wood initial court appearance for may.wood appeared in court,pled not guilty,and requested a trial date,which was set for july.later,wood,pro se,filed a document request for kesler records.on the advice of his superiors and the district attorney office,kesler did not provide the documents or respond.
at trial on july,plaintiff wood refused to accept a plea bargain and decided to defend against the charges at that time,assistant district attorney brian jones spoke with both plaintiff wood and trooper kesler about the circumstances surrounding the speeding and log book citations.kesler advised prosecutor jones that wood had lost control of his vehicle due to wood locking his brakes,but that kesler had decided not to issue a reckless driving citation to wood.after speaking with trooper kesler,prosecutor jones instructed kesler to issue wood a citation for violation of the reckless driving statute 
trooper kesler complied with jones instruction,the reckless driving citation to march,the date of the speeding charge kesler also obtained an arrest warrant on the reckless driving charge.kesler did not believe that he could refuse when prosecutor jones told him to write the reckless driving citation.kesler felt that jones was his superior.
wood arrest 
wood refused to sign the reckless driving citation,despite being informed that it was not an admission of guilt and that refusing to sign it would result in his being arrested and taken to jail.trooper kesler then arrested wood and took him to the county jail.the full custodial arrest was based on wood refusal to sign the citation.on the way to the jail,kesler asked wood why he had not taken the plea agreement and why he had requested kesler records.wood spent four to five hours at the jail before being released.
at a subsequent trial on the charges,the court found wood guilty as charged of speeding mph in a mph zone and not guilty of reckless driving 
ii.procedural history 
wood filed this action against trooper kesler in his individual and official capacities alleging civil rights violations under,a civil rights conspiracy under,and false arrest and malicious prosecution under alabama law.
following discovery,defendant kesler moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in kesler favor on all claims against him in his official capacity and on wood claim against him individually.the district court,however,denied summary judgment to kesler individually on wood claims and state law claims.kesler timely appealed seeking immunity on all remaining claims 
iii.qualified immunity on claims 
we first address whether trooper kesler is entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiff wood claims for false arrest,malicious prosecution,and retaliation wood asserts that kesler lacked probable cause to charge him with reckless driving and to arrest him.wood contends that kesler did so maliciously and in retaliation for wood exercising his rights to trial and to subpoena records.
general principles 
qualified immunity offers complete protection for government officials sued in their individual capacities if their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.vinyard wilson,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.the purpose of this immunity is to allow government officials to carry out their discretionary duties without the fear of personal liability or harassing litigation,protecting from suit all but the plainly incompetent or one who is knowingly violating the federal law.lee ferraro,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
to receive qualified immunity,the public official must first prove that he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority when the allegedly wrongful acts occurred.id.internal quotation marks omitted.here,it is clear that trooper kesler was acting within the course and scope of his discretionary authority when he charged and arrested wood.once the defendant establishes that he was acting within his discretionary authority,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that qualified immunity is not appropriate.id.
the supreme court has set forth a test for the qualified immunity analysis.the threshold inquiry a court must undertake in a qualified immunity analysis is whether the plaintiff allegations,if true,establish a constitutional violation.hope pelzer,d citing saucier katz,d.if no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established,there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.saucier,at.however,i f a constitutional right would have been violated under the plaintiff version of the facts,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.vinyard,at quoting saucier,at.thus,we now analyze whether trooper kesler conduct violated wood constitutional rights.
false arrest 
an arrest does not violate the fourth amendment if a police officer has probable cause for the arrest.see lee,at ortega christian,cir von stein brescher,cir.for probable cause to exist,an arrest must be objectively reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances.lee,at.this standard is met when the facts and circumstances within the officer knowledge,of which he or she has reasonably trustworthy information,would cause a prudent person to believe,under the circumstances shown,that the suspect has committed,is committing,or is about to commit an offense.rankin evans,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although probable cause requires more than suspicion,it does not require convincing proof,and need not reach the same standard of conclusiveness and probability as the facts necessary to support a conviction.lee,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted alteration in original.
to receive qualified immunity protection,an officer need not have actual probable cause but only arguable probable cause.montoute carr,cir.because only arguable probable cause is needed,the inquiry is not whether probable cause actually existed,but instead whether an officer reasonably could have believed that probable cause existed,in light of the information the officer possessed.id.even law enforcement officials who reasonably but mistakenly conclude that probable cause is present are entitled to immunity.hunter bryant,d internal quotation marks omitted.
we conclude that kesler had actual probable cause to issue the reckless driving citation and to arrest wood.to show why,we discuss alabama reckless driving statute and then the evidence in this case.a defines reckless driving as follows 
any person who drives any vehicle carelessly and heedlessly in willful or wanton disregard for the rights or safety of persons or property,or without due caution and circumspection and at a speed or in a manner so as to endanger or be likely to endanger any person or property,shall be guilty of reckless driving.
this statute divides the offense of reckless driving into two alternatives.see white state,so d.the first alternative prohibits driving a vehicle carelessly and heedlessly in willful or wanton disregard for the rights or safety of persons or property.a.the second alternative prohibits driving without due caution and circumspection and at a speed or in a manner so as to endanger or be likely to endanger any person or property.id.
under alabama law,the phrase without due caution and circumspection means no more than negligence.kirk state,so d.wood thus may be guilty of reckless driving by driving negligently and at a speed or in a manner likely to endanger any person or property.a.
further,under alabama law,what constitutes reckless driving is generally a question of fact based on the total circumstances.see,bailey state,so d,evidence sufficient to show reckless driving when defendant sped up upon seeing officers,instigated police chase,and drove seven or eight miles over a rough,slick road at speeds ranging from to mph bradford state,so d,evidence sufficient to sustain conviction where defendant passed two cars on sharp curve driving to mph see also malbis bakery collins,so d,whether allowing four persons to ride in front seat was absence of due caution and circumspection was a question of fact under all of the circumstances 
in light of this alabama law,the evidence shows that trooper kesler had actual probable cause to charge wood with reckless driving.wood was driving a large tractor truck and hauling yet another vehicle.the interstate highway was reduced to a single lane of traffic due to construction,and barrels divided the open and closed lanes.due to these hazardous conditions,the normal speed limit of mph was reduced to mph.wood,however,was driving mph over that speed limit.the net result is that wood was speeding in a large tractor truck in an area of hazardous conditions on an interstate highway.under these facts,an officer in trooper kesler position had actual probable cause to believe that wood was violating the reckless driving statute.see a.
in particular,wood speeding,his going mph over the speed limit,is an established fact properly considered in determining if probable cause existed for the reckless driving citation.this is because wood conviction for driving at mph in a mph zone collaterally estops him from relitigating the fact of his speeding in this case.see brown city of hialeah,cir indicating that collateral estoppel applies in cases and that we determine the preclusive effect of a state court judgment by applying the estoppel rules of that state vazquez metro.dade county,cir same parker williams,cir defendant williams had his opportunity to litigate the fact of the rape in his state criminal proceeding.therefore,collateral estoppel was available to preclude him from relitigating the issue in this case against the macon county,alabama chief jailer,overruled in part on other grounds by turquitt jefferson county,cir en banc marcus paul fire and marine ins,cir.unit b july applying alabama law and stating generally that a party may be precluded by factual issues decided against it in a previous case,even if the estoppel is raised in the second case by a litigant who was not a party to the first proceeding in which the issue was determined 
trooper kesler also had actual probable cause to arrest wood for refusing to sign the reckless driving citation.under alabama law,refusal to sign a citation is cause for a custodial arrest.gouin state,so d,citing a and stating that the custodial arrest was authorized and justified because the appellant refused to sign the traffic ticket hays city of jacksonville,so d,there is no dispute that wood refused to sign the reckless driving citation and that he was aware that if he refused to sign,he would be taken to jail.
in sum,trooper kesler had actual probable cause to issue the reckless driving citation and to arrest wood because wood has not established a fourth amendment violation,trooper kesler is entitled to qualified immunity on wood false arrest claim.see marx gumbinner,cir the existence of probable cause is an absolute bar to a section action for false arrest.
malicious prosecution 
plaintiff wood also asserts a claim for malicious prosecution based on trooper kesler issuing the reckless driving citation and arresting him.our court has identified malicious prosecution as a violation of the fourth amendment and a viable constitutional tort cognizable under.see uboh reno,cir whiting traylor,cir kelly curtis,cir to establish a federal malicious prosecution claim under,the plaintiff must prove a violation of his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures in addition to the elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution.see uboh,at whiting,at kelly,at as to the constituent elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution,this court has looked to both federal and state law and determined how those elements have historically developed.uboh,at whiting,at.for example,in uboh,this court examined both federal law and georgia law and indicated that,for purposes of a malicious prosecution claim,the constituent elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution included a criminal prosecution instituted or continued by the present defendant with malice and without probable cause that terminated in the plaintiff accused favor and caused damage to the plaintiff accused.at we note that these are also the same elements required under alabama law for the tort of malicious prosecution.delchamps,bryant,so d.
this court in uboh also had to determine whether the common law element of favorable termination was met.at.to do so,the uboh court determined what constituted a favorable termination by examining primarily federal law.id.at.in sum,although both state law and federal law help inform the elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution,a fourth amendment malicious prosecution claim under remains a federal constitutional claim,and its elements and whether they are met ultimately are controlled by federal law 
in this case,wood malicious prosecution claim is that trooper kesler maliciously issued a reckless driving citation without probable cause and caused him to be unreasonably seized by making a custodial arrest on that charge when he refused to sign the citation.while a seizure,an arrest in fact occurred in the course of the prosecution,wood has not shown that kesler acted without probable cause,which is a required element of wood malicious prosecution claim.as outlined above,trooper kesler had actual probable cause to issue the reckless driving citation and for the custodial arrest,and thus,that probable cause bars his malicious prosecution claim.
because wood has not shown a fourth amendment violation,trooper kesler is entitled to qualified immunity on wood malicious prosecution claim.
retaliation 
wood also asserts a retaliation claim based on kes
