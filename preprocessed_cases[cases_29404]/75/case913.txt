factual and procedural history 
icc initial order 
since the early,averitt and milan,two trucking companies,have been involved in protracted litigation.their dispute arose from averitt attempt to obtain intrastate operating authority in alabama by contracting with another trucking company,deaton,deaton,to transfer a portion of deaton operating authority to averitt.
in early,averitt petitioned the interstate commerce commission icc for approval of the transfer of deaton authority to averitt pursuant to e a number of trucking companies,including milan,opposed the transfer.the opposing companies argued that the proposed transfer was merely a pretense for avoiding the jurisdiction of the alabama public service commission apsc,which regulated intrastate operating authority within alabama.on june,the icc issued a final order approving the transfer of deaton authority to averitt,and holding that,under,it had exclusive jurisdiction over the transaction which included the power to approve the transfer of intrastate operating authority a petition for judicial review of the icc order was filed in this court 
averitt separate lawsuit for an injunction against apsc 
meanwhile,based on the icc order,averitt applied to the apsc for a tariff to set the intrastate rate it could charge in alabama.the apsc refused to honor the icc order and rejected averitt tariff application.in response,on august,averitt and deaton filed a lawsuit against the apsc in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee in this lawsuit,averitt and deaton asked the district court to declare the icc order effective and to enjoin the apsc from interfering with averitt intrastate operations in alabama.specifically,averitt and deaton asked the district court to enter a judgment declaring t hat averitt and deaton have the right to carry out the transfer of operating authority approved by the icc without the approval of the apsc,and to enjoin the apsc from interfering with this transfer of authority.on august,judge thomas higgins issued a temporary restraining order and set a bond amount of.averitt express,sullivan,et.judge higgins then transferred the action to the northern district of alabama due to the separate appeal of the icc order pending before this court.
following the transfer of the action,judge clemon of the united states district court for the northern district of alabama issued a preliminary injunction on november.this preliminary injunction was issued against the apsc and those in active concert or participation with them,including milan,which had intervened as a defendant in the lawsuit.averitt express,sullivan,et.specifically,the defendants and intervenors were enjoined from impeding the transfer of operating authority from deaton to averitt or interfering with deaton or averitt operation of the authority once transferred.judge clemon required averitt to post a bond for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by the defendants if this preliminary injunction is subsequently found to have erroneously issued.id.usfg posted the bond as averitt surety.
c.this court north alabama i 
subsequently,on september,this court set aside the portion of the icc order approving the transfer of intrastate authority from deaton to averitt.see north alabama express,cir north alabama i,modified on panel reh g,cir this court held that the icc was correct in applying to this transaction,but found that even if the icc generally has the statutory authority to approve changes in intrastate certificates,it lacks authority to do so in this case because the proposed transaction is a sham designed solely to divest the apsc of its authority in this matter.id.at this court noted that deaton and averitt possessed multiple certificates allowing interstate transport and the proposed transfer would not enlarge averitt ability to transport in interstate commerce nor reduce deaton ability.id.the interstate authority deaton was transferring was already possessed by averitt,and deaton had more than one source of authority for the areas covered by the transfer.id.
this court further explained that congress did not give the icc power to create or transfer intrastate authority absent some connection between the proposed transaction,the intrastate authority,and interstate commerce.id.this court recognized that authorizes the icc to order the transfer of intrastate authority only if the intrastate authority has some relationship with the change in interstate commerce resulting from the proposed transaction.id.however,this court found that,i n the case at bar,the intrastate authority has a relationship to the interstate routes,but no relationship to the change in interstate commerce simply because there is no change.id.this court determined that there being no change in interstate commerce,the icc is effectively approving nothing more than the transfer of intrastate authority.id.therefore,this court concluded,b ecause the supposed interstate aspects of the transaction do not constitute a change in interstate commerce,the icc lacked the power to approve or exempt the intrastate aspects of the transaction.id.at.this court then instructed that t o the extent that it permits the transfer of the intrastate routes,the icc order is set aside.id.emphasis in original.
milan motion to dissolve the injunction issued in averitt and deaton first lawsuit 
after prevailing in this court in north alabama i,milan moved to dissolve the injunction issued by judge clemon in favor of averitt and deaton in their separate lawsuit against the apsc in federal district court.milan,which was an intervenor in that lawsuit,sought to recover from averitt and usfg the amount of the bond connected with the previously issued injunction,as well as further damages to be assessed against averitt express for the loss of business and profits suffered by milan express as a direct result of averitt intrastate operations in alabama,pl.ex.on july,the district court dissolved the injunction and dismissed with prejudice averitt and deaton lawsuit against the apsc,pl.ex.on september,the district court dismissed without prejudice milan claims,as an intervenor,against averitt and usfg for the bond amount and for excess damages b ased on the parties pretrial agreement that the eleventh circuit decision in north alabama i would be dispositive of the issues in this case.averitt express,sullivan,et.however,the district court expressly reserved milan right to assert its claim for damages against the injunction bond in a separate action.id.
icc second order 
after north alabama i,averitt and deaton petitioned the icc to reopen the exemption proceedings,seeking to introduce evidence of a connection between the proposed transfer and interstate commerce.on august,the icc determined that while north alabama i set aside the icc first order,it nonetheless left the exemption proceedings open.in the icc view,north alabama i set aside the icc order only to the extent it permitted the transfer of intrastate routes and not as to the icc grant of the exemption.the icc held that the exemption it previously had granted for the proposed transaction was still effective.the icc reasoned that unless the icc revoked that exemption,averitt could operate lawfully under the authority it acquired from deaton.this is necessarily so because the circuit function does not extend to issuing or revoking authorizations that only this commission has jurisdiction to issue.therefore,effective september,the icc held the exemption proceedings open to allow comment on the issue.
following the icc second order,averitt recommenced its intrastate operations in alabama.however,the apsc ordered averitt to cease and desist all alabama intrastate operations and sent letters to averitt customers,advising them that averitt did not have authority to engage in intrastate commerce in alabama and threatening them with penalties for knowingly violating the alabama motor carrier act.the apsc also issued citations to averitt drivers.
averitt second lawsuit 
on september,averitt and deaton filed suit against the apsc in the united states district court for the middle district of alabama,seeking to restrain the apsc from taking any action interfering with averitt right to operate in alabama on october,judge ira dement concluded that the district court did not have jurisdiction over orders issued by the icc and denied without prejudice the request for equitable relief.see averitt express,sullivan,et.
on october,averitt and deaton appealed the district court order in averitt express,sullivan and petitioned this court for a temporary restraining order tro.on october,this court granted the tro,stating the icc issued an order dated august,granting averitt the right to utilize the alabama intrastate authority it acquired from deaton.that order shall control until such time as this court may invalidate it.the state of alabama is directed to give full credit to the icc ruling until further order of this court.in re averitt express,appeal cir.
icc third order 
ultimately,the icc considered additional evidence from the parties concerning whether the transfer had effected a change in interstate commerce.on november,the icc issued its third order,determining that averitt will indeed acquire interstate operating authority from deaton which it does not have,and which permits averitt to transport new traffic categories in purely interstate commerce.the icc therefore found that the transfer satisfied the test established by this court in north alabama i requiring a change in interstate authority.consequently,the icc denied milan request to revoke the exemption it had granted averitt.
h.this court north alabama ii 
milan appealed to this court from the icc third order,arguing that there was insufficient evidence to show a relationship between the intrastate and interstate transfer as required by north alabama i,and that the transfer was therefore void.on august,this court first found that the icc acted within its authority in reopening the prior proceeding for additional evidence.north alabama express,cir north alabama ii.this court further found that the record before the icc now supports the icc decision that the transfer does effect a change in authority to transport goods in interstate commerce.id.emphasis added however,this court concluded that this change in interstate authority,however,does not necessarily result in a change in interstate commerce sufficient to carry a transfer of intrastate routes.id.at emphasis supplied.even though averitt acquired interstate authority it did not have previously,this court found that averitt as transferee has no intention of using that newly acquired interstate authority and thus the transfer creates no change in interstate commerce.id this court also determined that there was no evidence of any relationship between the interstate and intrastate authority being transferred.id.at.in this regard,this court explained that,contrary to milan assertion,does not require the parties to show the intrastate authority is necessary to the transfer of interstate authority.id.instead,averitt must show only some relationship between the interstate and intrastate authority being transferred.id.this court observed that a lthough the level of relationship does not seem to have been developed,it would appear that the icc authority must rest on a sufficient connection between the interstate transfer and the attempted intrastate transfer to make the icc action reasonable.id.finding the record did not show a change in interstate commerce or a relationship between the intrastate and the interstate transfer that affects commerce,this court again set aside the icc order to the extent that it permits the transfer of the intrastate routes.id.
ii.history of the case sub judice 
pleadings in district court 
following the review of the icc third order in north alabama ii,milan filed a separate,new complaint giving rise to this appeal.milan complaint was filed on october,in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama and was assigned to judge william acker,milan complaint alleged that averitt operated within alabama pursuant to a transfer of deaton intrastate authority,that a district court entered an injunction requiring the recognition of that transfer pursuant to the icc order,and that the icc order was beyond its authority and unlawful.milan complaint alleged that therefore from november,to december,averitt operated within alabama without holding legal authority to do so as a result,milan complaint alleged that it had to pay in legal fees to set aside the icc orders and that the revenues milan would have generated had been diverted to averitt over a period.milan sought to recover from averitt and usfg the amount of the injunction bond and additional damages caused by averitt wrongful operations under the illegal orders of the icc,as follows 
p laintiff milan express hereby claims the proceeds of that bond set out and attached hereto as exhibit b and such additional amount as may be assessed as damages against averitt express,arising out of the wrongful operations of averitt express,in the state of alabama during the time period which it has so operated under the illegal authority of the orders of the interstate commerce commission.
milan compl.at emphasis supplied.milan complaint alleged that the district court had authority and jurisdiction over its claims for the following reasons 
plaintiff further asserts that this court has authority and jurisdiction under the interstate commerce act,and to award attorney fees to the plaintiff incurred in order to establish its rights under this act.additionally,this court has authority and jurisdiction to consider and award these damages as a result of the court action in granting the injunctive orders which allowed such operations to be begun and continued.
in this appeal,milan seeks to sustain its excess damages award as a state law claim over which the district court had discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.specifically,milan asserts that alabama law recognizes an independent claim for bad faith in obtaining an injunction from a court and that milan complaint made a claim for excess damages against averitt for its bad faith in obtaining an injunction from the federal district court.however,milan made no such claim in its complaint.nowhere in its complaint did milan assert a claim for excess damages based on averitt bad faith procurement of an injunction from the federal district court.in fact,milan complaint does not mention averitt actions in obtaining the injunction or use the words bad faith.instead,milan complaint focuses on lost revenue and damages from averitt alleged wrongful operations in alabama under the illegal orders of the icc 
the pretrial order,entered on august,described milan claims essentially as the complaint had.as in the complaint,milan position in the pretrial order focused on milan claim for its lost profits caused by averitt illegal trucking operations in alabama and its legal costs to have averitt operations declared illegal and a sham the pretrial order does not contain a state law claim for averitt alleged bad faith procurement of an injunction from the federal district court.we further note that the pretrial order expanded on the complaint statement of the district court jurisdiction,but still based the complaint on federal jurisdiction,as follows 
subject matter jurisdiction exists under rule c sic federal rules of civil procedure since this action arises out of litigation which was found to be within the jurisdiction of this court under the interstate commerce act.also,plaintiff contends jurisdiction continues under the interstate commerce act,specifically in.
pretrial order.section of the act allows persons injured by a motor carrier to sue if the carrier provided services in clear violation of certain sections of the statute.rule c does not provide a cause of action but requires security be given when a temporary restraining order or an injunction is issued as the district court realized later,neither nor rule c provided a basis for any federal jurisdiction over milan claims.see infra.
the case proceeded to a jury trial.
opening and closing statements 
during trial,milan described its claim for additional damages as based on averitt bad faith before the icc.for instance,in its opening statement,milan argued as follows 
now,we have to prove that averitt was acting in bad the way the law order to recover anything above the bond we have two opinions of the eleventh circuit saying that the application to the interstate commerce commission was a sham and could not be the basis for a good transfer of alabama intrastate authority.we believe that establishes bad faith.
similarly,in closing,milan argued as follows 
you are going to be asked a question as to whether averitt obtained their authority from the icc in good faith and i think the motive is very clear in this proceeding that averitt intended to misrepresent to the icc that they were doing something that was going to change interstate commerce and therefore they should be allowed to have transferred this intrastate authority of deaton and operate it.
throughout the trial,milan presentation of evidence of averitt bad faith related to averitt actions before the icc.
motions for judgment as a matter of law 
at the close of milan evidence,averitt and usfg orally made a joint motion for judgment as a matter of law,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.the district court took the motion under advisement.
after the close of all of the evidence,averitt and usfg renewed their joint rule a motion for judgment as a matter of law.milan also made a rule a motion for judgment as a matter of law at this time,contending that this court finding that averitt actions before the icc were a sham was the same as a finding of bad faith for purposes of its claim before the district court.milan clarified that its rule a motion was addressed both to its claim under the theory of bad faith and under the bond theory.the district court took both motions under advisement.
interrogatories jury charge 
the district court then discussed with the parties the interrogatories,which the district court intended to present to the jury in both its jury charge and as part of the verdict form the first two interrogatories concerned milan claim for the face amount of the injunction bond and whether damages were proximately caused by the erroneously issued injunction.these interrogatories stated as follows 
did plaintiff,milan express,milan,prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it suffered damage as a proximate consequence of the injunction which was issued by this court and which was the subject of the injunction bond executed by defendant,averitt express,averitt,as principal,and upon which defendant,united states fidelity guaranty company,acted as surety 
only if the jury has answered yes to question,what,if any,amount of damage not exceeding has milan proven by a preponderance of the evidence that it sustained as a proximate consequence of the erroneously issued said injunction 
the first two interrogatories thus did not ask the jury to decide whether averitt procured the injunction in bad faith.instead,because the injunction was already dissolved,the question for the jury on milan claim on the injunction bond was only whether milan proved it suffered damages caused by the injunction and if so,the amount of those damages not exceeding the face amount of the bond.
the third and fourth interrogatories addressed milan separate claim for excess or additional damages.neither interrogatory mentioned the injunction or averitt actions in procuring the injunction from the federal district court.instead,these interrogatories focused on averitt actions before the icc.the third interrogatory asked the jury to determine whether averitt obtained its intrastate shipping authority from the icc not in good faith,as follows 
did milan prove by a preponderance of the evidence that averitt operated trucks in alabama under apparent but contested intrastate motor carrier authority in competition with milan for some period of time,and that the said apparent intrastate authority,later determined by the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit to have been erroneously granted by the interstate commerce commission icc,was acquired by averitt from the icc not in good faith 
emphasis added.if the jury found that averitt had acquired its intrastate authority from the icc in bad faith,then the jury was to answer the fourth interrogatory,which asked what damages milan proved it had sustained during the period between the issuance of the purported intrastate authority by the icc to averitt and the date upon which deregulation of intrastate truckers became effective,as follows 
only if the jury has answered question yes,what,if any,amount of damages has milan proven by a preponderance of the evidence that it sustained as a proximate consequence of the operation by averitt under apparent alabama intrastate authority during the time between the issuance of the purported intrastate authority by the icc to averitt and the date upon which deregulation of intrastate truckers became effective 
the fact that averitt actions before the icc,rather than averitt actions before the federal district court,were the focus of milan claim for excess damages is also evidenced by the nature of the time period referenced in the fourth interrogatory.the time period was from when the icc issued intrastate authority to averitt on june,until the deregulation became effective on january.the preliminary injunction,however,was not entered until november,and was dissolved on july.therefore,the fourth interrogatory instructed the jury to award milan damages for losses well outside the time period when the preliminary injunction was in place.specifically,the interrogatory instructed the jury that it could award milan damages which occurred in the five months before the preliminary injunction was entered and in the eighteen months following its dissolution 
additionally,averitt objected to the third interrogatory,arguing that it posed the wrong question.the more accurate question for the jury,averitt contended,was whether the injunction was obtained in good faith,not whether averitt obtained its authority from the icc in bad faith.milan responded that the interrogatory was correctly stated,since the origin of either the bad faith or the good faith started at the icc level.the district court stated that it would leave it like it is and that averitt had its exception.thus,once again,milan made it clear that its claim for excess damages was based on averitt alleged bad faith before the icc.
after the district court charged the jury with the four interrogatories,averitt objected with respect to interrogatory and into interrogatory.again,the district court noted averitt exception.
that averitt good or bad faith actions before the icc were the basis of milan separate claim for excess damages was further manifested by the district court evidentiary rulings and other jury charges at trial.for example,the district court determined that this court prior opinions in north alabama i and north alabama ii,in which averitt petition to the icc was described as illegal and a sham,were admissible as evidence.the district court said that what the eleventh circuit stated in these opinions was ambiguous and need ed to be interpreted by the jury as.the district court further allowed the parties to offer their respective interpretations of this court opinions in their opening and closing statements to the jury.
in his opening statement to the jury,milan counsel argued that this court opinions,stating that averitt application to the icc was a sham,evidenced that averitt conduct was in bad faith we have two opinions from the eleventh circuit stating that the application to the interstate commerce commission was a sham and could not be the basis for a good transfer of alabama intrastate authority.we believe that establishes bad faith.when it charged the jury on the third interrogatory,the district court stated that the eleventh circuit had determined that the apparent intrastate authority had been erroneously granted to averitt by the interstate commerce commission and that the court of appeals used in more than one place the word sham.the district court described these determinations by the eleventh circuit as some evidence of milan claim that the icc grant of authority,which turned out to be erroneous,illegal,was obtained by averitt not in good faith.
jury verdict 
after deliberations,the jury returned a verdict for milan on the first two interrogatories and awarded milan the full amount of the bond.
as to the third and fourth interrogatories,the jury determined that averitt obtained its intrastate motor carrier authority from the icc not in good faith and awarded milan in excess damages.the district court entered a a judgment of against averitt,representing the award on the injunction bond and in additional damages,and b a judgment of against usfg,representing the amount of the bond.
thereafter,averitt and usfg jointly moved again for judgment as a matter of law,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,and alternatively moved for a new trial,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.among their contentions,averitt and usfg repeated the argument that the third and fourth interrogatories were in error because they contemplated a claim based on bad faith before the icc,rather than bad faith in obtaining an injunction.they argued that the third interrogatory asked the wrong question and that b y asking the jury the interrogatory as phrased,the court was in effect creating a private right of action for securing an order from the in bad faith.they also argued that the fourth interrogatory instructed the jury to award damages for injuries incurred by milan for a period of time after the injunction had been dissolved.id.at.their motion also noted that the fourth interrogatory again assumes a cause of action for bad faith obtaining an order from the icc,a cause of action which does not,and can not under applicable law,exist.id.
in response to averitt and usfg motion,milan continued to argue,inter alia,that the third and fourth interrogatories correctly stated its claim for damages in excess of the injunction bond.
dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
the district court never ruled on the motions.instead,on october,the district court declared a ll pending motions moot and vacated the final judgment,finding sua sponte that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the case from the outset.milan express,averitt express,et.the district court determined that the jurisdictional statement contained in the pretrial order had been erroneous,and that neither federal rule of civil procedure c nor gave it jurisdiction over milan claims the court dismissed milan action without prejudice.
following the district court dismissal,milan filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e.in its rule e motion,milan argued for the first time that the court had jurisdiction over its claims pursuant to rule and milan also stated that although it did additionally claim that federal subject matter jurisdiction was granted by sections of the interstate commerce act,the case was,in fact,tried as a claim for damages against an injunction bond and over and above that bond for the wrongful issuance of an injunction.finally,milan argued that t o the extent that the court may perceive that the claim,as tried,extends beyond simply a suit on a bond under,the concept of supplemental jurisdiction was available.
the district court agreed with milan in part and found that provided subject matter jurisdiction over milan claim for the amount of the injunction bond itself.thus,on november,the district court reinstated the portion of the verdict.in reinstating the judgment to that extent,the district court did not discuss milan excess damages claim.thus,the district court order of november,left intact its earlier order dismissing milan excess damages claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.on december,the district court amended its november order to deny averitt and usfg motion for judgment as a matter of law or,alternatively,for a new trial.
first appeal 
milan appealed from the district court order dismissing its excess damages claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.averitt and usfg the district court final judgment of on milan claim on the injunction bond.on april,this court affirmed the district court decision to the limited extent that it found subject matter jurisdiction over milan claim on the injunction bond.in doing so,however,this court held that neither rule nor provided a basis for the district court jurisdiction over milan claim on the bond.milan express,averitt express,cir.instead,this court agreed with milan that provided jurisdiction over milan claim on the bond.id.section provides that district courts have original jurisdiction over any action on a bond executed under any law of the united states.thus,this court joined our sister circuits in concluding that an injunction bond,issued pursuant to rule c to secure a federal court injunction,is in fact a bond executed under any law of the united states.milan express,at internal quotations omitted.
although concluding that federal jurisdiction existed over milan claim on the bond,this court nonetheless reversed the district court entry of judgment on the jury verdict as to milan claim on the bond.see id.at.this court found that the district court had erred in submitting the claim on the bond to the jury because whether to award damages pursuant to an injunction bond rests in the sound discretion of the court equity jurisdiction.id.at quotation omitted.this court therefore remanded the case to the district court to consider whether to exercise its discretion to award milan the amount of the injunction bond.id.this court further held that the district court denial of averitt and usfg motion for judgment as a matter of law as to milan claim for the bond amount was not erroneous,stating this court has already held that the icc order,which the injunction was issued to protect,was erroneous.thus we can not now say that the injunction was appropriately issued.id.at citation omitted.
having found that there was federal jurisdiction over milan claim on the bond,this court remanded the excess damages claim to the district court so that the district court could consider whether to assume supplemental jurisdiction over that claim,pursuant to.id.importantly for the issues in this second appeal,this court also pointed out that the district court had never ruled on averitt motion for judgment as a matter of law or,alternatively,for a new trial regarding the excess damages claim.id.therefore,in the first appeal in this case,this court concluded that b ecause the district court did not rule on averitt motions regarding the excess damages claim,we will not consider those claims herein,but will leave that consideration to the district court on remand.id.
on remand to the district court 
on may,the district court on remand made an independent determination that,with regard to milan claim on the injunction bond,milan was entitled to recover the full amount of the bond,namely.milan express,averitt express,et,at.may.next,the district court addressed what it called milan other claim,namely,its tort claim for damages beyond the amount of the injunction bond.id.at.
the district court decided to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over that excess damages claim under,and decided not to ignore the jury verdict as to that claim,which it had earlier set aside.id.at.the district court then reinstated the jury verdict on the excess damages claim,stating t he court can discern no reason to retry the issue that has already been fully tried to a jury.id.the district court stated that t here was a substantial evidentiary basis for the jury answers to special interrogatories numbered and,finding that averitt acquired its apparent intrastate operating authority not in good faith that as a result milan sustained compensatory damages in the amount of and that its said damages are over and above the amount of the covered by the bond.id.at emphasis supplied.
the district court therefore denied averitt and usfg motion for judgment as a matter of law or,alternatively,for a new trial and reinstated the final judgment a against averitt in the amount of million,representing the award on the injunction bond and in damages in excess of the bond,and b against usfg for the amount of the injunction bond.the appeal presently before this court is averitt and usfg appeal from the district court order on remand.
iii.discussion 
award of bond amount 
averitt contends that the district court abused its discretion by awarding milan the injunction bond,arguing that milan was not wrongfully enjoined,milan failed to prove its damages were proximately caused by the injunction,and the district court failed to address the equitable factors in determining the amount of the bond to which milan was entitled.this court reviews the district court decision to award milan the amount of the injunction bond for abuse of discretion.state of alabama ex rel.siegelman,cir.
under federal rule of civil procedure c,an injunction bond provides security for such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.c.to recover against an injunction bond,a party must prove that it was wrongfully enjoined and that its damages were proximately caused by the erroneously issued injunction.
in the first appeal in this case,this court recognized that the issuance of the injunction in this case was erroneous.see milan express,averitt express,cir.specifically,this court stated 
this court has already held that the icc order,which the injunction was issued to protect,was erroneous.north alabama express,icc,cir.thus we can not now say that the injunction was appropriately issued.
id.moreover,a prevailing defendant is entitled to damages on the injunction bond unless there is a good reason for not requiring the plaintiff to pay in the particular case.siegelman,at quoting with approval,capital dev.bd.of illinois,cir.in this case,the district court on remand properly considered the equities of the case and determined that milan sustained damages as a proximate consequence of the wrongfully obtained injunction.
we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the full bond amount to milan.thus,we affirm the district court denial of averitt and usfg joint motion for judgment as a matter of law as to milan claim for the bond amount.
excess damages claim 
averitt also argues that the district court order reinstating the jury verdict on milan claim for excess damages must be reversed because the district court erred in denying averitt motion for judgment as a matter of law as to this claim.we review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.morro city of birmingham,cir.
on appeal,milan contends that the district court appropriately exercised supplemental jurisdiction over its claim for excess damages,pursuant to.on appeal milan describes its claim for excess damages as one for bad faith procurement of an injunction under alabama state law.the alabama supreme court has recognized a cause of action for bad faith procurement of an injunction.see ex parte water jet,brown,so d.specifically,the alabama supreme court has held that i f a plaintiff seeks an interlocutory injunction in bad faith,the defendant can recover damages from the plaintiff in excess of the amount of the bond.id.under alabama law,a claim for bad faith procurement of an injunction would allow plaintiff to recover damages in excess of a bond if the injunction is wrongfully issued and procured in bad faith.
the problem for milan is that its complaint,the statement of milan claim in the pretrial order,the court interrogatories to the jury,and the jury verdict addressed a claim for averitt actions in bad faith before the icc and not any claim for bad faith in procuring the injunction from the federal district court 
this is not a case where the jury rendered a general verdict.instead,the jury was given special interrogatories which reveal precisely what claims the jury was asked to decide and what the jury decided.accordingly,in reaching a verdict on the excess damages claim,the jury determined only that averitt had obtained its authority from the icc not in good faith,and did not make any determination regarding averitt actions in obtaining the injunction from the federal district court 
the only claim for excess damages pled in milan complaint,included in the pretrial order,instructed in the jury instructions,and decided by the jury is a claim for bad faith before the icc no such cause of action exists under alabama or federal law.a jury verdict on a cause of action can not be upheld nor can a verdict stand on the basis of an existing state law claim which was not pled or decided by the jury 
iv.conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court denial of averitt and usfg motion for judgment as a matter of law or,alternatively,for a new trial,and affirm in part and reverse and vacate in part the judgment.specifically,we affirm the district court judgment in the amount of in favor of milan and against averitt and usfg on milan claim on the injunction bond.we reverse and vacate the district court judgment of in favor of milan and against averitt on milan claim for excess damages.we further find that the district court erred in denying averitt motion for judgment as a matter of law as to milan claim for excess damages and on remand the district court is directed to enter final judgment in favor of averitt on milan claim for excess damages.

civil action no formerly.
plaintiff milan express,milan is a tennessee corporation doing business as a motor common carrier of general commodities holding authority to operate intrastate within the state of alabama issued by the alabama public service commission in certificate,and.milan also holds authority as an interstate carrier of general commodities to and from the state of alabama with authority to serve the balance of the united states.
the defendant averitt express,is also a motor common carrier authorized to provide service in interstate commerce to and from the state of alabama.averitt express,however,did not hold any authority or authorization from the alabama public service commission to provide service intrastate within the state of alabama until issued a certificate on january.averitt express,however,has been operating as a general commodity carrier within the state of alabama,purportedly under the authority of deaton,at least since november,when in case a preliminary injunction was entered by united states district judge clemon requiring the recognition of a transfer of the deaton alabama intrastate authority to averitt pursuant to an order of the interstate commerce commission.a copy of that preliminary injunction is attached hereto as exhibit a.at the time of the issuance of that preliminary injunction and pursuant to its order,a bond was filed by averitt express.a copy of that bond is attached hereto as exhibit b.
plaintiff milan express has contended since the icc order was entered approving a transfer of the deaton authority to averitt in the spring of that this order of the icc was unlawful and beyond the authority of the interstate commerce commission.these contentions have been made in various appeals of the icc order and of district court actions related to the icc order.the eleventh circuit united states court of appeals has entered a final order dated august,which is attached hereto as exhibit c.pursuant to this order,the eleventh circuit finally decided that the icc order was unlawful and sets it aside.thus,averitt express,has operated intrastate within the s
