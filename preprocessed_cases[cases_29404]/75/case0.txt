section does not address personal jurisdiction over railroads.
a section first relevant sentence provides that an action may be brought in a district court of the united states,in,among other places,the district in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action.this court has comprehended that sentence as a venue prescription,not as one governing personal jurisdiction.baltimore ohio kepner.congress generally uses the expression,where suit may be brought,to indicate the federal districts in which venue is proper,see,b,while it typically provides for the exercise of personal jurisdiction by authorizing service of process,see.nelson and tyrrell contend that the judiciary act provision that prompted enactment concerned both personal jurisdiction and venue,but this court has long read that judiciary act provision to concern venue only,see,green chicago.
b the second relevant sentence of that t he jurisdiction of the courts of the united states under this chapter shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several states refers to concurrent jurisdiction of state and federal courts over fela actions.see second employers liability cases.congress added this clarification after the connecticut supreme court held that congress intended to confine fela litigation to federal courts,and that state courts had no obligation to entertain fela claims.
c none of the cases featured by the montana supreme court in reaching its contrary conclusion resolved a question of personal jurisdiction.pope atlantic coast line,miles illinois central,kepner,and denver rio grande western terte,distinguished.moreover,all these cases,save pope,were decided before this court transformative decision on personal jurisdiction in international shoe washington.
the montana courts exercise of personal jurisdiction under montana law does not comport with the fourteenth amendment due process clause.only the propriety of general personal jurisdiction is at issue here because neither nelson nor tyrrell alleges injury from work in or related to montana.
a state court may exercise general jurisdiction over corporations when their affiliations with the state are so continuous and systematic as to render them essentially at home in the forum state.daimler,at.the paradigm forums in which a corporate defendant is at home are the corporation place of incorporation and its principal place of business,at,but in an exceptional case,a corporate defendant operations in another forum may be so substantial and of such a nature as to render the corporation at home in that state,at.daimler involved no fela claim or railroad defendant,but the due process constraint described there applies to all assertions of general jurisdiction over nonresident defendants that constraint does not vary with the type of claim asserted or business enterprise sued.
here,bnsf is not incorporated or headquartered in montana and its activity there is not so substantial and of such a nature as to render the corporation at home in that state.ibid.

on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of montana 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
the two cases we decide today arise under the federal employers liability act fela,stat,as amended,et,which makes railroads liable in money damages to their employees for injuries.both suits were pursued in montana state courts although the injured workers did not reside in montana,nor were they injured there.the defendant railroad,bnsf railway company bnsf,although doing business in montana when the litigation commenced,was not incorporated in montana,nor did it maintain its principal place of business in that state.to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction over bnsf,the montana supreme court relied on,which provides in relevant part 
under this chapter an action may be brought in a district court of the united states,in the district of the residence of the defendant,or in which the cause of action arose,or in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action.the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states under this chapter shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several states.
we hold that does not address personal jurisdiction over railroads.its first relevant sentence is a venue prescription governing proper locations for fela suits filed in federal court.the provision second relevant sentence,using the term concurrent jurisdiction,refers to jurisdiction,not personal jurisdiction.it simply clarifies that the federal courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction over fela suits state courts can hear them,too.
montana supreme court,in the alternative,relied on state law,under which personal jurisdiction could be asserted over persons found within montana.rule civ.proc.b.bnsf fit that bill,the court stated,because it has over miles of railroad track and employs more than workers in montana.our precedent,however,explains that the fourteenth amendment due process clause does not permit a state to hale an corporation before its courts when the corporation is not at home in the state and the occurred elsewhere.daimler ag bauman,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore reverse the judgment of the montana supreme court.
in march,respondent robert nelson,a north dakota resident,brought a fela suit against bnsf in a montana state court to recover damages for knee injuries nelson allegedly sustained while working for bnsf as a driver.in may,respondent kelli tyrrell,appointed in south dakota as the administrator of her husband brent tyrrell estate,similarly sued bnsf under fela in a montana state court,at,at.brent tyrrell,his widow alleged,had developed a fatal kidney cancer from his exposure to carcinogenic chemicals while working for bnsf,at,at.neither plaintiff alleged injuries arising from or related to work performed in montana indeed,neither nelson nor brent tyrrell appears ever to have worked for bnsf in montana,at,at.

we granted certiorari,to resolve whether authorizes state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over railroads doing business in their states but not incorporated or headquartered there,and whether the montana courts exercise of personal jurisdiction in these cases comports with due process.
nelson and tyrrell contend that first relevant sentence confers personal jurisdiction on federal courts,and that the section second relevant sentence extends that grant of jurisdiction to state courts.neither contention is tenable.section first relevant sentence concerns venue its next sentence speaks to jurisdiction 
the first sentence of states that an action may be brought in a district court of the united states,in,among other places,the district in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action.in baltimore ohio kepner,we comprehended this clause as establish ing venue for a action,at.congress,we explained,designed to expand venue beyond the limits of the judiciary act general venue provision,which allowed suit only in districts of which the defendant was an inhabitant.at see act of,stat.nowhere in kepner or in any other decision did we intimate that might affect personal jurisdiction.
congress generally uses the expression,where suit may be brought,to indicate the federal districts in which venue is proper.see,b general venue statute specifying where a civil action may be brought oakley,ali,fed.judicial code project listing special venue statutes,many with similar language.see also kepner,at frankfurter,dissenting the phrasing of follows the familiar pattern generally employed by congress in framing venue provisions.
in contrast,congress typical mode of providing for the exercise of personal jurisdiction has been to authorize service of process.see,clayton act provision stating that all process in cases against a corporation arising under federal antitrust laws may be served in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant,or wherever the defendant may be found a under federal trade commission act,process may be served on any person,partnership,or corporation wherever it may be found see also omni capital int l,rudolf wolff,discussing statutes that authorize or fail to authorize nationwide service of process.but schlanger seamans,though congress has provided for nationwide service of process in e,supp.v,that statute was meant to expand venue,not personal jurisdiction.congress uses this terminology because,absent consent,a basis for service of a summons on the defendant is prerequisite to the exercise of personal jurisdiction.see omni capital,at.
nelson and tyrrell,however,argue that relates to personal jurisdiction.in their view,the judiciary act provision that prompted enactment,stat,concerned both personal jurisdiction and venue.according to house and senate reports,they contend,two cases had brought to congress attention the problem with the prior provision namely,that in cases it authorized suit only in the district of the defendant residence.brief for respondents.see,citing macon grocery atlantic coast line,cound atchison,wd,same.in both cases,the courts had dismissed fela suits for want of jurisdiction.macon grocery,at cound,at.to avert such jurisdictional dismissals,they urge,congress enacted.
legislative history throws little light here.kepner,at driving today decision,we have long read the judiciary act provision to concern venue only.see green chicago,analyzing personal jurisdiction separately,after concluding that venue was proper under judiciary act provision.see also lee chesapeake ohio,noting that materially identical successor to judiciary act provision,act of,stat,relates to the venue of suits indeed,reading the judiciary act provision to authorize the exercise of personal jurisdiction would have yielded an anomalous result in diversity cases,the provision allowed for suit in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.stat.interpreting that clause to provide for jurisdiction would have allowed a plaintiff to hale a defendant into court in the plaintiff home district,even if the district was one with which the defendant had no affiliation,and the,no connection.
the second sentence in point provides that t he jurisdiction of the courts of the united states under this chapter shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several states.nelson and tyrrell argue that this sentence extends to state courts the first sentence alleged conferral of personal jurisdiction on federal courts.but,as just discussed,the first sentence concerns venue and confers no personal jurisdiction on any court.
we have understood second sentence to provide for the concurrent jurisdiction of state and federal courts over actions under fela.see second employers liability cases.as nelson and tyrrell acknowledge,congress added the provision to confirm concurrent jurisdiction after the connecticut supreme court held that congress intended to confine fela litigation to federal courts,and that state courts had no obligation to entertain fela claims.see brief for respondents citing hoxie new york.as justice mckinnon recognized in her dissent from the montana supreme court decision in nelson and tyrrell cases,t he phrase concurrent jurisdiction is a term of art long employed by congress and courts to refer to jurisdiction,not personal jurisdiction.at,at.see,mims arrow financial services,llc,federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over private suits arising under the telephone consumer protection act of,claflin houseman,state courts retain concurrent jurisdiction over suits in which a bankrupt party is involved,notwithstanding exclusive federal jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters.
pointing to a quartet of cases,the montana supreme court observed that this court consistently has interpreted to allow state courts to hear cases brought under fela even where the only basis for jurisdiction is the railroad doing business in the forum s tate.at,at citing pope atlantic coast line,miles illinois central,kepner,denver rio grande western terte.
none of the decisions featured by the montana supreme court resolved a question of personal jurisdiction.terte hel
