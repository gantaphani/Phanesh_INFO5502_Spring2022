articles and a of the texas insurance code the code provide that any insured named in the policy may reject uninsured motorist um and personal injury protection pip coverages.the question here is whether the insured spouse of the person listed as the named insured in the declarations page of a policy may reject those coverages.the court of appeals held that the spouse could not.we conclude,however,that the spouse falls within the class of persons statutorily entitled to reject um and pip coverages under the policy.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment in favor of old american county mutual fire insurance company old american.
factual background 
this case is presented on stipulated facts on january,margarita sanchez,wife of zeferino sanchez,applied for and purchased an insurance policy from old american for two of the couple vehicles.sanchez rejected um and pip coverages on the insurance application,and old american never assessed premiums for the coverages in applying for the policy,sanchez affirmed that the rejections of um and pip coverages would apply to the policy and to all future renewals of that policy.the sanchezes renewed their existing policy in.neither nor sanchez requested pip or um coverages at that time.
although sanchez name appeared on the policy application,she was not listed as a named insured on the declarations page the policy,however,defined you and your,the insureds under the policy to include the named insured as well as t he spouse if a resident of the same household.sanchez fell within the policy definitions of you and your because she and sanchez lived in the same house at all pertinent times.to that end,the parties stipulated that both and sanchez were insured under the policy.the parties disagree,however,about the extent of the policy coverage.specifically,the parties dispute whether sanchez was entitled to um and pip benefits to cover damages arising from a accident.
on april,sanchez chevrolet pickup truck was parked on the shoulder of interstate in hays county.a vehicle driven by an uninsured motorist struck sanchez truck as he was lying beneath it repairing a broken fuel hose.the impact caused the pickup to collapse on sanchez and sever his spinal cord.although sanchez owned the pickup truck at the time sanchez applied for the policy,sanchez did not identify the pickup in the application and it was not a covered auto under the policy.the policy um and pip provisions excluded coverage for injuries sustained while occupying or when struck by any vehicle owned by an insured that was not insured under the policy,the exclusion.
procedural background 
after the accident,sanchez filed a claim with old american for um and pip benefits under the policy.old american filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment absolving it of any obligation to pay those benefits.it then moved for summary judgment on three grounds i sanchez rejection of um and pip coverages precluded sanchez recovery of those benefits ii the policy exclusion eliminated um and pip coverages because sanchez sustained his injuries while upon and thus occupying the uncovered pickup and iii sanchez was struck by the uncovered pickup,which also invoked the um and pip exclusion.the trial court denied summary judgment on the first ground,granted summary judgment for old american on the second ground,and did not rule on the third.sanchez appealed the trial court judgment,and old american,contending that it was also entitled to summary judgment on the first and third grounds.
the court of appeals held that old american was not entitled to summary judgment on any of the asserted grounds and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.as to the first ground,the court held that sanchez was not i a named insured because her name was not listed on the declarations page of the policy,or ii an insured named in the policy with authority to reject coverages because she was not explicitly named in the policy.id.at.as to the second and third grounds,the court held that sanchez was neither occupying nor struck by his truck in the accident that gave rise to this suit.id.at.
we granted old american petition for review.because we conclude that old american was entitled to summary judgment on the first ground,we do not reach the other two grounds asserted by the parties in this case.
discussion 
the parties do not dispute that sanchez rejected um and pip coverages in writing they do not assert that there were any formal defects with the manner or form of rejection and they agree that premiums were never assessed for the coverages.the only issue is whether sanchez had statutory authority to waive them.to resolve this issue,we must determine whether,under articles and a of the texas insurance code,the spouse of the person identified as the named insured in the declarations page of a policy may reject um and pip coverages.the parties assert,and we agree,that this is a legal question with no genuine issues of material fact.
articles and a of the code mandate um and pip coverages in texas automobile liability insurance policies,unless those coverages are explicitly waived.see,a.specifically,article of the texas insurance code states 
no automobile liability insurance including insurance issued pursuant to an assigned risk plan established under authority of section of the texas motor vehicle act,covering liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of any motor vehicle shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless coverage is provided therein or supplemental thereto,in at least the limits described in the texas motor vehicle act,under provisions prescribed by the board,for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured or underinsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury,sickness,or disease,including death,or property damage resulting therefrom.the coverages required under this article shall not be applicable where any insured named in the policy shall reject the coverage in writing provided that unless the named insured thereafter requests such coverage in writing,such coverage need not be provided in or supplemental to a renewal policy where the named insured has rejected the coverage in connection with a policy previously issued to him by the same insurer or by an affiliated insurer.
