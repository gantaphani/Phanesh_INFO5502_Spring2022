the issue on this interlocutory appeal from an order denying a motion to dismiss an antitrust claim is whether the plaintiff had sufficient notice of the availability of the claim against a chapter debtor to satisfy due process requirements and render the claim discharged.this issue arises on an appeal by defendants appellants united air lines,dba united airlines,and united continental holdings,fka ual collectively united,from the may,order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york john gleeson,district judge,denying united motion to dismiss an antitrust complaint brought against it by plaintiff appellee dpwn holdings dhl.see dpwn holdings usa,united air lines,d.
we conclude that,in the circumstances of this case,the district court applied an incorrect standard in accepting as true dhl allegation that it was not aware of,or with due diligence could not have become aware of,sufficient facts to plead an antitrust claim that would survive a motion to dismiss in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding.we therefore remand for further development of the facts concerning a what dhl knew or reasonably should have known in time to present an antitrust claim in the bankruptcy proceeding,or to file a late proof of claim or move to amend the reorganization plan and b what united knew or reasonably should have known concerning dhl claim.
background 
facts concerning the alleged conspiracy.because this appeal is from the denial of a motion to dismiss,the facts regarding united alleged involvement in the conspiracy are taken from dhl complaint and are assumed to be true.see bryant state education department,cir.united was a member of the international air transport association iata at all times relevant to this appeal.iata enjoyed limited antitrust immunity in the european union through a block exemption.in,the european union directorate general for competition dgc sent a letter to an official at iata specifying that the block exemption did not cover the coordinated implementation of surcharges.this letter was shared with iata members.the united states department of transportation dot communicated a similar conclusion to iata.nevertheless,in iata adopted a surcharge upon the pretext of recouping increased costs.as a result,the dgc withdrew iata block exemption and subsequently denied an application for an individual exemption for the surcharge.
on august,united and two other airlines,lufthansa and scandinavian airlines sas entered into an agreement to provide globally integrated air transportation services in competition with other carriers and carrier alliances while remaining independent companies.on november,dot issued an order permitting the alliance and providing it limited antitrust immunity.however,the agreement prohibited the airlines from exchang ing information,discuss ing,agree ing upon,or coordinat ing on any subject or in any manner that would cause any party to contravene i any law 
in early,members of iata considered joint strategies to manage increases in the price of aviation fuel,including implementing fuel surcharges.at that time,members of iata considered the antitrust risks of coordinated surcharging.minutes from an iata conference on the topic,quoting andrew charlton,director of the iata legal department,stated 
antitrust laws prohibit competitors reaching any form of agreement,understanding or arrangement which is likely to have an impact on price a relevant exception is where immunity has been granted by the relevant authority for rates reached pursuant to a particular procedure and within the strict confines of the terms of the approval itself.
without any immunity,authorities regard with great suspicion any situation where competitors charge the same rate.in the event that there is any evidence whatsoever that competitors have had an opportunity to communicate in any way,and charge the same rate,there is a very strong assumption that they do so having colluded.
until the particular approval is granted for any rate agreed at this conference,that situation would apply.in other words,in my opinion,any airline which moves to charge the rate which is agreed at this conference before government approval,and therefore antitrust immunity,is obtained,would face a very strong evidential presumption that the rate being charged had been agreed between competitors and without antitrust immunity.
on august,iata approved resolution,under which member airlines would introduce a fuel surcharge tied to changes in the spot price of aviation fuel as tracked by the iata fuel price index fpi.iata officials were later advised that dot refused to give approval to the resolution,which would confer antitrust immunity,unless accompanied by economic justification based on current prices,which the airlines were unable to provide.as a result,iata board of governors declined to make the resolution effective.
in late to early,for the first time since approval of resolution,fuel spot prices increased enough to trigger a fuel surcharge.on january,iata submitted resolution for approval by dot,hoping to secure antitrust immunity and put the resolution into effect.united informed its competitors that it planned to impose a fuel surcharge effective february.then,before receiving a response from dot,united and a number of other airlines started charging dhl and other customers a fuel surcharge pursuant to the terms of resolution.
on march,dot rejected the airlines application for approval,stating,the uniform,index mechanism proposed here appears fundamentally flawed and unfair to shippers and other users of cargo air transportation.on march,iata members circulated a statement advising its airlines that implementing surcharges pursuant to the resolution might be illegal.the statement advised 
if members were to coordinate pricing by reference to the index,whether pursuant to this disapproved resolution or simply through de facto parallel pricing actions,that could be regarded as an illegal conspiracy in violation of applicable competition laws because any further pricing actions linked to the now tainted index could expose the carriers engaging in such pricing actions to serious antitrust liability,we must advise that carriers not engage in any pricing actions tied to the index.
iata also announced that it would stop publishing the fpi,because the index has now become tainted by the dot order finding resolution,to which the index was linked,to be adverse to the public interest and in violation of law.
dhl alleges that after the dot rejection of resolution,united and other airlines continued charging fuel surcharges as if resolution had been approved.for example,dhl alleges that in late,united and other cartel members in a coordinated,largely parallel fashion increased the fuel surcharge to dhl in accordance with resolution.
over the next few years,the airlines strayed from the methodology set forth in resolution.despite these deviations,united and the other airlines continued to fix fuel charges in the same anticompetitive and illegal manner.for example,in late,the airlines recalibrated the fuel surcharge formula in a coordinated manner.dhl complaint alleges that the airlines did so to preserve the supracompetitive profits generated by the fuel surcharge despite lower fuel prices.then,in july,united began using its own jet fuel index.dhl complaint alleges that this index was a fa√ßade to help united maintain the appearance of acting unilaterally.dhl alleges many other actions in furtherance of a conspiracy to fix fuel surcharges until at least.
the chapter proceeding.on december,united filed a petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.as part of its claims notification procedures,united identified dhl as a potential creditor holding more than twenty disputed claims.an antitrust claim was not mentioned.dhl received actual notice of united bankruptcy and all relevant deadlines.
on january,the bankruptcy court confirmed united reorganization plan,which became effective on february.pursuant to d,the plan provided for a blanket discharge of all claims and causes of action,known or unknown,of any nature whatsoever against united that arose before the confirmation date.also on february,distribution of shares of stock in the reorganized united began and was percent complete by march.
on december,a final decree was entered in united bankruptcy.all holders of general,unsecured claims received stock in the reorganized company that was valued at between and cents on the dollar.
developments.on february,law enforcement officials raided the offices of several airlines,other than united,allegedly involved in a fuel surcharge conspiracy.three days later,on february,a class action was filed against united and others,asserting claims like those asserted in dhl pending lawsuit see dist,d at.in june,the department of justice doj served a subpoena on united requesting information related to certain passenger pricing practices and surcharges.doj did not indict united for a conspiracy,although united was named as a defendant in over ninety class actions alleging such a conspiracy.united settled with the majority of class action plaintiffs in return for agreements to cooperate with the plaintiffs investigation.
on july,as a result of a settlement with one of the airlines involved in the alleged conspiracy,dhl obtained access to documents disclosing united participation in the scheme.
dhl antitrust suit.on february,dhl filed a lawsuit in the district court alleging that united was part of a conspiracy to fix the price of air cargo shipments,in violation of section one of the sherman act.the alleged scheme involved fixing the base freight rate and various surcharges.anticipating united defense that dhl antitrust claim was discharged in the bankruptcy proceeding,dhl alleged that it first learned of united involvement in a conspiracy after july,when dhl obtained access to confidential documents describing the scope of the cartel and providing evidence of united participation in the cartel.complaint.dhl also alleged that it did not and could not have discovered the injuries it sustained as a result of united illegal activity until after july.united moved to dismiss dhl antitrust suit on the ground that,among other things,dhl cause of action was discharged by the confirmation of united plan of reorganization.
on may,the district court denied united motion to dismiss.dist,d at.accepting for purposes of united motion to dismiss dhl allegation concerning its lack of knowledge,the court stated,i t is undisputed for purposes of this motion that dhl could not have discovered united alleged antitrust violations until after confirmation of the plan.id.at.the court held that dhl claim was not barred by confirmation of united reorganization plan because dhl was denied due process for lack of notice of its potential claim.id.at.in view of the time and expense that a potentially needless antitrust trial would take,the court sensibly certified its ruling for interlocutory appeal,and this court granted united petition for an interlocutory appeal.see b.
discussion 
the basic legal principles relevant to this appeal are not in dispute.under the bankruptcy code,confirmation of a chapter reorganization plan discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the date of confirmation.d a.in this context,a debt is defined to mean liability on a claim,and the term claim means right to payment,whether or not such right is reduced to judgment,liquidated,unliquidated,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,legal,equitable,secured,or unsecured.a.the discharge of preconfirmation claims operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action.a.the discharge of such claims serves the bankruptcy policy of providing debtors with a fresh start to permit their continued operation free of debts.see central virginia community college katz.however,a claim can not be discharged if the claimant is denied due process because of lack of adequate notice.see wright owens corning,cir.and whether notice comports with due process requirements turns on the reasonableness of the notice,see mullane central hanover bank trust,a flexible standard that often turns on what the debtor or the claimant knew about the claim or,with reasonable diligence,should have known,see chemetron jones,cir.
in ordinary cases in which a claim for money is asserted,it will often be entirely reasonable to expect that the debtor knows to whom it owes money,although many claimants will also know,or with reasonable diligence could ascertain,that they are owed money.however,in the context of a claim for damages based on the debtor alleged violation of law,two competing policies will be in tension.on the one hand is the policy sought to be vindicated by the statute alleged to be violated,here the sherman antitrust act.that policy promoting competition is enhanced by limiting the circumstances in which the claim is discharged.on the other hand is the policy sought to be vindicated by the bankruptcy code.that policy providing a debtor emerging from bankruptcy with a fresh start is enhanced by expanding the circumstances in which a claim is discharged moreover,a debtor will normally be less likely to be charged with knowledge that it has violated the law than that it owes money unrelated to a law violation.
we recognized the tension between these policies in in re chateaugay,cir,which pitted the policy of environmental protection under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act cercla,et,against the fresh start policy of the bankruptcy code.the code aims to provide reorganized debtors with a fresh start,an objective made more feasible by maximizing the scope of a discharge.cercla aims to clean up environmental damage,an objective that the enforcement agencies in this litigation contend will be better served if their entitlement to be reimbursed for cercla response costs based on pollution is not considered to be a claim and instead may be asserted at full value against the reorganized corporation.id.at.we also recognized that it will sometimes be appropriate to permit the fresh start policy to override the policy of the statute alleged to be violated.here,we encounter a bankruptcy statute that is intended to override many provisions of law that would apply in the absence of bankruptcy especially laws otherwise providing creditors suing promptly with full payment of their claims.id.
in the pending case,the district court accepted,for purposes of united motion to dismiss,dhl allegation that it could not have discovered united alleged antitrust violations until after confirmation of the plan.dist,d at although factual allegations of a complaint are normally accepted as true on a motion to dismiss,see,goldstein pataki,cir,that principle does not apply to general allegations that are contradicted by more specific allegations in the complaint.see,hirsch arthur andersen,cir barberan nationpoint,d,in re livent.noteholders securities litigation,d.in ashcroft iqbal,the supreme court deemed conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true on a motion to dismiss an allegation that a defendant knew of harsh conditions of confinement.id.at,quoting complaint.it is not clear,and has not since been clarified,whether the court unwillingness to accept this allegation of knowledge was intended to apply generally to allegations of mental states or was a more limited pronouncement influenced by the fact that the defendants were senior officials of the government,less likely to have knowledge of the alleged conditions of harsh confinement than lower ranking officials,like the defendant prison warden,with more immediate responsibilities for the alleged conditions.
whatever the scope of the supreme court statement in iqbal,dhl claim of lack of knowledge in this case is contradicted by several allegations in its complaint.for example,paragraph alleges that members of iata,including united,adopted resolution to set fuel surcharges,paragraph alleges that the carriers,including united,implemented the resolution,paragraphs and allege that the airlines raised fuel surcharges in parallel in conformity with the resolution,paragraph alleges that the surcharges increased at a greater rate than the increase in prices of aviatio
