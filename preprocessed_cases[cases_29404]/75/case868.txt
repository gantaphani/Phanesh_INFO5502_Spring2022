this appeal requires us to determine whether appellants,who are all current or former bus drivers for american coach lines of miami aclm,are subject to a provision in the fair labor standards act flsa,et,exempting from the flsa overtime requirements any employees who fall under the jurisdiction of the secretary of transportation under the motor carrier act mca.the district court found appellants to be eligible for this motor carrier exemption and therefore granted the portion of aclm motion for summary judgment addressing appellants claims for overtime wages.after reviewing the record and the parties briefs and hearing oral argument,we affirm the grant of summary judgment.
background 
aclm is a private motor carrier providing ground transportation for passengers that holds itself out to be an interstate motor carrier.it is licensed with the united states department of transportation dot,holds all the authorizations from the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa necessary to be an interstate passenger motor carrier,and has been issued a dot number.since,federal transportation agencies have audited aclm at least twice,on at least one occasion in combination with florida authorities.aclm also requires its drivers to meet dot safety standards,which florida has adopted as well.see.stat.aclm does not pay its drivers overtime wages.
aclm primarily provides transportation within the state of florida,though some of its business is between florida and other states.much of aclm revenue comes from shuttling cruise ship passengers between the miami and fort lauderdale airports and local hotels and cruise ship ports.since september,aclm has had a written contract to be the sole provider of such transportation for royal caribbean cruise lines royal caribbean during daytime hours.aclm asserts that between april and december it transported more than royal caribbean passengers,trips that resulted in over million in revenues.appellants contend that there is no proof that aclm provided such transport prior to september,though they appear not to dispute the total revenue figure.in addition to this written arrangement with royal caribbean,aclm maintains that it earned over from earlier informal agreements to provide similar shuttle transportation for costa cruises and princess cruises.appellants likewise dispute the existence of such arrangements.
under aclm contract with royal caribbean,it provides ground transportation for passengers who book vacation packages through travel agents or royal caribbean.for those passengers,ground transportation is included as part of the overall package and is not priced or itemized separately.passengers who do not ground transportation can request shuttle service when they arrive at the airport or cruise ship terminal,which will then be charged to that passenger royal caribbean account under the agreement,royal caribbean provides aclm with weekly manifests listing the expected time,date,and number of passengers for each shuttle trip.royal caribbean employees greet passengers on arrival,contact aclm when a bus is required,and collect vouchers from passengers before they board the bus.royal caribbean does not keep the vouchers nor does it give them to aclm rather,it gives aclm a load slip with a head count for each trip.aclm then uses these load slips to invoice royal caribbean for the trips.the agreement stated that aclm would receive payment only if a passenger actually boarded the bus,with royal caribbean deciding whether to pay based on a or rate as a result,aclm receives all of its payments from royal caribbean,rather than the passengers.
in addition to these local shuttle services,aclm also provided other forms of and motor coach transportation,including driving shuttle bus routes at the university of miami.between and,aclm drivers made at least trips that involved travel,some for as long as days both parties agree that approximately million,or of aclm total revenue during that period,came from these trips and that about of its drivers made such trips there appear to have been aclm drivers who made trips during the time frame,which constitutes of the drivers employed by aclm for that period nine of the appellants made trips for aclm,and appellants spent less than days on such trips during the period in question aclm does not keep records of how many trips its drivers make on a daily or annual basis,and there is no solid evidence regarding how many overall trips aclm drivers made between and nor of what percentage of those trips involved travel.one aclm executive agreed that total trips a year would be a reasonable estimate.he stated that,if this estimate were correct,then around of those trips would involve travel,which would mean that approximately of aclm total trips were out of state 
in august,three aclm drivers brought suit against aclm in the united states district court for the southern district of florida.they alleged that aclm had violated the flsa minimum wage and overtime provisions and florida whistleblower act.in december of that year,a fourth named plaintiff joined the suit,and the district court conditionally certified the class of all drivers employed by aclm from august to the present,a class that eventually comprised plaintiffs both parties filed motions for summary judgment.the drivers moved for partial summary judgment on,inter alia,the applicability of the motor carrier exemption,whereas aclm moved for summary judgment on all of the claims.in aclm motion,it asserted that,as a motor carrier,it was exempt from the overtime requirements of the flsa and thus did not have to pay overtime to the employees.
the district court granted in part and denied in part the parties respective summary judgment motions.the court found that all of the drivers,with the exception of those who predominately drove shuttle bus routes at the university of miami,were exempt from the flsa overtime requirements by virtue of the motor carrier exemption it therefore granted aclm summary judgment motion with respect to the motor carrier exemption for the bus drivers.the drivers moved for reconsideration of the order,which the court denied.the court then entered final judgment against the bus drivers on their overtime claims.appellants appealed that portion of the order granting in part aclm motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether it was eligible for the motor carrier exemption.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see waters miller,cir.in conducting our review,we construe all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.see id.
motor carrier exemption 
the flsa requires employers to pay employees at for any time worked in excess of forty hours per week.see a.however,the act specifically exempts from this requirement any employee with respect to whom the secretary of transportation has power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of the mca.id.b.congress created this exemption to eliminate any conflict between the jurisdiction exercised by the department of labor dol over the flsa and the mutually exclusive jurisdiction exercised by the dot over the mca.see spires ben hill county,cir.because of this congressional intent,the secretary of transportation does not have to exercise the authority granted to him by the mca for the motor carrier exemption to be applicable instead,his power to regulate under the act merely needs to cover a particular group of employees.see id.
we construe flsa exemptions narrowly against the employer see jeffery sarasota white sox,cir per curiam.the employer bears the burden of showing its entitlement to the exemption.see id.the secretary of transportation has authority under the mca to regulate the maximum hours of service of employees who are employed by a common carrier by motor vehicle engaged in interstate commerce and whose activities directly affect the safety of operations of such motor vehicles.spires,at see also b a.the mca indicates that the secretary has this power for,inter alia,all transportation described in.see a.section in turn provides the secretary with jurisdiction over transportation by motor carrier in various contexts,including between places in different states,between places in the same state if the transport passes through another state,and between the united states and a foreign country to the extent that the transportation occurs in the united states id.a,b,e.the motor carrier exemption applies only to those employees over whom the secretary of transportation has this authority.see a.
the applicability of the motor carrier exemption depends both on the class to which his employer belongs and on the class of work involved in the employee job.id.there are two requirements for an employee to be subject to the motor carrier exemption.first,his employer business must be subject to the secretary of transportation jurisdiction under the mca.see baez wells fargo armored serv,cir per curiam id.second,the employee activities must directly affect the safety of operation of motor vehicles in the transportation on the public highways of passengers or property in interstate or foreign commerce within the meaning of the motor carrier act.baez,at see also a.we address these prongs in turn.
secretary mca jurisdiction over aclm 
for the first prong to be met,aclm bus service must be subject to the secretary of transportation jurisdiction under the mca.there are a number of facts here to support such a finding.most importantly,aclm was licensed by the dot,has the fmcsa authorizations necessary to be an interstate motor carrier,and was audited in the past by the dot.as we have previously noted,the fact that a company holds these kind of authorizations indicates that the dot has exercised jurisdiction over it.see baez,at noting that the fact that the interstate commerce commission,which had authority over the mca at the time,issued a permit to a company indicated that mca jurisdiction already had been exercised over that company.additionally,aclm provided bus service that crossed state lines and derived about of its revenue from those trips.it also held itself out as an interstate motor carrier 
appellants contend that a carrier must engage in more than de minimus interstate commerce to fall under the secretary jurisdiction and that aclm small number of interstate trips would not meet this standard.appellants primary authority for such a requirement is morris mccomb.in that case,the supreme court found a business to be subject to mca jurisdiction when about of its total trips stemmed from interstate commerce,along with of its revenues.see morris,at.at.they also cite a number of other district court cases imposing similar requirements.see,rossi associated limousine,d.on the whole,these cases suggest that a company interstate business is de minimus if it constitutes less than one percent of the overall trips taken by the company.see turk buffets,summarizing cases.
the de minimus requirement may be inapplicable to situations such as this,where the company has the appropriate federal licensing and there is undisputed proof of some transportation that crosses state lines.we can find no cases indicating that this evidence,by itself,would not be enough to meet the prong.assuming arguendo that there is such a requirement,we find aclm to have met it.in analyzing the de minimus question,we find it pertinent to consider both the number of interstate trips made and the percentage of revenue the company earned from those trips.see garcia fleetwood limousine,d.although morris principally focused on the number of trips made,we believe the amount of revenue derived from those trips is likewise indicative of the degree to which a business involves interstate transportation.see morris,at.at.in this case,the actual number of trips that indisputably crossed state lines is relatively small,but the percentage of revenues derived from those trips,is virtually identical to that which the supreme court deemed sufficient to create mca jurisdiction in morris we find this equivalency adequate to justify the same conclusion with respect to aclm.we therefore find that aclm has met the first prong of the exemption test.
secretary mca jurisdiction over appellants activities 
having found that the secretary of transportation has jurisdiction over aclm,we turn to the question of whether the secretary jurisdiction also encompasses appellants activities.as previously noted,this would be the case only if they were engag ing in activities of a character directly affecting the safety of operation of motor vehicles in the transportation on the public highways of passengers or property in interstate or foreign commerce within the meaning of the motor carrier act.a.the parties do not dispute that appellants engaged in activities of a character that directly affected the safety of operation of motor vehicles.we thus need to determine whether these activities constituted interstate commerce as that term is understood in the mca.
the dol regulations indicate that the definitions of the mca itself determine what constitutes transportation in interstate or foreign commerce sufficient to bring an employee within the secretary of transportation purview.see a.the mca and flsa do not have identical conceptions of what constitutes interstate commerce.see id.however,to make enforcement easier,the regulations assume that a movement that would constitute interstate commerce under the flsa would likewise constitute interstate commerce under the mca,except in those situations where the interstate commerce commission has held or the secretary of transportation or the courts hold otherwise.id.b.accordingly,if it has been authoritatively held that transportation of a particular character within a single state is not in interstate commerce under the mca,there would be no motor carrier exemption even if the facts established a practical continuity of movement from sources,which would constitute interstate commerce under the flsa.id.
courts are guided by practical considerations in determining whether an employee activities would be part of interstate commerce for purposes of the flsa.marshall victoria transp,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.when persons or goods move from a point of origin in one state to a point of destination in another,the fact that a part of that journey consists of transportation by an independent agency solely within the boundaries of one state does not make that portion of the trip any less interstate in character.united states yellow cab,overruled on other grounds by copperweld independence tube,d.as a result,purely intrastate transportation can constitute part of interstate commerce if it is part of a continuous stream of interstate travel.chao first class coach.for this to be the case,there must be a practical continuity of movement between the intrastate segment and the overall interstate flow.walling jacksonville paper.see also bilyou dutchess beer,cir applying this standard in analyzing applicability of motor carrier exemption.
in marshall,we addressed a city bus service in brownsville,texas,which often transported people who had walked across the mexican border before boarding the bus.see marshall,at.we characterized the transportation of people making international journeys as a regular,recurring and substantial part of the bus drivers overall workload.id.at.because the drivers work thereby was entwined with a continuous stream of international travel,we concluded that the drivers were engaged in interstate commerce,even though their routes were solely intrastate id.the supreme court reached a similar conclusion in united states capital transit.that case involved a bus service that drove routes within the district of columbia that took commuters to locations where they then could board buses bound for virginia.see id.at.at.the court found that the interstate commerce commission icc had regulatory authority under the mca over those bus routes because they were part of a continuous stream of interstate transportation and thus formed an integral part of an interstate movement.id.at.at.
these cases indicate that aclm routes would come under the secretary mca jurisdiction.its shuttle trips share a practical continuity of movement with the interstate or international travel of the cruise lines and their passengers,just as the brownsville bus routes did for their riders journeys.for cruise ship passengers arriving at the airport or seaport,aclm shuttle rides would be part of the continuous stream of interstate travel that is their cruise vacation.the royal caribbean patrons in particular would have no reason to have any alternate view since the fee for the shuttle ride would either be bundled as part of their cruise vacation package or would be included on the bill for their royal caribbean shipboard account.
possible limitations on secretary mca jurisdiction 
appellants make three arguments as to why we should find aclm not to have met the second prong,which we address in turn.first,they maintain that we should not read the motor carrier exemption as applying to interstate commerce when that term does not appear in the relevant statute.second,they assert that the secretary is divested of jurisdiction over aclm routes by the exemption,a a.third,they contend that those routes could constitute interstate commerce only if there was a arrangement between aclm and an air carrier.
statutory text 
appellants assert that the applicability of the motor carrier exemption should be governed by the plain text of the statutes.they maintain that this language specifically limits the secretary mca transportation solely to transportation that actually crosses state lines.see.according to appellants,this is the only permissible interpretation of the secretary jurisdiction,particularly in light of our dictate to narrowly construe flsa exemptions,and that the routes would not qualify as interstate under this rationale.
we decline to adopt such a restrictive reading.courts consistently have interpreted the scope of mca exemptions using the interstate commerce understanding.see,bilyou,at foxworthy hiland dairy,cir.in fact,the only authority appellants can cite for their reading,apart from the statutory text itself,is a concurring opinion in a third circuit case,which no court since has followed.see packard,at nygaard,concurring in judgment.moreover,that rationale is at odds with our past cases finding mca exemptions to apply to workers whose activities involved exclusively intrastate transportation or handling of goods that were bound for destinations.see baez,at finding armored car drivers who made intrastate deliveries of checks which ended up outside the state to be subject to motor carrier exemption galbreath gulf oil,cir finding that motor carrier exemption applied to drivers who performed solely intrastate transportation of petroleum products that originated.additionally,the dol own regulations appear to support applying the exemption to situations in which the activity at issue does not involve interstate transit see b noting that it will ordinarily be assumed that the interstate commerce requirements of the section b exemption are satisfied when the employee intrastate transportation is part of an interstate movement of the goods or persons being thus transported so as to constitute interstate commerce within the meaning of the fair labor standards act.
appellants also contend that,even if the routes would be considered part of interstate commerce,congress divested the secretary of transportation of jurisdiction over those routes by enacting the exemption,a a.that provision states that n either the secretary nor the board has jurisdiction under this part over transportation of passengers by motor vehicle incidental to transportation by aircraft.a a.dot regulations provide that such transport would be incidental if it is limited to those passengers who have had or will have an immediately prior or immediately subsequent movement by air and if it occurs entirely within a radius of the airport.a.
appellants argue that this exemption divests the secretary of jurisdiction under over aclm,because that statute is the only provision under that subpart of title to address jurisdictional issues.since the applicability of the motor carrier exemption depends on whether the secretary has power over a motor carrier under,this reading would mean that the exemption would make the motor carrier exemption inapplicable to aclm.see a.the parties do not dispute that aclm drives would fall under the terms of the exemption because the drives all are immediately prior or subsequent to air travel and occur within a radius of the airport.the only issue we must decide is whether the exemption would bar the secretary from exercising jurisdiction over aclm with respect to flsa issues,which would thereby make the motor carrier exemption inapplicable to the company.
as the district court noted,appellants argument appears to be at odds with the plain language of the statute.though a references to determine the scope of the secretary authority under the mca,it does so only to indicate to what transportation the mca applies.see id.there is no indication that this provision is meant to incorporate anything other than the descriptions of transportation contained in.any exemptions to would therefore seem to be irrelevant.this reading is supported by the fact that a also cites,which contains a specific from the secretary jurisdiction for transportation between alaska and other states that occurs in a foreign country,but does not reference any other possible jurisdictional exceptions to.see id,a.
an examination of the background of the exemption further indicates that it was not intended to limit the secretary jurisdiction over overtime issues.the difficulty in analyzing the scope of the exemption derives from the wording of the current version of the mca,the parts of which have been amended and separated over the years.the original version of the act specifically stated that the exemption did not apply to regulations under section of the mca that discussed such topics as maximum hours see id.b ed.see also bingham airport limousine,noting that the exemption did not limit the secretary authority under the mca to impose hours and safety regulations.however,congress later revised the statute and removed the references to section and wage and hour issues.the current version now discusses eliminating the secretary jurisdiction under this part.id.a a.
no court appears to have addressed the scope of this specific exemption,but a number have examined similarly worded mca exemptions.in bilyou,for example,the second circuit examined the legislative history of,which divested the secretary of jurisdiction under this part over transportation unrelated to a primary business.see bilyou,at.based on the court examination,it found that the provision addressed solely economic matters and therefore did not limit the secretary jurisdiction over issues relating to safety and hours.see bilyou,at.the court also commented that is in a different part of the mca from the exemption at issue and that the jurisdictional limitation imposed by that exemption would not impact the secretary authority under see id.
appellants cite one case,mielke laidlaw transit,d,reaching a contrary holding,that such an exemption would eliminate the secretary mca jurisdiction over all matters relating to a particular motor carrier,including with respect to the regulation of hours and safety see mielke,d at.that court focused principally on the statutory text and found that the reference to this part had to be read as referring to the totality of the secretary regulatory power.see id.however,no other court appears to have adopted this rationale,and the few that have addressed this issue since bilyou and mielke have followed the interpretation of the former.see,king asset appraisal,d.
we likewise find bilyou statutory analysis more persuasive than mielke.though the current version of the exemption does not contain specific references to hours and safety regulation,the elimination of that language likely reflects the fact that the separation of the various sections of the mca rendered the reference to section meaningless.there is no indication in the legislative history that congress intended to alter its original view regarding the effect of the exemption.see.at,cong,not
