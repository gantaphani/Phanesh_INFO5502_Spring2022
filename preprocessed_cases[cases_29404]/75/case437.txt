package delivery service dhl express and its german parent company,deutsche post ag,publicly announced on november,that they would stop offering domestic shipping on january.this announcement effectively sounded the death knell for five of dhl six chicagoland facilities,which handled domestic parcels almost exclusively and had been shedding jobs since august.the union that represented the drivers and clerical workers at those facilities,the international brotherhood of teamsters local,immediately began talks with dhl to negotiate severance agreements for its members.the collective bargaining agreements that covered the workers did not provide for severance benefits.the negotiations were successful and on december,yielded a severance agreement for each bargaining unit,the drivers and the office workers.the agreements became operative on december,when dhl representative signed them.whether dhl violated the worker adjustment and retraining notification warn act,in reaching and implementing these agreements is the principal question before us in this appeal.
the agreements contained a number of different severance benefits packages.the first was available to up to of dhl drivers.drivers who opted and qualified on seniority grounds for this package would receive ten weeks of pay and benefits.drivers had little time to decide whether to participate in this plan they were simultaneously required to complete a job rebid form on which they had to indicate by the close of business on december,not only their future shift preferences but also whether they had signed up for the plan.the other severance packages local negotiated provided four rather than ten weeks of pay and benefits but were otherwise substantially similar to the plan.there were no limits placed upon the number of workers who could enroll in the plans,though one of the packages for each bargaining unit was aimed exclusively at individuals who had already been laid off these packages provided no benefits,and the others were aimed at workers who remained on staff.drivers and office workers were given until december,to decide whether they wanted to participate in the plans.employed office workers appear to have been given until january,to make their decisions.
workers who accepted any of the local severance packages signed the following general waiver and release

a total of workers some of them were members of automobile mechanics union local,which negotiated its own similar plan signed a release and resigned their employment in exchange for either four or ten weeks of severance pay and benefits.three hundred nineteen drivers took the plan,while workers participated in one of the three plans.
workers who did not participate in one of the severance plans did not receive any severance pay from dhl.those individuals instead retained their seniority status and recall rights,as well as the right to bring legal claims against dhl and its parent,deutsche post.john ellis and timothy price,the named plaintiffs in this putative class action,were dhl drivers and local members who did not participate in the plans.ellis,who was laid off days before the discontinuation of domestic shipping was announced,and price,who was laid off on january,instead filed suit,alleging that dhl and its parent deutsche post failed to comply with the warn act,which requires certain businesses contemplating plant closings or mass layoffs to inform workers of these impending events at least sixty days in advance.ellis and price sought back pay and benefits.see.they also sought to represent a class of former dhl employees who had been represented by local,but the district court terminated as moot their motion to certify a class after granting in full dhl motion for summary judgment.see muro target,cir.
the district court provided three interrelated bases for its grant of summary judgment,all of which led it to the conclusion that the warn act was not applicable here.first,the district court concluded that the dhl layoffs could not constitute a plant closing as defined in a because the five chicagoland facilities could not together be considered a single site of employment,and price and ellis failed to put forth allegations sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a plant closing occurred at any of the individual facilities.second,the district court concluded that the layoffs could not constitute a mass layoff as defined in a because the employment losses at the five facilities considered collectively for the sake of argument did not reach the requisite critical mass of of the workforce during the relevant statutory time period.finally,the district court determined that ellis and price failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the voluntariness of the severance agreements,fatally undermining their contention that the workers who left dhl pursuant to those agreements should be counted as involuntarily separated for warn act purposes.see a.the district court recognized that the dhl workers had to make a tough choice in the face of daunting economic circumstances,but concluded that there was no evidence that they signed the severance agreements involuntarily.because it found that the bases for its grant of summary judgment in favor of dhl applied equally to deutsche post,against whom ellis and price levied identical claims,the district court sua sponte granted summary judgment in favor of deutsche post as well and terminated the case.ellis and price appeal the grants of summary judgment.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.spivey adaptive mktg.llc,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
