this case concerns the preemptive scope of the interstate commerce commission termination act of iccta.kansas city southern railway company railroad,the defendant below,argued to the district court that the iccta preempts the state tort claims brought by the plaintiffs,who own land adjacent to the railroad track in sequoyah county,oklahoma.the district court accepted this argument and granted summary judgment in the railroad favor.after reviewing the record,however,we conclude that the iccta does not expressly preempt the plaintiffs tort claims.we also conclude that there were insufficient facts in the record for the district court to determine whether the iccta impliedly preempts the plaintiffs claims.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court 
the plaintiff landowners in this case are the revocable trust of charley davis and the revocable trust of annie davis landowners.their property abuts a floodplain drainage ditch that is adjacent to a portion of the railroad track.the ditch itself contains a culvert system.the landowners allege that when the railroad replaced old,deteriorated wooden railroad ties,it regularly discarded the used rails in the drainage ditch.they also allege that the railroad failed to cut the vegetation in the drainage ditch on a regular basis,and that when it cut the vegetation,it disposed of the debris in the.the landowners claim that the improperly discarded railroad ties and vegetation debris impeded the flow of water through the drainage ditch and culvert system adjacent to their properties.this,in turn,allegedly resulted in a gradual of sediment in the drainage ditch and in the flooding of the landowners property on a number of occasions.these incidents led the landowners to sue the railroad in oklahoma state court,alleging state torts of trespass,unjust enrichment,public and private nuisance,negligence,and negligence per se.they sought actual and punitive damages,abatement,remediation,and other relief.

express preemption 
the iccta states that e xcept as otherwise provided in this part,the remedies provided under this part with respect to regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under federal or state law.b.because the iccta contains an express clause,our task of statutory construction must in the first instance focus on the plain wording of the clause,which necessarily contains the best evidence of congress intent.sprietsma,at.quoting csx,easterwood,d.the act defines transportation as 
a a locomotive,car,vehicle,vessel,warehouse,wharf,pier,dock,yard,property,facility,instrumentality,or equipment of any kind related to the movement of passengers or property,or both,by rail,regardless of ownership or an agreement concerning use and 
b services related to that movement,including receipt,delivery,elevation,transfer in transit,refrigeration,icing,ventilation,storage,handling,and interchange of passengers and property.
while certainly expansive,this definition of transportation does not encompass everything touching on railroads.subsection a focuses on physical instrumentalities related to the movement of passengers or property,and subsection b on services related to that movement.we do not think that the plain language of this statute can be read to include the conduct that the landowners complain of old railroad ties into a wastewater drainage ditch adjacent to the tracks and otherwise failing to maintain that ditch.these acts or failures to act are not instrumentalities of any kind related to the movement of passengers or property or services related to that movement.id.rather,they are possibly tortious acts committed by a landowner who happens to be a railroad company.because these acts or omissions are not transportation under,the iccta does not expressly preempt the generally applicable state common law governing the railroad disposal of waste and maintenance of the ditch.
this reading is consistent with other interpretations of the iccta preemptive scope.we look,for instance,to rulings by the surface transportation board,the agency congress created in the iccta,id,and to which congress gave extensive authority in this area,city of lincoln surface transp,cir.the stb has exclusive jurisdiction over 
transportation by rail carriers,and the remedies provided in this part with respect to rates,classifications,rules including car service,interchange,and other operating rules,practices,routes,services,and facilities of such carriers and 
the construction,acquisition,operation,abandonment,or discontinuance of spur,industrial,team,switching,or side tracks,or facilities,even if the tracks are located,or intended to be located,entirely in one state.
b.as the agency authorized by congress to administer the iccta,the transportation board is uniquely qualified to determine whether state law should be preempted by the iccta.green mountain vermont,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also ventures,sur
