this case requires us to determine the boundary between state statutes that regulate employee drug testing,such as oklahoma standards for workplace drug and alcohol testing act odta,and federal statutes that mandate drug testing of certain employees.oklahoma drug testing statute exempts from its procedural standards d rug or alcohol testing required by and conducted pursuant to federal law.stat.tit,c.we must determine whether the drug test conducted on clyde williams,a feeder driver for united parcel services,falls within the scope of this exemption,thereby extinguishing his state law claim for violations of the drug testing procedure under oklahoma law.we conclude that it does.
i.the legal framework of drug testing 
the development of fast and inexpensive urinalysis tests to detect drug use prompted the spread of employee drug testing throughout the nation in the early.employee drug use was estimated to result in productivity losses by businesses of around billion per year.harwood,et,economic costs to society of alcohol and drug abuse and mental illness research triangle institute,june in,president reagan issued executive order,the drug free workplace program,requiring periodic as well as and drug testing of federal employees in certain sensitive positions.exec.order.department of transportation dot regulations issued in and those issued under the authority of the omnibus transportation employee testing act of,require drug and alcohol testing of employees in positions in the aviation,trucking,pipeline,and other transportation industries.et id.et id.et id.et seq department of transportation drug testing regulations for the motor carrier industry,procedures for transportation workplace drug testing programs.et.these federally mandated drug tests are subject to procedural requirements intended to protect individual privacy,ensure accountability and integrity of specimens,require confirmation of all positive screening tests,mandate the use of laboratories operating within certain guidelines,provide confidentiality for test results and medical histories,and ensure nondiscriminatory testing methods.fhwa controlled substances testing,policy statement.the procedural regulations are enforced by administrative remedies in the form of civil and criminal penalties.there is no private cause of action available to aggrieved employees for a violation of the procedural protections.see schmeling nordam,cir.
many private companies also implemented drug testing of employees,even though not required to do so by federal law.by,half of the fortune firms had adopted some type of employee drug testing policy.royer cook,et.al,drug assessment methods in the workplace,in drug testing technology,tom mieczkowski.through such policies,employers sought to combat workplace problems connected with drug use,including absenteeism,theft,accidents,diminished productivity,liability,and increased health care costs.however,outside of federally regulated industries in which drug testing is mandated by law,drug testing by private employers is not subject to the procedural protections imposed on drug testing in the federal sector.the lack of procedural standards prompted concerns about employee privacy,procedural errors resulting in false positives,and confidentiality in the reporting of positive results.to address these concerns,many states adopted statutes that impose procedural regulations on employee drug tests conducted by private employers.to date,states have adopted such measures 
oklahoma enacted its standards for workplace drug and alcohol testing act in.although the procedural requirements imposed by the odta are similar in most respects to those already in place under dot regulations,there are some substantial practical differences.the odta requires the laboratories that process drug tests to be licensed by the oklahoma state department of health.stat.tit,and requires that samples be collected and tested by individuals deemed qualified by the oklahoma state board of health.id.employers who require drug testing must offer an employee assistance program to provide referral services for substance abuse counseling,treatment,or rehabilitation.id.no such program is required by the dot regulations.under the odta,employers must pay for both primary and confirmation testing,id,while the dot regulations do not specify who must pay for testing,except that direct employee payment can not be a condition for receiving a test.most significantly,unlike federal law,the odta provides a private cause of action to aggrieved employees for willful violations of the act.stat.tit.
the question posed in this case is whether an employee aggrieved by his employer drug test may sue under state law for violations of these procedural protections.
ii.facts and procedural history 
in the wee hours of february,appellant clyde williams,a driver for appellee united parcel services,ups,swerved onto the shoulder of the highway on his route from lawton,oklahoma to oklahoma city.the soft shoulder caused the two trailers being pulled by his truck to overturn.williams was not issued a citation by the oklahoma highway patrol,but ups supervisors required him to submit to a urinalysis drug test based on reasonable cause to believe that he had used drugs in violation of the ups employee policy.according to a drug testing form filled out approximately two and a half hours after the accident,the basis for the supervisors suspicion was williams redness of eyes.williams submitted a specimen for drug testing later that morning.after both his initial and tests returned positive,ups terminated him.
williams brought suit under the odta in the district court for comanche county,oklahoma,claiming that ups had violated procedural requirements under the act.he sought reinstatement,back pay,and lost benefit are available remedies under state law,though not available under federal law.ups removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of oklahoma based on diversity jurisdiction.ups then filed a motion to dismiss,or in the alternative a motion for summary judgment,citing.stat.tit,c,which explicitly exempts drug tests required by and conducted pursuant to federal law from the provisions of the odta.ups contended that the drug test conducted on williams was required by and complied with the dot regulations governing drug testing of commercial truck drivers,promulgated under authority of the federal omnibus transportation employee testing act of.the district court initially denied ups motion,but upon the submission of additional evidence by ups showing compliance with the applicable dot regulations,held that williams drug test fell within the statutory exemption provided by c.williams appeals the grant of summary judgment for ups.
we affirm,although we do not decide whether williams test complied with dot regulations.rather,we hold that c categorically exempts those drug tests that are mandated by federal law and subject to procedural regulations imposed by the dot,whether or not the employer fully complied with those regulations.
iii.analysis 
the boundary between conflicting state and federal law is ordinarily resolved by reference to federal preemption principles,which derive from the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,art.vi.the dot regulations contain an express preemption provision this part preempts any state or local law to the extent that compliance with both the state or local requirement in this part is not possible or compliance with the state or local requirement is an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of any requirement in this part.because f ederal regulations have no less preemptive effect than federal statutes,fid.fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d,we would ordinarily look to this regulation as the measure of preemption.here,however,the state law contains what might be called a provision,which carves out a sphere of exclusive federal authority from its scope of application,and thus reduces or eliminates conflict with federal law.section c of the odta states that d rug or alcohol testing required by and conducted pursuant to federal law or regulation shall be
