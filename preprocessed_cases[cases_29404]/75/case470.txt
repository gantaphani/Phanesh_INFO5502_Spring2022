wisconsin central,wcl,an interstate railroad company,brought a suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief in federal court after the illinois department of labor the idol began investigating claims that wcl had violated overtime regulations under the illinois minimum wage law.comp.stat.the basis for wcl suit was that the state overtime provisions were preempted by federal law.this preemption argument was based on two separate grounds that enforcing the illinois law would require interpreting provisions in wcl collective bargaining agreements cbas and was thus preempted by the federal railway labor act rla,which required that all cba disputes be resolved in arbitration and that congress regulation of the railways was so vast that field preemption applied.on for summary judgment,the district court found for wcl on the first preemption claim,and thus did not address the field preemption issue.for the following reasons,we find that the issue of preemption under the rla was not ripe for consideration,but that congress has so occupied the field of railway regulation that illinois overtime law is preempted as applied to the railways.
background 
wcl is a railroad that operates in wisconsin,minnesota,michigan,and illinois.in,the idol received complaints from five wcl signal maintainers claiming they had been denied overtime wages owed under illinois law.see.comp.stat.as signal maintainers,these employees fell within one of the four categories of wcl employees which includes communications and signal employees,conductors,locomotive engineers,and employees that work in illinois and have entered into cbas with the railway concerning the terms and conditions of employment.
defendant nancy mcdonald,an idol compliance officer,was assigned to investigate these claims.mcdonald sought to verify and corroborate the claimants allegations.after speaking with some of the claimants,mcdonald sent a letter to wcl illinois office on august,requesting the company payroll records from september to the present for all signal maintainers.on september,wcl replied by letter,explaining its position that,because the signal maintainers were employed pursuant to a cba entered into under the rla,et,that act preempted the state overtime law.wcl received a response to this letter on january,in which mcdonald explained that she was proceeding with her investigation since there was currently no chief counsel at the idol able to review wcl preemption claim.mcdonald also stated that if wcl did not voluntarily comply with her records request,she would subpoena the railway to compel the payroll records production.see.comp.stat.c.moreover,mcdonald noted that the idol would bring enforcement proceedings against wcl under.comp.stat.if,after her investigation,it was determined that the illinois minimum wage law overtime provisions had been violated.
this prompted wcl to file,on february,a suit in federal court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.the suit,brought against mcdonald and catherine shannon,the director and now director of the idol,in their official capacities,claimed that enforcement of the state overtime law against wcl was preempted by federal law.five days later,on february,the idol issued a subpoena to wcl,seeking the time and payroll records not only for the signal maintainers,but for every wcl employee at the company from september,to february.the idol subsequently agreed to extend the deadline for responding to the subpoena until after the resolution of wcl lawsuit.
on march,wcl amended its complaint to its present version.count sought declaratory relief,claiming that based on congress vast regulation of the railway industry,field preemption applied,thus barring the illinois minimum wage law applicability to wcl.count sought to enjoin the idol from enforcing the illinois minimum wage law against wcl on the same grounds.counts and sought the same relief as counts and,but on the basis that the rla preempted illinois overtime law from being enforced with respect to those workers employed pursuant to a cba.
the idol filed a motion to dismiss wcl complaint on april.the district court converted the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment,which wcl responded to with a for summary judgment.on september,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order,granting summary judgment for wcl and denying it for the idol.the district court found for wcl on the basis of the rla preemptive force,reasoning that determining whether wcl had violated illinois overtime provisions would require interpreting the applicable cbas,something which the rla mandates occur through an arbitration process outside the state or federal courts.see hawaiian airlines norris,d.having found for wcl on this ground,the district court did not need to determine whether field preemption also precluded the idol from enforcing the illinois minimum wage law against the railway.the idol then brought this appeal,with wcl,in its response brief,contending that this court,if reversing the district court,could still find for the railway on the basis of field preemption.
ii.discussion 
this appeal raises two preemption issues whether the idol investigation and enforcement of illinois overtime law is preempted by the rla and whether field preemption precludes the state overtime provision applicability to the railway,on the basis of congress comprehensive regulation of the rail industry.because this appeal comes to this court from for summary judgment,we review the district court findings de novo,aux sable liquid prods.murphy,cir.as with any summary judgment motion,this court reviews these construing all facts,and drawing all reasonable inferences from those facts,in favor of the party.automobile mechanics local welfare pension funds vanguard car rental usa,cir quoting hall bodine,cir.here,however,because there are no genuine issue of material fact,we need decide only whether either party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c.
preemption under the railway labor act 
the idol appeal focuses upon the district court finding that,because the overtime claims being investigated by the i dol involve interpretation and application of various provisions of the cbas,the claims are preempted by the railway labor act.cent.shannon,d.the supreme court addressed the rla preemptive scope most recently in hawaiian airlines norris,d where the court explained the act in the following manner 
congress purpose in passing the rla was to promote stability in relations by providing a comprehensive framework for resolving labor disputes.to realize this goal,the rla establishes a mandatory arbitral mechanism for the prompt and orderly settlement of two classes of disputes.the first class,those concerning rates of pay,rules or working conditions,are deemed major disputes the second class of disputes,known as minor disputes,grow out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements covering rates of pay,rules,or working conditions.minor disputes involve controversies over the meaning of an existing collective bargaining agreement in a particular fact situation.thus,major disputes seek to create contractual rights,minor disputes to enforce them.
at.internal citations omitted.accordingly,because the rla requires that all minor disputes be resolved through a mandatory arbitral mechanism,if the alleged overtime violations under illinois law are in essence a minor dispute involving the cbas,then the idol state overtime claims are preempted.id.at.despite this mandatory arbitration process,however,the court made clear in hawaiian airlines that substantive protections provided by state law,independent of whatever labor agreement might govern,are not under the rla.id.at.instead,the court reaffirmed its prior decision in lingle norge div.of magic chef,d,reiterating that where the resolution of a claim depends on an interpretation of the cba,the claim is preempted,but explaining that certain claims may involve purely factual questions that do not require a court to interpret any term of a agreement,and thus are not preempted.id.at.quoting lingle,at.
in keeping with hawaiian airlines,this court has affirmed,on a number of occasions,that preemption or preclusion if a federal claim is brought under the rla exists when the success of the claim is dependent upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement terms.miller am.airlines,cir citing brown.cent,cir t he best way to harmonize these two statutes the rla and the ada is to allow a plaintiff employee to bring an ada claim in federal court against his employer even if his employment is governed by a collective bargaining agreement which is subject to the rla,unless the resolution of his ada claim requires the court to interpret the collective bargaining agreement terms as a potentially dispositive matter.and tice am.airlines,cir providing that dismissal is appropriate where a particular interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is potentially dispositive of a the plaintiff claim see also in re bentz metal prods,cir holding,with respect to the parallel preemption provision in of the labor management relations act lmra,a,that a state law claim is not preempted if it does not require interpretation of the cba even if it may require reference to the cba.accordingly,this court has identified many scenarios where cbas may be implicated as part of a state or federal cause of action,but of the claim is unnecessary.such examples include when the particular contractual provision is so clear as to preclude all possible dispute over its meaning,baker kingsley,cir quoting metalcrafters mcneil,cir if the parties d o not dispute the interpretation of the relevant cba provisions,brown,at or where reference to the cba is only necessary for computing damages.see in re bentz metal prods,at discussing livadas bradshaw,d.
the district court,in its analysis,focused upon whether resolving an overtime claim brought by the idol against wcl would require the application or interpretation of the cbas.wisconsin central,d at.the court found that such interpretation would be necessary,observing that computing overtime under illinois law requires ascertaining the number of hours worked and the regular rate of pay figures that could only be calculated by turning to the cbas,and were not so clear under those agreements that they could be determined through a mere glance without interpretation 
the main thrust of the idol appeal is that the district court failed to take the extra step of determining whether,at this stage of the proceedings,it was evident that an interpretation of wcl cbas would be dispositive of liability in an overtime claim brought under illinois law.referencing the examples given above where this court has noted that would be unnecessary,the idol argues that,particularly since as of right now,at the investigation stage,there is no dispute between the parties as to the cbas terms as applied to the illinois minimum wage law,the district court judgment was premature and overbroad.this argument is strikingly similar to a claim that this suit is not ripe for review,but the idol specifically argued in its brief to this court that this suit is ripe for adjudication.this court,however,is obligated to consider its jurisdiction at any stage of the proceedings,wisconsin nation,cir quoting enahoro abubakar,cir,and ripeness,when it implicates the possibility of this court issuing an advisory opinion,is a question of subject matter jurisdiction under the requirement.meridian sec.ins.sadowski,cir.
ripeness is predicated on the central perception that courts should not render decisions absent a genuine need to resolve a real dispute,lehn holmes,cir quoting charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice procedure,at ed,and c ases are unripe when the parties point only to hypothetical,speculative,or illusory disputes as opposed to actual,concrete conflicts.id.quoting hinrichs whitburn,cir.the inquiry into ripeness is made more complicated when suit is brought under the declaratory judgment act,and hence seeks preemptive relief,but the ability to bring suit under that act does not vitiate the constitutional requirement that the claim address a case of actual controversy.deveraux city of chicago,cir.this court has acknowledged that the distinction between a controversy in the article iii sense and an abstract question of law is necessarily one of degree,and it would be difficult,if it would be possible,to fashion a precise test for determining in every case whether there is such a controversy.id.at quoting maryland casualty pacific coal oil.the supreme court,however,has tried to clarify this standard,recently reiterating that,b asically,the question in each case is whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.medimmune,genentech,d quoting maryland casualty,at.
in trying to ascertain whether wcl preemption suit under the rla is of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant review by this court at this time,we are guided by the supreme court decision in abbott labs,where the court stated that ripeness determinations depend on the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.metro.milwaukee ass of commerce milwaukee county,cir quoting abbott labs.gardner,d.with respect to the first requirement,whether this issue is fit for judicial review,this is not the case here,based upon the nature of wcl preemption claim under the rla.issues of express or field preemption are generally purely legal questions,where the matter can be resolved solely on the basis of the state and federal statutes at issue.see,id.at issue ripe for consideration where almost purely legal issues raised regarding whether a county ordinance was preempted by the national labor relations act,et pac.gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n,d noting,in finding a preemption claim ripe for review,that t he question of is predominantly legal.this is not the case,however,for preemption questions under the rla,or its parallel provision in of the labor management relations act.see hawaiian airlines,at.describing these standards as virtually identical.as explained by this court in in re bentz metal prods,the question of whether a state law is preempted by virtue of a cba,requires a factual analysis to determine the extent to which a state law claim will require interpretation of a cba.at discussing preemption under of the lmra.
here,the record is not sufficiently developed for this court to engage in this factual analysis.this court precedent reflects that state law is only preempted if the resolution of the claim is dependent upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement terms.miller,at.at this stage of the proceedings,all that is clear is that the cbas will have to be consulted to calculate the hours worked and regular rate of pay under the illinois minimum wage act.while this information was sufficient for the district court to determine that computing these values requires interpretation and application of various provisions contained in the cbas.cent,d at,the parties have not yet staked out a position for the record as to what these cba provisions mean,making it impossible to determine at this stage of the proceedings whether a disagreement will exist that will require an arbitrator,under the terms of the rla,to engage in this cba interpretation.
as part of its finding that illinois overtime provision was preempted,the district court incorrectly placed reliance upon language in in re bentz metal prods,which states that,i f the entitlement to wages or other employee pay or the amount due were at issue,the cba would control almost certainly,interpretation of the agreement would be necessary and would be subject to the arbitration procedures in the contract.at.what the district court did not take into account is that the reason the entitlement to wages and the amount due were not at issue in that case was because that sum was undisputed between the parties.id.at.here,the idol investigation of wcl overtime practices has not progressed to a point where it can be determined what dispute,if any,the parties will have over the cbas terms.because preemption under the rla will only occur if the parties dispute the cbas terms,and even then,arguably only if the dispute is relevant as to liability as opposed to damages,the record is not sufficiently developed for this court to engage in the factual analysis required by in re bentz metal prods.
the second requirement under abbott labs for determining ripeness the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration,abbott,at.similarly not met in this case.as a general matter,it is typically no bar to ripeness if the government has only threatened enforcement,rather than actually brought a lawsuit.see medimmune.at where threatened action by government is concerned,we do not require a plaintiff to expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis for the threat see also metalcrafters mcneil,cir.this situation is unique,however,since the preemptive sweep of the rla is focused upon providing a comprehensive framework for resolving labor disputes,hawaiian airlines,at,and does not reach substantive protections provided by state law,independent of whatever labor agreement might govern.id.at.thus,the hardship to wcl is not its need to comply with the state overtime requirements or the current investigation,but is rather the possibility that it will need to defend itself in an enforcement action ultimately preempted due to the need for an arbitrator,rather than a court,to interpret the cbas,in accord with the rla.of course,as our sister circuit has observed,if it is evident that the result of a process must lead to preemption,it would defy logic to hold that the process itself can not be preempted and that a complaint seeking that result would not raise a ripe issue.ne hub partners,cng transmission,cir.that court,however,was quick to note that 
we are not holding that any claim of process preemption necessarily is ripe so that the court should consider the preemption claim before the process is completed.it well may be that in a particular case when conflict preemption is implicated the court may conclude that it reasonably can be anticipated that the process will yield a result that is not preempted.
id.at.here,the claim that the idol investigation should be halted based upon the preemptive scope of the rla is not ripe for consideration,since this is not a circumstance where the idol investigation and subsequent enforcement of the state overtime laws would invariably lead to a finding of preemption.as discussed above,even if the idol brought suit against wcl under the illinois minimum wage act,scenarios exist where it would be unnecessary for the cbas to be interpreted in order to resolve the claim.accordingly,the district court lacked jurisdiction to rule on wcl counts concerning preemption under the rla.
field preemption 
this court may affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on a ground other than that relied upon by the district court below,so long as the alternative basis finds adequate support in the record.bombard fort wayne newspapers,cir citing meredith allsteel,cir.thus,even though the district court only ruled on whether the rla preempted the illinois minimum wage law as applied to wcl,we turn to examine wcl alternate field preemption bars the states from regulating railroad overtime wages.
ripeness does not pose an obstacle to this court hearing this claim.see abbott,at.whether an issue is ripe for review depends upon the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.unlike the factual,analysis required for determining preemption under the rla,in re bentz metal prods,at,field preemption is a purely legal question,see pac.gas,at,limited to an analysis of the illinois minimum wage law and federal statutes governing the railways.furthermore,in addition to the record being sufficiently developed for review on this issue,there is also a hardship to wcl if this court does not hear this claim at this time.the idol has threatened to enforce illinois overtime law against that would be completely barred if this court were to find field preemption to exist.moreover,even if the idol ultimately did not bring suit against wcl,its investigation alone drains wcl resources,and there would be no basis for the idol to investigate these overtime claims if field preemption is applicable.
the preemption doctrine is grounded in the constitution supremacy clause,which provides that,this constitution,and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land.hoagland town of clear lake,cir quoting,art.vi,cl.field preemption does not rest on an express congressional provision,or a conflict between federal and state law,see,but instead occurs if federal law so thoroughly occupies a legislative field as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it.cipollone liggett group,d quoting fidelity fed.sav.loan de la cuesta,d.
the long history of pervasive congressional regulation over the railway industry is undeniable,and the supreme court has observed that,r ailroads have been subject to comprehensive federal regulation for nearly a century.united transp.union long island,d.these laws have touched on nearly every aspect of the railway industry,including property rights shipping labor relations hours of work safety security retirement unemployment and preserving the railroads during financial difficulties as was by the sixth circuit in its decision addressing the very issue now before this court.corman palmore,cir.
moreover,much of this federal legislation has been found to preclude state regulation over the railways.for example,as has already been discussed,the rla goal of providing a comprehensive framework for resolving labor disputes,preempts actions that would require interpreting a cba.hawaiian airlines,at.congress has also expressly preempted state laws relating to railroad safety and security,unless the specific has not yet been regulated by a federal agency,or if such a regulation is necessary to address a uniquely local hazard.going farther back in history,the supreme court,in,held that the hours of service act,which was intended to limit the number of consecutive hours worked by railway employees out of safety concerns,see chicago united states,preempted state regulation in this area.erie new york.t he hours of service law of march,is the judgment of congress of the extent of the restriction necessary.it admits of no supplement it is the prescribed measure of what is necessary and sufficient for the public safety and of the cost and burden which the railroad must endure to secure it.
the idol acknowledges that there is a great quantity of federal railway legislation and that certain laws have a preemptive effect,but maintains that congress has not sufficiently expressed its clear and manifest intent that illinois overtime law be preempted as applied to the railroads,particularly since wages are an area traditionally left to state regulation.see english general,d where the field which congress is said to have includes areas that have been traditionally occupied by the states,congressional intent to supersede state laws must be clear and manifest.quoting jones rath packing,d see also frank.dot,cir establishment of prevailing wage rates and labor standards for indigenous workers is an area of traditional state regulation.in support of its position,the idol primarily relies upon the supreme court decision in terminal railroad association brotherhood of railroad trainmen,where the court determined that a state requirement that all trains have cabooses for the health,safety,and comfort of the rear switchmen was not preempted by the boiler inspection act,the safety appliance act,the interstate commerce act,or the rla.the idol contends that wcl field preemption argument is foreclosed by the court holding that the enactment by congress of the railway labor act was not a preemption of the field of regulating working conditions themselves and did not preclude the state of
