in this wrongful death action arising out of a collision,the plaintiffs claim that familiar,signs that read railroad crossing provided inadequate warning for the railroad crossing and that the railroad was negligent in failing to remove a gravel pile and vegetation that restricted drivers view of approaching trains.the railroad contends that federal law preempts these claims.when railroad crossing improvements are federally funded,federal regulations specify what warning devices must be used and the united states supreme court has held that section of the federal railroad safety act of expressly preempts state tort law actions challenging the adequacy of those devices the trial court concluded that federal regulations do not apply in this case,and the court of appeals affirmed we disagree and accordingly reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and render judgment that the plaintiffs take nothing.
in late,billy howard limmer and his wife patricia bought a home in thorndale,a small central texas farming community,pop,where they intended to live after limmer retired in march.they attended thorndale high school,married,and moved away to work,but often returned to visit family in the area.
the union pacific railroad runs through the middle of thorndale east and west,parallel to and just south of state highway.on average,some two dozen trains pass through thorndale every day.the tracks cross several streets,including front street,which runs south from the highway,then turns east and continues along the south side of the tracks.the following schematic illustrates the site 
at the front street crossing near the highway,there are two sets of standard gauge tracks,wide about apart.the tracks farthest from the highway are the main line,on which trains can travel up to mph.the tracks nearer the highway are for a siding the crossing is very rough and bumpy,and vehicles must take it very slowly.a crossbuck stands three or four the highway,before the siding.a second crossbuck is located on the other side of the main line,facing traffic coming from the opposite direction.there are no other warning devices.trains sound their horns to signal their approach.in april,a pile of gravel as big as a high and alongside the siding about west of the crossing.the gravel pile restricted a driver view westward,as did vegetation growing in the railroad,but a driver could still see more than down the tracks to the west.
just after on april,limmer drove his pickup south on a town street to highway,turned left going east,then turned right a block or two later off the highway onto front street.eyewitnesses heard the horn of an eastbound train approaching at mph and watched as limmer drove very slowly down front street,across the siding,and into its path.limmer was killed instantly.
patricia limmer and her two daughters sued the union pacific.we refer to the parties as the limmers and the railroad.as an affirmative defense,the railroad asserted that the limmers claims were expressly by the federal railroad safety act of frsa congress enacted frsa to promote safety in all areas of railroad operations and to reduce accidents and injuries to persons frsa calls for l aws,regulations,and orders related to railroad safety to be nationally uniform to the extent practicable.to that end,frsa authorizes the secretary of transportation to prescribe regulations and issue orders for every area of railroad safety and provides in section that a state may adopt or continue in force a law,regulation,or order related to railroad safety until the secretary of transportation prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the subject matter of the state requirement in two cases,csx transportation,and norfolk southern railway shanklin the united states supreme court has held that under section,federal regulations covering the subject matter of a railroad safety requirement of state law preempt state law,including common law tort liability the accident in shanklin was very similar to the one in this case the deceased drove his truck into the path of an oncoming train at a crossing marked only by crossbucks 
the highway safety act of hsa grants federal funding to states to eliminat e hazards of crossings in return,hsa requires each state to conduct and systematically maintain a survey of all highways and identify those railroad crossings which may require separation,relocation,or protective devices,and establish and implement a schedule of projects for this purpose.under the authority of both frsa and hsa,the secretary of transportation,through the federal highway administration fhwa has promulgated numerous regulations,including several addressing the installation of warning devices at railroad crossings.
the regulations at b govern the design of grade crossing improvements for federally funded projects.we will refer to them as the grade crossing design regulations.subsection b requires adequate warning devices that include automatic gates with flashing light signals if any of six enumerated conditions is present where none is present,subsection b states that the type of warning device to be installed,whether the determination is made by a state regulatory agency,state highway agency,the railroad,is subject to the approval of the fhwa.according to the supreme court,when subsections b and b apply,the secretary has determined the devices to be installed and the means by which railroads are to participate in their selection.these regulations therefore cover the subject matter of state law which,like the tort law,seeks to impose an independent duty on a railroad to identify repair dangerous crossings and thus preempt common law tort liability for a claim that a warning device installed at a railroad crossing was inadequate 
the limmers do not contend that any of the six conditions described in subsection b was present at the front street crossing.thus,subsection b applies to any warning device installed there using federal funds the railroad offered evidence of two federally funded programs to improve railroad crossings in texas.the purpose of the first,implemented between and,was to install or upgrade crossbucks at certain crossings using metal,reflectorized signs.the railroad participated in the program,but it had more than crossings in texas at the time,and the limmers contend that the evidence falls short of establishing that the crossbucks at the front street crossing were installed as part of the program.the second program,authorized by the legislature in involved attaching retroreflective tape to the pole and back of the blades of every crossbuck in texas.retroreflective material reflects light back in the direction of its source.thus,when a vehicle lights shine on an object marked with retroreflective material,the light is reflected back toward the vehicle,causing the object to appear brighter to the driver.the limmers do not dispute that federal funds helped pay for the tape on the crossbucks at the front street crossing but they contend that the improvement did not amount to the installation of a warning device within the meaning of the federal regulations.
the jury found limmer and the railroad both negligent in causing the collision and apportioned responsibility to limmer and to the railroad.the jury found the railroad negligent in two respects in failing to provide additional warning signals,a flag man,or a stop an crossing and in answer to a separate question,in failing to eliminate the sight restriction caused by the gravel pile or vegetation.the jury awarded compensatory damages totaling million.the preemption defense was tried,without objection,to the bench,and the evidence was offered outside the presence of the jury.the trial court rejected the defense without making any findings of fact and rendered judgment on the verdict.
on appeal,the railroad argued that it had established its preemption defense,and that a failure to eliminate sight restrictions at the crossing was not an independent basis for liability the railroad acknowledges that it had the burden to prove preemption,that the trial court presumably resolved all factual disputes against preemption and that it must therefore demonstrate that preemption has been established as a matter of law at first,the court of appeals reversed and rendered judgment for the railroad,holding that preemption had been established,but on rehearing,it reversed and remanded for a new trial 
whether the crossbucks at the front street crossing were installed using federal funds was a factual matter,and while there may have been some evidence that the installation was federally funded,the court concluded that the documentary evidence was inconclusive and that there were reasons why the trial court could have decided not to credit the testimony of the witnesses who testified in support of the railroad position thus,the court held,the railroad had not established that basis for preemption as a matter of law.whether the federally funded application of the retroreflective tape to the crossbucks constituted the installation of a warning device under federal law was a legal issue,and the court held it did not 
finally,the court held that a railroad negligent failure to eliminate sight restrictions at a crossing is not an independent basis for liability for causing a collision but is merely a consideration in determining whether the railroad was negligent in warning of the crossing thus,the trial court erred in submitting a separate jury question regarding sight restrictions finding itself in doubt whether the erroneously submitted question improperly influenced the jury,the court concluded that a new trial was required 
the limmers and the railroad petitioned for review.we granted both petitions 
the project,one of the two projects on which the railroad rests its preemption defense,was developed by fhwa and authorized in texas by statute requiring what was then the state department of highways and public transportation to develop guidelines and specifications for the installation and maintenance of retroreflectorized material at all public grade crossings not protected by active warning devices.the statute broadly defined a warning device as an active warning device,crossbuck,or other traffic control sign,the purpose of which is to alert motorists of a grade crossing and more specifically defined an active warning device as a bell,flashing light,gate,wigwag,or other automatically activated warning device.the statute also defined retroreflectorized material as material that reflects light so that the paths of the reflected light rays are parallel to those of the incident rays.the statute provided that retroreflectorized material shall be affixed to the backs of crossbucks and their support posts in a manner that retroreflects light from vehicle headlights to focus attention to the presence of a nonsignalized crossing that is,a crossing not protected by active warning devices one fhwa official described the agency research with r etroreflective material installed on the backs of crossbucks and their support posts as follows 
these devices were located on the far side of the crossing from approaching traffic so as to retroreflect light from the vehicle headlights through the moving gaps in the train.the resulting flickering light attracts the driver attention to the presence of a moving train at the crossing.the devices were visible at feet in advance of the crossing through the gaps between train cars and wheels 
texas received more than million in federal funds for the project some of which were used to apply retroreflectorized tape to the poles and backs of the blades of the crossbucks at the front street crossing.the railroad contends that this was an installation of a warning device within the meaning of subsection b of the grade crossing design regulations,preempting the limmers claims that the warning signs at the crossing were inadequate.
federal regulations distinguish between active and passive warning devices at railroad crossings,referring to both as traffic control devices passive warning devices,the only kind involved in this case,are defined as those types of traffic control devices,including signs,markings and other devices,located at or in advance of grade crossings to indicate the presence of a crossing but which do not change aspect upon the approach or presence of a train.other than this brief,list of examples signs,markings,and other devices the federal regulations do not define traffic control devices.but fhwa manual on uniform traffic control devices,incorporated into its regulations defines them as all signs,signals,markings,and other devices used to regulate,warn,or guide traffic,placed on,over,or adjacent to a street,highway,pedestrian facility,or bikeway by authority of a public agency having jurisdiction.and traffic markings are defined in fhwa grade crossing handbook as a ll lines,patterns,words,colors,or other devices,except signs,set into the surface of,applied upon,or attached to the pavement or curbing or to the objects within or adjacent to the roadway,officially placed for the purpose of regulating,warning,or guiding traffic.
retroreflective tape attached to a crossbuck is certainly a marking used to warn traffic of railroad crossings.the point of the program was that the addition of retroreflective tape to crossbucks would provide traffic with an additional,different warning of railroad crossings,making them more visible to motorists.the retroreflective tape on the crossbucks in this case was placed adjacent to a street by authority of a public agency having jurisdiction.it was thus a warning device within the meaning of subsection b of the federal regulations.
the limmers argue that retroreflective tape can not be a traffic control device because it merely reflects light and does not,as their expert,heathington,put it,tell motorists to stop,to look,to observe,to turn right or to not turn right,or anything of that nature.they point out that retroreflective tape is nowhere mentioned as a traffic control device in the fhwa manual.but the manual contemplates that most signs and warning devices will be retroreflective it also mentions strips for crossbucks in several sections markings are specifically mentioned in the federal regulations as traffic control devices.more importantly,the use of retroreflective strips on crossbuck posts and is designed to reflect light back at motorists,to attract attention and provide an enhanced warning,which was the purpose of the program.
the supreme court decision in easterwood illustrates well the difference between a device that warns and one that does not.there,gates were to be installed at five adjacent crossings as part of a single project circuitry was installed at all five crossings and gates were installed at four of them,but the plan for gates at the fifth crossing was abandoned,and that is where the accident occurred the supreme court easily rejected the argument that the circuitry alone was a warning device,even though it was installed as part of a project to provide warnings at other crossings unlike the circuitry in easterwood,the retroreflective tape at the front street crossing actually provided motorists warning of the crossing.
the limmers rely on a letter that their expert,heathington,obtained from shelley rowe,director of fhwa office of transportation operations,shortly before trial.heathington had written a brief letter to rowe on june,enclosing two photographs of the front street crossing and stating,i n my opinion,the tape which is used in this fashion is not a traffic control device as defined by the manual.heathington concluded i am hoping that you being from fhwa can confirm this conclusion about the use of the tape.rowe brief letter in reply,dated august,stated merely,r etroreflective tape is not considered a traffic control device and,therefore,its use around a traffic sign post does not conflict with the standards in the manual.
the limmers do not argue that rowe letter is entitled to deference,only that it provides support for heathington opinions.in deciding what effect to give rowe letter,we are guided by the united states supreme court observations in skidmore swift in a similar context.regarding the views of the administrator of the wage and hour division of the department of l
