the consumer warranty act hereafter sometimes referred to as the act,civil code section et provides that if a manufacturer or its representative in this state fails to repair a new motor vehicle to conform to any express warranty after a reasonable number of attempts to repair,the manufacturer must replace the vehicle or pay restitution,subd.d.the question presented in this case is whether a buyer who resides in california may bring suit against a manufacturer under the act when the buyer purchased the vehicle in another state,but brought the vehicle for repair to the manufacturer authorized repair facility in california,and repeated attempts to repair the vehicle proved unsuccessful.we conclude that the act does not apply unless the vehicle was purchased in california.
during a visit to idaho,plaintiffs edward and sandi cox,who are california residents,purchased a motor home manufactured by defendant winnebago industries,and equipped with an engine made by defendant cummins,plaintiffs filed a complaint in the riverside county superior court against defendants,alleging that the motor home did not conform to express warranties and that its engine was defectively manufactured.the first cause of action was a claim for breach of express warranty and violation of the act.plaintiffs alleged that their vehicle was defective in numerous ways.the complaint alleged that the manufacturers authorized repair facilities in riverside county,california,had failed to remedy these defects after numerous attempts,and that the manufacturers violated the act by not replacing the vehicle or providing a refund.the complaint sought actual damages of plus attorney fees and a civil penalty of up to twice the amount of actual damages,the remedies provided in section,subdivision e.the complaint also alleged other claims,including a violation of the federal lemon law,the consumer warranty act.et.
defendants moved for summary adjudication of the first cause of action on the ground that plaintiffs had purchased the motor home in idaho,arguing that the act applies only to vehicles purchased in california.in opposing the motion,plaintiffs argued that the california statute applies if the manufacturer representative in is,the authorized repair after a reasonable number of attempts to repair the vehicle to conform to the express warranty.the trial court denied the motion for summary adjudication.defendants filed a petition for writ of mandate in the court of appeal.that court issued an alternative writ,but after briefing and argument denied the writ,concluding that the act applies whenever a manufacturer that sells goods in california or its representative fails to service or repair the good to conform to its express warranty,even in cases when the particular good was purchased out of state.we granted review.
the consumer warranty act was enacted to address the difficulties faced by consumers in enforcing express warranties.consumers frequently were frustrated by the inconvenience of having to return goods to the manufacturer for repairs and by repeated unsuccessful attempts to remedy the problem.see comment,toward an end to consumer the consumer warranty act work santa clara.the act protects purchasers of consumer goods by requiring specified implied warranties,placing strict limitations on how and when a manufacturer may disclaim those implied warranties,and providing mechanisms to ensure that manufacturers live up to the terms of any express warranty.see.
among other provisions,the act requires manufacturers of consumer goods sold in california to make available to buyers service and repair facilities at which goods can be repaired to conform to any express warranties provided by the manufacturer.every manufacturer of consumer goods sold in this state and for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty must m aintain in this state sufficient service and repair facilities to carry out the terms of the express warranty,subd.a a.the manufacturer may maintain its own repair facility or may designate and authorize an independent repair facility to meet its responsibilities under its express warranties,subd.a b.
in addition,the act specifies time frames within which repairs under an express warranty must be provided.service and repair at the manufacturer authorized repair facility in the state must be commenced within a reasonable time,subd.b.goods must be repaired to comply with the warranty within days,unless delay is caused by conditions beyond the control of the manufacturer or its representative.ibid.
in those instances when the goods can not be repaired to conform to an express warranty after a reasonable number of attempts,the act specifies a remedy,in what has been referred to as the provisions,subd.d see kwan of north america,th,d.for consumer goods generally,the manufacturer must either replace the goods or reimburse the buyer in an amount equal to the purchase price,less a reasonable amount for the buyer use of the goods during the period preceding detection of the nonconformity,subd.d.a buyer who is damaged by a failure to comply with any obligation under the act may bring an action for damages and other relief,subd.a.
the legislature has amended the act and adopted additional provisions that address the special problems experienced by consumers in enforcing warranties on new motor vehicles.see stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch.these provisions frequently are referred to as the lemon law.in any case involving a new motor vehicle,there is a rebuttable presumption that a reasonable number of attempts have been made to repair the vehicle if,within months or miles,whichever comes first,either the same problem has been subject to repair four or more times or,if the problem is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury,two or more times and the buyer has notified the manufacturer directly of the need for the repair,or the vehicle is out of service for more than calendar days because of repair under the warranty,subd.b.if the buyer prevails in an action involving a new motor vehicle,the buyer may recover damages and reasonable attorney fees and costs and,under some circumstances,a civil penalty of up to two times the amount of damages,subd.e.the lemon law also provides manufacturers with the option of establishing a third party dispute resolution process to address disputes over the enforcement of express warranties.a manufacturer that maintains such a process receives certain advantages,including an exemption from the civil penalty unless the manufacturer has willfully violated the law,subds.c and e.
the substance of current section,subdivision d,was added in.stats,ch.the amendment addressed continuing problems experienced by automobile buyers in enforcing the remedy.it gave the buyer of a new motor vehicle the option of selecting reimbursement rather than a replacement vehicle,and specified in detail how the amount of reimbursement is to be calculated,subd.d.
the issue presented here is whether the provisions contained in subdivision d of section apply to vehicles purchased outside of california.in arguing that they do not,defendants rely primarily on the language of subdivision a of section,which imposes the duty upon e very manufacturer of consumer goods sold in this state and for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty to provide facilities for repair of its goods reasonably close to all areas where its consumer goods are sold.italics added.plaintiffs,on the other hand,maintain that the phrase consumer goods sold in this state in section,subdivision a is a limitation only on the category of manufacturers that must provide repair facilities in this state.because section,subdivision d,which provides the remedy for new motor vehicles,does not include an express limitation to vehicles sold in the state,plaintiffs contend that the provisions of that subdivision should not be limited to vehicles purchased in california plaintiffs argue that if the legislature had intended to limit the remedy to goods sold in the state,it would have included in subdivision d an express limitation to sales,just as it did in subdivision a and other portions of the act.see,every sale of consumer goods that are sold at retail in this state is accompanied by an implied warranty of merchantability,specifying when the implied warranty of fitness applies to the sale of consumer goods that are sold at retail in this state.
in construing a statute,our task is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the enactment.olmstead arthur gallagher cal th,d.we look first to the words of the statute,which are the most reliable indications of the legislature intent.diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d.we construe the words of a statute in context,and harmonize the various parts of an enactment by considering the provision at issue in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.renee superior court cal th,d,phelps stostad cal th,d.
when considered in the context of the other portions of section,subdivision d is most reasonably interpreted as applicable only to vehicles sold in california.the language employed throughout section strongly suggests that no single subdivision can be read independently of the others.each subsequent subdivision employs language that can be fully understood only by reference to previous subdivisions.the language used thus indicates that all the subdivisions of section were intended to apply to the same universe of sold in this state.
subdivision a of section provides that manufacturers of consumer goods sold in this state and for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty must maintain or designate repair facilities in this state these facilities must be located reasonably close to all areas where its consumer goods are sold,subd.a a.subdivision b states that if those service and repair facilities are maintained in this state and service or repair of the goods is necessary because they do not conform with the applicable express warranties,the manufacturer or its representative in this state must commence repairs within a reasonable time,subd.b,italics added.the references to those facilities,the goods,and the warranties in subdivision b only can be to the facilities,goods,and warranties discussed previously in subdivision a.therefore the goods as used in subdivision b must refer to the same goods described in subdivision a that is,consumer goods sold in this state and for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty.
subdivision c of section goes on to specify that the buyer must deliver nonconforming goods to the manufacturer service and repair facility within this state,unless delivery can not reasonably be accomplished.subdivision c repeatedly uses the phrase nonconforming goods without further definition or explanation.that phrase draws its meaning from subdivision b,which refers to goods that do not conform with the applicable express warranties.thus,the phrase the nonconforming goods was meant to incorporate the same meaning of goods that is used in subdivisions a and b consumer goods that are sold in this state and for which the manufacturer has provided an express warranty,and that do not conform to that warranty.
subdivision d of section sets out the manufacturer general duty to replace goods or reimburse the buyer if the manufacturer or its representative in this state does not service or repair the goods to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts.again,it is most reasonable to interpret the references to the manufacturer,the goods,and the express warranties to signify the manufacturer,goods,and warranties as these terms have been employed in the previous subdivisions.therefore,it appears that the general duty to replace goods that can not be repaired is limited to goods that are sold in this state and for which the manufacturer has provided an express warranty,subd.a.
subdivision d of section sets out the manufacturer duty to replace a new motor vehicle or reimburse the buyer if the manufacturer or its representative in this state is unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts.subdivision d,unlike subdivision d,does not use the phrase the goods.thus,subdivision d does not directly incorporate the limitation on goods contained in subdivision a of section.instead,it refers to a new motor vehicle,a phrase employed for the first time in subdivision d.
nevertheless,we conclude that subdivision d of section,like subdivision d,was not meant to be read independently of the other subdivisions and likewise is limited to new motor vehicles sold in this state.a new motor vehicle is just one type of consumer goods.the statute treats the special provisions applicable to new motor vehicles in subdivision d as an exception to the general provision applicable to all consumer goods in subdivision d.the latter subdivision states that a manufacturer who can not repair a consumer good to comply with express warranties must replace it or make restitution,except as provided in paragraph.subdivision d provides the same remedies for new motor vehicles,except that the buyer has the option of selecting restitution instead of replacement and the statute provides additional specifications for both the refund and restitution remedies.see,subd.d a c.
although the act treats motor vehicles differently from other types of consumer goods in several ways,we find no indication that the legislature intended to treat motor vehicles differently with respect to the limitation on the act coverage to goods sold in california.as noted above,special provisions governing motor vehicles were added to the act,beginning with the adoption of the lemon law in.stats,ch.that law added new provisions to section specifying the circumstances under which a presumption would arise that a reasonable number of attempts have been made to conform a new vehicle to the express warranties,and also provided for a third party dispute resolution process to resolve disputes between buyers and manufacturers under the lemon law as originally adopted in,there was no special provision establishing a manufacturer duty to refund or replace a nonconforming motor vehicle rather,that duty was established by then subdivision d,the general duty to refund or replace nonconforming consumer goods.thus,all consumer goods,including motor vehicles,came under then subdivision d,which,under the above analysis,encompassed only goods sold in this state.
the substance of current subdivision d was adopted in.the amendments to subdivision d added special provisions that delineate the remedy to be provided if the manufacturer can not repair a new motor vehicle.subdivision d was renumbered as d,without changing its substance,and subdivision d was added.subdivision d tracks the general provision of d but contains additional specifications that apply when a new motor vehicle is involved.the buyer has the option of selecting reimbursement instead of replacement,subd.d.if replacement is selected,the replacement vehicle must be substantially identical to the one replaced,and the manufacturer is required to pay specified incidental damages,subd.d a.if restitution is selected,the amount is to be calculated as specified by the statute,subd.d b.nothing in subdivision d suggests the legislature intended to broaden the coverage of the statute to vehicles sold outside the state.
another part of the act,the notice requirement in section,also provides support for the conclusion we reach.that statute specifies the contents of a notice of rights that must be included in every work order or repair invoice for warranty repairs.the notice must state a buyer of this product in california has the right to have this product serviced or repaired during the warranty period,subd.a,italics added.the notice also must describe the rights provided to buyers under section,subdivision d.the phrase a buyer of this product in california indicates that the legislature believed those rights applied only to a buyer who purchased the product in california.the quoted language in section was adopted in,before the amendments that added subdivision d but after the original adoption of the general requirements
