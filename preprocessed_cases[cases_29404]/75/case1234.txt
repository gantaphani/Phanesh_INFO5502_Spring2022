plaintiffs sued asiana airlines,and one of its managers after plaintiffs were not allowed to board their ticketed flight,claiming this refusal was due to their age and perceived physical limitations.the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment,concluding that the warsaw convention or the airline deregulation act of preempted plaintiffs action.we hold that plaintiffs claims are not preempted,and that triable issues of material fact exist as to most,but not all,of plaintiffs causes of action.
facts and procedural history 
modesta aquino and her husband,david aquino,who is now deceased,the aquinos had tickets on a november,asiana airlines,asiana flight from san francisco international airport to the philippines.the tickets provided that asiana services were subject to conditions of carriage and related regulations which are made part hereof and are available on application at the offices of carrier asiana general conditions of carriage for international passenger and baggage included the following provision asiana may refuse to carry,cancel the reserved space of,or remove enroute any passenger when,in the exercise of its reasonable discretion,such action is necessary for reason of safety the conduct,age or mental or physical condition of the passenger is such as to require special assistance of asiana or cause discomfort or make himself objectionable to other passenger,or involve any hazard or risk to himself or to other persons or to property 
on the evening of the flight,the aquinos,together with several relatives,went to the airport the aquinos daughter,purificacion landero landero,and son,percival aquino percival,went to asiana counter with the aquinos tickets and gave them to a ticket agent,while the aquinos waited.percival asked the agent to provide a wheelchair for david aquino.the agent asked who the passengers were,and landero pointed her parents out to the agent.the agent then called an asiana manager,tae keun han han,who is a defendant in this action.han approached the aquinos,then asked landero how old the aquinos were.she told him they were years old according to landero,han told her the aquinos were too old to travel.han then told landero the aquinos would need a certificate from a doctor,certifying that they would be able to survive the flight,and suggested they visit the airport medical clinic to obtain a certificate the aquinos visited the medical clinic but although the clinic staff stated the aquinos looked healthy and did not require treatment,they did not provide a certificate.the aquinos walked back to the asiana ticket counter.on the way back,david aquino complained that his legs hurt from the walking.
when the aquinos reached the asiana ticket counter,landero told han the clinic staff had refused to provide a medical certificate but that the staff had said the aquinos looked healthy.she also told him it was difficult for her father to walk long distances according to landero,han replied,if he can not walk,why does he have to travel then he should not be traveling.landero persisted in asking han to allow her parents to board the airplane,and han told her he would call the police.he went to his office,and shortly afterward,police officers arrived.
the aquinos left the airport.the family was later informed that the aquinos could travel on another asiana flight,but that they would need a medical certificate.the aquinos decided not to fly on asiana and on december,they traveled to the philippines on a flight offered by another airline.asiana refunded the cost of their original tickets.david aquino died in the philippines on february.

ii.discussion 
standard of review 
our standard of review is well settled.in reviewing a summary judgment in favor of the defendant,we independently assess the correctness of the trial court ruling by applying the same legal standard as the trial court in determining whether any triable issues of material fact exist,and whether the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.rubin united air lines,th,d.in doing so,we construe the moving party affidavits strictly,construe the opponent affidavits liberally,and resolve doubts about the propriety of granting the motion in favor of the opposing party.ibid.
b.the warsaw convention is not applicable 
the warsaw convention is a comprehensive international treaty,signed in,governing liability in all international transportation of persons,baggage,or goods.in signing the warsaw convention,t he contracting states in believed that limitations on liability would promote the development of the fledgling commercial air industry by allowing the airlines to predict their exposure to monetary damages and thereby obtain needed capital and adequate insurance coverage.carey united airlines cir,fn.omitted.
only a few of the provisions of the warsaw convention are pertinent here.article provides the carrier shall be liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger,if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.article limits the amount of monetary damage that can be awarded for such accidents.order of civil aeronautics board approving increases in liability limitations of the warsaw convention and the hague protocol,reprinted in hist.revision notes foll.may.article,as amended provides in pertinent part.in the carriage of passengers and baggage,any action for damages,however founded,can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this convention,without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights.montreal protocol.article,as amended,provides in the carriage of passengers and baggage,the limits of liability specified in article shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier,his servants or agents,done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result provided that,in the case of such act or omission of a servant or agent,it is also proved that he was acting within the scope of his employment.see brandt american airlines,c si wl.lexis,see also tseng,supra,at,fn.
where it is applicable,the warsaw convention provides the exclusive remedy for personal injuries.in tseng,the united states supreme court considered whether a passenger may maintain an action for personal injury under local law where the claim does not satisfy the conditions for liability under the warsaw convention.there,a passenger was subjected to an intrusive security search during preboarding procedures at an international airport in the united states.she brought an action alleging causes of action for assault and false imprisonment,but no bodily injury,as that term is used in article of the warsaw convention.the court held that the warsaw convention preempts actions under local law r ecovery for a personal injury suffered on board an aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking,stat,if not allowed under the convention,is not available at all.tseng,supra,at.the court also noted that a passenger who had not sustained bodily injury could not gain compensation under article for her solely psychic or psychosomatic injuries.tseng,at.see also eastern airlines,floyd,d.the court therefore concluded that the plaintiff was barred from pursuing an action not only under the warsaw convention but also under local law.tseng,supra,at.
following the decision in tseng,several courts have held that the warsaw convention preempts other claims as well,including breach of contract,discrimination,and willful misconduct.see carey united airlines,supra,at warsaw convention provides exclusive remedy for claims arising out of intentional misconduct brandt american airlines,supra,wl at pp.lexis at pp.warsaw convention preempts claims for breach of contract and federal discrimination,and provides exclusive remedy for willful misconduct peralta continental airlines,c mjj wl.lexis,warsaw convention preempts contract claims based on delay turturro continental airlines d,warsaw convention preempts federal discrimination claims as well as state tort claims waters port authority of new york new jersey d,warsaw convention preempts federal discrimination claims.however,in order for the warsaw convention to govern a claim,the incident giving rise to the claim must take place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.warsaw convention.
the question of whether a passenger is involved in any of the operations of embarking is a question of law to be decided based on the facts of each case.schmidkunz scandinavian airlines system cir.numerous cases have construed the meaning of this phrase,generally applying a test that examines the totality of the circumstances.see maugnie compagnie nationale air france cir,marotte american airlines,cir.in making this determination,courts focus on several factors,in particular the activity of the passengers at the time of the accident the restrictions,if any,on their movements the imminence of actual boarding and the physical proximity of the passengers to the gate.king american airlines,cir,quoting buonocore trans world airlines,cir.
applying this test,courts have found the warsaw convention applies to injuries suffered in a terrorist attack that took place inside a terminal,after the passengers had surrendered their tickets and passed through passport control,when they were standing in line at the departure gate,in an area reserved for passengers,waiting to be searched.day trans world airlines,cir,see also evangelinos trans world airlines,cir.the warsaw convention has also been held to apply to an airline refusal to board passengers who had received their boarding passes,passed through security,and were in an area of the airport available only to ticketed passengers near the departure gate.marotte american airlines,supra,at.similarly,a court held the warsaw convention applied to a claim for an airline refusal to board passengers who had checked in,received their boarding passes,and boarded the vehicle that was to transport them from the terminal to the aircraft.king american airlines,supra,at.
courts have found the warsaw convention inapplicable,however,where passengers were still in common areas,were not under the control of airline personnel,or were not physically near the departure gate.see buonocore trans world airlines,supra,at passenger had checked in and was in public area of airport,not near ticket gate,free to move about terminal before his flight was called mccarthy northwest airlines,cir,passenger had checked in and received boarding pass,was in a common area far from departure gate,was being led by airline agent toward customs area,but had not yet fulfilled most of the conditions necessary for boarding sweis trans world airlines,at time of terrorist attack passengers were checking in baggage and receiving boarding passes but were several steps from actual boarding,were not segregated from other passengers,were not near boarding gates,and flight was not scheduled for two more hours beaudet british airways,plc,passenger waiting in lounge after not engaged in operations of embarking as matter of law schmidkunz scandinavian airlines system,supra,at passenger had not yet received boarding pass and was in common passenger area.
based on the record presented,we conclude the aquinos were not engaged in the operations of embarking.at the time of the events giving rise to this action,they were in a common passenger area,attempting to check in.they had not checked their luggage or received their boarding passes.they had not progressed through security to an area restricted to passengers.indeed,their complaint is that they were not allowed to begin the operations of embarkation.the record does not show that they ever became engaged in those operations.asiana does not direct us to any case extending the reach of the warsaw convention to the stage of attempting to check in,and our independent research does not disclose any.
asiana contends that appellants were participating in procedures and therefore all events were governed by the warsaw convention.in support,asiana relies on lathigra british airways plc cir,in which the ninth circuit court of appeals stated once the passenger presents herself to the carrier or its agents as ready to begin the air journey,the convention generally governs liability for delays in the carrier performance,and its provisions apply until completion of disembarkation at the destination airport.however,despite the dictum suggesting otherwise,lathigra did not hold that the warsaw convention applied to activities that occurred at.rather,it held that travel delays caused by the negligent actions of airline employees in reconfirming flight reservations days before the passenger had even presented herself at the airport,where the carrier no longer served the route in question,were not covered by the warsaw convention.ibid.the court also made clear that its previous decisions in schmidkunz and maugnie,both of which declined to apply the warsaw convention liability limitations to injuries occurring in the common passenger areas of airport terminals,were still good law.lathigra,at,fn.we do not read lathigra as holding that the warsaw convention preempts causes of action arising even before passenger is completed.
we thus conclude the warsaw convention does not preempt the aquinos claims.
c.the airline deregulation act of is not applicable 
asiana argues that,even if the warsaw convention does not preempt this action,the airline deregulation act of does.the act provides in pertinent part a state,political subdivision of a state,or political authority of at least states may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier that may provide air transportation under this subpart.b.
the scope of this preemption,particularly as it relates to airline service,has been the subject of considerable dispute,although it is clear that the act does not preempt all state law based actions related to an airline conduct.for instance,in american airlines,wolens,d wolens,the united states supreme court held that the act permits state law based court adjudication of routine breach of contract claims,reasoning that such actions do not allege a violation of state imposed obligations,but instead seek recovery solely for the airlines alleged breach of its own,undertakings.
the federal circuit courts have not devised a uniform test for determining whether a state law action is related to an airline service.the ninth circuit court of appeals has adopted an approach defining service for purposes of the act preemption clause as the prices,schedules,origins and destinations of the transportation of passengers,cargo or mail s ervice was not intended to include an airline provision of beverages,personal assistance to passengers,the handling of luggage,and similar amenities.charas,supra,a
