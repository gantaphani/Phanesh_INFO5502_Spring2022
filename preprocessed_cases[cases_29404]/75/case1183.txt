in this consolidated action for breach of mandatory duty involving wrongful death,defendant california highway patrol and two of its officers collectively,the chp petition this court for a writ of mandate after the trial court denied their motion for summary judgment.the trial court found that the chp had a mandatory duty under vehicle code section,subdivision a,to impound an individual vehicle for days after arresting that individual for driving with a suspended license in violation of vehicle code section 
we conclude that section,subdivision a hereafter,section a provides only discretionary authority to impound and therefore the chp can not be held liable here under government code section for failing to perform a mandatory duty.accordingly,we issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to reverse its order denying summary judgment and to enter judgment in favor of the chp.
background 
on the morning of march,chp officers machado and lopez responded to a noninjury car accident involving scott pierre.pierre appeared intoxicated and failed a series of field sobriety tests.officer lopez arrested pierre for driving while under the influence of prescription drugs,in violation of section.officer machado prepared a vehicle report form,indicating pierre vehicle would be stored rather than impounded or released pursuant to section,subdivision h 
while en route to the sacramento county sheriff department,officer lopez checked pierre license and discovered it was suspended.officer lopez subsequently booked pierre for violation of sections,subdivision a driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license.in the arrest report,officer lopez marked pierre car as stored as opposed to impounded.
pierre was released from jail that very same day at approximately pierre mother then retrieved the vehicle from folsom towing.at approximately that evening,pierre,while driving the vehicle,collided with another car,causing fatal injuries to decedent jerry walker.
in,amanda and carl walker the walkers,decedent wife and son,filed separate wrongful death complaints against the chp pursuant to government code section,which imposes liability for breach of mandatory duty these complaints were subsequently consolidated.government code section provides where a public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury,the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.
the walkers alleged that the chp breached the mandatory duty of the impound requirement of section a at the time the chp allegedly breached this mandatory duty,the subdivision at issue was simply subdivision a for our purposes,this former subdivision a and the current subdivision a of section are substantively identical.section a provides in relevant part whenever a peace officer determines that a person was driving a vehicle while his or her driving privilege was suspended the peace officer may either immediately arrest that person and cause the removal and seizure of that vehicle or,if the vehicle is involved in a traffic collision,cause the removal and seizure of the vehicle without the necessity of arresting the person a vehicle so impounded shall be impounded for days.
the chp moved unsuccessfully for summary judgment,arguing,among other things,that section a did not create a mandatory duty for government code section purposes.the trial court concluded that section a created a mandatory duty here within the purview of government code section liability.
the trial court ruled that although it is not mandatory to take any action under section a,once a police officer chooses to take action by arresting an individual for driving with a suspended license under section,the officer must also impound the individual vehicle for days.according to the trial court,section a does not permit a peace officer to merely arrest the driver the officer must arrest the driver and impound the vehicle,or simply impound the vehicle.
the chp then filed the petition for writ of mandate prohibition that is at issue here.we issued an alternative writ.
discussion 
standard of review 
the chp contends that the trial court incorrectly interpreted section a to impose a mandatory duty to impound pierre vehicle for days after the officers arrested him for driving with a suspended license.
the interpretation of a statute is a question of law subject to independent review on appeal.we therefore interpret section a independently.our objective in interpreting a statute is to determine legislative intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.the first thing we do is read the statute,and give the words their ordinary meanings unless special definitions are provided.if the meaning of the words is clear,then the language controls if not,we may use various interpretive aids,including legislative history,statutory context,and public policy.schnyder state bd.of equalization th,d,fns.omitted department of fish game irrigation dist.th,d fish game.
interpretation of section a 
language of section a 
section a provides as relevant whenever a peace officer determines that a person was driving a vehicle while his or her driving privilege was suspended or revoked,or driving a vehicle without ever having been issued a driver license,the peace officer may either immediately arrest that person and cause the removal and seizure of that vehicle or,if the vehicle is involved in a traffic collision,cause the removal and seizure of the vehicle without the necessity of arresting the person a vehicle so impounded shall be impounded for days.
the vehicle code specifically defines shall as mandatory,and may as permissive.california courts have interpreted various provisions of the vehicle code using the word may to confer discretionary authority on law enforcement.see,hough mccarthy cal d,department of motor vehicles may suspend or revoke license green city of livermore d.officer may impound vehicle or remove keys.therefore,the may language of a supports the interpretation that this statute confers discretionary authority on law enforcement.
the trial court focused on the words may either to conclude that any action under section a mandated a impoundment.the trial court determined that the words may either required an officer taking action under this statute to do one of two things arrest the person and impound the vehicle,or simply impound the vehicle.however,the trial court cited no authority for this interpretation.in fact,this court has previously rejected such an interpretation of may either in in re jermaine th,d.the jermaine court found that interpreting may either to allow only two choices was erroneous for several reasons,including that the juvenile court rules at issue there like the vehicle code here state that shall is mandatory and may is permissive.id.at,d.the phrase may either does no more than apply the may to both of the succeeding clauses.thus,section a,in effect,says only that an officer may immediately arrest th e person and cause the removal and seizure of th e vehicle or may cause the removal and seizure of the vehicle without the necessity of arresting the person 
the walkers focus on the word shall in section a as creating a mandatory duty on the chp.however,the walkers emphasis on shall is misplaced.the word shall describes only the time period for any vehicle so impounded.italics added.if an officer decides not to impound a car under the discretionary authority provided by section a,it is not so impounded and therefore the provision is inapplicable.
extrinsic aids for section a interpretation 
if the words of the statute themselves do not provide a definitive answer,we may turn to extrinsic aids.here,we turn to legislative history,statutory context,and public policy.fish game,supra,th at,d.
legislative history 
the legislative history of section sheds some additional light upon the legislature intent.the legislature in added section to the vehicle code as one of several pro
