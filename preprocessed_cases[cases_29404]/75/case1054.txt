a coalition of idaho land owners denominated citizens against cart petition for review of the decision of the surface transportation board in union pacific railroad branch,id,stb docket no.june.in that decision the board authorized union pacific to salvage miles of its wallace branch rail line in idaho,subject to four environmental conditions,and also authorized the to be used as a trail pursuant to the national trails system act,d trails act.cart challenges only the authorization of interim trail use it contends that the board was required to assess the environmental impacts of trail use and erred in not disallowing trail use because the is contaminated.the board determined that the national environmental policy act nepa,does not apply to the trails act,and that the trails act does not otherwise require an environmental assessment prior to issuance of a certificate for interim trail use.because cart fails to show that these determinations were contrary to law or unreasonable,we deny the petition.
this case is before the court following the surface transportation board decision on remand from this court in state of idaho by and through idaho pub.utilities comm.in that case,this court affirmed the interstate commerce commission decision to permit immediate discontinuance of rail operations on the wallace branch rail line,but remanded the commission conditional authorization of salvage.id.at.after further proceedings,the surface transportation board,as successor to the commission through its section of environmental analysis,issued for public review and comment a draft supplemental environmental assessment.upon review of the section final assessment,the board concluded that if salvage is conducted according to the plans worked out by the railroad and other federal agencies,and if four new environmental mitigation conditions were implemented,then the railroad salvage proposal would not have significant adverse environmental impacts.
the board also issued a certificate of interim trail use citu permitting interim trail use and rail banking of the because the state of idaho and the coeur tribe had submitted the requisite statement of willingness to assume full responsibility for the property and the railroad had indicated its willingness to negotiate with them.the board rejected cart argument that the issuance of a trails act authorization required the preparation of environmental documentation under nepa.the board took the position that questions relating to how and whether the should be used as a trail were not questions for the board to decide.viewing its role under the trails act as ministerial,the board concluded that issuance of a citu is not a federal action under nepa.the board further observed that the environmental implications of trail use on the had been thoroughly addressed in the detailed studies performed in connection with civil proceedings that led to a consent decree in 
cart contends that the trails act requires the board to implement that act in a manner to effect its public recreational purposes consequently,in cart view,the board refusal to consider any environmental,contamination,or human hazard facts relating to the implementation and consequences of trail use,was contrary to nepa requirements and was arbitrary and capricious.because,cart continues,the requirements and policies of the trails act mandate that a citu permit a recreational trail only if the purposes of the trails act,set forth at,are satisfied,the citu should be revoked,and the rail line declared abandoned,in view of record evidence that the contamination in the is a human health hazard.essentially,then,the court must review the board determinations that nepa is inapplicable to citu issuance under the trails act,and the trails act itself does not require an environmental assessment before issuance of the citu.
the trails act,as amended by the national trails system act amendments of,stat,is the culmination of congressional efforts to preserve shrinking rail trackage by converting unused to recreational trails.preseault,d.under the trails act,the board must preserve established railroad for future reactivation of rail service by prohibiting abandonment where,if the railroad is willing to enter into an agreement for trail use,a trail sponsor offers to assume responsibility for management,payment of taxes,and legal liability for the and agrees to return the should there ever be a proposal to reactivate the line for rail service.see d.if the parties reach agreement,the land may be transferred to the trail operator for interim trail use,subject to terms and conditions if no agreement is reached,the railroad may abandon the line entirely and liquidate its interests.see preseault,at.by deeming interim trail use to be like discontinuance rather than abandonment,congress sought to prevent property interests from reverting to the landowners under state law.see id.at.
the provisions of the trails act are straightforward.section d of the amended trails act provides 
if a state,political subdivision,or qualified private organization is prepared to assume full responsibility for management of such and for any legal liability arising out of such transfer or use,and for the payment of any and all taxes that may be levied or assessed against such,then the board shall impose such terms and conditions as a requirement of any transfer or conveyance for interim use in a manner consistent with this chapter,and shall not permit abandonment or discontinuance inconsistent or disruptive of such use.
d.the board has promulgated regulations requiring sponsors to submit certain documentation describing the site and indicating the user willingness to assume full responsibility for management,legal liability,and taxes,as well as an acknowledgment of the user continuing obligation to meet its responsibilities subject to future reactivation of the for rail service.see.upon receipt of such documentation,the board applies a rebuttable presumption of fitness of a sponsor.see jost surface transp.thus,where the railroad is willing to enter negotiations with the sponsor,the abandonment is deferred and if the parties reach agreement within a certain time,no abandonment can occur until the user terminates trail use in an administrative proceeding absent an agreement the citu converts to a notice of abandonment.see jost,at goos,cir.
nepa generally requires federal agencies to examine the environmental effects of proposed federal actions and to inform the public of the environmental concerns that were considered in the agency decisionmaking.see baltimore gas natural res.defense council,d.specifically,nepa requires agencies to prepare an environmental evaluation for all proposals for major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.nepa applies to the board decisions to allow rail line abandonments.see idaho,at b.on the other hand,the board has determined that nepa does not require analysis of the environmental effects of possible interim trail use because the issuance of a citu is only a ministerial act.see iowa southern railroad in pottawattamie,mills,fremont and page counties,ia,june.the board adhered to this position in rejecting cart arguments.
because nepa mandate is addressed to all federal agencies,the board determination that nepa is inapplicable to the trails act is not entitled to the deference that courts must accord to an agency interpretation of its governing statute.see chevron natural res.defense council,d people against nuclear energy nuclear regulatory comm n,consequently,the issue of whether the board erred in determining that its decision to issue a citu under trails act is not subject to nepa is a question of law,subject to de novo review.see we find no error in the board determination 
the touchstone of whether nepa applies is discretion.the twofold purpose of nepa is to inject environmental considerations into the federal agency decisionmaking process and to inform the public that the federal agency has considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.macht skinner,quoting weinberger catholic action of educ.project,d.such in
