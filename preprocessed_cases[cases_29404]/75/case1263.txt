introduction 
vehicle code section provides for the removal,seizure and impounding for days of a vehicle driven by a driver while unlicensed or while his or her driving privileges are suspended or revoked,subd.a.following notice by the impounding agency,the registered and legal owner of a vehicle that is removed and seized shall be provided the opportunity for a storage hearing to determine the validity of,or consider any mitigating circumstances attendant to,the storage,subd.b.
in this appeal from a peremptory writ of mandate issued by the sonoma county superior court,we determine whether the registered owner lack of actual knowledge that the driver to whom he loaned his car was not validly licensed constitutes a mitigating circumstance under section,subdivision b,warranting release of the vehicle to the registered owner before expiration of the storage period set forth in the statute.we conclude,as did that trial court,that it does.we further conclude that section does not condition the operation of the mitigating circumstances exception to situations where the owner has made a reasonable inquiry as to the licensed status of the driver before lending the vehicle.
facts procedural background 
on july,santa rosa police officer robert minning stopped a dodge truck being driven by adam pennebaker,for failing to yield the right of way.minning determined that pennebaker license had been formally suspended by the department of motor vehicles on five separate occasions,including a current suspension,effective january,for operating a vehicle with an excessive blood alcohol level.minning detained,arrested and issued a citation to pennebaker for various vehicle code violations.he also impounded the dodge pursuant to section,subdivision a.pennebaker signed the citation and,upon promising to appear in court,he was released from custody.
the registered owner of the truck was pennebaker grandfather,year old earl smith,petitioner below and respondent on this appeal.smith had loaned the vehicle to pennebaker the day before,since pennebaker own vehicle was inoperable and he needed a vehicle to get to work.when smith learned the had been impounded,smith went to the santa rosa police department respondent below and appellant herein and met with officer robert kopriva who,with smith consent,thereafter conducted a storage hearing.
according to smith declaration filed in the writ proceeding,smith had observed his grandson driving his own vehicle during the year and believed his grandson was validly licensed to drive.smith told kopriva that he did not know and had no reason to know his grandson license was suspended.smith further testified that kopriva asked him if he had asked for or examined his grandson driver license before permitting him to drive,and smith answered no,but told kopriva that he had no reason to believe that his grandson was not validly licensed.smith averred that kopriva told him that it did not matter what i knew or did not know about my grandson license status since i had not asked for or examined my grandson license,santa rosa police department would not release my vehicle and the vehicle would be held in impound for days.
in his declaration,kopriva stated that,when asked,smith confirmed that he did not ask his grandson whether he had a driver license and did not ask to see his grandson license.kopriva also declared that smith said he was aware that at some time in the past,his grandson had problems with his license,but he thought those problems had been resolved.smith was not sure what those problems were.based upon his review of documents and smith responses to his questions,kopriva concluded that smith allowed his vehicle to be used by his grandson without making a reasonable effort or inquiry to determine whether his grandson possessed a valid license to operate the vehicle.kopriva therefore made the decision to keep the impounded for the days provided by section.
on or about july,smith spoke with traffic sergeant brad marsh regarding the impounding of his truck.marsh is the supervisor in charge of the traffic detail and oversees the hearing officers who handle poststorage hearings.marsh reviewed the file and spoke with kopriva and with smith.he told smith that because he had made no effort or inquiry to determine whether his grandson possessed a valid driver license,kopriva decision would stand unless smith could present additional evidence.
on july,smith filed a petition for writ of mandate or mandamus with the sonoma county superior court,seeking the release of his truck.therein,in addition to the foregoing facts,smith averred that the impound storage fee of per day,when added to the towing and administrative fees would exceed the value of the vehicle estimated to be between at the end of the day impoundment.
the city of santa rosa city answered and filed opposition.after hearing,the trial court granted the petition,holding that smith had proven he did not know his grandson license was suspended and therefore had established mitigating circumstances warranting release of his truck under section,subdivision b.in its order granting the writ petition,the court stated the court is of the opinion that the mitigating circumstances set forth in b are fulfilled if the owner proves that he did not know that the driver was an unlicensed person,and the owner is not required to prove that he asked the person whether he had a valid license,or asked to see the person license.
on april,the writ issued,ordering city,the santa rosa police department cream towing,to immediately release the truck to smith upon his payment of charges for towing and three days of storage.the court ordered the city of santa rosa to pay any additional storage charges or fees.the writ further ordered the city and the police department to immediately implement a policy and procedure whereby a vehicle is released from impoundment under vehicle code,if the evidence presented by a registered owner at an impound hearing establishes a mitigating circumstance including but not limited to the fact that the registered owner of the vehicle did not know that the driver of the vehicle had a suspended or revoked driver license,or no driver license,at the time the registered owner allowed the driver to operate the vehicle.the court refused to read into section the duty established by section that a registered owner must make a reasonable effort or inquiry to determine whether a prospective driver possesses a valid driver license before allowing him or her to operate the owner vehicle 
this timely appeal followed 
discussion 
appellant city argues that the trial court incorrectly interpreted sections and.
respondent smith argues that the trial court properly found that mitigating circumstances were present,warranting release of smith truck.smith contends,however,that the trial court improperly placed the burden of proof of lack of knowledge that the driver was not validly licensed upon the registered owner seeking release of his or her vehicle before the end of the day period.smith argues the burden of proof should properly have been placed upon the impounding agency to show that the registered owner knew the driver was not validly licensed 
standard of review.
the parties agree that our review of the superior court determination here is de novo.ordinarily,we would examine the superior court findings after its independent review of the administrative record in this case the evidence before the hearing officer at the poststorage hearing to determine whether the findings were supported by substantial evidence.machado department of motor vehicles th,d villalobos zolin th,d.but the determinative question in this case is one of statutory construction of section,and consequently is a question of law.see generally,century ins.garamendi cal th,d.on questions of law arising in mandate proceedings,we exercise independent judgment.mcintosh aubry th,d.villalobos zolin,supra,th,d.
statutory construction.
in many respects,the court order provides a template for our analysis here.we begin,as did the superior court,with the supreme court admonition in people ex rel.younger superior court cal d,w e must interpret the statute in question in accordance with applicable rules of statutory construction,fundamental among which are those which counsel that the aim of such construction should be the ascertainment of legislative intent so that the purpose of the law may be effectuated citation that a statute should be construed with reference to the entire statutory system of which it forms a part in such a way that harmony may be achieved among the parts citation and that courts should give effect to statutes according to the usual,ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.citation.merrill department of motor vehicles cal d,
beyond doubt there is a legislative policy favoring prevention and punishment of unlicensed driving.see legislative findings and declarations.and certainly this policy should be advanced to the extent permitted under the statutes as written.the first step in our analysis,however,is to focus on the words used by the legislature in order to determine their traditional and plain meaning.citation.mercer department of motor vehicles cal d.
the phrases mitigating circumstances,circumstances in mitigation,and circumstances of mitigation have been used in several statutes and hundreds of cases in california.mitigating circumstances are referred to,for instance,in statutes and rules relating to circumstances considered in aggravation or mitigation of sentence,cal.rules of court,rules e,b,considering whether to impose enhancement for driving under the influence causing injuries to more than one victim circumstances to be considered in the penalty phase of a capital case,circumstances considered in attorney discipline matters,state bar procedure rules,rules,circumstances considered in license revocation proceedings under the fish and game code fish,circumstances considered in suspending or revoking teaching credentials,subd.c and circumstances amounting to a defense of actions under civil libel statutes code civ.in a libel action,the mitigating circumstances which section of the code of civil procedure allows the defendant to prove are those which tend to show that the defendant in speaking the slanderous words acted in good faith,with honesty of purpose,and not maliciously clay lagiss d,roemer retail credit d.although criminal statutes and rules often specify some of the mitigating factors relating to the crime or to the defendant to be considered by the decision maker,subds.b k cal.rules of court,rule,other statutes do not define or describe in detail the mitigating circumstances which may be considered as lessening culpability and therefore warranting a reduction in punishment.
indeed,case law often considers whether mitigating circumstances apply to reduce culpability and therefore lessen punishment or damages,even where the applicable statute does not expressly mention such a term.see,in re leardo cal d,fleming state bar of cal.cal d,cases construing bus,relating to attorney discipline harris alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.cal d,construing bus,imposing penalties for violation of the alcoholic beverages control act.
black law dictionary ed defines mitigating circumstances as.a fact or situation that does not justify or excuse a wrongful act or offense but that reduces the degree of culpability and thus may reduce the damages in a civil case or the punishment in a criminal case.a fact or situation that does not bear on the question of a defendant guilt but that is considered by the court in imposing punishment and esp.in lessening the severity of a sentence 
a similar definition of mitigating circumstances is found in caljic,which provides in pertinent part a mitigating circumstance is any fact,condition or event which does not constitute a justification or excuse for the crime in question,but may be considered as an extenuating circumstance in determining the appropriateness of the death penalty.
we believe these definitions are consistent with the usual and ordinary understanding of the term mitigating circumstances,and suggest the sense in which it was intended by the legislature in the present context.see,mercer department of motor vehicles,supra,cal d,fn.the above definitions indicate the term encompasses equitable considerations such as the good faith of the actor or circumstances lessening his or her culpability.certainly nothing in the common uses of the phrase would prohibit consideration of the owner lack of knowledge that the driver was unlicensed as a mitigating circumstance.
however,these common definitions do not necessarily render the term mitigating circumstances as used in section,subdivision b,subject to a plain meaning within that statutory framework.smith argues that the fact that the owner does not actually know the driver is not validly licensed is sufficient to constitute a mitigating circumstance.indeed,he also argues the fact the driver is not the registered owner is in and of itself a mitigating circumstance,regardless of the owner knowledge of the license status of the driver.the city argues to the contrary,that the owner lack of knowledge that the driver does not have a valid license is only a mitigating circumstance where the owner has first inquired as to the license status of the driver to whom he or she lends the effect incorporating the duty established in section into the mitigating circumstances language of section.
as these differing interpretations suggest,it is not altogether whether the statute reference to any mitigating circumstances encompasses a duty by the owner to inquire of the driver whether the driver is validly licensed or to examine the borrower license,before lending the vehicle.
consequently,we turn to extrinsic sources to obtain evidence of legislative intent.long beach police officers city of long beach cal d.because the words of the statute themselves provide no definitive answer,it is appropriate to refer to extrinsic sources for evidence of legislative intent.where statutory language is susceptible of more than one meaning,it is the duty of the courts to accept that intended by the framers of the legislation,so far as its intention can be ascertained.to discern legislative intent,we must examine the legislative history and statutory context of the act under scrutiny.citation.id.at,fn.omitted.
legislative history.
the legislative history of section sheds little light upon the legislature intent in using the phrase any mitigating circumstances.
section was added to the vehicle code by statutes of,chapter,section,as part of a number of provisions dealing with the registration and licensing of vehicles,the revocation and suspension of licenses,and punishments for driving with a suspended or revoked license.it was introduced as senate bill by senator quentin kopp on february.weekly,reg.sess.section regarding impounding and storage of vehicles driven by unlicensed drivers and section making it unlawful for a vehicle owner to knowingly allow another person to drive the vehicle upon a highway without first making a reasonable effort or inquiry to determine that the driver had a valid driver license were both contained,along with other provisions,in senate bill as originally introduced and ultimately enacted into law.text of bill as chaptered,stats,ch.
the purpose of the bill,according to the senate committee on the judiciary analysis is to make changes in the vehicle code to deter people from driving with a suspended license or under the influence,and permanently revoke the license of a driver convicted of assault using a vehicle as a deadly weapon.senate com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess,as amended.the need for the bill was described therein by senator kopp u nlicensed drivers pose a threat to safety on our roads and highways.ibid.i t is clear that disqualified drivers are substantially in fatal accidents in california.ibid.
the bill analysis described then existing law,in relevant part as does not prohibit a person who has control of a vehicle from procuring that vehicle for,or authorizing the use of that vehicle by,another person if the other person driver license has been suspended or revoked by the department of motor vehicles id.at.the analysis continued that senate bill would p rovide that it is a misdemeanor for a person having control of a vehicle to allow a driver to use the vehicle,knowing that the driver has a suspended license allow a law enforcement officer to arrest a person for driving with a suspended license allow a law enforcement officer to impound a vehicle for a day period if the vehicle is driven by a person with a suspended license id.at.
as introduced and as originally enacted as section,senate bill did not contain any language regarding mitigating circumstances.
on february,one day before introduction of senate bill by senator kopp,assembly member richard katz introduced assembly bill known as the safe streets act of,also aimed at increasing penalties for driving without a valid license,including a provision authorizing forfeiture of a vehicle as a nuisance when operated by an unlicensed individual who was the registered owner of the vehicle and who has a previous misdemeanor conviction for a violation of specified provisions.this provision of assembly bill was enacted as section,subdivision a.added by stats,ch.as enacted and in effect today,section also provided that i f the driver of a vehicle impounded pursuant to this subdivision was not a registered owner of the vehicle at the time of impoundment,or if the driver of the vehicle was a registered owner of the vehicle at the time of impoundment but the driver does not have a previous conviction for a violation of various specified vehicle code sections,the vehicle shall be released pursuant to this code and is not subject to forfeiture,subd.c.
as introduced,assembly bill would have,among other things,added a provision to the vehicle code in language virtually identical to that of section as introduced in senate bill to make it unlawful for the owner of a motor vehicle to knowingly allow another person to drive the vehicle upon a highway unless the owner determines that the person possesses a valid driver license that authorizes the person to operate the vehicle.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june.this provision was dropped from assembly bill when the senate and assembly bills were reconciled.
perhaps because it provided for vehicle forfeiture,assembly bill contained extensive legislative findings and declarations concerning the hazards posed by unlicensed drivers.these findings and declarations were codified in section and they mirror in some respects the concerns voiced by senator kopp in introducing senate bill 
the bill analysis of senate bill when heard on june,in the assembly committee on transportation chaired by assembly member katz,observed that senate bill,among other things requires any vehicle impounded because the driver was driving without a valid license to be impounded for days.creates a new separate misdemeanor violation prohibiting any person having control of a vehicle from allowing another driver to use the vehicle,if the person having control knows that the other driver does not have a valid license.italics added.assem.com.on transportation,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.
at the third reading in the senate,following amendment of august,the bill analysis for senate bill observed with recent amendments,there is no longer any conflict between this bill and ab katz,and the bills are complementary.ab vehicle forfeiture provisions will only apply to a specified group of the most dangerous illegal drivers,and this bill applies to the other drivers.floor analysis reading of bill reg.sess.as amended.
senate bill passed the assembly on august,and the senate on august.on that date,senator kopp submitted a letter regarding its interpretation.the senate journal for the regular session,contained the following letter from senator kopp,dated,regarding senate bill stats,ch.this letter is to ensure accurate interpretation of two provisions of senate bill related to the operation of vehicles by unlicensed drivers.with respect to the vehicle impound and storage provisions in vehicle code section,sb is intended to address culpable conduct by the of a vehicle.it is not intended to impose a day impound penalty on a vehicle owner under the following circumstances when the vehicle has been stolen when the vehicle is subject to bailment and driven by an unlicensed employee of a business establishment,including a parking service or repair garage or when the owner has not knowingly allowed an unlicensed person to drive.with respect to the provisions of vehicle code section,it is intended that lenders and lessors have complied with the requirement to make a reasonable effort or inquiry to determine whether the prospective driver possesses a valid driver license if the lender or lessor has inquired whether the borrower or lessee has a valid driver license at the inception of the vehicle loan or lease.hist.and statutory notes,west ann.ed.foll,italics added.
following passage of assembly bill,assembly member katz on september,sent the governor a letter urging him to sign the bill into law and stating that assembly bill and senate bill were complementary measures,assembly bill applying to the most dangerous repeat offenders and subjecting only vehicles owned by the illegal driver to forfeiture,while senate bill provided for impoundment for a period of time for vehicles driven by drivers not lawfully licensed that are not subject to forfeiture under assembly bill assem.member katz,sponsor of assem.bill reg.sess.letter to governor.
the mitigating circumstances language was added to section,subdivision b in.amended by stats,ch.bill.that amendment also added subdivisions d through i relating to the release of an impounded vehicle and accompanying charges and fees.
the assembly analysis of this amendment asserted,in pertinent part,that l aw enforcement agencies throughout the state have made frequent and effective use of the vehicle impoundment provisions,impounding thousands of vehicles being operated by drivers with suspended or revoked licenses,or unlicensed drivers.the bill impoundment and release provisions are intended to address uncertainties and situations which have arisen since sb took effect in january.numerous financial institutions and rental agencies have reported their inability to reclaim vehicles they legally own but which are leased,financed or rented to others.some law enforcement agencies have refused to release such vehicles before the end of the days,resulting in significant impoundment charges to the legal owners when the registered owners subsequently do not reclaim the vehicles.the provisions clarifying the impoundment law are consistent with the safe streets act of ab katz,chapter,statutes of which confiscates vehicles if a driver is caught driving either with a suspended or revoked license,or has never had a license,and has a prior conviction for one of these offenses assem floor analysis,reading of bill reg.sess.as amended.
according to the analysis,senate bill c larifies the application of the vehicle impoundment provisions and specif ies conditions and procedures for the release of a vehicle prior to days.specifically,this bill 
a authorizes the impoundment for days of a vehicle involved in an accident caused by a driver with a suspended or revoked license or an unlicensed driver,without the necessity of arresting the driver.
b allows the impounding agency to consider any mitigating circumstances during a hearing to determine the validity of a impoundment.
c requires an impounding agency to release a vehicle prior to the end of the day period i when the vehicle was stolen ii when the vehicle was driven by an unlicensed employee of a business,parking service or repair facility iii when the driver license was suspended or revoked for minor or violations and iv when all towing and storage fees and charges are paid.
d requires the release of an impounded vehicle to the legal owner before days,if all of the following conditions are met i the legal owner is a specified financial institution,vehicle dealer or another person,not the registered owner,holding a security interest in the vehicle ii all towing,storage fees and charges are paid and,iii the legal owner presents foreclosure or repossession documents to the impounding agency.
e prohibits vehicles released early to legal owners from subsequently being returned to the original or registered driver and prohibits rental agencies from renting another vehicle to the cited driver before the days expired.assem.floor analysis,reading of bill reg.sess.as amended,italics added.
a amendment to section made changes not relevant to this discussion stats,ch.bill,as did amendments adopted in.stats,ch.assem.bill,stats,ch.assem.bill.
although sections and were companion pieces of legislation,aimed at reducing the harm caused by drivers with suspended,revoked or no licenses,there is nothing in the legislative history of either section that would support reading into the any mitigating circumstances language of section concerning the impound and storage of vehicles driven by such drivers,the mandate of section that the registered and legal owner of the vehicle must inquire about the license status of the driver to whom the owner lends the vehicle.
in its analysis of the legislative history of section,the trial court recognized that,in construing a statute we do not consider the motives or understandings of an individual legislator even if he or she authored the statute.delaney superior court cal d,fn,accord,in re marriage of bouquet cal d,williams garcetti cal th,d.nevertheless,it concluded that senator kopp august,letter,purporting to clarify the impound and storage provisions of section as originally enacted,having been made part of the record of the legislature,was relevant in determining the understanding of the legislature as a whole and was entitled to be considered by the court in determining the interpretation of the enactment.
in in re marriage of bouquet,supra,cal d,our supreme court recognized that i n construing a statute we do not consider the motives or understandings of individual legislators who cast their votes in favor of it.citations.nor do we carve an exception to the principle simply because the legislator whose motives are proferred sic actually authored the bill in controversy citation no guarantee can issue that those who supported his proposal shared his view of its compass.id.at.nevertheless,it held the court could consider a letter of the author referring to debate which could illuminate the interpretation of the statute intended by the legislature and where the letter was printed in the senate journal on motion of a senator as a letter of legislative intent.id.at.the supreme court has required that such a letter refer to arguments presented to legislators before it may be considered.california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d,in re marriage of bouquet,supra,cal d at,see also,mcglothlen department of motor vehicles d.
a legislator statement is entitled to consideration,however,when it is a reiteration of legislative discussion and events leading to adoption of proposed amendments rather than merely an expression of personal opinion.citations.the statement of an individual legislator has also been accepted when it gave some indication of arguments made to the legislature and was printed upon motion of the legislature as a letter of legislative intent.citation.california teachers san diego community college dist,supra,cal d,accord,roberts city of palmdale cal th,d,delaney superior court,supra,cal d at,fn.union bank superior court demetry th,fn,d.
that senator kopp letter was included in the senate journal after passage of senate bill,standing alone,does not persuade us that his view of the legislation was considered by the legislature as a whole or was part of any debate on the legislation.see,in re marriage of bouquet,supra,cal d.but for the later amendment of the section,we would view it as completely irrelevant to the interpretation of the statute.
however,senator kopp views on the proper interpretation of the statute were before the legislature that enacted the amendments to section,which amendments allowed consideration of any mitigating circumstances during the impound hearing.in such case,it is reasonable to conclude that the mitigating circumstance language was consistent with the views expressed by senator kopp and intended to clarify section.the amendment authored by kopp and by assem.member katz adding the term any mitigating circumstances to the statute was introduced less than a year after passage of section.in addition to adding the mitigating circumstances language to subdivision b,the amendment also explicitly added the other circumstances voiced by senator kopp in his letter,by which the owner could recover the vehicle before the expiration of the period.specifically,the amendment also provided the agency was to release the impounded vehicle before the storage period where the vehicle was stolen,or was subject to a bailment by an unlicensed employee of a parking service or repair garage.stats,ch.bill.
statutory context.
in addition to the legislative history of section,we consider the statutory context of the statute.e very statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.city of petaluma county of sonoma th,d see select base materials,board of equalization cal d.reference to related statutes may be helpful.see mercer department of motor vehicles,supra,cal d,use of similar terms in related statutes suggestive of legislative intent.
none of the other statutes relating to unlicensed driver uses the term mitigating circumstances.nevertheless,the city urges a narrow definition for the term,arguing that mitigating circumstances imports section s duty of inquiry,requiring an owner to inquire as to the license status of the driver in order to thereafter assert lack of knowledge of the unlicensed status of the driver as a mitigating circumstance.we disagree.
although sections and were introduced in the same bill and both aimed at reducing the incidence of unlicensed driving and punishing such behavior,there is no reference to or incorporation of section into section.we are not persuaded that the legislature intended to so narrow the definition of mitigating circumstances where the registered and legal owner,who was not the unlicensed driver,seeks restoration of the vehicle before expiration of the storage period.had the legislature wished to import the standard of culpability set forth in section into section,it easily could have done so.
more importantly,section is a criminal statute.it does not involve impound or storage of automobiles driven by unlicensed drivers.rather,section imposes criminal liability upon an owner who knowingly allows another person to drive the owner vehicle without first determining the driver possesses a valid driver license.the statute continues in relevant part for the purposes of this section,an owner is required only to make a reasonable effort or inquiry to determine whether the prospective driver possesses a valid driver license before allowing him or her to operate the owner vehicle.an owner is not required to inquire of the department whether the prospective driver possesses a valid driver license,subd.b.that standard for criminal liability could conceivably furnish a basis for a negligence finding in a civil action for damages against an owner who did not make a reasonable effort to determine whether the prospective driver possessed a valid license before allowing the driver to operate the owner vehicle where injuries were proximately caused thereby.see,see generally,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,violation of a criminal statute may constitute negligence per se.however,it does not follow that the inquiry standard necessarily would apply to an owner trying to retrieve his vehicle from impound.it is reasonable to assume that a less stringent standard would apply to the owner seeking to retrieve his property from impound than to an owner sought to be held liable for damages caused by allowing an unlicensed driver to drive the owner car.
we agree with the trial court,which found it more reasonable to interpret section by referring to other impound statutes contained in the vehicle code specifically sections,and.
section provides for impound of motorcycles driven by a person while his or her driving privilege has been suspended or revoked.it provides in relevant part whenever a person is convicted for driving any class or motor vehicle,while his or her driving privilege has been suspended or revoked,of which vehicle he or she is the owner,or of which the owner permitted the operation,knowing the person driving privilege was suspended or revoked,the court may,at the time sentence is imposed on the person,order the motor vehicle impounded in any manner as the court may determine,italics added.actual knowledge that the driver was not validly licensed is required before the court may order the impound of a motorcycle driven by someone other than the owner.there is no indication of any requirement that the owner inquire about the license status of the driver before allowing the driver to drive and appellant does not contend that an inquiry duty should be read in to the knowledge requirement of this similar statute 
section allows a magistrate to issue an order authorizing a peace officer to impound a vehicle when the officer establishes reasonable cause to believe the vehicle was used to flee a police officer or was driven in a reckless manner.however,the registered owner of the vehicle need only show that he was not the driver who fled or evaded the police officer to obtain immediate release of the vehicle knowledge or lack thereof that the driver was not validly licensed is not relevant to this impound statute.if the owner was not the driver,the owner need only prove such to obtain immediate release of his or her vehicle.this is the case even though the vehicle was used in circumstances far more serious than driving without a valid license.
under section,the vehicle is subject to forfeiture as a nuisance if it is driven by the registered owner who has lacks a valid license and who was previously convicted of a specified misdemeanor,including driving without a license.the statute provides that i f the driver of a vehicle impounded pursuant to this subdivision was not a registered owner of the vehicle at the time of impoundment the vehicle shall be released pursuant to this code and is not subject to forfeiture,subd.c.the legislature clearly intended forfeiture under this section to apply only where the driver was the registered owner and had previous convictions.this is consistent with the legislative history indicating forfeiture was to apply in cases where the driver was also the registered owner with a history of prior unlawful driving behavior.moreover,under section even where the statutory requisites are met and the unlicensed driver is the registered owner,the trial court has discretion to deny forfeiture.in people v.one cadillac deville,supra,th,d.
in people v.one cadillac deville,supra,th,d,the court described some of the factors which might bear on the court exercise of discretion to impose a forfeiture under section.mitigating or aggravating factors may bear on the decision,whether the driver knew the license was invalid.id.at,d,italics added.
these companion vehicle code statutes,although distinguishable in particular respects from section,are also part of the statutory scheme for addressing the problem of unlicensed drivers by impound,storage and vehicle forfeiture provisions.they provide strong support that the legislature intended to deal more leniently with registered owners who had no actual knowledge of the invalid license status of drivers using their vehicles.indisputably,the legislature intended to reserve forfeiture of vehicles to apply only to a specified group of the most dangerous illegal drivers bill analysis,reading of bill reg.sess.as amended,the most egregious violators of the law.
in this case,given the value of the vehicle and the costs of storage,application of the storage period of section effects a forfeiture of the vehicle in circumstances where the registered owner did not know the license of the driver to whom he loaned his car had been suspended.we believe at a minimum,that the term mitigating circumstances as used in section encompasses the circumstances present here.the addition of the term any mitigating circumstances to section,indicates the legislature did not intend to punish the failure of the owner to inquire as to the license status of the driver by the effective forfeiture of the vehicle 
burden of proof of mitigating circumstance.
respondent smith contends the court erred in placing upon him the burden of proving the applicable mitigating circumstance that he lacked knowledge that the driver was unlicensed.he argues that the impounding agency must prove the absence of any mitigating circumstance to retain the vehicle for the full storage period.we disagree.
as provided by evidence code section except as otherwise provided by law,a party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting.once this initial burden is met,the opposing party will be charged with producing its own evidence as to the matters established.a the burden of producing evidence as to a particular fact is on the party against whom a finding on that fact would be required in the absence of further evidence.b the burden of producing evidence as to a particular fact is initially on the party with the burden of proof as to that fact.burden of producing evidence means the obligation of a party to introduce evidence sufficient to avoid a ruling against him on the issue.thus,if a plaintiff presents evidence to establish each element of its case,the defendant has the burden of going forward with its own evidence as to those issues.this does not alter the ultimate burden of proof,which rests with the plaintiff to prove each of the relevant facts supporting its cause of action.tusher gabrielsen th,d,italics omitted.
the statutory scheme for poststorage hearings set forth in section and incorporated by reference in section,subdivision b,places the burden of establishing the authority for,and the validity of,the removal squarely upon the storing agency,subd.a.it is the agency burden to show that the vehicle was validly seized.however,the agency need not negate every conceivable mitigating circumstance,absent any evidence that mitigating circumstances exist.it is up to the owner asserting that mitigating circumstances warrant release of the vehicle before expiration of the storage period to produce evidence of such mitigating circumstances.
as stated earlier,the presence of mitigating circumstances does not justify or excuse the wrongful act,but rather reduces the degree of culpability of the actor and arguably warrants a reduction in punishment.consequently,as is the case in other contexts where a defendant claims that mitigating circumstances lessen culpability and warrant lesser or no discipline or punishment,assertion and proof of such is the burden of the person asserting the presence of mitigating circumstances.see,carnation olivet egg ranch d.under cal,a,as in breach of contract actions generally,the burden of proof is on the party whose breach caused damage,to establish matters relied on to mitigate damage people ex rel.state air resources bd.wilmshurst th,d proof that actual damages less than liquidated maximum provided in a penalty statute lies with defendant warner state bar cal d,in attorney discipline proceeding,respondent attorney has the burden of establishing the mitigating circumstances and rehabilitation matter of spaith review cal.state bar.rptr,wl,cal.bar same in the matter of twitty review cal.state bar.rptr,same code civ,libel statute places burden on one asserting mitigating circumstances.
use of the term in this statute appears to us no different.
as the court below found,the evidence showed without contradiction that smith did not know and had no reason to know his grandson was unlicensed.officer kopriva stated that smith informed him that smith knew at some time in the past that his grandson had problems with his license,which problems he believed had been resolved.that statement does not undermine smith assertion that he did not know his grandson was not validly licensed.by requiring smith to show he had made a reasonable inquiry as to the license status of his grandson,the city used an improper standard in determining whether to keep the impounded truck for the full days and abused its discretion in refusing to find mitigating circumstances in smith lack of actual knowledge under the facts of this case.
we conclude the trial court properly determined that the mitigating circumstances set forth in section,subdivision b,are demonstrated where the owner proves he or she did not know that the driver was not validly licensed and that the owner is not either required to ask the driver whether the driver has a valid license or to ask to see the license in order to recover the vehicle before expiration of the storage period.

we affirm the judgment of the trial court issuing the writ of mandamus.respondent smith shall recover his costs on this appeal.
