after petitioner union pacific railroad hereinafter carrier charged five of its employees with disciplinary violations,their union hereinafter union initiated grievance proceedings pursuant to the cba.the union asserts that the parties conferenced all five disputes and the carrier concedes that they conferenced at least two.dissatisfied with the outcome of the proceedings,the union sought arbitration before the nrab first division.both parties filed submissions in the five cases,but neither mentioned conferencing as a disputed matter.yet,in each case,both parties necessarily knew whether the union and the carrier had conferred and the board governing rule,published in circular one,which prescribes board procedures,instructs carriers and employees to set forth all relevant,argumentative facts,cfr d,e.just prior to the hearing,one of the arbitration panel industry representatives objected,sua sponte,that the record included no proof of conferencing.the carrier thereafter embraced that objection.the referee allowed the union to submit evidence of conferencing.the union did so,but it maintained that the issue was untimely raised,indeed forfeited,as the carrier had not objected before the date set for argument.the panel,in five identical decisions,dismissed the petitions for want of jurisdiction.the record could not be supplemented to meet the objection,the panel reasoned,for as an appellate tribunal,the panel was not empowered to consider de novo evidence and arguments.the union sought review in the federal district court,which affirmed the board decision.on appeal,the seventh circuit observed that the single question at issue was whether written documentation of the conference in the record was a necessary prerequisite to nrab arbitration,and determined that there was no such prerequisite in the statute or rules.but instead of resting its decision on the union primary,argument that the panel erred in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over the cases it reversed on the ground that the nrab proceedings were incompatible with due process.
the seventh circuit erred in resolving the union appeal under a constitutional,rather than a statutory,headline.this court granted certiorari to address whether nrab orders may be set aside for failure to comply with due process notwithstanding first q limited grounds for review.but so long as a respondent does not seek to modify the judgment below,true here,the respondent may rely upon any matter appearing in the record in support of the judgment.blum bacon.the seventh circuit understood that the union had pressed statutory and constitutional arguments,but observed that both arguments homed in on a single question is written documentation of the conference in the record a necessary prerequisite to nrab arbitration answering this single question in the negative,the seventh circuit effectively resolved the union core complaint.because nothing in the act elevates to jurisdictional status the obligation to conference minor disputes or to prove conferencing,a negative answer to the single question leaves no doubt about the union entitlement,in accord with first q,to vacation of the board orders.given this statutory ground for relief,there is no due process issue alive in this case,and no warrant to answer a question that may be consequential in another case.nevertheless,the grant of certiorari here enables this court to reduce confusion,clouding court as well as board decisions,over matters properly typed jurisdictional.
congress authorized the board to prescribe rules for presenting and processing claims,first v,but congress alone controls the board jurisdiction.by refusing to adjudicate the instant cases on the false premise that it lacked jurisdiction to hear them,the nrab panel failed to conform,or confine itself,to matters congress placed within the scope of nrab jurisdiction,first q.
a not all mandatory prescriptions,however emphatic,are properly typed jurisdictional.arbaugh y h.jurisdiction properly comprehended refers to a tribunal power to hear a case,and can never be forfeited or waived.at.in contrast,a rule does not reduce a tribunal adjudicatory domain and is ordinarily forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.kontrick ryan.for example,this court has held nonjurisdictional and forfeitable the provision in title vii of the civil rights act of requiring complainants to file a timely discrimination charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc before proceeding to court,zipes trans world airlines.in contrast,the court has reaffirmed the jurisdictional character of a time limitation for filing a notice of appeal.bowles russell.here,the requirement that parties to minor disputes,as a last chance prearbitration,attempt settlement in conference,is imposed on carriers and grievants alike,but satisfaction of that obligation does not condition the board adjudicatory authority,which extends to all disputes between carriers and their employees growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay,rules,or working conditions,slocum delaware,quoting first i.when a cba grievance procedure has not been followed,resort to the board would ordinarily be objectionable as premature,but the conference requirement is independent of the cba process.rooted in,the rla g eneral duties section,and not moored to the nrab e stablishment,powers,and duties set out in first,conferencing is often informal in practice,and is no more jurisdictional than is the presuit resort to the eeoc held nonjurisdictional and forfeitable in zipes.and if the conference requirement is not jurisdictional,then failure initially to submit proof of conferencing can not be of that genre.and although the carrier alleges that nrab decisions support characterizing conferencing as jurisdictional,if the nrab lacks authority to define its panels jurisdiction,surely the panels themselves lack that authority.furthermore,nrab panels have variously addressed the matter.
b neither the rla nor circular one could plausibly be read to require,as a prerequisite to the nrab exercise of jurisdiction,submission of proof of conferencing.instructions on party submissions are,not jurisdictional,rules.the board itself has recognized that conferencing may not be a question in dispute,and when that is so,proof thereof need not accompany party submissions.it makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly presented data supporting the employee grievance,cfr d evidence the carrier had no opportunity to consider prearbitration.but conferencing is not a fact bearing on the merits of a grievance.moreover,the rla respects the parties right to order for themselves the conference procedures they will follow.see sixth.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
it is most true that this court will not take jurisdiction if it should not,chief justice marshall famously wrote,but it is equally true,that it must take jurisdiction if it should.we have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given,than to usurp that which is not given.cohens virginia,wheat,see marshall marshall.while chief justice marshall statement bears fine tuning,there is surely a starting presumption that when jurisdiction is conferred,a court may not decline to exercise it.see fallon,manning,meltzer,shapiro,hart wechsler the federal courts and the federal system ed.the general rule applicable to courts also holds for administrative agencies directed by congress to adjudicate particular controversies.
congress vested in the national railroad adjustment board hereinafter nrab or board jurisdiction to adjudicate grievances of railroad employees that remain unsettled after pursuit of internal procedures.first h,i.we consider in this case five nearly identical decisions of a panel of the nrab dismissing employee claims for lack of jurisdiction.nrab first div.award,app.to pet.for cert,hereinafter panel decision.in each case,the panel declared that a procedural rule raised by a panel member,unprompted by the parties,was jurisdictional in character and therefore commanded threshold dismissal.
the panel characterization,we hold,was misconceived.congress authorized the board to prescribe rules for the presentation and processing of claims,first v,but congress alone controls the board jurisdiction.by presuming authority to declare procedural rules jurisdictional,the panel failed to conform,or confine itself,to matters congress placed within the scope of nrab jurisdiction,first q.because the panel was not without authority to assume jurisdiction over the employees claim s,panel decision,its dismissals lacked tenable grounding.we therefore affirm the judgment of the seventh circuit setting aside the panel orders.
concerned that labor disputes would lead to strikes bringing railroads to a halt,congress enacted the railway labor act rla or act,stat,as amended,et,in to promote peaceful and efficient resolution of those disputes.see union pacific price.the act instructs labor and industry to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay,rules,and working conditions,and to settle all disputes,whether arising out of the application of such agreements or otherwise,in order to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier.first see trainmen jacksonville terminal,describing obligation to pursue agreement as the heart of the rla as part of its endeavor,congress provided a framework for the settlement and voluntary arbitration of minor disputes.see price,at.in the railroad industry,the term minor disputes means,primarily,grievances arising from the application of collective bargaining agreements to particular situations.at.
many railroads,however,resisted voluntary arbitration.see,at.congress therefore amended the act in amendment to mandate arbitration of minor disputes under the altered scheme,arbitration occurs before panels composed of two representatives of labor and two of industry,with a neutral referee serving as tiebreaker.see,at.to supply the representative arbitrators,congress established the nrab,a board of private persons representing labor and industry in equal numbers.first a see trainmen chicago,neutral referees,the rla provides,shall be appointed by the representative arbitrators or,failing their agreement,by the national mediation board.first l.the amendment authorized the nrab to adopt,at a session in,such rules as it deems necessary to control proceedings,first v the product of that rulemaking,codified at cfr pt,is known as circular one.
in keeping with congress aim to promote peaceful settlement of minor disputes,the rla requires employees and carriers,before resorting to arbitration,to exhaust the grievance procedures specified in the agreement hereinafter cba.see first i.this stage of the process is known as proceedings.as a final prearbitration step,the act directs parties to attempt settlement in conference between designated representatives of the carrier and the.second,sixth the rla contains instructions concerning the place and time of conferences,but specifies that the statute does not supersede the provisions of any agreement as to conferences in effect between the parties,sixth it is undisputed that in common practice the conference may be as informal as a telephone conversation.
if the parties fail to achieve resolution in the usual manner up to and including the chief operating officer of the carrier designated to handle minor disputes,either party may refer the matter to the nrab.first i.submissions to the board must include a full statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the disputes.see cfr d,e submissions must clearly and briefly set forth all relevant,argumentative facts,including all documentary evidence arbitration is launched when the party referring the dispute files a notice of intent with the nrab after board acknowledgment of the notice,the parties have days to file simultaneous submissions.nrab,uniform rules of procedure june.
in creating the scheme of mandatory arbitration superintended by the nrab,the amendment largely foreclose d litigation over minor disputes.price,at see railway conductors pitney,not only has congress designated an agency peculiarly competent to handle minor disputes,but it also intended to leave a minimum responsibility to the courts.congress did provide that an employee who obtained a monetary award against a carrier could sue to enforce it,and the court could either enforce the award or set it aside.price,at first p ed.in addition to that limited role,some courts of appeals,we noted in price,reviewed awards claimed to result from a denial of due process of law.at citing ellerd southern pacific,barnett seashore lines.
in,congress again amended the scheme,this time to state grounds on which both employees and railroads could seek judicial review of nrab orders.the governing provision,still in force,allows parties aggrieved by an nrab panel order to petition for court review.first q ed.the provision instructs that 
o n such review,the findings and order of the division shall be conclusive on the parties,except that the order may be set aside,in whole or in part,or remanded,for failure of the division to comply with the requirements of the rla,for failure of the order to conform,or confine itself,to matters within the scope of the division jurisdiction,or for fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the order.

the instant matter arose when petitioner union pacific railroad hereinafter carrier charged five of its employees with disciplinary violations.their union,the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen hereinafter union,initiated grievance proceedings pursuant to the cba.the union asserts that,following exhaustion of grievance proceedings,the parties conferenced all the disputes counsel for the carrier conceded at argument that at least two of the disputes were conferenced,tr.of oral arg.dissatisfied with the outcome of the proceedings,the union sought arbitration before the first division of the nrab.the union and the carrier,from early through,filed simultaneous submissions in the five cases.in each submission,the union included the notice of discipline or discharge,the hearing transcript,and all exhibits and evidence relating to the underlying adverse actions used in the grievance proceeding.neither party mentioned conferencing as a disputed matter.yet,in each case,both parties necessarily knew whether the union and the carrier had conferred,and the board governing rule instructs carriers and employees to set forth all relevant,argumentative facts,cfr d,e.
on march,just prior to the hearing on the employees claims,one of the industry representatives on the arbitration panel raised an objection.petition to review and vacate awards and orders of first div.nrab in nd,hereinafter pet.to review.on his own initiative,unprompted by the carrier,and in executive session,the industry representative asserted that the record included no proof of conferencing.see ibid.the carrier thereafter embraced the panel member objection.the neutral referee informed the union of the issue and adjourned the hearing,allowing the union to submit evidence that conferencing had in fact occurred.see.the union did so,offering phone logs,handwritten notes,and correspondence between the parties as evidence of conferencing in each of the five cases,panel decision.from its first notice of the objection,however,the union maintained that the issue was untimely raised,indeed forfeited,as the carrier itself had not objected prior to the date set for argument of the cases,at pet.to review.
on march,nearly one year after the question of conferencing first arose,the panel,in five identical decisions,dismissed the petitions for want of authority to assume jurisdiction over the claim s.panel decision.citing circular one,see supra,at,and the weight of arbitral precedent,the panel stated that the evidentiary record must be deemed closed once a notice of intent has been filed with the nrab.panel decision in explaining why the record could not be supplemented to meet the objection,the panel emphasized that it was an appellate tribunal,as opposed to one which is empowered to consider and rule on de novo evidence and arguments.at.
the two labor representatives dissented.the carrier submissions,they reasoned,took no exception based on failure to conference or to prove conferencing therefore,they concluded,under a well settled principle governing the board deliberations,the carrier had forfeited the issue,at.the dissenters urged that the union had furnished evidence showing the cases had all been conferenced,even though the relevant collective bargaining agreement did not require conferencing.at.dismissal of the claims,the dissenters charged,demonstrated the kind of gamesmanship that breeds contempt for the minor dispute process.at.
the union filed a petition for review in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois,asking the court to set aside the board orders on the ground that the panel had unlawfully held it lacked authority to assume jurisdiction over the cases absent evidence of a conference between the parties in the record.pet.to review.nothing in the act or the nrab procedural rules,the union maintained,mandated dismissal for failure to allege and prove conferencing in the union original submission.by imposing,without warrant,a technical pleading or evidentiary requirement and elevating it to jurisdictional status,the union charged,the panel had egregiously violate d the act,or fail ed to conform its jurisdiction to that required by law,alternatively,the union asserted that the panel violated procedural due process by entertaining the carrier untimely objection,even though the carrier had failed to raise any objection as to lack of conferencing in its submissions.
the district court affirmed the board orders.addressing the union argument that the issue was untimely raised,the court accepted the panel description of the issue as jurisdictional,and noted the familiar proposition that jurisdictional challenges may be raised at any stage of the proceedings.supp,and.
on appeal,the seventh circuit recognized that the union had presented its case through both a statutory and constitutional framework.the court observed,however,that the essence of the conflict boils down to a single question is written documentation of the conference in the record a necessary prerequisite to arbitration before the nrab ibid.it then determined that there was no such prerequisite n o statute,regulation,or cba,the court concluded,required the evidence of conferencing to be presented in the record.at.but instead of resting its decision on the union primary,argument that the panel erred in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over the cases the court of appeals reversed on the ground that the nrab proceedings were incompatible with due process.see,at.
we granted the carrier petition for certiorari,which asked us to determine whether a reviewing court may set aside nrab orders for failure to comply with due process notwithstanding the limited grounds for review specified in first q as earlier recounted,courts of appeals have divided on this issue.see supra,at,and.appearing as respondent in this court,however,the union urged affirmance of the seventh circuit judgment on an alternative ground.reasserting the lead argument it had advanced in its petition for court review,see supra,at,the union maintained that the board did not conform,or confine itself,to matters within the scope of its jurisdiction,first q.brief for respondent.in response,the carrier stated that the union alternative ground presents a pure question of law that th e court can and should resolve without need for remand.reply brief.we agree.
so long as a respondent does not seek to modify the judgment below,true here,i t is well accepted that the respondent may,without filing a or,rely upon any matter appearing in the record in support of the judgment.blum bacon.the seventh circuit,as just observed,see supra,at,understood that the union had pressed statutory and constitutional arguments,but also comprehended that both arguments homed in on a single question is written documentation of the conference in the record a necessary prerequisite to arbitration before the nrab at.answering this single question in the negative,the court of appeals effectively resolved the union core complaint.but,for reasons far from apparent,the court declared that once we answer the key question,adjudication of the due process claim is unavoidable.ibid.
the seventh circuit,we agree,asked the right question,but inappropriately placed its answer under a constitutional,rather than a statutory,headline.as the court of appeals determined,and as we discuss infra,at,nothing in the act elevates to jurisdictional status the obligation to conference minor disputes or to prove conferencing.that being so,the unavoidable conclusion,following from the seventh circuit answer to the key question,at,is that the panel,in first q words,failed to conform,or confine itself,to matters within the scope of its jurisdiction.the carrier,although it sought a different outcome,was quite right to urg e the court of appeals to consider the statutory claim before the constitutional one.at.
in short,a negative answer to the single question identified by the court of appeals leaves no doubt about the union entitlement,in accord with first q,to vacation of the board orders.given this statutory ground for relief,there is no due process issue alive in this case,and no warrant to answer a question that may be consequential in another case absent grounds specified in first q for vacating a board order,may a reviewing court set aside an nrab adjudication for incompatibility with due process an answer to that question must await a case in which the issue is genuinely in controversy in this case,however,our grant of certiorari enables us to address a matter of some importance we can reduce confusion,clouding court as well as board decisions,over matters properly typed jurisdictional.
