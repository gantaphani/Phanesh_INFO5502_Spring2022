in these consolidated appeals we determine whether the trial court erred in vacating the arbitration award of for fees and expenses in settlement of jordan department of motor vehicles th,d jordan,the case that held the smog impact fee was unconstitutional.we also address a challenge to the validity of revenue and taxation code section,subdivision b section b,the statute that authorized the arbitration.
although we recognize the limited scope of judicial review of an arbitration award under moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,moncharsh,we find this case falls in the limited and exceptional circumstance justifying judicial review of an award that violates an explicit expression of public policy.an award of over million in public monies pursuant to statutory authority for an arbitration in the settlement of an million dispute is an unconstitutional gift of public funds.as such it violates both section b,which authorizes the arbitration,and the public policy set forth in article xvi,section of the california constitution,prohibiting gifts of public funds.we affirm the judgment vacating the arbitration award.
subject to the implicit limitation that the arbitration award not exceed million,we find section b is not unconstitutional as a delegation of the legislature power to appropriate money.we affirm the judgment dismissing the declaratory relief action.
background 
in,the legislature enacted revenue and taxation code sections through,creating the motor vehicle smog impact fee.stats,ch.under this statutory scheme,a fee was imposed to register motor vehicles in california if the vehicle was last registered in another state,unless the vehicle was california certified.former,subd.a.
four individuals the jordan plaintiffs moved to california,registered their vehicles,and each paid the smog impact fee.challenging the constitutionality of the smog impact fee,they sought refunds,which were denied.they filed a complaint seeking refunds of the smog impact fees and a declaration that the smog impact fee was unconstitutional.jordan,supra,th at,d.
the trial court declared the motor vehicle smog impact fee unconstitutional under the commerce clause of the united states constitution and under article xix of the california constitution.it ordered the state to refund the fee to the jordan plaintiffs,to enter a claim for refund for those who paid the fee after entry of judgment,and to file claims for refund or to set up and file a class action for those who paid the fee on or after september,three years before the initial complaint,but prior to entry of judgment.jordan,supra,th at,d.
in a subsequent proceeding,the trial court found the efforts of the jordan plaintiffs and their counsel resulted in creation of a common fund of.the court awarded counsel five percent of this fund or in fees and expenses.for ease of reference we shall refer to this amount as simply million.
on appeal,this court upheld the trial court finding that the motor vehicle smog impact fee was unconstitutional.jordan,supra,th at,d.we found,however,that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in fashioning a remedy for taxpayers who were not properly before it.id.at,d.the judgment was reversed with respect to orders that refunds be filed or paid to anyone other than the four jordan plaintiffs.id.at,d.
in response to the jordan decision,supra,th,d,the governor announced i have read that opinion.i think it is sound and i have decided not to appeal the case.he further announced he had asked the department of motor vehicles and the department of finance to prepare and present to the legislature a workable plan to refund the fees collected.i believe everyone who paid the fee is entitled to a refund.
in the meantime,the state appealed from the fee award.neither the jordan plaintiffs nor their attorneys.the matter was fully briefed and set for oral argument on february.at the request of the parties,argument was continued to allow the parties to settle the matter through mediation.on may,the parties wrote this court,requesting a second continuance because the parties had agreed to arbitration.the letter stated they are currently in the process of working out the detailed terms of the arbitration.
on june,the governor signed two bills passed by the legislature assembly bill reg.sess.and senate bill reg.sess.stats,chs.the legislature found and declared that approximately vehicle owners paid the smog impact fee,for a total of approximately.in jordan,supra,th,d,the court declared the smog impact fee unconstitutional.the governor announced the state would not appeal the jordan decision and would refund the smog impact fee plus interest to all who paid it.
the express legislative intent of these two bills was to do all of the following repeal existing provisions of law that establish and impose the smog impact fee.require the department of motor vehicles to search its records and promptly identify those persons who were,at the time the application for registration was completed,the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle and who are eligible for a refund of the smog impact fee.notify all eligible recipients the pending refunds and provide a simplified verification and claims procedure for those refunds.promptly provide payment of the smog impact fee refunds to eligible persons,including the three hundred dollar fee,any penalty fee collected for late payment of the smog impact fee,and any interest earned on those charges.appropriate the full amount of funds necessary to refund the smog impact fee,any penalty fee collected for late payment of the smog impact fee,and any interest due to those who paid the fee.stats,ch,e stats,ch,e.
senate bill added revenue and taxation code section.stats,ch.that section provided for the creation of the smog impact fee refund account in the amount of,subd.a.section b provides notwithstanding section of the government code,the moneys in the smog impact fee refund account in the special deposit fund are hereby continuously appropriated,without regard to fiscal years,to the department of motor vehicles for the purpose of making refunds to persons who paid the smog impact fee formerly required by chapter commencing with section upon registering a vehicle in california.each refund shall also include the amount of any penalties incurred by the payer with respect to the fee,and shall also include interest as specified in sections and of the vehicle code.in addition,the appropriate level of court costs,fees and expenses in the settlement of the case of jordan department of motor vehicles th,d,shall be determined through binding arbitration,and all of those fees,costs,or expenses shall be paid with funds from the account.any amounts remaining in the account on or after june,shall revert to the general fund,subd.d.
counsel for the jordan plaintiffs attorneys and the state entered into an agreement,entitled agreement to arbitrate amount of attorneys fees.the agreement recites that fees and expenses fees were awarded in the superior court and that award is the subject of an appeal by the state.rather than pursue that appeal and possible future proceedings in the superior court,the parties have agreed to submit the issue of fees to binding arbitration before a panel of three retired judges.the agreement set forth the terms and procedures for that arbitration.it provided attorneys may argue entitlement to any amount of fees on any theory they believe is supported by the facts and circumstances of the case.defendants may oppose the requested amount on any basis they deem appropriate.
the appeal from the million fee award was dismissed.
the arbitration panel determined the case was a common fund case.it further determined that percent of the total fund or is an appropriate award of fees and expenses to attorneys.
the state sought reconsideration of the award,contending it was unreasonable.the governor supported the request for reconsideration.in a reply brief,the state argued,for the first time,that section b set a limit on the award of million.
the arbitration panel denied the motion for reconsideration.it found no authority to reconsider the award and found no compelling reason presented to do so.
one of the arbitrators,retired chief justice malcolm lucas,dissented from the denial of reconsideration.although he was not prepared to conclude that the panel had erred in making the award,his tentative view was that the award might violate public policy for two reasons.first,if the state is correct that the legislature intent in enacting section,subdivision b was to allow an award of up to million,any award in excess of that amount is clearly contrary to public policy,to the amount intended and prescribed by the legislature.second,and perhaps even more troublesome,is that,as i note below,any award for legislative action prompted by plaintiffs counsel might be deemed to be compensation for sponsoring favorable legislation.any such award would violate,not just public policy,but also might be an unconstitutional gift of public funds.chief justice lucas also wondered whether the panel may have erred in awarding fees based on the entire fund,so that there was a of fees based on fees awarded a too handsome rate of per hour and overestimated the risk involved in a purely legal question that was not factually complex and required no protracted discovery.he concluded by observing the state may have grounds for holding fast to its current view that any award over million is in violation of section,subdivision b and is an unconstitutional gift of public funds.
the attorneys petitioned to confirm the arbitration award.the state petitioned for a writ of mandate to vacate the award or to vacate the arbitration award as it exceeded the panel powers and violated public policy.
independently,dean andal and donald wolfe collectively,andal brought an action to prevent the state from paying the arbitration award.in addition to an injunction or a writ of mandate to block payment of the award,andal sought a declaration that the last sentence of section b was unconstitutional and therefore both the arbitration agreement and award were void.
the trial court sustained the attorneys demurrer and dismissed the andal action.andal appealed from the judgment of dismissal.
the trial court vacated the arbitration award.it found it was an error of law to find a common fund in this case.such a finding was precluded by jordan,supra,th,d,and the refund account was the result of lobbying,not lawyering.the court found it was contrary to public policy to award a percentage of an appropriation to lobbyists and the refund account was a political decision,not in response to the attorneys activities.the decision to award attorney fees for the legislative remedy was in excess of the arbitration panel jurisdiction.there was no cap on the amount of fees that could be awarded,but the panel simply decided the wrong dispute.the award must be set aside.
attorneys appealed from the order denying the petition to confirm the arbitration award and the order granting the petition to vacate the award the state appealed from the portion of the order finding there was no limit on the arbitration award.we ordered all the appeals consolidated.
discussion 
the arbitration agreement provided this award shall be binding on all parties,and there is no right of appeal,collateral attack,or other review.arbitration awards are final and conclusive because the parties have agreed they should be so.moncharsh,supra,cal th,d.this expectation of finality strongly informs the parties choice of an arbitral forum over a judicial one.the arbitrator decision should be the end,not the beginning,of the dispute.citation.ibid.to ensure the arbitration decision is final and conclusive,only limited judicial review is available.courts may not review the merits of the controversy,the validity of the arbitrator reasoning,or the sufficiency of the evidence.id.at,d.indeed,an arbitrator decision is not generally reviewable for errors of fact or law,even if the error appears on the face of the award and causes substantial injustice.id.at,d.a n award reached by an arbitrator pursuant to a contractual agreement to arbitrate is not subject to judicial review except on the grounds set forth in code of civil procedure sections to vacate and for correction.id.at,d.
code of civil procedure section sets forth the bases on which a court shall vacate an arbitration award.a court shall vacate an award if it determines the arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted,at subd.a.an arbitrator exceeds his powers when he acts without subject matter jurisdiction national union fire ins.stites law d,d,decides an issue that was not submitted to arbitration california faculty superior court th,d pacific crown distributors brotherhood of teamsters d,arbitrarily remakes the contract pacific gas electric superior court th,d,upholds an illegal contract loving evans blick cal d,issues an award that violates a public policy city of palo alto service employees internat.union th,d,issues an award that violates a statutory right board of education round valley teachers cal th,d,fashions a remedy that is not rationally related to the contract advanced micro devices,intel cal th,d,or selects a remedy not authorized by law marsch williams th,d appointing receiver luster collins th,d imposing economic sanctions to enforce award.in other words,an arbitrator exceeds his powers when he acts in a manner not authorized by the contract or by law.
in determining whether an arbitrator exceeded his powers,we review the trial court decision de novo,but we must give substantial deference to the arbitrator own assessment of his contractual authority.advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,fn,d,alexander blue cross of california th,d.
the powers of arbitrators derive from,and are limited by,the agreement to arbitrate.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.although code of civil procedure section permits the court to vacate an award that exceeds the arbitrator powers,the deference due an arbitrator decision on the merits of the controversy requires a court to refrain from substituting its judgment for the arbitrator in determining the contractual scope of those powers.citations.advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,d.
the arbitration agreement empowered the arbitrators to award attorney fees and expenses to plaintiff attorneys as a result of their efforts and success in the jordan litigation.the award was million in attorney fees,costs,and expenses in settlement of jordan,supra,th,d.since we can not review the arbitrators reasoning or the evidence moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d,we must conclude that the award does not exceed the arbitrators powers under the agreement.
the agreement to arbitrate,however,does not stand alone it was authorized by statute.both the agreement and the award make explicit reference to section b as the authority for the arbitration.the arbitration award states pursuant to california revenue and taxation code section,subdivision b,this arbitration panel awards of the smog impact fee refund fund,namely,the sum of inclusive of attorney fees,costs and expenses to claimants,in settlement of the case of jordan department of motor vehicles th,d.section b authorizes an arbitration award of the appropriate level of court costs,fees,and expenses in the settlement of the jordan case.
our fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.if there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.day city of fontana cal th,d.
the state contends the decision vacating the arbitration award must be affirmed for three reasons.the arbitrators were limited to deciding the amount of fees in accord with the jordan decision,supra,th,d,which eliminated a common fund theory of recovery.section b limited the award to million.an award in excess of million violates public policy.we agree that section b and public policy limit the award to million.
the state argues section b authorized an award of fees and costs for work on the jordan case,supra,th,d,but not a percentage of the fund later created by the legislature.the state contends that since it had a maximum exposure of million in the dispute over attorney fees,the statutory authorization of an arbitration award in settlement of this dispute was necessarily limited to million.
attorneys argue the legislature did not use settlement in the literal sense,noting that the jordan case,supra,th,d was not settled,but resolved by a final judgment.they contend there is ample evidence that the legislature was aware that attorneys sought more than million in fees and nothing in section b limits the award to million.attorneys provided evidence of their communications with legislators,indicating attorneys were seeking more than million in fees and that the legislators understood there was no cap on the amount the arbitrators could award.statements of individual legislators,however,are accorded little weight in construing a statute,as the court task is to ascertain the intent of the legislature as a whole.quintano mercury casualty cal th,d.
attorneys assert the lack of any limit on the amount of fees that could be awarded is shown by the language of the arbitration agreement,which provides attorneys may argue entitlement to any amount of fees on any theory they believe is supported by the facts and circumstances of the case.defendants may oppose the requested amount on any basis they deem appropriate.significantly,attorneys assert,the state never argued before the arbitrators that there was a limit under section b on the amount of fees that could be awarded.
further,attorneys argue there was no cap of million because the state exposure was not limited to that amount.although they did not appeal from the million fee award and they virtually conceded the fee award would have been reversed on appeal,they claim changed circumstances would have allowed a larger fee award on remand they contend they would have been entitled to a percentage of the common fund of the refund account established by the legislature.
california follows what is known as the american rule,which provides that each party to a lawsuit must ordinarily pay his own attorney fees.trope katz cal th,d.the american rule was codified in code of civil procedure section,which states in part except as attorney fees are specifically provided for by statute,the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,express or implied,of the parties case law has established certain nonstatutory exceptions to this rule,based on the inherent equitable powers of the court.serrano priest cal d,serrano iii.one of these,and the only basis attorneys offer for a fee award in excess of million,is the common fund doctrine.w hen a number of persons are entitled in common to a specific fund,and an action brought by a plaintiff or plaintiffs for the benefit of all results in the creation or preservation of that fund,such plaintiff or plaintiffs may be awarded attorney fees out of the fund.citations.ibid.
the bases of the equitable rule which permits surcharging a common fund with the expenses of its protection or recovery,including counsel fees,appear to be these fairness to the successful litigant,who might otherwise receive no benefit because his recovery might be consumed by the expenses correlative prevention of an unfair advantage to the others who are entitled to share in the fund and who should bear their share of the burden of its recovery encouragement of the attorney for the successful litigant,who will be more willing to undertake and diligently prosecute proper litigation for the protection or recovery of the fund if he is assured that he will be promptly and directly compensated should his efforts be successful.citations.estate of stauffer cal d.
application of the common fund in this case does not conform to these equitable underpinnings.the attorneys fees would not be paid out of the recovery and borne by all who benefited.those who paid the smog impact fee receive a refund of the entire amount plus interest and any penalty.no portion of their recovery is used to pay attorney fees.any unencumbered amount remaining in the refund account on or after june,reverts to the state general fund,subd.d.thus,the attorney fees are paid by the state,not by the beneficiaries of the attorneys action.
the common fund doctrine is applicable only where plaintiffs efforts have effected the creation or preservation of an identifiable fund of money out of which the fees will be paid.serrano iii,supra,cal d at.in serrano iii,plaintiffs sought attorney fees under the common fund doctrine for litigation resulting in a judgment that required equalization of spending in california public schools.in denying fees under this theory,the supreme court observed the judgment itself had not created any fund.any additional monies available for public education as a result of the judgment will flow from legislative implementation of the judgment,not from the judgment itself.id.at.plaintiffs relied on a finding that the litigation resulted in an annual pool of million and it was likely further sums would become available.again,however,we point out that any such increases in the total educational budget,while they may be termed a response to our serrano decisions,are by no means required by them.it is for the legislature to determine,in its conjoined political wisdom,whether the achievement of that degree of equality of educational opportunity which is required by the state constitution is to be accompanied by an overall increase in educational funding.ibid.italics in original.
the creation of the refund account,while in response to the jordan litigation,was not required by the jordan litigation.in jordan,this court held the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in ordering refunds for those who had paid the smog impact fee.jordan,supra,th at,d.the effect of the judgment was a declaration that the smog impact fee was unconstitutional and refunds of for the four plaintiffs.id.at,d.the decision to create the refund account and provide refunds for all who paid the smog impact fee was the independent policy decision of the governor and the legislature,in their conjoined political wisdom.as the jordan decision makes clear,no court could order the refunds.id.at,d.the statute of limitations for many of the claims had expired the claims could only be revived by legislative action.the decision to create the refund account and provide refunds for all flowed from legislative implementation of the judgment,not from the judgment itself.serrano iii,supra,cal d at.
attorneys contend serrano iii does not preclude a common fund fee award where a discretionary fund is created by the legislature.first,they distinguish serrano iii on its facts.in serrano iii,plaintiffs sought equality in education,not monetary relief.further,they sought to have the fees paid by the state,not out of the money appropriated in response to the litigation.serrano iii,supra,cal d at.these factual distinctions,while they make the case against a common fund fee award even stronger in serrano iii,do not change the supreme court requirement that a common fund fee award is appropriate only where the judgment creates or preserves the fund.while attorneys sought a refund for all who paid the smog impact fee,the refund was not the result of the litigation but of separate legislation in response to the litigation.since plaintiffs efforts have not effected the creation or preservation of an identifiable fund of money out of which they seek to recover their attorneys fees,the common fund exception is inapplicable.serrano iii,supra,at.
attorneys next contend that serrano iii must be read in the context of settled fee jurisprudence.they contend they are entitled to claim credit for benefits that are conferred as a result of the litigation,even if not required by the court judgment.they cite to california cases that applied this catalyst theory in the context of determining the successful or prevailing party for purposes of attorney fees under code of civil procedure section,the private attorney general statute.folsom butte county of governments cal d,californians for responsible toxics management kizer d.wallace consumers cooperative of berkeley,d.we have no quarrel with the proposition that in determining attorney fees under code of civil procedure section,it is appropriate to consider whether plaintiffs lawsuit induced the legislative response,or was a material factor or contributed in a significant way to refunds for all who paid the smog impact fee.californians for responsible toxics management kizer,supra,at.nor do we dispute that attorneys are entitled to fees under the private attorney general statute.however,since these cases address a different theory supporting an attorney fee award,they are not useful in interpreting serrano iii,supra,cal d.
attorneys contend the causation principles articulated in these statutory fee award cases are equally applicable to common fund awards.they cite to bank of america cory d.cory.in cory,taxpayers sought to compel the controller to enforce the unclaimed property law code civ,et against banks who were retaining accounts that should have been turned over to the state.the controller initially opposed the lawsuit,but switched sides and made successful claims against the banks.the result of the lawsuit was the creation of a common fund.id.at.the taxpayers sought attorneys fees from this fund and the controller opposed the fee award,arguing taxpayers counsel was unnecessary as the attorney general represented the depositors and the people of california.the court rejected this argument as specious the taxpayers were the moving force behind the entire action.id.at.although the court in cory spoke of the causal connection between the taxpayers suit and the controller enforcement of the unclaimed property law id.at,cory was a case in which the fund was created by the lawsuit and thus is consistent with serrano iii.further,the cory court stressed that attorney fees should be paid out of the common fund,by reducing the beneficiaries share thereof.those benefiting from the recovery of the fund,in this case some depositors and eventually the people of the state of california,must bear their share of the cost of litigation.fees for taxpayers attorneys will be deducted from the judgment,and each claimant share reduced proportionately.cory,at.as discussed above,those who benefit from the smog impact fee refund account are not bearing any share of the cost of litigation or the attorneys fees those fees will be borne solely by the state.awarding a common fund fee in this case,therefore,is not compatible with the equitable underpinnings of the doctrine.
we recognize that other jurisdictions have awarded a common fund fee where the fund was not created by the litigation.for example,in kerr killian,a class of taxpayers sought refund of state income taxes paid on their federal retirement contributions.while the case was pending,the governor of arizona directed the department of revenue to make refunds to all taxpayers who had filed timely refund claims.id.at.the appellate court held it was proper to award attorney fees under the common fund doctrine although the fund was not created by settlement or court order.id.at.in in re prudential ins.america sales litigation cir,a class action lawsuit against an insurer alleging deceptive sales practices was settled and attorney fees were awarded under the common fund doctrine.the appellate court remanded the case for further examination of the extent to which the benefits of the settlement were created by class counsel.id.at.it rejected,however,an argument that the causation standards are different in statutory cases and common fund cases.id.at,fn.
we decline to follow these cases from other jurisdictions.first,in neither case is the award of a common fund fee incompatible with the equitable underpinnings of the common fund doctrine,as it is here.in the arizona tax refund case,the attorney fees were paid out of the fund by reducing the beneficiaries share of the fund.kerr killian,supra.in in re prudential ins.america sales litigation,supra,the fee award was part of the settlement it was opposed only by certain class members.further,while the arizona court and the third circuit are free to disregard the mandate of serrano iii that the fund be required by the lawsuit rather than merely a response to the lawsuit serrano iii,supra,cal d at,we are not.auto equity sales,superior court cal d.
the common fund doctrine was not available as a basis for attorney fees in this case.since attorneys offer no other basis for an award of over million in fees,the state exposure was limited to the existing million award.
the state contends a cap of million must be read into section b because otherwise the statute authorizes an arbitration award that is an unconstitutional gift of public funds.we agree.
section of article xvi of the california constitution provides that the legislature has no power to make any gift or authorize the making of any gift,of any public money or thing of value to any individual,municipal or other corporation the term gift in the constitutional provision includes all appropriations of public money for which there is no authority or enforceable claim,even if there is a moral or equitable obligation.conlin board of supervisors cal.an appropriation of money by the legislature for the relief of one who has no legal claim therefor must be regarded as a gift within the meaning of that term,as used in this section,and it is none the less a gift that a sufficient motive appears for its appropriation,if the motive does not rest upon a valid consideration.id.at.
it is well settled that the primary question to be considered in determining whether an appropriation of public funds is to be considered a gift is whether the funds are to be used for a public or private purpose.if they are to be used for a public purpose,they are not a gift within the meaning of this constitutional prohibition.citation.california teachers board of trustees d.
the settlement of a good faith dispute between the state and a private party is an appropriate use of public funds and not a gift because the relinquishment of a colorable legal claim in return for settlement funds is good consideration and establishes a valid public purpose.orange county foundation irvine d.the compromise of a wholly invalid claim,however,is inadequate consideration and the expenditure of public funds for such a claim serves no public purpose and violates the gift clause.id.at.
the settlement of the attorney fee dispute in this case is a public purpose.the question is whether there is a public purpose in paying more than the state established maximum exposure.we see no benefit to the public,only benefit to attorneys.the payment of a claim that exceeds the maximum exposure is akin to payment of a wholly invalid claim and violates the gift clause.orange county foundation irvine,supra,d at.because attorneys had no colorable claim to fees in excess of million,any payment over million serves no public purpose.
this conclusion does not mean any arbitration award that is legally insupportable is a gift of public funds.such a conclusion would undermine the state ability to submit claims to binding arbitration.an arbitrator is not constrained to decide disputes according to the rule of law and an arbitrator decision is not reviewable for errors of law.moncharsh,supra,cal th,d.for example,an attorney fee award of million in this case would not be legally supportable see ante,fn,but because million is within the amount in dispute,settlement by payment of such amount would not be a gift of public funds.the payment would be supported by adequate consideration,the relinquishment of a colorable legal claim.
this case is unusual in that the state maximum exposure was determined before arbitration by a trial court judgment from which only the state appealed.attorneys offer no valid basis upon which the award could be increased.where the state maximum exposure is established by a judgment,a payment of more than that maximum in settlement of the dispute,without independent consideration,is a gift of public funds.in fact,since there is no legal basis for such an award of attorney fees,it is,as chief justice lucas suggests,a payment for sponsoring favorable legislation.nothing in section b permits a payment for sponsoring favorable legislation its appropriation is limited to appropriate attorney fees and costs.therefore,the award is both against public policy and an unconstitutional gift of public funds.
if a statute is susceptible of two constructions,one of which will render it constitutional and the other unconstitutional in whole or in part,or raise serious and doubtful constitutional questions,the court will adopt the construction which,without doing violence to the reasonable meaning of the language used,will render it valid in its entirety,or free from doubt as to its constitutionality,even though the other construction is equally reasonable.citations.the basis of this rule is the presumption that the legislature intended,not to violate the constitution,but to enact a valid statute within the scope of its constitutional powers.miller municipal court cal d.
attorneys construction of section b,with no cap on the amount of the arbitration award,would mean the legislature authorized an unconstitutional gift of public funds.if so,the statute would be unconstitutional,as andal asserts.adhering to both the plain language of the statute and the presumption the legislature intended to enact a constitutional statute,we must construe section b as limiting the arbitration award for attorney fees to million.this construction does no violence to the language of the statute.rather,it conforms to the usual and ordinary meaning of the language used.when section b was enacted,only the state appeal from the million fee award was pending.an arbitration award in settlement of this dispute would reasonably be understood to be between and million.
in moncharsh,supra,cal th,at page,d,the supreme court cautioned a court should be reluctant to overturn an arbitrator award without an explicit legislative expression of public policy.in city of palo alto service employees internat.union,supra,th,d,the arbitration award ordered reinstatement of an employee who had made credible threats of violence at the workplace.the appellate court found this award conflicted with a injunction barring the employee from the workplace.obedience to judicial orders was unquestionably an important public policy,so the award violated public policy and the order confirming the award was reversed.id.at,d.
here,the arbitration award violates a clear expression of public policy.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.while the limitation on the arbitration award may not be explicit in section b,the prohibition against gifts of public funds is a clear public policy set forth in article xvi,section of the california constitution.
attorneys contend the state has waived the argument that the arbitrators exceeded their powers by awarding more than million because the state failed to make that argument to the arbitrators.
in moncharsh,supra,cal th at page,d,moncharsh contended the award was subject to judicial review because a portion of the contract containing the arbitration agreement was illegal.the high court rejected the claim that moncharsh had waived this contention.we thus hold that unless the party is claiming i the entire contract is illegal,or ii the arbitration agreement itself is illegal,he or she need not raise the illegality question prior to participating in the arbitration process,so long as the issue is raised before the arbitrator.failure to raise the claim before the arbitrator,however,waives the claim for any future judicial review.id.at,d.
in paramount unified school dist.teachers of paramount th,d paramount,a school district appealed from an order confirming an arbitration award directing the district to pay monetary damages to a former probationary teacher.the district claimed the teacher failure to comply with the claims requirement of the tort claims act barred the award.the court found to the extent this contention challenged the arbitrator application of law,it was not reviewable.to the extent it challenged the legality of the monetary award,the court found,relying on moncharsh,supra,cal th,d,it was waived for failure to raise it before the arbitrator.paramount,supra,at,d.the district contention that the award constituted a gift of public funds was preserved for appeal because it was raised before the arbitrator.id.at,d.
the moncharsh rule of waiver does not apply here.the state is not challenging the legality of all or any portion of the arbitration agreement,or the statute that authorized the arbitration.rather,it has offered an interpretation that avoids a constitutional problem.the state does not contend that any monetary award would be a gift of public funds it is only challenging the specific award made by the arbitrators.
the legislature holds public monies in trust for public purposes and the gift of public funds limitation in the constitution is directed to ensure that public funds are spent only on public purposes.conlin board of supervisors,supra,cal.at.therefore,in advancing the contention that an award of more than million is a gift of public funds and can not be allowed,the state seeks to protect not only its interests,but the interests of the public.more importantly,it is clear that neither the doctrine of estoppel nor any other equitable principle may be invoked against a governmental body where it would operate to defeat the effective operation of a policy adopted to protect the public.citation.wilson los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority cal th,d,see also,anyone may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for his benefit.but a law established for a public reason can not be contravened by a private agreement.
since the arbitration award violates the clear expression of public policy against gifts of public funds,the arbitrators exceeded their powers.the arbitration award of million can not stand.it is an unconstitutional gift of public funds and the arbitrators exceeded their powers in ordering the state to pay such an award.an award of a gift of public funds is not authorized by law the state could not agree to it,the legislature could not authorize it,and neither this nor any court could confirm it.
there are two remedies available when the arbitrators exceed their powers.the award shall be vacated if the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.code civ,subd.a.code of civil procedure section,subdivision b permits correction of an award when the arbitrators exceed their powers,if the correction can be achieved without affecting the merits of the decision.
in blue cross of california jones th,d,a dispute over health care benefits went to arbitration.the arbitrator awarded the policy holders expenses and attorney fees and ordered blue cross to pay for hours per day of home nursing care for their disabled son until his eighteenth birthday or death,whichever occurred first.the trial court granted the motion to confirm the award and denied blue cross motion to vacate the award.on appeal blue cross argued the arbitrators rewrote the health care agreements by ordering nursing care that could exceed the policies financial limits.id.at,d.the court ordered the award corrected to provide the medical benefits would not exceed the million limits of the policies.id.at,d.the court found the award could be corrected without affecting the merits of the controversy the correction merely restored the clear and undisputed financial limits to which the parties agreed.ibid.
here,a correction would do more than merely impose an undisputed cap it would drastically reduce the award from million to million.that section b limited the award to million was hardly undisputed.the attorneys position was that the award was not limited in any manner.our conclusion that there is a limit on the award supports the state argument that the common fund theory was inappropriate in this case.because the change to the award affects the parties arguments in the arbitration,a correction can not be made without affecting the merits of the decision.
