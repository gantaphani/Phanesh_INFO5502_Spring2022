this appeal arises from a judgment denying a petition for writ of administrative mandate.the case presents issues concerning the proper interpretation of the outdoor advertising act hereafter,the act lamar central outdoor,llc lamar filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate to vacate a decision of the california department of transportation department denying lamar application for a permit for an electronic message center placed next to a public highway the trial court denied lamar writ petition,and entered judgment in favor of the department.lamar appeals.we affirm.
in,lamar built a wooden,static billboard next to highway rosedale highway in kern county pursuant to an outdoor advertising permit issued by the department.the billboard site is located in an unincorporated area of the county,just outside the city of bakersfield city limits.the billboard site is located in an area zoned for medium industrial uses,and is within feet of numerous business and commercial activities.
in august,lamar filed a permit application for an electronic message center at the site of its existing static billboard.this application did not reach the department.in september,lamar converted the western face of its static billboard to an electronic message center.the location of lamar electronic message center is approximately feet to the east of a electronic message center.lamar electronic message center consists of a flat screen messaging area with diodes or led.messages are alternated by changing the color of the led.evidence presented by the department in the trial court showed that,during a site visit in,five advertisements continuously cycled on lamar electronic message center.each message lasted about five seconds one entire cycle lasted about seconds,and then repeated.evidence presented by lamar in the trial court showed that messages on its electronic message center change less frequently than every four seconds,and do not blink or employ moving lights.lamar evidence also asserted that messages displayed on its electronic message center do not turn on or off,but this must be considered in context in that one message must necessarily turn off in order for a different message to turn on.the trial court found as a matter of law,that all electronic message centers which cycle through different advertising copy use lighting that is,by definition,intermittent.
in march,lamar submitted another permit application.in may,the department denied lamar permit application on the ground that its electronic message center was located within feet of two electronic message centers on the same side of highway.the department concluded that this spacing violated the act,specifically,section,subdivision d.
in may,lamar filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate seeking to vacate the department decision to deny the permit and to compel it to grant lamar application for a permit.the department filed a seeking injunctive relief ordering lamar to cease using its electronic message center.the parties tried the cause to the trial court in january,and the court took the matter under submission.shortly thereafter,the court issued a statement of decision which set forth the bases for ruling that lamar failed to meet its burden to show that the department denial of the permit application was unreasonable or legally incorrect.
in june,the parties executed a stipulation to dismiss lamar remaining causes of action and the department.the stipulation reads in part 
the parties wish to minimize further proceedings in the trial court and to proceed with lamar appeal on its petition for writ of administrative mandate as expeditiously as possible.to that end,the parties wish to facilitate issuance of a final judgment that expressly resolves all remaining causes of action.
the parties therefore have agreed to dismiss,without prejudice,lamar fourth,fifth and sixth causes of action and the department,also without prejudice italics added.
on july,the trial court entered an order on the parties stipulation.on the same date,the court signed and entered judgment in favor of the department on lamar writ petition.
lamar filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
appealability 
our court requested the parties to brief the issue of whether one final judgment had been entered in the action,given their stipulation that lamar would dismiss certain of its causes of action,and the department would dismiss its for injunctive relief,to facilitate issuance of a final judgment and proceed with lamar appeal on the merits as expeditiously as possible.the parties have submitted letter briefs arguing that the appeal is proper in that there are no claims still actually pending in the trial court,meaning the judgment on lamar petition for writ of mandate should be viewed as a final judgment in the action.see morehart county of santa barbara cal th,d.we find the judgment is appealable.
the parties acknowledge a line of published cases which have concluded that a dismissal without prejudice as here,coupled with a waiver of the statute of limitations not as here violate the one final judgment rule.see,don jose restaurant,truck ins.exchange th,d.the parties argue that this appeal should be treated differently because their stipulation to dismiss certain claims did not include any provision which would facilitate potential future litigation of the claims involved in the case.see abatti imperial irrigation dist.th,d.further,the department has represented to our court that,at present,there are no intentions to resurrect any of the dismissed causes of action.
in the absence of any saving language in the parties stipulation as to the claims dismissed by lamar and department,and given the department representation that it presently has no intentions to resurrect any claims against lamar,we are satisfied that no claims are legally alive between the parties see kurwa kislinger cal th,d,and that a final judgment exists supporting appellate jurisdiction.if either party hereafter commences litigation related to lamar message center,the propriety of that future action will be an issue for another court on another day.
ii.the statutory interpretation issues 
lamar contends the judgment on its writ petition must be reversed because the spacing requirement that the department and the trial court applied to lamar permit application for its electronic message center is the foot requirement prescribed by section,subdivision d,whereas the spacing requirement that truly governs by law is the foot or less requirement prescribed by section,subdivision d.we disagree.
a.a general history of the controlling legislation 
california has had a statutory scheme governing outdoor advertising adjacent to public highways since at least the early.see stats,ch.before that decade was out,the legislature had enacted a version of the act.see stats,ch.there were ensuing tinkerings over time,until,in,the legislature repealed the whole of the act and added the current version of the act found in the business and professions code.see stats,ch.in turn,it too has been changed by still more amendments.
the case before us today largely concerns amendments to the act in and in.in,the legislature enacted senate bill,affecting a single section of the act,amending section.stats,ch.in,the legislature enacted senate bill,an omnibus bill,affecting various sections of the act,as well as the public utilities code,streets and highways code,and vehicle code.stats,ch.as relevant to the current case,senate bill made changes to section and which we address below.
b.the governing statutes 
section establishes a general prohibition against advertising displays subject to specified exceptions,under prescribed statutory and regulatory controls,within a foot wide controlled area at the edge of interstate or primary highways in this state its introductory sentence provides notwithstanding any other provision of the act,no advertising display shall be placed or maintained within feet from the edge of the of,and the copy of which is visible from,any interstate or primary highway,other than any of the following,italics added.subdivisions a through e of section specify the types of advertising displays allowed within the controlled area adjacent to interstate or primary highways.subdivision a,for example,concerns directional or other official signs for natural wonders and scenic and historical attractions,and subdivision b concerns advertising displays advertising the sale or lease of the property upon which the displays are located.
a form of statute establishing such a foot wide controlled area for advertising displays at the edge of interstate and primary highways in this state has been on the books for almost years.see former,sub.b,added by stats,ex.sess,ch.in enacting laws of this nature,the legislature at one time declared that the regulation of advertising structures adjacent to any state highways was necessary to promote the public safety,health,welfare,convenience and enjoyment of public travel,to protect the public investment in such highways,to preserve the scenic beauty of lands bordering such highways,and to insure that information in the specific interest of the traveling public is presented safely and effectively,recognizing that a reasonable freedom to advertise is necessary to attain such objectives.id.subd.a.
as noted above,subdivisions a through e of section identify types of advertising displays allowed within the foot wide controlled area at the edge of primary highways.the same subdivisions also prescribe requirements for each such type of advertising display.one such type of allowed advertising display is found in section,subdivision d as enacted in by senate bill.section,subdivision d,allows message center displays that comply with all requirements of the act.further,section,subdivision d provides no message center display may be placed within feet of another message center display on the same side of the highway.italics added.
prior to,a message center display allowed by section was restricted to displaying advertising only for an business.see former,subd.stats,ch.with the enactment of senate bill,section was amended to remove the restriction on message centers to displaying advertising only for an business,in favor of a rule that generally allowed message center displays adjacent to interstate or primary highways.see stats,ch.at the same time,the legislature imposed the spacing requirement noted above that no message center display could be placed within feet of another message center on the same side of the highway.ibid.
section reads the provisions of section shall not apply to penalty segments that are located in business areas and which comply with section italics added.interestingly,the enactment of section see stats,ch,the legislative amendment of section,subdivision d,which,as noted above,opened the door for allowable message centers with general,not merely,advertising,but imposed a foot spacing requirement between message centers 
section establishes standards for advertising displays in business areas.this section states in addition to the advertising displays permitted by section to be placed within feet of the edge of the of primary highways,advertising displays conforming to the following standards,and not in violation of any other provision of the act,may be placed in those locations if placed in business areas italics added.section,subdivisions a through e,then set forth various standards for advertising displays in business areas,including spacing requirements that are less restrictive,than the foot spacing requirement in section,subdivision d,for message centers.the language of section uniformly refers to advertising displays there is no language in section that more specifically refers to message centers.
the parts of section that are most relevant to lamar current case are subdivisions b,d and e.subdivision b reads advertising displays in business areas may not be placed that are so illuminated that they interfere with the effectiveness of,or obscure any official traffic sign,device,or signal nor shall any advertising display include or be illuminated by flashing,intermittent,or moving lights except that part necessary to give public service information such as time,date,temperature,weather or similar information nor shall any advertising display cause beams or rays of light to be directed at the traveled ways if the light is of an intensity or brilliance as to cause glare or to impair the vision of any driver,or to interfere with any driver operation of a motor vehicle.
subdivision d provides no advertising display shall be placed within feet from another advertising display on the same side of any portion of or a primary highway that is a freeway no advertising display shall be placed within feet from another advertising display on the same side of any portion of a primary highway that is not a freeway if that portion of the primary highway is located outside the limits of an incorporated city and outside the limits of an urban area.no advertising display shall be placed within feet from another advertising display on the same side of any portion of a primary highway that is not a freeway if that portion of the primary highway is located inside the limits of an incorporated city or inside the limits of an urban area italics added.
subdivision e provides subdivision d does not apply any of the following advertising displays permitted by subdivisions a to c,inclusive,of section.the minimum distance between signs shall be measured along the nearest edge of the pavement between points directly opposite the signs along each side of the highway.
as noted above,section establishes a foot wide controlled area adjacent to interstate or primary highways in our state,and provides that no advertising display shall be placed in this controlled area unless it complies with the requirements specified in section,subdivisions a through e.section is the starting point for all matters arising under the act.notwithstanding any other provision of the act,no advertising is allowed in the controlled area other than those specified in section.
section,subdivision d allows message center displays in the controlled adjacent to interstate and primary highways.at the same time,section,subdivision d subjects such displays to the following spacing requirement no message center display may be placed within feet of another message center display on the same side of the highway 
the stipulated,undisputed facts in the administrative record establish that lamar is applying for a permit for a message center display,that its message center display is located within the foot wide controlled area at the edge of an interstate or primary highway,and that lamar message center display is located less than feet from an message center display on the same side of the highway.up to this junction of the law and facts,we do not see any error in the trial court judgment.the language of section,subdivision d is plain and unambiguous as to message center displays next to public highways.unless its language may be avoided,it controls.voices of the wetlands state water resources control bd.cal th,d,discussing rules of statutory construction.there shall not be a message center display within feet of another message center display adjacent to a public highway.
to avoid this conclusion,lamar argues that its message center display is governed by section because the display is located in a business area and it does not violate a foot or less spacing requirement prescribed under section,subdivision d.lamar points to subdivision,subdivision e,which provides a rule for the non applicability of section,subdivision d,to advertising displays allowed by section.lamar argues that,if section,subdivision d does apply to its message center allowed by section,subdivision d,then too the spacing requirements of section,subdivision d control over the spacing requirements of section,subdivision d.the trial court did not adopt this interpretation of the statutory scheme,nor do we.
lamar correctly asserts that its message center display is located along a penalty segment of highway as defined by section,and in a business area as defined by section.building upon this foundation,lamar next invokes section,which provides that t he pro
