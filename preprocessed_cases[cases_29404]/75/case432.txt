plaintiff frederick tyrrell appeals the district court grant of partial summary judgment to defendant norfolk southern railway company.the lower court held that under the interstate commerce commission termination act iccta,the surface transportation board stb exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over rail construction preempts the ohio track clearance regulation upon which tyrrell based his negligence per se claim under the federal employers liability act fela.tyrrell argues that the district court erred as the federal railway safety act frsa is the proper statute for assessing whether the ohio track requirement is preempted.we reverse the district court decision and remand for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
background 
tyrrell worked as a trainman for norfolk southern at its railroad yard in bellevue,ohio.one night in,he was walking between tracks and when a car traveling on track struck him.as he fell,his right foot rolled under the car wheels.as a result of his severe injuries,his lower right leg was amputated.
tyrrell instituted an action against norfolk southern under the fela,et,alleging that the railroad failed to provide him with a safe place to work by negligently and carelessly using an unreasonably dangerous track clearance in violation of state law.norfolk southern moved for partial summary judgment,contending that the ohio track clearance regulation at issue was preempted under the iccta jurisdiction provision for the stb,b.the district court granted the railroad motion.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.see csx,city of plymouth,cir citing city mgmt.united states chemical,cir.summary judgment is appropriate i f the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.as a matter of law,statutory construction issues are reviewed de novo on appeal.see united states davis,cir citation omitted.
ohio requires that any new construction or reconstruction of main lines,passing tracks,and yard tracks involved in rail switching must provide at least feet of clearance between the centers of adjacent and parallel tracks.constructed after the promulgation of this requirement,the bellevue rail yard has a track clearance of feet and inches.fela provides that common railroad carriers engaged in interstate commerce are liable for damages to employees who suffer injuries due to the negligence of a carrier officers,agents,or employees or by reason of any defect or insufficiency in its cars,track,roadbed,or other equipment due to a carrier negligence.see.as tyrrell injuries arose from a workplace accident involving a track area that did not comply with ohio admin.code,he brought this fela action.
this case presents a statutory construction question regarding two federal railroad statutes and their preemptive effect on ohio track clearance regulation.in its summary judgment analysis,the district court classified ohio admin.code as primarily a construction requirement and limited its analysis to the iccta preemption provision,b,which provides the stb with exclusive jurisdiction to regulate rail carriers construction and operation of rail switches,side tracks,and facilities.the trial court also stated that even if it assumed the regulation addressed workplace safety,the iccta remained the proper statute for analysis as one of the express purposes of the act was to encourage safe and suitable working conditions in the railroad industry under.on this basis,the district court held that the iccta preempted ohio admin.code because its express preemption clause applies to state regulations impacting rail construction or rail safety.
in contrast,tyrrell,along with the united states and the stb as amici curiae,construe the state regulation as one dealing with rail safety,thus requiring analysis under the frsa preemption provision,which provides the federal railroad administration fra with the authority to regulate rail safety.for this case,the applicable preemption and saving clauses state that 
laws,regulations,and orders related to railroad safety shall be nationally uniform to the extent practicable.a state may adopt or continue in force a law,regulation,or order related to railroad safety until the secretary of transportation prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the subject matter of the state requirement.
emphasis added.tyrrell further argues that the district court broad interpretation of the iccta jurisdiction over rail construction under b repeals by implication the current federal and state rail safety regulatory system developed under frsa.this concern is shared by the united states and the stb.
in response,norfolk southern argues that the district court decision does not stand for the proposition that the iccta preempts frsa or any other federal statute dealing with rail safety.rather,it simply asserts the iccta authority to preempt state construction regulations like ohio admin.code in addition,norfolk southern argues that the core preemption question is not what the stated purpose of the state rail law is,but whether its effect falls within the iccta broad jurisdiction.for support,it cites csx,city of plymouth,d notice of appeal filed may,hereinafter plymouth ii.in plymouth ii,the district court examined a michigan train speed regulation under the iccta and the frsa.while the district court ruled that frsa preempted the state regulation to the extent it regulated rail safety factors like train speed,train length and air brake performance,it also held that b construction language preempted the state regulation as it required railroads to make substantial capital improvements.see plymouth ii,d at.norfolk southern thus interprets plymouth ii to mean that the ohio track clearance regulation is preempted because it affects rail construction and the iccta assigns the stb exclusive jurisdiction over rail construction.
in its amicus brief on behalf of the railway,the association of american railroads aar also emphasizes that both the iccta and frsa manifest an express congressional intent to preempt state law to establish national uniformity.as the stb can assert rail safety authority,the aar argues that the district court did not expand the stb jurisdiction or negate fra plenary rail safety authority.rather,the lower court correctly determined that the iccta preempted a state law that encroached on its statutory authority.
under the supremacy clause of the constitution,federal law preempts conflicting state law.however,there is a presumption against the supplanting of historic state police powers by the federal government unless preemption is the clear and manifest purpose of congress.see csx,easterwood,d cipollone liggett group,d.in expressing its preemptive intent,congress can supercede state law through explicit statutory language or implicitly through the statute structure and purpose.see cipollone,at.as this case presents two federal statutes containing explicit preemption clauses,the task of statutory construction must in the first instance focus on the plain wording of the clause s,which necessarily contain the best evidence of congress intent.easterwood,at.although the analysis of a preemption clause scope begins with its text,our interpretation of that language does not occur in a contextual vacuum.medtronic,lohr,d.the ultimate touchstone of preemptive effect is congress purpose.see id.at.in order to develop a fair understanding of congressional purpose,a reviewing court must study the preemption language,the surrounding statutory structure and regulatory scheme,and how congress intended to affect business,consumers,and the law through these combined factors.id.at.citing cipollone,at.opinion of stevens.
unfortunately in ruling on the motion for summary judgment,the district court did not have the benefit of federal agency input regarding the jurisdictional relationship between the iccta and frsa.as a result of this critical handicap,it did not achieve a reasoned understanding of the way
