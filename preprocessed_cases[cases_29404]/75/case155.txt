martin kosmynka was loading an vehicle atv onto a trailer when the vehicle climbed the far wall of the trailer,flipped over,and rendered kosmynka paralyzed.kosmynka and his wife sued the atv manufacturer,defendant polaris industries,polaris,on theories of strict products liability,negligence,and breach of implied warranty.polaris now appeals from a judgment entered after a jury trial in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york wexler,awarding kosmynka and his wife christine kosmynka million in damages.the jury found in favor of polaris on the strict products liability and breach of warranty claims,but found that polaris negligently designed the vehicle or failed to provide adequate safety warnings.
polaris appeals on the grounds that i it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law,and ii the verdict was inconsistent because a product defect is as the jury was properly charged an element of the claims for negligent design and negligent failure to warn.we reject the argument that polaris is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.but we conclude that the jury verdict was inconsistent,and that polaris preserved its objection to the inconsistency.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case for retrial 
background 
when an appeal comes to us after a jury verdict,we view the facts of the case in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.promisel first am.artificial flowers,cir.
in the summer of,kosmynka purchased a new drive polaris sportsman atv sportsman from his local polaris dealer,towing it home on a tilt bed trailer essentially a seesaw on wheels,which he had previously bought for general yard and garden work.the trailer was not purchased with walls or side boards so kosmynka retrofitted it himself.
on october,kosmynka neighbor,who had the identical vehicle,borrowed the trailer in order to take his sportsman to the polaris dealership for servicing.after the neighbor unsuccessfully tried to get the vehicle onto the trailer,kosmynka took over.after engaging the drive switch and selecting the gear for additional traction,kosmynka applied the thumb throttle and attempted to ease the vehicle up the trailer bed.seconds later,the vehicle front wheels start ed climbing the front of the boards of the trailer the sportsman then tipped over backwards and landed on top of kosmynka,rendering him paralyzed.
the polaris owner manual contained no instruction about how to load or unload the vehicle onto any trailer then again,kosmynka did not recall reading any sections whatever of that manual.
the kosymnkas lawsuit proceeded to a jury trial.
after the presentation of evidence,the district judge instructed the jury on negligence,strict products liability,and breach of implied warranty.the court charge paralleled the new york pattern jury instructions,as did the verdict sheet,which contained interrogatories on each theory of liability,on contributory negligence,on the fault chargeable to each party,and on damages.
the jury found that i polaris was negligent in the design of the atv or in the failure to adequately warn of dangers in using the atv ii the atv was not defectively designed and polaris adequately warned of the dangers of operating the atv and iii polaris did not breach its implied warranty to plaintiff after apportionment of percent of the fault to polaris and percent to kosmynka,the award in favor of plaintiffs totaled million.
immediately after the verdict was read,counsel for polaris requested a sidebar and advised the judge with the jury still empaneled that the negligence and strict liability findings were inconsistent.as counsel explained,the jury had misapplied the court negligence charge by finding polaris negligent even though the product was found not defective 
it was i nconsistent that the jury would find negligence but no defect because an element of the negligence claim is that the product had to be defective plus an additional element,that the defect existed by reason of the defendant not using the reasonable care.that the difference between strict liability and negligence,they would have had to show,to find strict liability,that the y did use reasonable care.
so it was possible to find defect and negligence,but you ca find negligence but no defect.there still would have had to have been a defective product for them to find negligence.
counsel for both sides explained to the court that the jury could be,because the jury was still empaneled.the court concluded,however,that was impracticable the jury already ha s the charge in front of them.the court also declined to declare a mistrial.consequently,the court allowed the verdict to stand,entered judgment,and denied polaris subsequent motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial.
discussion 
polaris argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because i it neither owed nor breached a duty to protect kosmynka from a risk that was not reasonably foreseeable and ii plaintiffs failed to prove that polaris negligence was the proximate cause of kosmynka injury.
under rule a,judgment as a matter of law is proper only when a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.a jury verdict should be set aside only where there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture,or such an overwhelming amount of evidence in favor of the movant that reasonable and fair minded men could not arrive at a verdict against him.song ives,cir ellipsis in original quoting mattivi african marine,cir.
under new york law,which applies in this diversity action,see gasperini ctr.for humanities,d,a negligent tortfeasor is liable for any reasonably foreseeable risk that is proximately caused by its action.see di ponzio riordan,see also codling paglia,a manufacturer can fairly be said to know and to understand when an article is suitably designed and safely made for its intended purpose.a lthough virtually every untoward consequence can theoretically be foreseen with the wisdom born of the event,the law draws a line between remote possibilities and those that are reasonably foreseeable because n o person can be expected to guard against harm from events which are so unlikely to occur that the risk would commonly be disregarded.di ponzio,at,citations omitted see also palsgraf long island,the risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed,and risk imports relation it is risk to another or to others within the range of apprehension.there must be knowledge of a danger,not merely possible,but probable.macpherson buick motor.
within limits,negligence is a question of fact best left to the jury.see,ugarriza schmieder,t he very question of negligence is itself a question for jury determination.palsqraf,at,the range of reasonable apprehension is at times a question for the court,and at times,if varying inferences are possible,a question for the jury.
to prove negligent design,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the product defect was a substantial factor in causing the injury,see fritz white consol,internal quotation marks and citation omitted,and that it was feasible to design the product in a safer manner,voss black decker,a defendant can rebut such a showing by presenting evidence that the product as designed is a safe is,one whose utility outweighs its risks when the product has been designed so that the risks are reduced to the greatest extent possible while retaining the product inherent usefulness at an acceptable cost.id.at.practical engineering feasibility can be demonstrated by expert testimony concerning either a prototype that the expert has prepared or similar equipment using an alternative design that has been put into use by other makers.rypkema time,d,referencing new york law.
a manufacturer has a duty to warn against latent dangers resulting from foreseeable uses of its product of which it knew or should have known.a manufacturer also has a duty to warn of the danger of unintended uses of a product provided these uses are reasonably foreseeable.liriano hobart,collecting cases internal citations omitted.
plaintiffs assert that the sportsman was defective in two ways i that it was defectively designed in such a way that it would climb steep vertical surfaces and backward on top of its operator,and ii that it failed to contain adequate safety warnings of the danger of such a foreseeable consequence.plaintiffs also argue that each defect was a proximate cause of kosmynka injury.while we find the evidence insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a finding of defect on a theory of defective design,a colorable argument can be made that a rational juror could conclude that the product was defective because of a failure to warn of a foreseeable danger.at trial,the jury considered,inter alia,the following evidence 
the expert testimony of william medcalf a design expert,who i proposed as a reasonable alternative design the use of a tilt switch or kill switch,which would cut power to the sportsman wheels if the vehicle climbed too steep a slope or accelerated too rapidly and ii conceded that a no reasonable alternative design could have prevented kosmynka accident without impairing the capabilities of the sportsman b no atvs on the market feature tilt switches,likely because they are not a practical,feasible design for the purposes for which atvs were intended in off road riding c he had never installed or tested a tilt switch on any atv and d no tilt switch could have prevented kosmynka accident,because such a device can not immediately halt the power running to the drive train or instantaneously stop forward momentum.
the expert testimony of kris kubly an expert in the fields of mechanical engineering and atv riding,testing,and accident reconstruction,who stated that i atvs are operated over a wide variety of terrain,including hills,ravines,short rock ledges,logs,streams,trails,and similar obstacles and ii the sportsman could rise to an incline of approximately degrees before it starts to be on the verge of tipping over.
the testimony of mitchell johnson the director of a polaris technology center,who stated that i the sportsman was equipped with a few warnings as to the maximum,recommended incline on which the vehicle should be,degrees ii any atv that approached a wall with the throttle open would climb the wall and iii that a conventional,drive atv by a japanese manufacturer that encounters a wall or obstacle would climb that wall or obstacle,respectively.
the expert testimony of kenneth laughery a warnings expert,who stated that i it is not an open and obvious hazard that a demand drive atv is capable of climbing a vertical wall or vertical object ii the vehicle owner manual failed to warn about the atv ability to climb a vertical wall and roll while in drive iii it would have taken no more than a page or two to provide an adequate safety warning iv he knew of no atv manufacturer whose manuals or labels contained any such warning and v he was aware of no empirical study demonstrating that such warnings effectively modify driving habits.
the inability of medcalf and laughery to identify an accident in which an atv tipped over while being loaded onto a trailer,and the fact the time of kosmynka had sold drive atvs and had received no complaints of caused by an atv front wheels climbing the front wall of a trailer.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that polaris was negligent in its design of the sportsman plaintiffs introduced no reasonable alternative design that would have made the sportsman safer without materially impairing the vehicle utility.indeed,plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the installation of a tilt switch which was never tested by any of plaintiffs experts on any atv would have been practical or would have prevented the accident.see voss,at.
it is a closer call as to the adequacy of the sportman safety warnings.a manufacturer has a duty to warn against latent dangers resulting from foreseeable uses of its product of which it knew or should have known,and of the danger of unintended but reasonably foreseeable uses of its product.see liriano,at.on the one hand,polaris knew that of the sportsman would use their vehicles to navigate obstacles,forge streams,climb and descend steep inclines,and the like and that would have to load and unload their atvs onto and from various types of trailers.on the other hand,while polaris knew of the potential of similar drive atvs climbing walls and flipping over,they also had had no reports of their demand drive vehicles doing so.
the jury was instructed to consider both negligence claims so,we can not determine how or to what extent the jury finding of negligence was based on the evidence of polaris failure to warn versus the evidence concerning design the jury may or may not have considered that kosmynka accident was of a potentially broader class of mishap in which a demand drive atv climbs any vertical surface touched by the exposed front wheels,such as a boulder,log,snowbank,garage wall.
we therefore conclude that there was not such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture.ives,at citation omitted.accordingly,we uphold the district court denial of polaris motion for judgment as a matter of law.
in the alternative,polaris argues that it is entitled to a new trial because the jury rendered an inconsistent verdict,having found on the one hand that polaris was negligent and on the other that there was no defect in the sportsman design or warning.we agree that the jury verdict was inconsistent and that a new trial is required.
we review the grant or denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion.song ives,cir.such a motion ordinarily should not be granted unless the trial court is convinced that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result or that the verdict is a miscarriage of justice.hygh jacobs,cir quoting smith lightning bolt,cir.when a jury returns a verdict by means of answers to special interrogatories,the findings must be consistent with one another,as they form the basis for the ultimate resolution of the action.crockett long island,cir.if the jury answers can not be harmonized rationally,the judgment must be vacated and a new trial ordered.id.quoting brooks brattleboro memorial,cir.
plaintiffs point out that polaris urged the district court to declare a mistrial,and thus failed to satisfy its duty as the dissatisfied party to make sure that the jury was not discharged until the jury ha d had a chance to reconsider its verdict,and to seek affirmatively to the jury of any anomaly it could have corrected.plaintiffs contend that this conduct amounted to waiver of any argument that the verdict was inconsistent.we disagree.
polaris brought the inconsistency to the court attention at the earliest possible moment polaris sought and was granted a sidebar conference after the jury foreman announced the verdict and before the jury was polled.at that juncture,the court had the option of curing the inconsistency while the jury remained empaneled.sometime later,after the jury was excused though still in the jury room,and after the court acknowledged that it could not improve on the jury charge,the parties were asked what should be done and plaintiffs advocated reinstruction while polaris advocated a mistrial.the court rejected both of these options and thought it best to leave the issue to the court of appeals 
polaris may i ask how the court would instruct the jury as to this inconsistency that our threshold problem 
the court i do know.
how do you recommend we send it back to the jury on the inconsistency 
polaris i do not believe,your honor,that there is a way,practically,to instruct the jury how to resolve the inconsistency.i think under the circumstances the only choice is to declare a mistrial.
the court in view of the clear directions to me given by the parties,one does say anything and one wants a mistrial,i going to let it stand,and i excuse the jury,and that the reason that we have the second circuit.
it is we
