the united states customs service customs appeals the judgment of the court of international trade granting summary judgment in favor of sl service,sl service sl,united states,d.int l trade.because the court of international trade erroneously applied texaco marine services,united states,texaco,we reverse.
background 
between november and december,the pacific,a ship owned by sl service,was at the hongkong united dockyards for the purpose of obtaining american bureau of shipping and united states coast guard required inspections and modifications,which are,in addition to dutiable repairs.upon returning to the united states,customs assessed a duty pursuant to a,which states that t he equipments,or any part thereof,including boats,purchased for,or the repair parts or materials to be used,or the expenses of repairs made in a foreign country upon a vessel documented under the laws of the united states shall be liable to entry and the payment of an ad valorem duty on the cost thereof in such foreign country.emphasis added.
as part of this assessment,customs determined that the cost of should be considered an expense of repair because it was necessitated by the dutiable repairs as well as the inspections and modifications.customs did not,however,impose the ad valorem duty on the full cost of.instead,it determined that only that portion of the cost of attributable to the dutiable repairs should be used to calculate the duty.this amount was determined by dividing the cost of dutiable repairs by the sum of the cost of dutiable and work.the cost of was then multiplied by this fraction,resulting in an estimation of the cost of due to the dutiable repairs.the ad valorem duty was applied to this amount.
after having timely protested the liquidation to customs,sl service brought this challenge in the court of international trade claiming that the duty imposed on violated the but for test prescribed by texaco and that the apportionment technique was contrary to section a.in addition,sl service argued that customs violated c by failing to provide notice and receive comment about the use of apportionment.having stipulated that the pacific was for no longer than necessary to complete the inspections and modifications,both parties moved for summary judgment.
the court of international trade granted summary judgment in favor of sl service.it found that texaco delineated two categories of expenses for the purpose of a.the first category,considered expenses of repairs and therefore dutiable,would not be incurred but for the undertaking of dutiable repairs.the second category,expenses,referred to those expenses incurred for the purpose of obtaining only inspections and modifications as well as those required by both dutiable and work expenses.based on this reading of texaco,the court determined that the duty was arbitrary,capricious and in violation of the law because the of the pacific was necessitated by both and dutiable work.as such,it was a expense not subject to section a.
on appeal,customs contends that the court of international trade interpretation of texaco is too narrow and in contravention of the language and purpose of a.customs claims that the holding in texaco applies only to expenses incurred as the result of either or dutiable work expenses,but not to expenses.further,it argues that section a,a statute enacted to protect the domestic shipbuilding and repair industry,should not be interpreted in a manner that would allow artful to avoid virtually all duties on expenses of foreign repairs.
discussion 
this case raises two questions whether that is required by both dutiable and work is an expense of repair and whether customs use of apportionment is permissible.with respect to both,we answer in the affirmative.
we review a grant of summary judgment by the court of international trade de novo.new zealand lamb,united states.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.int l trade c.c.
the crux of the error below was the court misinterpretation and resulting misapplication of texaco,in which we were asked to decide whether cleaning performed subsequent to dutiable repairs and work associated with protective coverings used during dutiable repairs were expenses of repairs and,therefore,dutiable.at.we determined that the expenses at issue were dutiable because they would not have been incurred but for dutiable repairs.id.at.in so holding,we announced the following test expenses of repairs covers all expenses which,but for dutiable repair work,would not have been incurred.id.
the most obvious difference between the facts here and those in texaco is that texaco dealt with expenses while the of the pacific was a expense.as such,the but for test,which was formulated for classification of expenses,is inapplicable.sl service counters that texaco did,in fact,consider expenses.it relies on a footnote in texaco,which states 
although it appears that some cleaning of the cargo tanks to prepare them to carry cargo would have been necessary even if the repairs had not been made,it also is true that all the debris mentioned in the invoice was created by the repairs.in this regard,the invoice does not indicate that the cleaning included the cleaning of the remains of previous cargo.in any event,texaco has made no effort to separate from the total g expenses amounts that would have been incurred to clean the cargo tanks as a normal maintenance service had the repairs not been made.
at.sl service extrapolates from this that we specifically considered expenses because we noted that the petitioner in texaco could have differentiated the expenses at issue but chose not to.our observation,however,did nothing to change the nature of expenses at issue,all four of which were expenses.id.at.it is irrelevant to our determination of the dutiability of expenses that texaco could have argued that the cleaning expenses were necessitated by both dutiable and work.the precedential force of texaco applies only to expenses.this is equally true with respect to service,united states,because it addressed the same type of expenses considered by texaco.
sl service also submits that the discussion in texaco of united states geo hall coal,cir,establishes that the but for test applies to expenses.at.according to sl service,the section referring to geo hall coal held that was not a dutiable expense when it is required by inspections and modifications.this contention,however,is not supported by either case.
first,there is no evidence that the dutiable repairs in geo hall coal required.the only information available to us now,or in texaco,was contained in an unpublished opinion of the department of treasury board of general appraisers,which did not specify the type of dutiable repairs performed or whether they necessitated.the decision stated only that is not always an expense of repairs because dutiable repairs are made.for instance,may be required by the inspections and modifications,but not by the dutiable repairs.therefore,it is just as likely that the outcome in geo hall coal is consistent with our holding here.second,geo hall coal addressed a jurisdictional question only,aff,cir.there were no findings with respect to the dutiability of.finally,the discussion in texaco is consistent with the fact that the dutiable repairs in geo hall coal did not require.at.according to texaco,the board held that the expense was not subject to the vessel repair duty because the board found that the expense would have been incurred irrespective of whether or not dutiable repairs were performed.id.at.this does not imply,as sl service contends,that is never dutiable when required by inspections and modifications.it merely reiterates that the in geo hall coal was required by the inspections and modifications and would have been needed whether or not the dutiable repairs,which did not necessarily require,were performed.
the history of the but for test instructs that special treatment is required when concurrent and independently sufficient acts combine to cause harm.see page keeton et,prosser and keeton on th
