this case centers on the admin per se laws where the dmv suspends a drivers license when a motorist has been arrested for drunk driving before the motorist has had the benefit of a trial in a court of law.it does not involve a criminal prosecution for drunk driving.as we explain below,because the admin per se law operates in a summary fashion,the dmv is required to show that the motorist had a certain amount of blood alcohol percent at the time he or she was driving.and that requires a valid chemical test.
of course,a jury in a court of law could certainly conclude in a criminal prosecution that a driver was intoxicated based on such indicia as slurred speech and an unsteady gait without a valid chemical test.and trial judges,even in a case of a first offense,have always had the power to suspend a driver license as a condition of probation see.but before the dmv can summarily suspend a license without court proceedings it must have the definite evidence of a valid chemical test showing blood alcohol while driving of at least percent.as the dmv itself is well aware,some symptoms of intoxication can occur below the percent threshold.the legislature,however,has not authorized administrative suspension without substantial evidence the motorist was driving with at least that amount of alcohol in his or her blood.
background 
john baker was arrested for drunk driving and had his driver license suspended.he challenged the suspension in an administrative hearing conducted by the dmv.at the hearing baker presented uncontroverted evidence that the orange county crime lab which analyzed his blood sample had not complied with state regulations requiring such labs to have new alcohol testing procedures on file with the state department of health services the new procedures used by the lab involved a larger glass vial and more sodium fluoride as a preservative.at the administrative hearing,there was uncontroverted expert testimony to the effect that the combination could result in a false high.the dmv did nothing to show that the test was otherwise reliable.even so,the dmv refused to reinstate baker license.
baker then sought relief in the trial court.he brought a petition for a writ of mandate,seeking an order requiring the reinstatement of the license.the petition was denied by the trial judge,based on circumstantial evidence other than the suspect blood test.specifically,at the time of his arrest baker had exhibited an unsteady gait,bloodshot eyes,slurred speech,a smell of alcohol,and there was a port wine stain on his clothing.
this test evidence is important because,given the crime lab failure to comply with the state regulations,the burden then shifted to the dmv to show that the test was still reliable.see davenport department of motor vehicles th,d if the licensee shows that official standards were in any respect not observed,the burden shifts to the dmv to prove that the test was reliable despite the violation.having failed to carry that burden,the upshot is that the dmv had no substantial evidence with which to conclude that baker blood alcohol level was percent or greater at a time while he was driving.
that is,unless the unsteady gait,the bloodshot eyes,the slurred speech,the odor of alcohol and the wine stain could,by themselves,suffice to establish that baker had or greater while he was driving.
the case thus quickly devolves to this question can a given amount of level be established without a valid chemical test by evidence of behavior or indicia typically associated with intoxication,such as,like here,slurred speech,bloodshot eyes,or an unsteady gait the dmv claims that mckinney department of motor vehicles th,d and jackson department of motor vehicles th,d provide an affirmative answer to the question.
no.they do.there is language in both cases which can be read for the proposition that circumstantial evidence apart from a chemical test might establish a given level,but that language is not only dicta,but unsupported dicta.in the jackson case,in fact,one of the authorities cited by the court would require the opposite conclusion.
the mckinney case arose out of the sloppy draftsmanship of a dmv form used by arresting officers.see mckinney,supra,th at,d.the form merely asked the officer to say that at such and such a date and time,he or she had reasonable cause to believe that a certain driver was arrested for driving under the influence.ibid.the court noted that by focusing on the time of the arrest,the form omitted any material as to the time the motorist was driving under the influence.as the mckinney court pointed out,the form was illogical an arresting officer certainly knows when he or she made the arrest.see ibid.what the form should have asked the officer to state is that at such and such a time,the officer had reasonable cause to believe the driver was driving under the influence of alcohol.id.at,d.
seizing on the deficiency of the form,the arrested motorist in mckinney argued that there was no evidence that his blood alcohol level was at the time he was driving,even though a subsequent chemical test,an intoxilyzer,conducted less than an hour and later,showed two blood alcohol readings of and.mckinney,supra,th at,d.
most of the opinion was taken up establishing the point that the dmv hearing officer could validly infer from the motorist condition at the time of his arrest that he had more than alcohol in his blood at the time he was driving.see mckinney,supra,th at,d.the second part of the opinion tackled the issue of whether the dmv had the burden of establishing the admissibility of the chemical test under the kelly frye standard.see id.at,d.
the passage which supports the dmv position here is found in the third part of the opinion in the last substantive paragraph.see mckinney,supra,th at,d.there,the court noted that one of the elements necessary for the suspension of the license is that the motorist blood alcohol level be at least.the court then declared,without further analysis,that the element was abundantly established,both by the breathalyzer test readings and the arresting officer personal observations.ibid.
the declaration would be have nothing more than an ipse dixit had the court not appended to it a footnote.the footnote began with this paragraph while a chemical test result is usually relied upon by the hearing officer as decisive,we point out that it is not the only means of establishing that a driver bal was or more.mckinney,supra,th at,fn,d.
next followed this sentence,impliedly offered as support for the preceding sentence as our supreme court has noted,what the legislature has prohibited is driving a vehicle with a rate over the prescribed limit,not driving when a chemical test shows it to be over the limit,original emphasis.that statement,of course,is otherwise unremarkable.
the next sentence,however,then leapt to this conclusion thus,both parties are free to introduce circumstantial evidence bearing on whether the driver bal exceeded the permissible level.mckinney,supra,th at,fn,d.for this statement the mckinney court cited burg municipal court cal d,footnote.
burg was a supreme court tour de force opinion written in response to a challenge to california having adopted the scandinavian model of drunk driving law.see burg,supra,cal d at.california had recently defined its penal drunk driving law in terms of having a certain blood alcohol level and the defendant in burg argued that the law was unconstitutionally vague.his theory was that a motorist usually can not know precisely how much alcohol is in his or her blood.see id.at.
the burg court,of course,rejected the defendant idea.footnote in burg,relied on by the mckinney court,was itself the tag end of a passage the gravamen of which was a refutation of the defendant contention that the state had unconstitutionally created a presumption of guilt.see burg,supra,cal d at.the burg court refuted the contention by saying,in the text,that the prosecution still had to prove,at the time a motorist was driving,his or her blood alcohol exceeded the defined amount.id.at.footnote was appended after that comment.burg,supra,cal d at,fn.
