background 
patents in suit 
the three patents at issue in this case relate to drive trains for hybrid electric vehicles.in a conventional automobile,the wheels are driven using torque rotational force supplied only by an internal combustion engine ice or engine.in hybrid electric vehicles,on the other hand,the wheels are driven using torque supplied by an ice,an electric motor,or a combination of the two.this adds an additional layer of complexity because the relative torque contributions of the ice and the electric motor must be combined and controlled.
to that end,the drive train disclosed in the patent employs a microprocessor and a controllable torque transfer unit cttu that accepts torque input from both the ice and the electric motor 
as shown in figure of the patent,illustrated above,the ice output shaft and the electric motor output shaft extend into the cttu housing and terminate at bevel gears and,respectively,each of which mesh with two other bevel gears,and.
in this embodiment,bevel gears and are equipped with locking devices for setting the gears rotational freedom,if any,relative to the housing.patent,ii.in one mode of operation the microprocessor locks the bevel gears,causing the housing and the drive shaft to rotate about their horizontal axes in response to any torque provided by the output shafts of the ice or electric motor or both.id.at.in this locked mode of operation,the two shafts rotate at the same speed,although the amount of torque provided by the individual shafts may differ.see id.the cttu microprocessor,by virtue of its ability to control the amount of torque provided at each shaft,is able to control the relative amounts of torque transferred from the ice and the electric motor to the drive shaft.see id.at,ii.the microprocessor is able to do so by holding the inputs constant and merely sending control signals to the locking devices.for example,if the ice is disengaged and not providing any torque while the bevel gears are locked,there is a transfer of torque from the electric motor output shaft,through the cttu,to the drive shaft.in another mode of operation differential mode,however,the microprocessor releases the bevel gears such that they are free to rotate.patent,ii.if the ice is disengaged in this mode,there is a transfer of torque from the motor output shaft,through the cttu,to the drive shaft.
claims and of the patent are relevant to this appeal.because claim depends from claim,and because the issues we must decide do not implicate the additional limitation of claim,only claims and are reproduced below

id.at,emphasis added.
the drive train of the and patents differs from the drive train of the patent in that it employs a than a combine the torque contributions from the ice and the electric motor.as illustrated in figure of the patent illustrated below,torque from electric motor is directly transferred to differential and therefore to the wheels.torque from ice,on the other hand,is only indirectly transferred to the wheels because output shaft of the ice is routed through clutch.
consequently,when the clutch is disengaged,the electric motor is the sole source of torque transferred to the wheels.when the clutch is engaged,however,torque provided by both the ice and the electric motor is transferred to the wheels.another difference from the drive train of the patent is that the drive train of the and patents use road load to determine the proper combination of torque from the ice and the electric motor 
accused devices 
at issue in this appeal are hybrid electric vehicles sold by toyota.toyota first commercial hybrid electric vehicle,the prius i,was sold in japan beginning in and in the united states beginning in.in,toyota began marketing a,the prius ii.the drive train or transaxle unit of the prius is also present in another form in the toyota highlander and lexus rx is similar to the drive trains described in all three patents in suit in the sense that it,too,combines torque from an ice with torque from an electric motor or the traction motor.however,instead of combining these torques using the patent s lockable bevel gears or the and patents clutch,toyota drive train is designed around a planetary gear unit or device,having a central sun gear that meshes with several planetary gears supported by a planetary carrier,which in turn mesh with a peripheral ring gear 
as may be appreciated from the following depiction of toyota drive train,the output shaft from the ice is connected to the planetary carrier and thus to the planetary gears,whereas the output shaft from is connected to the ring gear.the toyota design also employs an additional having an output shaft connected to the sun gear.
as with the microprocessor in the drive train,a microprocessor associated with toyota drive train is able to control the amount of torque provided by both the ice and.unlike the transfer of torque through the cttu described in the patent,however,the transfer of torque through toyota planetary gear unit can not be varied of the torque provided by the ice to the planetary carrier is always transferred to the ring gear.that fraction of the ice torque is then combined with of the torque provided by.as such,toyota microprocessor is only able to vary the amount of torque output to the drive shaft by varying the ice torque inputs holding those inputs constant results in a constant torque output.
ii.district court proceedings 
paice initiated the instant action against toyota on june,by filing a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas alleging three counts of count for each patent in requesting,inter alia,compensatory damages and a permanent injunction.on september,the district court issued a written opinion construing dozens of disputed claim terms.paice llc toyota motor,claim construction opinion.of primary importance to the issues on appeal is the court construction of controllable torque transfer unit the cttu limitation as a device or component that is controlled to transfer variable amounts of torque.id.slip op.at.
on december,the district court commenced a jury trial during which both sides presented extensive evidence.paice theory of the case,put before the jury largely through the expert testimony of steven nichols,was that the planetary gear unit,the arrangement,and the shaft leading to the counter drive gear of toyota drive train satisfies the cttu limitation.
see.in particular,nichols stated that the structure is a device or component it accepts inputs at the planetary carrier from the ice output shaft and at the ring gear from the output shaft that is controlled to transfer variable amounts of torque the microprocessor dictates the amount of torque sent from each input,and ultimately output to the drive shaft.see.
toyota offered its own theory to the jury,largely through the expert testimony of edward caulfield.according to caulfield,toyota planetary gear unit only accepts torque input from the ice.percent of that input torque is then output to the ring gear.the combination of the fractional ice torque with the torque from does not occur until after the fractional ice torque is output from the planetary gear unit to the ring gear.therefore,caulfield opinion was that toyota drive train does not satisfy the district court construction because there is no single device or component that can be characterized as.see caulfield further testified that toyota drive train does not satisfy the cttu limitation because the flow of torque through the planetary gear unit can not be altered from the split discussed above,and therefore,can not be controlled to transfer variable amounts of torque.
at the end of the evidentiary presentation,the case was submitted to the jury.the jury concluded that toyota drive train lacks a literal cttu,but infringes claims and of the patent under the doctrine of equivalents,see the jury found no infringement of the other asserted claims.based on those findings,the jury awarded to paice as a reasonable royalty.
on january,toyota filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol seeking to overturn the jury limited finding of infringement.paice filed its own motion for jmol,seeking to overturn the jury finding of no literal infringement with respect to claims and of the patent,claim of the patent,and claims and of the patent.the court denied both motions.
paice also moved for a permanent injunction to prevent toyota from making,using,offering for sale,and selling within the united states the accused vehicles.in addressing that motion,the district court followed the traditional test mandated by the supreme court recent decision in ebay mercexchange,d a plaintiff must demonstrate that it has suffered an irreparable injury that remedies available at law,such as monetary damages,are inadequate to compensate for that injury that,considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant,a remedy in equity is warranted and that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.with respect to irreparable injury,paice argued that the absence of an injunction would have an adverse effect on its ability to license the patented technology.the court rejected this argument,however,noting that paice had only adduced vague testimony that the company was sidelined in its business dealings during litigation.paice llc toyota motor,docket,slip op.at,wl.the court also pointed to evidence in the record suggesting that paice inability to reach an agreement with chrysler,for example,was due to public misrepresentations paice allegedly made about its relationship with chrysler,and was not due to the absence of an injunction.id.moreover,since paice does not actually manufacture any goods,the court concluded that there was no threat that paice would lose name recognition or market share without an injunction.id.slip op.at.
intertwined with its consideration of irreparable injury was the court analysis of the adequacy of monetary damages.given the relatively small reasonable royalty awarded by the amounted to approximately per accused comparison to the overall value of the vehicles,the court concluded that monetary damages would suffice.id.the adequacy of monetary damages was further bolstered,in the court opinion,by the fact that paice had offered a license to toyota during the period.id.slip op.at.
with regard to the balance of hardships,paice contended that it faces extinction without an injunction,whereas toyota would suffer only minor economic losses.this contention was rejected by the court because,in its view,an injunction against toyota would disrupt related business,such as dealers and suppliers could have an adverse effect on the burgeoning hybrid market and might damage toyota reputation.id.slip op.at.the court further concluded that paice extinction argument was unsound because it was based on the rejected premise that only injunctive relief of the type requested will lead to a successful licensing program.consequently,the court held that the balance of hardships favored toyota.id.lastly,the court determined that the public interest favored neither party.id.accordingly,the court denied paice motion for a permanent injunction.id.slip op.at.however,rather than leaving the parties to their own devices with respect to any future acts of infringement,the court imposed an ongoing royalty of per prius ii,toyota highlander,or lexus vehicle sold by toyota during the remaining life of the patent and entered final judgment.paice llc toyota motors,docket,slip op.at.
toyota appeals the denial of its jmol motion,and paice both the denial of its jmol motion,as well as the ongoing royalty imposed by the district court we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
iii.standard of review 
federal rule of civil procedure a provides that a court may grant a motion for jmol only where there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the.we review the district court denial of a motion for jmol without deference,applying the same standard employed by the district court.honeywell,int l hamilton sundstrand,en banc.under this standard,we can reverse a denial of a motion for jmol only if the jury factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence or if the legal conclusions implied from the jury verdict can not in law be supported by those findings.cybor fas,en banc.
the decision to grant or deny permanent injunctive relief is an act of equitable discretion by the district court,reviewable on appeal for abuse of discretion.ebay.at.
iv.discussion 
toyota appeal 
we first address the issues raised in toyota appeal of the district court denial of the motion for jmol of noninfringement of claims and of the patent.according to toyota,the jury finding of infringement of those claims under the doctrine of equivalents must be overturned for three reasons.we disagree.
sufficiency of the evidence 
first,toyota argues that the expert testimony of nichols was legally insufficient to support a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.although nichols testified before the jury for a day and a half,toyota claims that the vast majority of his testimony was directed to literal infringement.specifically,toyota argues that nichols explicitly marked the end of his extensive literal infringement testimony by answering in the affirmative when asked whether t he opinion that he had expressed thus far relate d to literal infringement.immediately thereafter,toyota contends,nichols explicitly transitioned to his equivalence testimony by again answering in the affirmative when asked whether he had also formed an opinion with respect to the doctrine of equivalents.id.
following his answer to that question,the following brief exchange took place before the jury between counsel for paice and nichols 
so,assuming that the controllable torque transfer unit is not literally infringed,have you found that the accused vehicles satisfy this limitation under the doctrine of equivalents 
yes.it is my opinion that they do.
c ould you describe that for us by reference to the slide that we see on the screen,slide 
well,this particular slide is the doctrine of equivalents analysis for the controllable torque transfer unit.i will say that i do believe that it is literally there.however,it provides the function that is to be provided.it provides controllable and variable amounts of torque from two sources to the drive wheels,and i believe that consistent with the claim construction of the court.
the way in which it does that is it controls a set of gears to receive torque from two input shafts and transfer torque to the drive wheels.
and what the result 
a.the results are the vehicles control to direct torque flow between the motor,the engine and the drive 
id.the slide referenced by counsel for paice contained a grid with three rows,with one row corresponding the function of the cttu,one row corresponding to the way in which the cttu performed that function,and one row corresponding to the result the cttu achieved and two columns,one corresponding to the patent and the other corresponding to the accused toyota vehicles.in each of the grid six boxes,a red check mark indicated the presence of the in both the cttu and the accused toyota vehicles.this,toyota says,was the extent of nichols testimony on the subject.
we have stated that a patentee must provide particularized testimony and linking argument with respect to the function,way,result test when such evidence is presented to support a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.inst.cypress semiconductor,emphasis added.generalized testimony as to the overall similarity between the claims and the accused infringer product or process will not suffice.id.under this standard,nichols testimony was plainly sufficient.a careful review of the entire transcript from that portion of the trial evinces that the bulk of nichols testimony was not limited to literal infringement.while it is true that the excerpts pointed to by toyota ostensibly draw a figurative line in the sand separating testimony concerning literal infringement from that concerning equivalence,we do not read nichols testimony to say that every word he uttered from the time he took the stand until the moment he transitioned to the doctrine of equivalents related only to literal infringement.rather,nichols gave a substantial amount of over seventy pages of the technology disclosed in the patents and the inner workings of the accused vehicles transaxle units before he even discussed the topic of infringement at all 
now,nichols,now that we discussed some of the components in the patents,could we turn to your infringement analysis 
it was with his answer to this question that nichols indicated to the jury that his infringement testimony was officially beginning.and it was to this starting point that nichols was referring a short time later when he answered in the affirmative to the question,t he opinion that you expressed thus far,does that relate to literal infringement.
another infirmity in toyota argument is that,even if we were to agree that nichols did in fact draw some sort of line in the sand with his answer to that question,in so doing he did not thereby render his literal infringement analysis irrelevant to his subsequent equivalence analysis.our particularized testimony standard does not require nichols to his testimony at square one when transitioning to a doctrine of equivalents analysis.indeed,we think it desirable for a witness to incorporate earlier testimony in order to avoid duplication.the fact that nichols did not explicitly do so does not mean he did not implicitly incorporate his earlier testimony.thus,we reject any notion that nichols equivalence testimony is strictly limited to the few lines pointed to by toyota.
toyota also argues that nichols other testimony can not be used to support the jury verdict due to the absence of any linking argument to tie such testimony to the analysis of the cttu.again,we find toyota characterization of nichols testimony inaccurate.for example,on the morning of december,and before he turned to his literal infringement analysis,nichols demonstrated the operation of an actual accused vehicle transaxle unit to the jury,and in so doing he explained 
okay.and when you say its input,what is it that you talking about as being input,nichols 
a.we have torque input from the engine,torque input from,combined torque output to the drive wheels,controllably combined to give you variable torque on the output to drive the wheels.
emphases added.later that same morning,referring to slide,nichols explained to the jury that the accused vehicles transaxle units provide the function that is to be provided,controllable and variable amounts of torque from two sources to the drive wheels.emphases added.thus,within a close proximity of time,nichols first demonstrated and explained operation of an actual accused device to the jury,and then linked that demonstration and explanation to the function of the cttu.our review of the record reveals that nichols testimony was similarly sufficient with respect to linking the way and result prongs.
nonetheless,toyota criticizes nichols for allegedly failing to identify any specific structure in the accused vehicles transaxle units corresponding to the cttu.in particular,toyota claims that paice equivalence argument is supported by nothing more than nichols g eneralized testimony as to the overall similarity between the claims and the accused infringer product.see appellants br.quoting,at.this argument is specious in light of the fact that counsel for toyota spent a substantial portion of his time on cross examination asking nichols to help draw a box on a diagram around the exact portion of toyota drive train he identified as corresponding to the cttu.see.to now suggest on appeal that the jury was never shown specific structure is simply incorrect.compare appellants br.indeed,nichols was never asked at trial to identify any alleged equivalent structure in connection with his equivalents analysis,with questions by badenoch exactly what device in this diagram of the toyota prius transaxle schematic,what are you nichols calling now the controllable torque transfer unit in your opinion and can you nichols just go over that one more time so that i can draw a box to make sure i got it right.
toyota also argues that nichols fail ed to acknowledge any differences between the cttu claim limitation and any component or components alleged to be equivalent in order to explain why and how such differences are insubstantial.appellants br.we are unaware of any such acknowledgement requirement in the context of the test,and toyota does not cite any case law standing therefor.in any case,nichols was called as a rebuttal witness to answer caulfield testimony.with respect to the question of whether toyota accused cttu is device or component,nichols testified 
now,nichols,did you also hear caulfield testify yesterday about where the torque from,i say intersects the ring gear and where is it,in your understanding,that caulfield said that takes place 
a.if i understand him correctly,he takes the position,actually this plus this plus other elements are all one shaft and as a result it is not an input it sort of an flowby and there is no input shaft in.if i understand his testimony.
do you agree with this testimony,nichols 
well,it certainly a novel approach.
and what is it you mean by a novel approach 
it not true.
so,you do not agree with it 
no this is a ring gear.without this,the planetary gear unit does not exist.it not a ring gear shaft,a shaft ring gear.it a ring gear.
i will add one other thing.if,in fact,it does flow on the outside somehow,which it does not,this is not a dumb device.this would be a very smart device that somehow would have torque flow around the outside of a ring gear which is not a ring gear but a shaft.it simply does not make sense to me.
trial tr,december.
and with respect to the question of whether toyota accused cttu is controlled to transfer variable amounts of torque,nichols testified 
q.we heard a lot of testimony about the percent torque split within the planetary gear unit.i just want to confirm it.do you agree or disagree that the torque split always occurs in the planetary gear unit 
yes.it steady state,that the torque split and it been consistent on four or five or six people giving testimony.we all agree on that split of steady state.
and yet you still have reached the conclusion that you reached,nichols,regarding whether the planetary gear unit in the toyota accused vehicles is a controllable torque transfer unit 
and how have you reached that in light of the fact that there is a fixed split within the ring gear itself 
well,i believe everyone that given testimony has agreed that can provide power independently through the planetary gear unit,although there may be some arguments whether it through or somehow around the planetary gear unit.everyone agreed,and the engine can provide it and then provide it in different combinations.
this rebuttal testimony,in conjunction with the testimony given during each side case in chief,provided the jury with an ample basis upon which to evaluate the insubstantiality of the differences between the cttu limitation and the accused structure.
criticism of prior art 
the second reason toyota contends that the jury equivalence verdict can not stand relates to paice criticism of two patents issued to berman et and assigned to trw,patent the patent and the patent collectively,both patents describe a hybrid drive train similar to those in the accused vehicles in that the drive train design employs an ice,a traction motor,and a generator coupled to a planetary gear unit.see patent.however,unlike toyota drive train,the drive train has two modes of operation,one being designed for lower speeds and the other being designed for higher speeds.see,id.at,ii.although the design employs various controllers containing transistors and other electronic circuitry,see id.at,there is no controlling microprocessor choosing the most appropriate mode of operation.
the written description of the patent describes the design as providing a more promising parallel hybrid approach than other prior art,patent,but it nevertheless points to disadvantages of the design compared to the invention 
the present invention relates to such a parallel hybrid vehicle,but addresses certain substantial deficiencies of the berman et al design.for example,berman et al show two separate electric powered by the internal combustion engine to charge batteries and to drive the vehicle forward in traffic.this arrangement is a source of additional complexity,cost and difficulty,as two separate modes of engine control are required,and the operator must control the transition between the several modes of operation.further the gear train shown by berman et al appears to be quite complex and difficult to manufacture economically 
id.at,ii.emphases added.given this criticism and disavowal of in the written description,toyota argues that its drive are allegedly based on the configuration of the prior art patents can not be captured by paice invocation of the doctrine of equivalents.
this court has addressed the effects of criticism and disavowal in several cases.for example,in scimed life systems,advanced cardiovascular systems,the technology at issue related to b alloon dilatation catheters used in coronary angioplasty procedures to remove restrictions in coronary arteries.such catheters were made in one of two configurations the dual or adjacent lumen configuration,or the coaxial lumen configuration.id.the question on appeal was whether the merely specified that the two lumens be separate were limited in scope,either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents,to the coaxial lumen configuration.analyzing the claim language in light of the written description,we held,inter alia,that the patentee had distinguish ed the prior art on the basis of the use of dual lumens and had point ed out the advantages of the coaxial lumens used in the catheters that were the subjects of the patents in suit.id.at.we read this as support ing the conclusion that the claims should not be read so broadly as to encompass the distinguished prior art structure.id.we further explained that the most compelling portion of the specification was the patentee statement that the coaxial configuration is the basic sleeve structure for all embodiments of the present invention contemplated and disclosed herein.id.at quoting the written description.we were thus led to the inescapable conclusion that the separate limitation was literally limited in scope to the coaxial configuration.id.at.
relying again on the patentee criticism of the prior art and the all embodiments statement,we arrived at the same conclusion with respect to equivalent claim scope.however,our analysis turned on a narrower rationale 
the principle articulated in several cited cases is akin to the familiar rule that the doctrine of equivalents can not be employed in a manner that wholly vitiates a claim limitation.see hilton davis chem,d athletic alternatives,prince,specific exclusion principle is a corollary to the all limitations rule.thus,if a patent states that the claimed device must be nonmetallic,the patentee can not assert the patent against a metallic device on the ground that a metallic device is equivalent to a device.the unavailability of the doctrine of equivalents could be explained either as the product of an impermissible vitiation of the claim limitation,or as the product of a clear and binding statement to the public that metallic structures are excluded from the protection of the patent.t he foreclosure of reliance on the doctrine of equivalents in such a case depends on whether the patent clearly excludes the asserted equivalent structure,either implicitly or explicitly.
id.at.thus,because the patentee had clearly exclude d one of only two possible structures,competitors and the public were free to draw the reasonable conclusion that the patentee was not seeking patent protection for catheters that used a dual lumen configuration.id.at.
this court was confronted with a similar fact pattern in gaus conair,where the technology at issue related to a safety mechanism that prevents fatal shocks to users of electrical appliances such as hairdryers due to immersion of the appliance in water.in particular,the safety mechanism of the patented invention employed protective circuitry designed to detect the invasion of water before any such water could reach the components of the appliance itself.id.at.the safety mechanism of the accused appliance,however,would not react until water reached the components of the appliance.id.at.this would result in the user experiencing a brief,but shock.id.ironically,we noted,one of the principal advantages of the claimed invention over the prior art touted in the patent specification was the invention ability to protect the user from such a shock.id.at.thus,we held that the patentee criticism of this prior art characteristic amounted to a surrender of claim scope that the patentee could not reclaim by invoking the doctrine of equivalents.id.at see also dawn equip.farms,holding that statements in the written description touting the ability of the patented invention to overcome disadvantages in the prior art strongly suggest,if not mandate,judgment in the defendant favor where the accused products suffered the very same disadvantages.
in this case,toyota analogizes the patent criticism of the design to the criticism of prior art discussed in scimed,gaus,and dawn equipment.we disagree.as the written description of the patent reveals,the primary disadvantage of the design is its control system,which relies upon a human operator to select the mode of operation.patent,ii.t he operator must control the transition between the several modes of operation.paice overcame this disadvantage by using a microprocessor to determine the most appropriate mode of operation based on its monitoring of control inputs from the driver,as well as several other variables.id.at,ii.toyota drive trains use a microprocessor in the same manner as the patent,the microprocessor determines the most appropriate mode of operation based on its monitoring of control inputs from the driver,as well as several other variables.therefore,the patent discussion of the design disadvantages does not preclude the application of the doctrine of equivalents to toyota accused transaxle units.
to be sure,the written description of the patent does point out that the gear train appears to be quite complex and difficult to manufacture economically,ii.however,to the extent paice drew a distinction between its design and the design,the distinction is clearly secondary and equivocal at best.moreover,it is far from obvious which portion of the gear train is supposed to be quite complex and difficult to manufacture economically.paice may have been referring to the arrangement of the motors,engine,and planetary gear set,or to the control system described in the patents.the intrinsic evidence simply does not provide any resolution to this ambiguity.consequently,this is not a case like scimed where the patentee selected one configuration for all embodiments of the invention to the exclusion of the only other known configuration.nor is this a case like gaus or dawn equipment where the patentee touted the invention improvements over the very same subject matter sought to be recaptured under the doctrine of equivalents.thus,we find nothing in the written description of the patent that amounts to a disavowal sufficient to overturn the jury finding of infringement.
in spite of the differences between the design and toyota design,toyota argues that paice is bound by various statements it made equating the design to toyota design.according to toyota,paice disavowal of the design relative to the limitations of the claims acts as a disavowal of toyota accused transaxle units.in the written description of the patent,paice distinguished toyota prius i transaxle unit which also uses a planetary gear unit to combine torque 
various articles describe several generations of toyota motor company hybrid vehicles,stated soon to be available commercially toyota describes this vehicle as a hybrid regardless of the label applied,its powertrain appears to be similar to that of the berman patents described above,that is,torque from either or both of an internal combustion engine and an electric motor are controllably combined in a mechanism and transmitted to the drive wheels through a planetary gearset providing the functionality of a transmission.
patent,ii.emphases added.this statement,however,merely acknowledges what we have already observed,that both designs utilize a planetary gear unit to output combined torque.that observation does not imply that the and prius i designs are identical relative to the limitations of the claims.indeed,the written description of the patent touts the advantages of its design over both the design of the patent and the planetary gear unit design of the prius id.at,ii,ii.this is entirely consistent with the jury finding that toyota planetary gear unit design infringes the design of the patent but not the design of the patent.
to further buttress its argument that paice equated the design with the accused drive trains and disclaimed them,toyota cites a host of extrinsic evidence,including a paice business plan explaining the cost disadvantages of the design,a confidential document written by paice founder alex severinsky describing t he toyota hybrid drive as an exact copy of the design,an article quoting a of the patent as describing the toyota tms system to be a copy of the design,a page from paice marketing materials asserting that the toyota prius is the realization of the trw patent,an email from severinsky to toyota stating that paice technology is quite opposite to your prius,and the following notations hand written by severinsky in the margin of an article describing the prius i 
notations read this is trw not toyota and this is trw invention 
although the parties disagree as to whether extrinsic evidence may give rise to a disavowal of subject matter,we need not address this point.simply put,we reject toyota contention that paice statements equating the design to toyota design amount to a complete disavowal of the accused transaxle units.
admissions by counsel 
the third and final reason toyota urges us to overturn the jury finding of infringement relates to a portion of the opening statement made to the jury by counsel for paice 
and keep in mind that toyota can cut off damages tomorrow.toyota can make sure they never have to pay paice another cent by doing what by going back to the prius i and do use severinsky high current invention anymore and stop using road load.
emphasis added.according to toyota,this is a binding judicial admission by paice that the prius i does not infringe any of the patents in suit.in toyota opinion,the undisputed evidence established that the structural configurations of the accused vehicles are the same as the prius i for purposes of determining infringement.appellants br.therefore,toyota argues,this admission necessarily implies that none of the accused vehicles infringe.
the district court agreed with toyota to a certain extent,and held that the above statement constitutes a binding admission that prius i does not infringe the.paice llc toyota motor,docket,slip op.at.the district court noted,however,that the jury did not consider whether the claim limitations were met equally by the prius i as the prius ii.id.slip op.at.therefore,the district court disagreed that the evidence established that the structural configurations of the accused vehicles are the same as the prius i for purposes of determining infringement.instead,the court concluded,there is sufficient evidence underlying the jury verdict and that verdict should not be overturned based on the conclusory admission by plaintiff counsel.id.slip op.at.
in effect,the district court treated the statement as merely an evidential opposed to a conclusive the jury was free to weigh against the other evidence adduced at trial see pickens equitable life assurance soc y,cir holding that a district court properly treated an admission as evidential and submitted it to the jury for consideration.in light of what we view as tenuous logic in toyota argument,and the conclusory nature of the admission itself,we think the district court acted well within the confines of its discretion by ruling as it did.
having rejected all three reasons set forth by toyota for overturning the jury finding of infringement,we hold that the district court did not err in denying toyota motion for jmol.
paice cross appeal 
we next address the issues presented by paice cross appeal,namely,the district court denial of the motion for jmol of no literal infringement of claims and of the patent,claim of the patent,and claims and of the patent and the district court imposition of an ongoing royalty of per prius ii,toyota highlander,or lexus vehicle subsequently sold by toyota.as with toyota appeal,we reject each of paice contentions with respect to infringement issues.with respect to the ongoing royalty,however,we are unable to determine whether the district court abused its discretion.accordingly,we must vacate a limited portion of the district court order and remand for further proceedings.
denial of jmol 
paice argues that the verdict of no literal infringement of claims and of the patent,which was based on the jury determination that the cttu limitation is not satisfied by toyota drive train,is unsupported by the evidence.with respect to toyota argument that the accused drive trains lack a device or component,paice points out that nothing in the district court claim construction prevents a single shaft from being both an input and an output shaft,or limit s the nature or the location of the input.appellee br.paice argument,however,misses the point of caulfield testimony.because the combination of the fractional ice torque with the torque does not occur until after the fractional ice torque is output from the planetary gear unit to the ring gear,there is no single device or component in toyota design that can be characterized as.although the jury,in light of its equivalence verdict,must have seen caulfield distinction as insubstantial,we believe that his testimony provided the jury with substantial evidence upon which to base its finding of no literal infringement of claims and of the patent.
paice further argues that the jury verdict of no literal infringement of claim of the patent and claims and of the patent,each of which contains a clutch limitation,is unsupported by the evidence.the district court construed the term clutch as a device that selectively permits or prohibits transfer of torque and rotation.claim construction opinion,slip op.at.according to nichols,the court construction is satisfied by a combination of the planetary gear unit,the ice shaft,the shaft leading from the ring gear to the drive sprocket,and the drive sprocket itself.this combination can be controlled either by,which is able to prevent torque transfer from the ice shaft to the drive sprocket by providing a counter torque at the ring gear sufficient to negate torque provided by the ice shaft,or by a parking pawl,which is simply a lock that prevents movement of the gears.however,because the court construction literally requires a device,not a number of devices to act as the clutch,caulfield explained that the planetary gear unit,as a single device,will always transfer any torque provided by the ice to the ring gear output,for clarity,torque gets out of the device,which is the planetary,and goes to the parking pawl,which is a couple of gears downstream.
once again,we believe this testimony provided the jury with substantial evidence upon which to base its finding of no literal infringement of claim of the patent,and claims and of the patent.therefore,we hold that the district court did not err in denying paice motion for jmol.
imposition of an ongoing royalty 
finally,we address the district court order,which allows toyota to continue using the invention of the patent at a cost of per accused vehicle the district court order reads 
defendants are hereby ordered,for the remaining life of the patent,to pay plaintiff an ongoing royalty of per infringing prius ii,toyota highlander,or lexus the infringing vehicles.royalties shall be paid quarterly and shall be accompanied by an accounting of the sales of infringing vehicles.payments shall begin three months after the date of signing this judgment and shall be made quarterly thereafter.the first payment shall include royalties for all infringing vehicles sold that were not accounted for in the jury verdict.payments not made within days of the due date shall accrue interest at the rate of,compounded monthly.plaintiff shall have the right to request audits.it is anticipated that the parties may wish to agree to more comprehensive and convenient terms.the parties shall promptly notify the court of any such agreement.the court maintains jurisdiction to enforce this portion of the final judgment.
paice argues that the district court did not have the statutory authority to issue this order,and that,even if the court did have such authority,paice was denied its right to a jury trial under the seventh amendment to determine the amount of the ongoing royalty rate 
we begin with the language of,which provides in relevant part 
the several courts having jurisdiction of cases under this title may grant injunctions in accordance with the principles of equity to prevent the violation of any right secured by patent,on such terms as the court deems reasonable.
perhaps the most apparent restriction imposed by is that injunctions granted thereunder must prevent the violation of any right secured by patent.we have previously held that this statutory language limits the scope of activities that may be enjoined.see,joy techs.flakt,holding that noninfringing acts may not be enjoined.the more difficult question raised by this case,however,is whether an order permitting use of a patented invention in exchange for a royalty is properly characterized as preventing the violation of the rights secured by the patent.
under some circumstances,awarding an ongoing royalty for patent infringement in lieu of an injunction may be appropriate.in shatterproof glass ford,this court upheld a royalty,based on sales,for continuing operations.although the parties in that case contested the amount of the royalty,styled a compulsory license by the court,there was no dispute as to the district court authority to craft such a remedy.see id.in the context of an antitrust violation,mandatory sales and licensing of relevant patents are forms of relief when necessary to an effective remedy,particularly where patents have provided the leverage for or have contributed to the antitrust violation adjudicated.united states glaxo group,d.
but,awarding an ongoing royalty where necessary to effectuate a remedy,be it for antitrust violations or patent infringement,does not justify the provision of such relief as a matter of course whenever a permanent injunction is not imposed.in most cases,where the district court determines that a permanent injunction is not warranted,the district court may wish to allow the parties to negotiate a license amongst themselves regarding future use of a patented invention before imposing an ongoing royalty.should the parties fail to come to an agreement,the district court could step in to assess a reasonable royalty in light of the ongoing infringement.
in this case,the district court,after applying the test for a permanent injunction and declining to issue one,imposed an ongoing royalty sua sponte upon the parties.but,the district court order provides no reasoning to support the selection of per infringing vehicle as the royalty rate.thus,this court is unable to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in setting the ongoing royalty rate.accordingly,we think it prudent to remand the case for the limited purpose of having the district court reevaluate the ongoing royalty rate.upon remand,the court may take additional evidence if necessary to account for any additional economic factors arising out of the imposition of an ongoing royalty the district court may determine that is,in fact,an appropriate royalty rate going forward.however,without any indication as to why that rate is appropriate,we are unable to determine whether the district court abused its discretion.hensley eckerhart,d it is important for the district court to provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award.the district court should also take the opportunity on remand to consider the concerns
