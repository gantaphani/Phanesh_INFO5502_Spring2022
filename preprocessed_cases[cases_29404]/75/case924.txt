the city of santa monica petitioner petitions this court for review of the federal aviation administration faa final agency decision and order concluding that petitioner ordinance banning certain categories of aircraft from operating at the santa monica municipal airport smo violates petitioner contractual obligations to the federal government.petitioner claims that it was arbitrary and capricious for the faa to conclude that petitioner was failing to make smo available for use on fair and reasonable terms and without unjust discrimination,to all types,kinds,and classes of aeronautical use.for the reasons set forth below,we reject petitioner contentions and deny the petition for review.
smo is a,regional public air port located in,owned,and operated by petitioner.smo has no scheduled passenger service,but serves general aviation aircraft and functions as a reliever airport for the los angeles international airport.smo serves four categories of general aviation aircraft category a and b aircraft those with approach speeds of less than knots at maximum landing weight and category c and d aircraft those with approach speeds of knots or greater at maximum landing weight.category c and d aircraft,which make up approximately seven percent of all operations at smo,are almost exclusively business and executive jets.
in,the santa monica city council enacted a resolution to close smo,triggering a flurry of litigation between petitioner,the faa,and several private parties.in,petitioner and the faa resolved their dispute by entering into a contract the agreement,in which they agreed to the following principles 
i the airport is to be open and available to and for public use as an airport on fair and reasonable terms,without unjust discrimination,and without granting any exclusive rights prohibited by law.
ii pursuant to the federal aviation act of,as amended,exclusive authority is vested in the faa for the regulation of all aspects of air safety,the management and control of the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace,and movement of aircraft through that airspace.
santa monica airport agreement at,hereinafter agreement.the parties also agreed that 
i the airport serves an important role in the regional and national system of air transportation and air commerce.it has a vital and critical role in its function as a general aviation reliever for the primary airports in the area.as a reliever facility the airport attracts and provides services to general aviation thereby diverting aircraft away from the air carrier airports and other heavily used airports in the greater los angeles area.study and analysis have confirmed this congestion and that other similar general aviation reliever airports in the area are already heavily used and do not have the ability to accept or absorb the service provided by santa monica airport.
id.at.the agreement specified that it would remain effective until july,and that petitioner would operate and maintain smo as a viable functioning facility without any derogation of its role as a general aviation reliever until that date.id.at.
between and,petitioner applied for and received million in federal funds through grant agreements between petitioner and the faa under the faa airport improvement program.the agreement was incorporated into those grant agreements,which further bound petitioner to certain grant assurances.of particular relevance to this case is grant assurance,which included the following two restrictions 
a the airport sponsor will make its airport available as an airport for public use on fair and reasonable terms and without unjust discrimination,to all types,kinds,and classes of aeronautical uses.
i the sponsor may prohibit or limit any given type,kind,or class of aeronautical use of the airport if such action is necessary for the safe operation of the airport or necessary to serve the civil aviation needs of the public.
grant agreement,santa monica airport at pt.v,june,hereinafter grant agreement.under the terms of the airport improvement program grants,the agreements between petitioner and the faa remain in effect throughout the useful life of the facilities developed or equipment purchased with the grant funds,but not to exceed twenty years from the date of the acceptance of the funds.id.at pt.v.although the parties dispute whether the grant assurances expire in or,the parties agree that they currently remain in effect.
in july,the santa monica airport commission voted to recommend to petitioner a revised aircraft conformance program that would reserve smo for the exclusive use of category a and b aircraft.this action provoked a long series of meetings,discussions and negotiations between petitioner and the faa that continued until.on march,petitioner adopted an ordinance adding section to the city of santa monica municipal code ordinance,which prohibits any person from operating a category c or d aircraft from landing or departing smo except in emergencies.see santa monica,municipal code.
believing that the ordinance violated petitioner obligations under the grant agreements to make smo available for public use on fair and reasonable terms and without unjust discrimination,to all types,kinds,and classes of aeronautical use,grant agreement at pt.v,the faa took action to prevent its enforcement.on april,the faa issued a cease and desist order requiring petitioner to suspend enforcement of the ordinance until the faa issued a final agency decision regarding the ordinance legality.the faa also filed motions with the district court for the central district of california requesting a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to prevent petitioner from enforcing the ordinance.the district court granted both motions.
after the district court issued the preliminary injunction,petitioner and the faa proceeded through the agency administrative review process.on may,the faa issued a director determination in which it concluded,inter alia,that the ordinance was inconsistent with petitioner contractual obligations under the grant agreements.in the matter of compliance with federal obligations by the city of santa monica,california,director determination at,faa docket may.after the faa issued the director determination,petitioner requested a hearing,which was held before an faa hearing officer in march of.on may,the hearing officer issued an initial decision in which he also concluded that that the ordinance violated grant assurance.in the matter of compliance with federal obligations by the city of santa monica,california,initial decision of the hearing officer at,faa docket may.after both parties appealed portions of the hearing officer initial decision,the faa issued a final agency decision and order on july,which concluded that federal law preempts the ordinance and that the ordinance violates grant assurance.in the matter of the city of santa monica,final agency decision and order at,faa order july,modified by order granting motion for clarification of final agency decision,faa order,hereinafter final agency decision.pursuant to a,petitioner seeks review of the faa final decision and order.
in its final agency decision,the faa concluded that petitioner ordinance was invalid for two reasons because congress grant of exclusive authority to the faa to regulate aviation safety preempts the ordinance and because the ordinance violates petitioner contractual obligations under grant assurance.final agency decision at.basis for the faa first a constitutional doctrine,derived from the supremacy clause in article vi of the constitution.gade solid wastes mgmt.ass n.before reaching a constitutional question,a federal court should consider whether there is a nonconstitutional ground for deciding the case,and if there is,dispose of the case on that ground.kalka hawk.for this reason,judicial restraint requires us to begin our analysis by examining the faa second conclusion regarding petitioner contractual obligations.
petitioner argues that the faa acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it concluded that the ordinance violates grant assurance because the faa ignored evidence in the record,acted inconsistently with the its own policies and prior decisions,and failed to state a rational connection between the evidence and its conclusion.for the reasons set forth below,we disagree.
this court reviews the decisions of federal agencies,including the faa,under the standards set forth by the administrative procedure act.d f afonso realty trust garvey.the faa factual determinations are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence.c.we may overturn nonfactual aspects of the faa decision only if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.boca airport,quoting a.the scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.nevertheless,the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the,state farm mut,quotation omitted.
there is no dispute that when petitioner accepted federal funds under the faa airport improvement program,petitioner agreed to the terms of the grant assurances incorporated into the grant agreements.nor is there any dispute that grant assurance currently requires petitioner to make smo available as an airport for public use on fair and reasonable terms and without unjust discrimination,to all types,kinds,and classes of aeronautical uses with the exception that petitioner may prohibit certain types of aircraft if such action is necessary for the safe operation of the airport.grant assurance at pt.v.the parties disagree,however,on whether the ordinance is unjustly discriminatory and whether it is necessary for safety.
in its final decision,the faa concluded that the discriminatory restriction against operators of categories c and d aircraft is unjust and not necessary for the safe operation of smo.final agency decision at.the faa based this conclusion on four intermediate findings category c and d aircraft can operate safely at smo despite the lack of runway safety areas category c and d aircraft are less likely to be involved in an overrun than category a and b aircraft in the unlikely event of an overrun by a category c or d aircraft,it is very unlikely that the aircraft would reach the neighborhoods beyond the smo runway and the risks associated with overruns and undershoots at smo by category c and d aircraft can be mitigated without implementing a total ban and without reducing the utility of the runway.id.at.un der the applicable standard of review,if each of these conclusions was rationally based on facts for which there was substantial evidence in the record,and if together they satisfactorily explain the agency final determination,then the petition for review must be denied.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass,at t he agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.c findings of fact by the secretary,under secretary,or administrator,if supported by substantial evidence,are conclusive.first,we consider whether the faa four conclusions were rationally based on substantial evidence in the record.
the faa first conclusion was a direct rebuttal to petitioner primary justification for banning category c and d aircraft from operating at smo.although petitioner argued that category c and d aircraft could not safely operate at smo because the airport lacks runway safety areas,the faa disagreed.a runway safety area is a defined surface surrounding the runway prepared or suitable for reducing the risk of damage to airplanes in the event of an undershoot,overshoot,or excursion from the runway.faa advisory circular at.current faa airport design standards call for runway safety areas to extend feet beyond each end of a runway serving category a and b,type ii aircraft and feet beyond each end of a runway serving category c and d,type ii aircraft.id.at.in its current configuration,smo has no runway safety areas extending beyond either end of its single runway and has scant room to add them.the airport,which sits atop a plateau,is surrounded by residential neighborhoods.immediately after the smo runway ends in either direction,a steep incline leads down to public roads and private homes.petitioner argued that the lack of runway safety areas makes the likelihood of a runway overshoot by a category c or d aircraft,which have higher landing speeds than category a and b aircraft,unreasonably high at smo.
the faa disagreed,concluding that category c and d aircraft can operate safely at smo despite the absence of runway safety areas.the faa noted that for every landing at smo,the pilot of the aircraft is required to determine whether his aircraft is capable of landing on smo runway,and that the presence or absence of a runway safety area does not factor into the pilot calculus.final agency decision at.the faa also noted that almost half of the category c and d operations are subject to additional safety precautions either because they are part of fractional ownership programs or because the aircraft are governed by faa rule,and that other as improved stopping performance,better trained and more experienced pilots,and more stringent aircraft certification category c and d aircraft safer than category a and b aircraft.id.at.the faa also recognized that the runway safety area requirement applies only to new runway construction and that older airports are only required to comply to the extent possible considering factors such as feasibility,cost,and impact on operations.id.at.the faa further noted that the runway safety area standards are not operational requirements and that hundreds of airports across the country operate safely without standard runway safety areas,including major airports such as los angeles international,boston logan,and midway chicago.id.based on these facts,the faa concluded that category c and d aircraft could operate safely at smo in its current configuration.
next,the faa considered whether category c and d aircraft are more or less likely to be involved in an overrun than category a and b aircraft.the faa examined evidence pertaining to the frequency of overruns and undershoots and made the following observations.first,that in general,category c and d aircraft are involved in fewer overruns than category a and b aircraft.id.at.and second,that specifically at smo,category a or b aircraft were involved in seven overruns and one undershoot between and,but category c and d aircraft were not involved in any overruns or undershoots.id.the faa also noted that an faa air safety investigator testified that his office receives reports of category a and b aircraft overruns daily,but that category c and d overruns are incredibly rare.id.at.
looking at more general safety information,the faa noted that national transportation safety board data show that jets category c or d aircraft have an accident rate times lower than piston aircraft mostly category a or b aircraft,times lower than piston aircraft mostly category a or b aircraft,and times lower than turboprops mostly category a or b aircraft.id.at.the faa also credited the testimony of two faa officials regarding the relative safety of category c and d aircraft.the manager of the faa part commuter and aircraft operations air carrier operations branch testified that category c and d aircraft have a lower probability of suffering the type of defect that would cause a runway excursion or overrun.id.at.an faa air safety investigator testified that category c and d aircraft are safer than category a and b aircraft because they have more power,are more technically sophisticated,and have more highly trained pilots.id.at.based on this evidence,the faa concluded that category c and d aircraft are less likely to be involved in an overrun or an undershoot than category a and b aircraft.id.at.
although the faa concluded that an overrun by a category c or d aircraft would be rare,it acknowledged that an overrun was still possible.to address petitioner concerns about the potential damage to privat
