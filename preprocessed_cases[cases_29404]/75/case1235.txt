members of the sanctity of human life network plaintiffs stood on sidewalks of freeway overpasses during rush hours and held signs,visible to motorists below on the freeways,communicating their views concerning abortion.responding to reports of freeway congestion caused by plaintiffs activities,officers of the california highway patrol chp directed plaintiffs to terminate their activities.
plaintiffs filed this injunctive and declaratory relief action,seeking to enjoin the chp from interfering with their display of handheld signs on freeway overpasses during rush hours on january,the anniversary of the united states supreme court decision in roe wade,d.after trial,the court entered judgment in favor of the chp.
we find that the statutes,vehicle code sections and,under which the chp claimed the power to terminate plaintiffs activities,do not apply to plaintiffs activities.however,we also conclude the chp,under the facts presented at trial,acted appropriately pursuant to its authority to direct traffic.see.we further conclude that the chp actions in this case did not violate plaintiffs free speech rights.accordingly,we modify the trial court judgment to grant to plaintiffs declaratory relief only to the extent of declaring that the chp may not interfere with plaintiffs activities under the authority of vehicle code sections and and otherwise affirm the judgment.hereafter,unspecified code citations are to the vehicle code.
trial court proceedings 
as reflected in the statement of decision,the issue litigated at trial was whether plaintiffs can display handheld signs from freeway overpasses to the traffic below during rush hours on january,the roe wade anniversary date.in and,the chp ordered plaintiffs to take down the signs.the chp intends to continue to issue such orders under the authority of sections and governing display of traffic signs and declaring every prohibited sign a public nuisance and penal code section relating to failure to remove a public nuisance.while plaintiffs objected to the statement of decision on several grounds,they did not dispute these facts.
for purposes of trial,the parties stipulated that plaintiffs conducted their demonstrations on sidewalks on freeway overpasses rather than in the roadway,the freeway overpasses involved are enclosed with cyclone fencing so there is no danger of signs falling onto the freeway,and plaintiffs do not claim a right to attach their signs to public property.
on january,plaintiffs held signs on four freeway overpasses between and in the morning.an officer of the chp arrived at one of the locations at about.after some discussion concerning plaintiffs right to display the signs and the arrival of other officers,the officers took plaintiffs signs.at other overpasses,chp officers told plaintiffs they must leave,which they did.
in,plaintiffs displayed their handheld signs on freeway overpasses during rush hour the morning of january until they were told to leave by chp officers.the chp officers were dispatched to the freeway overpasses in response to complaints that plaintiffs activities were causing freeway congestion.plaintiffs were told they had to remove the signs.on the afternoon of january,plaintiffs planned to gather on freeway overpasses,displaying their handheld signs,between and.at one overpass,at approximately,officers of the sacramento police department arrived,cited plaintiffs and told them they had to leave.chp officers were present but did not interact with plaintiffs.plaintiffs held signs and demonstrated on unspecified dates in locations other than freeway overpasses with no interference from the chp.
discussion 
ivehicle code traffic sign statutes 
as noted,the chp has terminated plaintiffs activities on freeway overpasses under the purported authority of sections and.the chp officers who testified at trial stated they would continue to remove prohibited signs in view of freeway motorists under this authority,although the officers were less than clear concerning what is a prohibited sign.plaintiffs assert these vehicle code sign statutes do not apply to their signs.after consideration of the statutes,their context within the vehicle code,and their legislative history,we agree with plaintiffs that sections and do not apply to their signs.
while section prohibits certain signs,section merely provides authority for the chp to remove such prohibited signs.we therefore focus on section.
section is found in division,chapter,article of the vehicle code.division relates generally to rules of the road,while chapter of division relates to traffic signs,signals,and markings,and article of that chapter designates offenses relating to traffic devices.
section provides no person shall place,maintain,or display upon,or in view of,any highway any unofficial sign,signal,device,or marking,or any sign,signal,device,or marking which purports to be or is an imitation of,or resembles,an official traffic control device or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic or which hides from view any official traffic control device.there are two categories of prohibited signs,signals,devices,and markings under the language of the statute.they are unofficial signs,signals,devices,or markings and signs,signals,devices,or markings which a purport to be or are imitations of,or resemble,an official traffic control device,b attempt to direct the movement of traffic,or c hide from view any official traffic control device.plaintiffs signs did not meet the description of signs in the second category.therefore,we must determine whether plaintiffs signs were prohibited because they are in the first category.
we need not consider what is a signal,device,or marking because it has been agreed throughout this litigation that what plaintiffs were displaying were signs.an unofficial sign,as opposed to an official sign,appears to be a traffic sign not placed by governmental entities,although nowhere in the vehicle code is unofficial sign defined.see allowing governmental entities to place traffic signs,signals and other traffic control devices.
during trial,the chp expert on the vehicle code,officer scott hall,who teaches the vehicle code at the highway patrol academy and is authorized to speak authoritatively concerning the meaning of the vehicle code for the chp,testified concerning the chp enforcement of section.his testimony reveals that the chp does not have a clear or articulable definition of the scope of section.asked to explain the presence,considering section,of certain signs within view from the freeway,officer hall testified well,first of all,we do enforce these signs.we enforce the official traffic control devices.we teach these are what they are.sic.these signs here are enforced by another department.i do know if they have permits.i do know if they exempt from a permit.the fact that they there tells us that somebody else who regulates these signs has either given them permission or has allowed them to be there.while he agreed billboards are unofficial signs,he simply stated that the chp does not enforce these signs.he continued there two different types of signs.there official,and there permitted.an official sign regulates,warns and guides.the department of transportation puts up official signs.that what we enforce.anything else is unofficial.unless you have a permit or you exempt,you ca have it.that what it is.the chp view is that bus advertising and bumper stickers do not violate section.when asked why that is so,the officer replied you got me.finally,officer hall testified that determination of what a prohibited sign is under section is purely a matter of discretion for the chp i f this sign were a visual hazard,we would investigate it and go up to em,find out if they had a permit for it and what the parameters of it were for.that what says.if we deem it a visual hazard,we can take it down.
in the vehicle code,a highway is a way or place of whatever nature,publicly maintained and open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel.highway includes street.this broad definition is consistent with the chp understanding and enforcement efforts.officer hall testified that a highway is pretty much any road that encompasses the main travel portion of the roadway,sidewalks,et cetera.
applying these definitions to the terms used in the vehicle code,section prohibits any unofficial sign,meaning any traffic sign,in view of any public place used for vehicular traffic.what is a traffic sign is the only ambiguity remaining.the plain meaning of unofficial sign,taken out of the context of the statutory scheme relating to traffic signs,might suggest that the statute refers to any sign,traffic related or not,that was not placed there by the government.while the plain meaning,without consideration of the context,may lead to this interpretation,other canons of statutory interpretation preclude this interpretation.
the goal of statutory interpretation is to determine and apply the legislature intent.collection bureau of san jose rumsey cal th,d.that intent is typically determined from the plain meaning of the statute.if,however,application of an apparently unambiguous statute would lead to an absurd result,the court can presume the legislature did not intend the apparent meaning.in such cases,the court must engage in further statutory construction.times mirror superior court cal d,fn.
it can not be seriously argued that the legislature intended to prohibit any unofficial sign in view of a roadway.this would include billboards,house numbers,bus advertising,bumper stickers,and a host of other signs that are everywhere to be found in view of roadways.the prohibition in section bears no contextual relation to state statutes and local ordinances concerning private signs.furthermore,the legislature did not intend to prohibit unofficial signs only in view of a freeway.highway has a specific meaning,including streets,in the vehicle code,and modern freeways did not exist when the predecessor of section was enacted in.see former enacted in,defining freeway.
we must construe statutes in the context in which the legislature placed them.collection bureau of san jose rumsey,supra,cal th at,d.here,section is part of comprehensive legislation concerning traffic signs.it does not purport to govern any other type of sign.as noted above,chapter of division of the vehicle code relates to traffic signs,signals,and markings,and article of chapter provides for offenses related to those traffic devices.the context of section supports the conclusion that the legislature did not intend to regulate all signs,only those relating to traffic.for example,a private landowner can not post a speed limit sign within view of the roadway.the same landowner,however,does not violate section,interpreted in its context as a prohibition on private traffic signs,by posting a no trespassing sign visible from the roadway.
one might argue that the first category of prohibited signs in section be interpreted separately from the second category of prohibited which purport to be or are an imitation of,or resemble,an official traffic control device or which attempt to direct the movement of traffic or which hide from view any official traffic control order to give effect to the term unofficial sign.this approach to the interpretation of the statute raises as many problems as it solves.for example,if the second category of signs is interpreted without regard to the first category,even official traffic signs are prohibited because an official traffic sign certainly purports to be an official traffic control device.construing the two categories together to prohibit only unofficial traffic signs is the only way to avoid results obviously unintended by the legislature.
the legislative history of section supports this contextual interpretation of that provision.the first predecessor of section,former section,subdivision b,enacted in,provided it shall be unlawful for any person to place or maintain or to display upon or in view of any street or highway any unofficial sign,signal or device which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic sign or signal,or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic or which hides from view any official traffic sign or signal.stats,ch.as can be seen,the class of prohibited signs is not broken down into two categories.unofficial sign is joined with which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic sign 
the pattern for the provision was section of the uniform motor vehicle act regulating the operation of vehicles,one of four separate acts comprising the uniform motor vehicle code.when codifying former section,subdivision b,the legislature adopted the language of the uniform act,as did other states by.uniform laws annotated motor vehicles,of the assem.interim com.on motor vehicle laws assem.
in,the legislature requested the california code commission to prepare a recodification of all existing motor vehicle laws.the next year,the code commission presented to the legislature the proposed vehicle code and commented the california code commission has endeavored to draft the vehicle code without effecting any substantive changes,except those to which attention is called in the notes following this preface.proposed,com.the notes did not mention the section at issue here and,thus,no substantive change was intended.id.at pp.this recodification,being merely a codification of then existing laws,was enacted in.assem.during this recodification process,former section,subdivision a,in place of former section,subdivision b,was enacted.the new section contained the modern language splitting the prohibited signs into two categories.it provided no person shall place,maintain or display upon,or in view of,any highway any unofficial sign or any sign which purports to be or is an imitation of,or resembles,an official traffic sign stats,ch.in,the section number of the statute was changed to section,as it currently stands.stats,ch.
the change in wording of the statute,splitting the prohibited signs into two categories,was,therefore,not meant to be a substantive change to the statute.it is unclear why the code commission made that change.no other state has done so.for example,colorado statute provides no person shall place,maintain,or display upon or in view of any highway any unauthorized sign,signal,marking,or device which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic control device or railroad sign or signal,or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic,or which hides from view or interferes with the effectiveness of any official traffic control device.this specific language is found in most state statutes.see,ann.ann.
accordingly,the legislative history of section is consistent with what we have concluded is the statute reasonable is,that it applies only to traffic signs and was never intended to do more.plaintiffs signs can not be characterized as traffic signs subject to prohibition under section.they did not purport to be traffic signs.they did not imitate or resemble traffic signs.the signs did not attempt to direct the movement of traffic or hide from view any traffic sign.the chp,relying only on sections and,can not prevent plaintiffs from displaying the signs.
plaintiffs have presented an actual controversy concerning whether the chp may interfere with plaintiffs activities under the authority of sections and.we conclude the chp may not do so.therefore,plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief on that issue.see code civ,authorizing declaratory relief when actual controversy presented.since sections and do not apply,we need not consider whether their application would violate plaintiffs free speech rights.
injunctive relief 
although the chp purported to act pursuant to sections and,which do not provide authority for the actions taken,injunctive relief is not available if it would have the effect of preventing the execution of a public statute by officers of the law for the public benefit.code civ,subd.b.under the facts of this case,an injunction could have the effect of preventing the chp from executing its beneficial function of directing traffic pursuant to section.
members of the california highway patrol are authorized to direct traffic according to law,and,in the event of a fire or other emergency,or to expedite traffic or insure safety,may direct traffic as conditions may require notwithstanding the provisions of this code.traffic includes pedestrians.the record shows that the chp acted to terminate plaintiffs activities on freeway overpasses only when those activities were causing freeway congestion.thus,under the authority of section allowing the chp to direct traffic to expedite traffic as conditions may require,the actions taken by the chp conformed to their statutory authority.
during the testimony of a chp officer,the effect of section as broad authority to direct traffic was raised but not explored.its application to this case was not considered.the statute was mentioned in a footnote in plaintiffs opening brief,but only to say that the chp did not claim this section as justification for its actions.finally,in response to the request for supplemental briefing in which this court asked whether the chp has inherent authority to exclude communicative activities from freeway overpasses,the chp cited its authority under section.consideration of section goes to the question of whether plaintiffs are entitled to the injunctive relief requested.we conclude that an injunction on chp interference with plaintiffs activities might have the effect of preventing the execution of a public statute for public benefit.therefore,plaintiffs are not entitled to injunctive relief.code civ,subd.b.
on appeal,plaintiffs assert that application of sections and to their signs violates their free speech rights because it has the effect of prohibiting their signs while other signs billboards and other advertising containing commercial speech are allowed.our conclusion that sections and are inapplicable makes it unnecessary to reach this contention.plaintiffs also contend,however,that the chp has unconstitutionally broad discretion in determining whether to interfere in plaintiffs activities because,in plaintiffs words,the chp can offer no statute that purports to be a reasonable time,place,manner restriction that is narrowly tailored 
understandably,plaintiffs did not contend in the trial court that section violates their free speech rights as applied in this case.the chp did not assert section as authority for its actions.the focus of this action has been,as noted in the statement of decision,whether the chp intended enforcement of sections and will prevent plaintiffs from displaying their signs.however,the chp knowledge of the scope of its authority has no bearing on that authority.
under the narrow facts of this case,we conclude that the chp actions,authorized by section,did not violate plaintiffs free speech rights.the government may place restrictions on free speech on streets to permit free flow of traffic,which is the main purpose of a street,even if an incidental purpose of providing a forum for free speech is served.regulations of the use of a public forum that ensure the safety and convenience of the people are not inconsistent with civil liberties but are one of the means of safeguarding the good order upon which civil liberties ultimately depend.cox new hampshire.thomas chicago park dist,d.t he exercise of first amendment rights may be regulated where such exercise will unduly interfere with the normal use of the public property by other members of the public with an equal right of access to it.food employees logan valley plaza,d.time,place,and manner restrictions on free speech must not be based on the content of the message,must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,and must leave open ample alternatives for communication.forsyth county nationalist movement,d see also clark community for creative,d.thomas chicago park,supra,at,fn.the state has a strong interest in ensuring the free flow of traffic on roadways.madsen women health center,d,planned parenthood,williams cal th,d.
here,the chp actions were not based on the content of the message,served the significant governmental interest of allowing traffic to flow freely on the freeways,and left open ample alternatives for plaintiffs to communicate their message in other forums.although the parties differ dramatically on whether,and under what circumstances,a freeway overpass is a public forum,it is unnecessary to decide that issue in this case because,even assuming freeway overpasses are public forums,the chp actions,authorized by section,did not violate plaintiffs free speech rights.see faustin city,county of denver,colorado cir,sidewalk of highway overpass is a traditional public forum.a fundamental and longstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.lyng indian cemetery prot.asso,d,see also santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,d.
the legislature has never spoken concerning the issue of expressive activities on freeway overpasses.if it is the terrifying problem the dissent suggests,perhaps the legislature should deal with the issue.a specific and narrowly tailored statute would establish california public policy in this regard and give the courts a point of reference for application of constitutional principles.
the chp discontinued plaintiffs activities on the freeway overpasses,under the facts of this case,only when the activities were causing traffic congestion on the freeways below.therefore,section,on its face,allowed the chp to direct plaintiffs to move on to expedite traffic 
given this conclusion,it is unnecessary and would be premature for us to determine whether the chp can prevent the plaintiffs from demonstrating when the activities are not causing traffic congestion.for example,we need not determine whether the chp can prevent plaintiffs activities on freeway overpasses at any time to insure safety or for other reasons.while it may be argued that allowing the chp to prevent plaintiffs activities on freeway overpasses based solely on safety concerns may delegate discretion to enforcing officers that is unconstitutionally broad see cox louisiana,d,only limited discretion may be vested in enforcing authorities,the question is not presented here.
because we conclude the chp actions were authorized by section and did not violate plaintiffs free speech rights,plaintiffs are not entitled to injunctive relief.accordingly,the portion of the trial court judgment denying injunctive relief must be affirmed.
declaratory relief 
beyond the declaration that the chp may not use sections and as authority to interfere with plaintiffs activities,this action does not present a proper case for declaratory relief.the issue of what the chp can and can not do in situations not substantially similar to the facts presented here can not be the subject of a declaration concerning plaintiffs rights because we can only speculate concerning what the conditions of future encounters between plaintiffs and the chp will be.
any person who desires a declaration of his or her rights or duties with respect to another,may,in cases of actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties,bring an original action for a declaration of his or her rights and duties code civ.
a plaintiff may bring an action for declaratory relief before an actual invasion of rights has occurred.burke city of san francisco d.however,the action must be based on an actual controversy with known parameters.if the parameters are as yet unknown,the controversy is not yet ripe for declaratory relief.pacific legal foundation california coastal com.cal d.
the ripeness requirement,a branch of the doctrine of justiciability,prevents courts from issuing purely advisory opinions.citation.it is rooted in the fundamental concept that the proper role of the judiciary does not extend to the resolution of abstract differences of legal opinion.it is in part designed to regulate the workload of courts by preventing judicial consideration of lawsuits that seek only to obtain general guidance,rather than to resolve specific legal disputes.however,the ripeness doctrine is primarily bottomed on the recognition that judicial decisionmaking is best conducted in the context of an actual set of facts so that the issues will be framed with sufficient definiteness to enable the court to make a decree finally disposing of the controversy.on the other hand,the requirement should not prevent courts from resolving concrete disputes if the consequence of a deferred decision will be lingering uncertainty in the law,especially when there is widespread public interest in the answer to a particular legal question.citations.
the controversy must be definite and concrete,touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.citation.it must be a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.the actual controversy referred to in code of civil procedure section is one which admits of definitive and conclusive relief by judgment within the field of judicial administration,as distinguished from an advisory opinion upon a particular or hypothetical state of facts.the judgment must decree,not suggest,what the parties may or may not do.citation.the principle that courts will not entertain an action which is not founded on an actual controversy is a tenet of common law jurisprudence,the precise content of which is difficult to define and hard to apply a controversy is ripe when it has reached,but has not passed,the point that the facts have sufficiently congealed to permit an intelligent and useful decision to be made.citation.pacific legal foundation california coastal,supra,cal d at.
the focus of this litigation has been the applicability of sections and and the constitutionality of the chp enforcement of those statutes.the parties did not litigate the chp enforcement of other statutes or the constitutionality of such enforcement.while it is necessary for us to consider,under the current facts,the applicability of section because plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and we can not grant injunctive relief if it would have the effect of preventing enforcement of a public statute for the public benefit see code civ,subd.b,we are not in a position to know the parameters of future relations between plaintiffs and the chp.indeed,those relations may change simply because the chp is now on notice that sections and do not apply to plaintiffs activities.
the issue of whether plaintiffs may hold their signs on freeway overpasses under circumstances not presented by the facts of this case is not ripe.many variables,such as traffic congestion,safety,and the exercise of the chp statutory authority,may combine to change whether the chp may appropriately interfere with plaintiffs activities in any given situation.furthermore,chp interference could be presented that,unlike here,would violate plaintiffs free speech rights.if such a situation were presented,the issue of whether the freeway overpass is a public forum would also be ripe.we can not,however,make a declaration at this point that will be applicable under all scenarios.since the controversy,beyond the application of the vehicle code sign statutes as discussed above,does not admit of definitive and conclusive relief by judgment,as distinguished from an advisory opinion upon hypothetical facts,there is no actual controversy pursuant to code of civil procedure section,and plaintiffs are not entitled to declaratory relief beyond the declaration of rights already discussed.
conclusion 
the judgment is modified to grant plaintiffs declaratory relief in that the chp may not rely on vehicle code sections and as authority to interfere with plaintiffs activities while plaintiffs are standing on the sidewalks of freeway overpasses and holding signs visible to the motorists below on the freeway.as modified,the judgment is affirmed.plaintiffs shall recover their costs on appeal.
i fully concur in justice nicholson analysis and conclusion that the california highway patrol chp may not rely on vehicle code sections and as authority to interfere with plaintiffs activities under the facts presented,but acted properly in dispersing plaintiffs under vehicle code section.
i write separately to emphasize my disagreement with several aspects of my dissenting colleague views.i disagree with his cataclysmic vision of the havoc that will be wreaked when citizens are permitted to exercise their first amendment rights on public property within sight of a freeway.i do not share his view of police power that we presume police authority to act absent a constitutional prohibition to the contrary.and while i agree with the majority that we need not reach the issue in this case,i am not persuaded by the dissent public forum analysis.
the dissent evokes images of freeways strewn with human carcasses and wrecked detritus of high speed collisions between drivers distracted by activity on freeway teeming with demonstrators competing to display their messages to the motoring public.there is no basis for such wild imaginings.while the parties may have wished for a more expansive holding,our task is to decide the case before us.this is a case about four specific overpasses populated by a given number of protestors at particular points in time.not all overpasses are the same.an overpass crossing highway in turlock may be an effective protest platform,particularly if the target audience happens to be local citizens,but protestors stationed on such an overpass would have a negligible impact on sparse freeway traffic.the same can not be said of the urban overpasses at issue in this case.the dissent lumps them all together and insists that a single rule should apply to all.
the dissent conclusion in this regard seems premised on the unsupportable notion that signs on freeway overpasses inevitably disrupt traffic on the underlying freeway and on largely irrelevant principles of real property law.after acknowledging decisions by the united states supreme court that public streets are traditional and quintessential public forums,the dissent makes the imminently reasonable observation that freeways are not the type of streets the supreme court had in mind.their access and traffic,among them unsuitable for service as public forums.up to this point the dissent reasoning is largely unassailable.what follows is not.the dissent then concludes,because freeways and government property within a freeway,such as freeway overpasses,are not public forums,restrictions on speech are permissible if reasonable.italics added.this segue or,more appropriately,giant leap from freeways to freeway overpasses is unaccompanied by analysis of overpasses or any explanation as to why a freeway public street that crosses over a be treated the same as the freeway it crosses.
only later does the dissent attempt to explain,and the explanation is totally unsatisfactory.instead of the analysis of the function and characteristics of freeways supporting the dissent conclusion that freeways are unsuitable public forums,the dissent offers a primer on property law the owner of land in fee has the right to the surface and to everything permanently situated beneath or above it.the dissent is correct on this point of law but the point is meaningless.what matters is not who owns the overpass but the characteristics that make it an unsuitable public forum.no amount of legal sleight of hand can alter the simple fact that a freeway overpass is not a freeway.
the dissenting opinion analysis of the chp authority is similarly flawed.accusing the majority of placing the statutory cart before the constitutional horse,the dissent cites perry ed.perry local ed,d,for the proposition that the right of access will differ depending on the character of the property at issue.from this simple undisputed principle,the dissent concludes accordingly,the initial,and pivotal,issue that must be resolved is whether freeways and freeway overpasses are public forum properties.the dissent thus insists that we must address the constitutional issue before we address the statutory question of whether the chp is even empowered to act.i fear the dissent not only has the horse and cart inverted,but the cart is also detached from the horse.the chp authority to act in the first instance is unrelated to the status of property as a public forum.
it is true that a lower standard is required of restrictions imposed on property that is not a public forum.the state has great authority to act in such an instance,but the chp has not been ceded all of the state powers.it is simply an agent of government with limited,statutorily defined authority to act.we have been pointed to no statute restricting the access of pedestrians to freeway overpasses.thus,before delving into difficult constitutional questions,it is fair to first ask what gives the chp the authority to act as it did.had plaintiffs demonstrators been removed from the freeway by employees of the board of fabric care,we would inquire into that board authority to act.we can not simply presume the chp has such authority.
finally,i concur with my colleague that we are not compelled to reach the question of whether a freeway overpass is a public forum.our opinion makes clear that even assuming public forum rules apply,the facts in this case warrant the action taken by the chp.the dissent complains that our opinion leaves prospective protestors to puzzle over the scope of the chp authority.that result,however,is inevitable unless we conclude,as does the dissent,that an overpass is not a public forum.we are neither a legislature nor an enforcement agency.our task is to review restraints enacted by the legislature and standards of enforcement promulgated by administrative agencies.where,as here,the authority to act is premised on an expansive statute such as vehicle code section,which empowers action on a basis,our review must necessarily be limited to the facts of the particular case.the parties are not left bereft of guidance similar facts will produce similar results.
as will soon become apparent,i strongly disagree with the majority analysis that should be terrifying to any person who drives on a freeway.
as the parties and the trial court recognized,this case poses a relatively straightforward question.is a freeway overpass a public forum that demonstrators can use to communicate their message to freeway motorists passing below 
in declining to decide this question,the majority takes a wrong turn that in effect invites groups or individuals to demonstrate on freeway overpasses,leaving them and the california highway patrol with the burden of litigating over the use of freeway overpasses case by case,overpass by overpass,throughout the the outcome depending on how much traffic congestion that a particular demonstration causes.in other words,the parties will be obligated to hit the road again,through future litigation,in an effort to obtain judicial answers to the questions they pose.
and the majority decision will burden freeway motorists with the danger that its approach will create.after all,the purpose of demonstrating on a freeway overpass is to cause freeway motorists to take their eyes and attention off driving and to focus,instead,on the signs and photographs displayed by the even to cause motorists to remain distracted as they ponder,rejoice,or fume about the message while driving on.nevertheless,the majority suggests that authorities must wait and see whether traffic congestion and dangerous conditions actually develop.
i refuse to travel down this road since it is far too dangerous and because the majority analysis is inconsistent with the law and common sense.not only is the use of freeway overpasses for expressive activity inconsistent with the purpose served by the overpasses,it takes no imagination to realize that such activity poses a grave threat to the safety and health of freeway drivers.negotiating the freeways today is difficult enough due to the speeds reached by most drivers and the lack of skills displayed by many of them.with motorists distracted by demonstrators on the overpasses above,accidents are bound to result,some of them fatal.thus,you could say the majority opinion is dead wrong.
this will be no small problem.as the record in this case shows,plaintiffs began using freeway overpasses because it was a cheap and efficient economical way to get their message to as many people as possible.it is inevitable that other individuals or organizations will follow suit because,as i have noted,the majority essentially invites them to protest on freeway overpasses while the authorities wait to see what effect the protests have on traffic congestion and safety.
i shudder to think of the consequences that will prevail.for example,white supremacist skinheads may be able to use the avenue overpass on highway to protest against the martin luther king,holiday just think how worked up and distracted this will get drivers who are speeding down the freeways,and how unsafe this will be for those on the road.why not dueling saddam advocates on the sunrise boulevard overpass and no war in iraq protestors on the mather field road overpass on highway the possibilities are endless.the danger to motorists is clear.
let there be no doubt that my views on the issue are not influenced by the nature of the protest in this case.whatever the message,allowing it to be delivered by demonstrators on a freeway overpass to traffic below presents too great a danger of physical harm to motorists.
as i will explain in detail to follow,freeway overpasses are not public forums in which to engage in expression protected by the first amendment.hence,the california highway patrol can prohibit the expression of ideas on freeway overpasses provided,as occurred in this case,that its actions are reasonable and not intended to suppress any particular point of view.if i am wrong and the law allows freeway overpasses to be used by demonstrators as public forums,then to borrow some words from charles dickens,the law is a idiot.dickens,oliver twist ch.bumble.
i begin by demonstrating why the majority end run around the public forum question is wrong.
as noted earlier,the positions of the parties in this case are relatively straightforward.plaintiffs want to use freeway overpasses to communicate to motorists passing underneath the overpasses.plaintiffs contend that freeway overpasses are public forums,and that they have a constitutional right to use them for communicative purposes subject only to a reasonable time,place,manner restriction narrowly drawn to meet a significant state interest.on past occasions,defendant california highway patrol chp has prevented plaintiffs from using freeway overpasses to demonstrate to freeway drivers.on those occasions,plaintiffs were trying to demonstrate during periods of rush hour traffic.however,plaintiffs did not,either by pleading or by testimony,limit their request for relief to such periods.
the chp,on the other hand,asserts that freeways and freeway overpasses are not public forums.at trial,the chp presented clear and forceful testimony that it enforces a blanket policy of prohibiting demonstrations from freeway overpasses whenever and wherever they occur,regardless of the content of the message.the witnesses explained that such demonstrations inevitably have an adverse effect on the safe and efficient movement of freeway traffic.thus,it is clear that,unless restrained by judicial decision,the chp will not permit plaintiffs to demonstrate from freeway overpasses at any time.
in light of this continuing dispute,plaintiffs brought this action for an injunction prohibiting the chp from denying plaintiffs constitutional right to express their views in a traditional public forum,and f or a declaration by the court of the rights and duties of plaintiff s herein.during preparation for trial,opposing counsel had conversations over the last several months about trying to get as clean and clear a constitutional outcome from this proceeding as possible.to that end,the parties endeavored to eliminate extraneous and undisputed issues by stipulation.
the parties recognize that the initial,and pivotal,issue is whether freeways and freeway overpasses are public forum properties.if so,plaintiffs conduct can not be prohibited,but may be regulated by a specific and narrowly drawn time,place,and manner regulation.perry ed.perry local ed.assn,d.in that respect,plaintiffs asked the chp for statutory authority relevant to such conduct.the chp provided a list of provisions,including vehicle code sections,and.further section references are to the vehicle code unless otherwise specified.sections and were identified as the primary provisions of significance.
the majority,seizing upon the trial discussions involving statutory provisions,seeks to avoid resolving the constitutional questions presented by focusing upon statutory issues.such an approach does not work.by adopting it,the majority fails to resolve the parties controversy and inevitably requires them to renew their litigative efforts.
the majority first construes sections and in a manner that excludes plaintiffs conduct.having done so,the majority concludes that plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief stating the chp can not rely upon those sections to exclude plaintiffs from freeway overpasses.
the majority approach places the statutory cart before the constitutional horse.as the united states supreme court said in perry ed.perry local ed,supra,d the existence of a right of access to public property and the standard by which limitations upon such a right must be evaluated differ depending on the character of the property at issue.id.at.at,d at.accordingly,the initial,and pivotal,issue that must be resolved is whether freeways and freeway overpasses are public forum properties.
in order to show cause for relief,plaintiffs must establish that they have an affirmative right to demonstrate to freeway traffic from freeway overpasses.plaintiffs can not establish an affirmative right simply by showing that some particular statute does not apply to them.rather,the issue necessarily turns on whether freeways and freeway overpasses are public forums.see arkansas educ.tv forbes,d.if freeways and freeway overpasses are not public forums,plaintiffs have no constitutional right to demonstrate from them and may be prohibited from doing so provided that their exclusion is not based on their viewpoint and is reasonable in light of the purposes for which the property is maintained.id.at.at,d at.in such case,the existence of a specific statutory exclusion is not critical.see,arkansas educ.tv forbes,supra,at.at,d at exclusion based upon journalistic discretion.if,on the other hand,freeways and freeway overpasses are public forums,plaintiffs may not be entirely prohibited from demonstrating,and may be regulated only by specific and narrowly drawn statutes or regulations.perry ed.perry local ed,supra,at.at,d at.in such case,sections and,which are broad,blanket prohibitions,can not suffice.in either case,an interpretation of those sections is not determinative of the issues presented.
in any event,the majority presupposes that the removal authority granted by section is necessarily limited to the prohibitions of section.however,section authorizes summary removal of e very prohibited sign,signal,device,or light.section is not the sole source of prohibition against signs,signals,devices or lights.see,bus.a statutory provision can not be read in isolation,but must be construed together with other laws on the same subject matter.california real estate loans,wallace th,d.
thus,to warrant relief precluding the chp from exercising authority under section,it is not enough to conclude that section does not apply to plaintiff conduct rather,it must be demonstrated that plaintiffs have a right to engage in the challenged activity.in the circumstances of this case,that can be addressed only by resolving whether or not freeways and freeway overpasses are public forums.
the majority next proceeds to a discussion of section and concludes that this provision permits the chp to prohibit plaintiffs activities,at least in some circumstances.based on this conclusion,the majority further concludes that it is unnecessary to determine whether freeways and freeway overpasses are public forums.again,the approach does not work.
first,as i have pointed out,the discussion places the statutory cart before the constitutional horse.we can not know the standard by which to evaluate limitations upon plaintiffs expressive efforts until we have first determined the character of the property at issue.perry ed.perry local ed,supra,at.at,d at.
second,the majority decision fails to answer numerous questions that are essential to the parties understanding of their rights and responsibilities.thus,the opinion states that the chp may prohibit plaintiffs demonstrations in order to ensure the free flow of traffic or to avoid traffic congestion,but leaves unanswered such questions as can section be applied as a preventative measure to avoid traffic congestion before it occurs since the chp witnesses testified that expressive conduct on the freeways inevitably impedes the free flow of traffic,can the chp exclude demonstrations in their entirety,thus effectively closing the forum if it was otherwise open if traffic congestion is prerequisite to the application of section,by what criteria is traffic congestion to be determined is it enough that traffic is congested or must plaintiffs conduct contribute to it whose opinion is determinative what recourse do plaintiffs have if they disagree 
precision is the touchstone of first amendment jurisprudence but the majority opinion effectively leaves the parties where they were before this litigation,without guidance to enable them to avoid future controversy,and future litigation.
third,the majority approach imposes unwarranted limitations upon the issues presented by the parties.it is true that when the chp interfered with plaintiffs activities in the past,plaintiffs were demonstrating during rush hours.however,plaintiffs did not suggest that they would limit their desire to demonstrate to rush hours.rather,they plan to demonstrate from freeway overpasses if we essentially a clear legal route to do so.
it is also true that,on prior occasions,officers were sent to the scene as the result of citizen complaints.but at trial,the officers made it clear that they did not exclude plaintiffs from the overpasses as the result of individualized consideration,but simply applied a blanket rule of exclusion.officer peart,who was involved in the prior incidents,testified that he would exclude demonstrators from overpasses whenever they come to his attention.sergeant faria,who was also involved in the prior incidents,concurred.neither officer attempted to describe the traffic conditions at the time of the prior encounters,and neither officer tried to justify their actions by reference to particular traffic conditions.
plaintiffs were not cited or arrested as a result of the prior incidents.they do not seek to avoid prosecution,fine,or other onus arising from those events.they do not seek recompense from the chp based upon those events.in the trial court,evidence related to the prior events was presented solely to establish that an actual legal controversy has arisen between the parties.the legal controversy is whether plaintiffs can be prohibited entirely from demonstrating to freeway traffic from freeway overpasses.the majority singular focus on the prior incidents does little to resolve the actual controversy that exists.
finally,by its decision the majority assumes the role of factfinder.since the parties were interested in resolving their dispute to avoid future controversy,they did not actually litigate the question whether,in past incidents,particular circumstances existed that would warrant restriction on plaintiff conduct,if such conduct were otherwise permissible.the trial court did not decide that question.however,if plaintiffs have a right to demonstrate from freeway overpasses subject to restriction under some circumstances,the question whether those circumstances exist is in large part factual.since the parties did not litigate that issue,and the trial court did not decide it,this court is not in a position to determine whether,in the prior incidents,circumstances warranted application of section.
the most the majority could properly conclude is plaintiffs may be prohibited from demonstrating from freeway overpasses when the circumstances described in section are present.but the negative pregnant included in such a plaintiffs are otherwise entitled to not a conclusion that we can properly reach without specifically addressing the question whether freeway overpasses are public forums.
an appellate court can not adjudicate through the mechanism of a negative pregnant.rather,a decision of an appellate court must be supported by a written statement of reasons.amwest surety ins.wilson cal th,d.and decisions are not authority for propositions not considered.mcdowell craig city of santa fe springs cal d.this is particularly true where the appellate court specifically declines to address an issue.estate of baird cal,estate of hall cal.
thus,while a casual reading of the majority opinion might suggest that the plaintiffs must be permitted to demonstrate from freeway overpasses at some times,such an unconsidered implication is not binding on the parties pacific estates,superior court th,d,or the trial court people shuey cal d,and can not serve as precedent for purposes of stare decisis people superior court williams th,d.
the only appropriate conclusion that can be drawn from the majority opinion is the chp may be able to continue to prohibit plaintiffs from demonstrating,so long as it does not purport to rely upon sections and in doing so.if plaintiffs desire a judicial determination whether they have a right to demonstrate in at least some circumstances,they will be obliged to commence new litigation.
the majority notes the general rule,founded in the principle of judicial restraint,that we will avoid deciding constitutional questions unless doing so is strictly necessary to resolution of the case before us.the rule is well established.santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,d.but it is equally well established that the rule can not be applied rigidly where first amendment interests are at stake and lengthy,piecemeal litigation,that may not fully vindicate those interests,must be avoided.baggett bullitt,d,people fogelson cal d.moreover,when a constitutional question is squarely presented in a justiciable controversy,it becomes our responsibility to resolve it.see heckler mathews,d,times film chicago,d.
the chp has made it clear that,unless it is advised it may not do so,it will preclude plaintiffs from demonstrating from freeway overpasses at any time and under any circumstances.a justiciable controversy has been presented by the parties that requires our determination,through a public forum analysis,whether plaintiffs have a constitutional right to demonstrate from freeway overpasses.see public utilities com.united states,d.we can not fully and properly resolve the controversy presented without first resolving this question.
because i have been unable to convince the majority to address the pivotal constitutional question presented in this litigation,i set forth my own views of the matter.
as the parties recognize,the degree to which the government can restrict a person from using public property to express the person views depends on the character of the property.perry ed.perry local ed,supra,at.at,d at.therefore,they agree that the important first step in considering the issue tendered in this case is a forum analysis,although they predictably harbor differing perceptions in that regard 
for purposes of a forum analysis,public property may be classified into three broad categories.perry ed.perry local ed,supra,at.at,d at.
the first category includes places that are quintessential public forums,which have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and,time out of mind,have been used for purposes of assembly,communicating thoughts between citizens,and discussing public questions.citation.perry ed.perry local ed,supra,at.at,d at.in places which by long tradition or by government fiat have been devoted to assembly and debate,the rights of the state to limit expressive activity are sharply circumscribed.ibid.the government may enforce time,place,and manner regulations that are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and that leave open ample alternative channels of communication.ibid.the government also may enforce a exclusion if it is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and it is narrowly drawn to serve that interest.accord,krishna society lee,d.
the second category of public property is that which is not a traditional public forum but which the government has opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity.perry ed.perry local ed,supra,at.at,d at.to be a public forum by designation ibid,it is not enough that the property be open to some forms of communication,or even that it be maintained for the purpose of communicative activity.id.at.at,d at postal service greenburgh civic assns,fn,fn,d,fn.rather,it must appear that the government has intentionally opened the property for expressive activity by the general public.arkansas educ.tv forbes,supra,at.at,d at.while the government is not required to retain the open character of such property indefinitely,as long as it does so it is bound by the same rules that apply to traditional public forums,r easonable time,place,and manner regulations are permissible,and a prohibition must be narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest.perry ed.perry local ed,supra,at.at,d at accord,krishna society lee,supra,at.at,d at.
the third category of public property is that which is neither by tradition nor by designation an open forum for general public communication.perry ed.perry local ed,supra,at.at,d at.t he first amendment does not guarantee access to property simply because it is owned or controlled by the government.postal service greenburgh civic,supra,at.at,d at.with respect to public property that is not an open forum for public communication,the government may enforce time,place,and manner regulations,and also may reserve the forum for its intended purposes,communicative or otherwise,as long as the regulation on speech is reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker view.perry ed.perry local ed,supra,at.at,d at accord,krishna society lee,supra,at pp.at,d at.
here,the public properties at issue are freeway overpasses upon which plaintiffs desire to direct their demonstrations to freeway motorists below.in other words,plaintiffs seek to use public property directly over the roadway and thus within the freeway,see irwin city of manhattan beach cal d.
noting that public streets are considered to be quintessential public forums perry ed.perry local ed,supra,at.at,d at,plaintiffs argue that so too must be freeways.i disagree for reasons that follow.
strictly speaking,a street is a public thoroughfare in an urban community such as a city,town,or village,and the term is not ordinarily applicable to roads and highways outside of municipalities.d highways,streets,and bridges,see also black law dictionary ed.in other words,a ll streets are highways,but not all highways are streets.montgomery railway company cal.
in the ordinary and conventional sense,a street is a means of intercommunication among members of the public for travel for the conduct of personal,social,and economic intercourse and for the convenient use of abutting properties,both commercial and residential.see hague committee for industrial organization.thus,in the conventional sense,streets are built and maintained to serve the public as well as abutting property owners.schnider state of california cal d,people ex rel.of transportation wilson th,d.members of the public traveling upon a street may stop and visit an abutting property,for business or personal purposes,and then reenter the street.people ex rel.of transportation wilson,supra,th at,d.and abutting property owners have a right of access to the street,which includes a right to be seen and visited by members of the public.schnider state of california,supra,cal d at,people ex rel.of transportation wilson,supra,th at,d.
traditional public forums,such as streets,are open for expressive activity regardless of the government intent because t he objective characteristics of these properties require the government to accommodate public speakers.arkansas educ.tv forbes,supra,at.at,d at.in places where the general public can gather,visit,and talk,they inevitably will do so,and it would be impossible and wholly unreasonable for the government to attempt to prescribe expressive activity in such places.public streets,in their ordinary and conventional sense,are precisely the type of public property that falls within the concept of a public forum.
freeways,however,differ greatly from streets.although streets,in their conventional sense,immemorially have been used as public forums hague committee for industrial organization,supra,at.at.at,freeways are of relatively recent origin.they were created to further the development of the state with an increasingly motorized,commuter public.see sts.unlike conventional streets,freeways serve a limited and restricted purpose they are designed to provide rapid transit for through traffic,uninterrupted by vehicles or pedestrians from private roads and intersecting streets schnider state of california,supra,cal d at.
it is the very essence of the idea of a freeway to prevent just the sort of thing that a conventional street is maintained to serve.people ex rel.public works lipari d.thus,the purpose and intent in the creation of a freeway are just the opposite of the purpose and intent in the creation and maintenance of an ordinary street or road.people ex rel.of transportation wilson,supra,th at,d.
in order for freeways to serve their limited purpose,they are subject to rules that are unlike those applicable to ordinary streets and roads.they are not open to the general public rather,use is restricted to persons in motor vehicles who desire and are willing to travel in a rapid and uninterrupted manner from one place to another.schnider state of california,supra,cal d at.abutting landowners have no,or at best limited,rights of access.people ex rel.of transportation wilson,supra,th at,d.pedestrians,bicyclists,and other relatively slow modes of transportation generally are prohibited.motorists can enter or leave the freeway only at designated on and off ramps.they can not stop or make a turn.freeways often are posted with minimum as well as maximum speed limits,subd.b.and the legislature has provided that no person may solicit,display,sell,offer for sale,or otherwise vend or attempt to vend any merchandise or service while being wholly or partly within the of any freeway,including any,or roadway shoulder that lies within the freeway,subd.a.
consistent with the legislative intent of maintaining freeways for the purpose of providing uninterrupted rapid transit for through traffic,the legislature has expressly delineated the types of signs or markers that california department of transportation caltrans can place,maintain,or authorize along the freeway.the types of signs or markers within the authority of caltrans are those reasonably necessary or convenient for purposes of rapid transit.for example,caltrans can maintain certain directional signs.sts,directions to a city or business district sts,historical sites sts,governmental maintained roadside rest areas institutions of postsecondary education.in rural areas,it can maintain signs advising motorists of the fuel,food,lodging,or camping services that can be obtained at the next exit sts,or of the location of a fire station sts.and,of course,it can place,maintain,or cause to be placed or maintained appropriate and necessary signs,signals,and other traffic control devices.other than the signs or markers the legislature has specifically authorized,caltrans has been given no general authority to place,maintain,or approve communicative activities within the freeway 
it is these attributes that distinguish freeways from the type of ordinary or conventional streets which traditionally have been used as public forums.these attributes also make it impossible for a freeway to serve the usual purposes for which public forums exist,such as assembly,public discussion and debate,and the communication of thoughts among members of the public.hague committee for industrial organization,supra,at.at.at.there simply can not be free and open assembly,public debate,or an exchange of ideas in a location where pedestrians are forbidden,motorists can not stop,and traffic passes at relatively high speeds.
the united states supreme court has rejected the view that traditional public forum status extends beyond its historic confines arkansas educ.tv forbes,supra,at.at,d at.rather,the development of new methods of transportation requires the development of new methods of accommodating that transportation,and each new step requires a new inquiry into the compatibility of transportation necessities and various kinds of expressive activity.krishna society lee,supra,at.at,d at.while i understand plaintiffs desire to direct their communication to freeway motorists freeways provide an essentially captive audience with a relatively high volume of viewers,the efficiency of the medium does not dictate that the property be treated as a public forum.postal service greenburgh civic,supra,at.at,d at.
accordingly,i am compelled to conclude that freeways,which serve a limited purpose wholly opposite that of ordinary streets,are not public forums.in reaching this conclusion,i am mindful of the united states supreme court decision in frisby schultz,d,which addressed a city adoption of an ordinance that completely banned picketing before or about any residence.the city asserted that its streets should not be considered public forums due to their physical narrowness and residential character.id.at.at,d at.the supreme court disagreed no particularized inquiry into the precise nature of a specific street is necessary all public streets are held in the public trust and are properly considered traditional public fora.id.at.at,d at.however,frisby schultz would compel a conclusion favorable to plaintiffs position only if this court were to extend the holding beyond the usual and ordinary meaning of street and find its reasoning applicable to any government property dedicated to some form of travel,regardless how limited or restricted.we are not at liberty to do so,as i will explain.
first amendment rights must always be applied in light of the special characteristics of the environment in the particular case.citation.healy james,d.it is not travel per se that makes a street a public forum rather,it is the street inherent capacity and traditional use for purposes of assembly,discussion,and other forms of social,economic,and political intercourse.compare hague committee for industrial organization,supra,at.at.at,with krishna society lee,supra,at.at,d at.
freeways,unlike ordinary streets,are to serve those purposes of public forums and,in their relatively brief history,freeways have not been held open for such purposes.
in this respect,i find the decision in greer spock,d to be significant.it involved the fort dix military reservation,which contained roads and footpaths open to civilian use.civilians were permitted to visit any unrestricted area of the reservation,but expressive activities,such as demonstrations,picketing,marches,and political speeches,were prohibited.id.at.at,d at.in rejecting a first amendment challenge to the prohibition upon expressive activities,the supreme court distinguished the roads and footpaths on the military reservation from a municipality open streets,sidewalks,and parks and concluded the open roads and footpaths on the military reservation were not public forums.id.at.at,d at.in reaching this conclusion,the court noted that the business of a military reservation is to train soldiers,not to provide a public forum.id.at.at,d at.
the decision in greer spock,supra,d demonstrates that when the united states supreme court speaks of streets as traditional public forums,it uses the word street in the ordinary and conventional sense,in reference to the public streets of a municipality.the court does not necessarily extend the meaning of street,and hence the status of public forum,to every pathway of travel in the public domain.this is consistent with the court statement that while a public forum analysis generally provides a workable analytical tool,the distinctions may blur at the edges,particularly in cases falling between the paradigms of government property interests essentially mirroring analogous private interests and those clearly held in trust,either by tradition or recent convention,for the use of citizens at large.city council taxpayers for vincent,fn,fn,d,fn.it also is consistent with the court view that first amendment rights must always be applied in light of the environment in the particular case.healy james,supra,at.at,d at.
freeways are not streets in the ordinary and conventional use of the word street and,with their limited purpose and restricted use,freeways have not been held in trust for the general use of the public at large 
because freeways and government property within a freeway,such as freeway overpasses,are not public forums,the government may reserve them for their intended purposes as long as the restriction on speech is reasonable and not an effort to suppress views with which public officials disagree.perry ed.perry local ed,supra,at.at,d at.
at trial,the chp relied upon two bases for prohibiting expressive activity on freeway and safety.i find these bases to be reasonable.
evidence in the record shows that plaintiffs purposely timed their demonstrations for periods of heaviest freeway use,rush hours.while plaintiffs did so in order to reach the greatest number of drivers,those also are times that involve the greatest potential for disruption of the efficient flow of traffic and the greatest danger to motorists from driver distraction.
the chp presented testimony that any form of visual distraction on the freeways impedes the smooth flow of traffic,particularly during periods of high use or congestion.accordingly,during commute times,the chp employs a tow truck service to remove stalled vehicles as soon as possible and officers even avoid making enforcement stops to prevent deleterious effects on traffic flow.likewise,it is obvious that the efficient movement of traffic would be adversely affected by expressive demonstrations aimed at freeway drivers.
the governmental concern for efficiency is.our increasingly congested freeways have caused the legislature to take steps to promote efficiency,including,among other things,the placement of call boxes to enable motorists in need of aid to obtain assistance sts,and the permanent implementation of a freeway service patrol system on urban freeways.sts,et distractions that can inhibit the smooth flow of traffic are matters of legitimate governmental concern since such distractions can hamper the ability of freeways to serve the purpose for which they are built and maintained.
even more important is the adverse effect on public safety that expressive demonstrations would entail.in the,flow of traffic on a freeway,it is particularly important that drivers pay attention to driving.the specific purpose of an expressive demonstration aimed at freeway motorists is to gain their attention to a message,and thus distract them from their driving.in the,traffic flow of a freeway,a distracted driver is a significant safety hazard.
it can not be denied that traffic safety is a legitimate governmental concern.in upholding a ban on advertising on vehicles using the streets of new york city,the united states supreme court said that it was within the discretion of the city to conclude that such advertising constitutes a distraction to vehicle drivers and to pedestrians alike and therefore affects the safety of the public in the use of the streets.railway express agency new york.and in upholding a local ordinance declaring to be a nuisance any advertising sign adjacent to a freeway and designed to be viewed by freeway travelers,the california supreme court said the ordinance served the obvious purposes of promoting highway safety as well as enhancing community aesthetic values.city of escondido desert outdoor advertising,cal d,disapproved on another point in san diego.contractors city council cal d.
testimony introduced by the chp established that its ban on expressive activity on freeways is applied in an manner without regard to content.there is no basis in the record to dispute that the prohibition in this case was not an attempt to suppress any particular point of view.i am aware of anecdotal information,outside the record of this appeal,that action has not been taken in some areas to remove patriotic symbols and messages posted on freeway overpasses following the despicable terrorist attacks on september.however,there is no evidentiary basis in this case to conclude that the chp action against plaintiffs was taken to suppress their particular point of view or that the chp employs its ban on expressive activity on freeways in a manner so as to suppress any particular points of view.
because the governmental interests of efficiency and traffic safety are reasonable grounds for excluding expressive activities from freeway,and there is no basis in the record of this case to establish that the chp employs its policy in a manner to suppress particular points of view,plaintiffs can be prevented from demonstrating on freeway overpasses.
plaintiffs nevertheless suggest that they must be permitted to demonstrate to freeway traffic from freeway overpasses because,in doing so,they are not required to stand on the surface of the freeway itself.the argument fails.
civil code section provides the owner of land in fee has the right to the surface and to everything permanently situated beneath or above it.this is consistent with civil code section,which states land is the material of the earth,whatever may be the ingredients of which it is composed,whether soil,rock,or other substance,and includes free or occupied space for an indefinite distance upwards as well as downwards,subject to limitations upon the use of airspace imposed,and rights in the use of airspace granted,by law.
specific to state highways,streets and highway code section provides a the term h ighway includes all,or any part,of the entire width of the of a state highway,whether or not the entire area is actually used for highway purposes.b the term e ncroachment includes any tower,pole,pole line,pipe,pipe line,fence,billboard,stand or building,or any structure,object of any kind or character not particularly mentioned in this section,or special event,which is placed in,under,or over any portion of the highway.
these statutes reflect the general rule that a property owner has the right to the enjoyment and control of the airspace above the property that is reasonably adaptable to the beneficial use of the property.strother pacific gas d.this rule was a fundamental premise of the litigation in irwin city of manhattan beach,supra,cal d,a decision that held a municipality could properly authorize the construction of a pedestrian walkway over a city street,and could limit the use of the structure in any reasonable manner,including its withdrawal from the access of the public at large.id.at.
freeway overpasses serve the dual interests of the state and of the surrounding community.overpasses serve the interest of the state by enabling it to maintain freeways as a means of rapid,uninterrupted transit for through traffic.schnider state of california,supra,cal d at.and they serve the interest of the surrounding community by preventing the schism that would occur if access from one part of the community to another were severed by the freeway.see sts.
the exercise of control over streets and roads is an exercise of the sovereign power of the state.ex parte daniels cal.any right of control that is not expressly delegated to local government is retained by the state,and any grant of authority is strictly construed in favor of state control.rumford city of berkeley cal d.while local governments may be permitted to exercise some control over freeway overpasses as part of their local road system,the state retains control over those overpasses at least to the extent necessary or appropriate for the operation and use of the freeway for its intended purposes.
accordingly,plaintiffs are not free of state control simply because they conduct their activities from freeway overpasses within the freeway rather than upon the surface of the freeway itself.
f orum analysis is not completed merely by identifying the government property at issue.rather,in defining the forum courts have focused on the access sought by the speaker.cornelius naacp legal defense ed.fund,d.this entails consideration of the audience the speaker wishes to reach as well as the physical property from which the speaker wishes to act.ibid.
freeway overpasses are within the freeway,and by principles of general law,as well as by provisions of the streets and highway code,they are under the control of the state for freeway purposes.plaintiffs demand to use the overpasses for the sole and specific purpose of demonstrating to freeway traffic.the chp excluded plaintiffs from the overpasses for the sole purpose of preventing them from demonstrating to freeway traffic.consideration of both the nature of the property and the access sought by plaintiffs compels the conclusion that,in this respect,freeway overpasses,like freeways themselves,are not public forums.
plaintiffs claim that the exclusion of their demonstrations from freeway overpasses has the effect of treating political speech less favorably than commercial speech,which is inconsistent with first amendment values.see metromedia,san diego,d,metromedia,city of san diego cal d.the contention is not persuasive.
in support of this assertion,plaintiffs point to provisions of the outdoor advertising act bus,et,which permits advertising on private property,generally referred to as billboard advertising however,a private citizen interest in controlling the use of his or her own property justifies different treatment from other types of expressive activity.see city council taxpayers for vincent,supra,d.hence,the activity regulated by the act is not comparable to plaintiffs activity,and need not be treated the same.in any event,the act flatly prohibits the placement or maintenance of any advertising display within the of any highway.bus,subd.a.
plaintiffs also point to advertising,such as signs on commercial buildings adjacent to a freeway,which are not covered by the outdoor advertising act bus,subd.d and which,plaintiffs claim,are unregulated.in fact,advertising is subject to regulation by local government through ordinance,subd.b bus,subd.a.but what is significant is that advertising involves a property owner interest in controlling the use of his or her property and,by definition,can not be conducted within a freeway.hence,it is not comparable to the activity in which plaintiffs wish to engage.
as another example of commercial speech that is permitted along freeways,plaintiffs note that caltrans places signs within freeway,advising motorists of traveler amenities,such as gas,food,or lodging,that can be obtained by leaving the freeway at a particular offramp.at times,these signs include the name or logo of the particular purveyor of the goods or services available.these signs,like directional signs in general,convey information of importance to the traveling public and serve the intended purposes of a freeway.where public property is not a public forum,government can permit communicative activity consistent with the property intended purpose without opening the property to expressive activity in general.perry ed.perry local ed,supra,at.at,d at.
plaintiffs also complain that their communication has been banned whereas some forms of otherwise unauthorized communication,such as commercial signs on the sides of city buses and bumper stickers on vehicles,are not excluded from the freeways.however,a lawful distinction may be drawn between a motorist using the freeway for its intended purpose,consistent with the rules of the road demanded therein,who incidentally has a message attached to his or her vehicle,and a person who does not wish to use the freeway for its intended purpose at all.railway express agency new york,supra,at.at.at see also lehman city of shaker heights,d.the fact that some forms of incidental communication are not excluded from the freeways does not have the effect of opening the freeways to all forms of communication whether or not related to the intended purpose of those properties.
in the final analysis,it must be kept in mind that freeway are not public forums.in dealing with public property that is not a public forum,the state can exclude some types of expressive activity even though other types are permitted.perry ed.perry local ed,supra,at.at,d at.unless,by policy or practice,the state has opened the property to the indiscriminate use of the general public for expressive purposes,the relevant question is not whether some forms of expression are permitted,but is whether the exclusion of the particular activity at issue is reasonable.see united states kokinda,d.in this respect,courts focus on the excluded activity and must recognize that the state is entitled to address activities it believes particularly warrant control without being required to address other,lesser evils.united states kokinda,supra,at.at,d at railway express agency new york,supra,at.at.at.
for reasons i already have explained,excluding demonstrations from freeway is reasonable.
as noted previously,the primary statutory authorities that the chp witnesses cited at trial were sections and.section provides no person shall place,maintain,or display upon,or in view of,any highway any unofficial sign,signal,device,or marking,or any sign,signal,device,or marking which purports to be or is an imitation of,or resembles,an official traffic control device or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic or which hides from view any official traffic control device.an unofficial sign,signal,device,or marking within the meaning of this section is one that is not placed,caused to be placed,or authorized by the department of transportation,sts.section authorizes the chp to remove,or cause to be removed,every prohibited sign 
plaintiffs argue these sections do not provide authority for the chp enforcement action against them because,in plaintiffs view,section does not,by its terms,apply to any signs other than those that purport to regulate traffic control or that block traffic control devices.they raise the specter that,if construed otherwise,section would permit the chp to prohibit plaintiffs from displaying their signs and banners in a manner viewable from any street.in essence,plaintiffs contend that,unless their construction of section is adopted,the statute is overbroad and therefore unconstitutional.this issue need not be addressed for the following reasons.
at trial,it was established that the chp has not interfered with plaintiffs expressive activities in any location other than on freeway overpasses.plaintiffs brought this litigation for the specific and limited purpose of obtaining injunctive and declaratory relief that would compel the chp to permit them to demonstrate on freeway overpasses.their specific claim is that freeway overpasses are traditional public forums and,thus,their demonstrations can not be precluded by the chp.as the litigation has progressed,plaintiffs have begun to focus on sections and.they appear to believe that if those sections are construed so as not to include their conduct,or are declared unconstitutional,plaintiffs will be entitled to the relief they seek.
plaintiffs argument presupposes that specific statutory authority is a prerequisite to the exclusion of demonstrations from within the freeway.it is not.
in addressing this issue,we must keep in mind that freeway,and freeway overpasses,are not public forums.where a public forum is involved,a narrowly drawn statute or regulation is essential to exclude or limit expression.perry ed.perry local ed,supra,at.at,d at.but the united states supreme court has not held that a statute or regulation is essential for the exclusion of expressive activity from property that is not a public forum.to the contrary,in forum cases,the court has upheld exclusions that were not based on statute or regulation.

as these decisions demonstrate,when property is not a public forum,the exclusion of expressive activity need not be based upon a specific,narrowly drawn statute or regulation.an exclusion can be based upon such things as a policy decision or the exercise of official discretion.
accordingly,the chp authority to prohibit plaintiffs from demonstrating on freeway overpasses is not necessarily dependent upon the interpretation and constitutional validity of sections and.
in establishing a freeway system,the legislature took steps to ensure that the public use of freeways would be limited to the intended purpose of freeways.thus,as i have noted,access is limited and controlled.schnider state of california,supra,cal d at,people ex rel.of transportation wilson,supra,th at,d.pedestrians,bicyclists,and other slow modes of transportation generally are prohibited.motorists can not stop or make a turn.there are often minimum as well as maximum speed limits on freeways,subd.b.and the legislature has excluded commercial activity from the freeway,subd.a.
the legislature has expressly delineated the types of signs and markers that can be placed or maintained within the freeway.see,sts.as part of the outdoor advertising act,the legislature expressly precluded any advertising sign from being placed or maintained within the freeway.bus,subd.a.although caltrans has full possession and control of the freeways sts,it has been given no statutory authority to place,maintain,or authorize any sign or marker other than those delineated by the legislature.neither caltrans nor the chp has been given statutory authority to authorize or permit the freeway to be used for expressive purposes,like protests or demonstrations.
the chp is the law enforcement agency with full responsibility and primary jurisdiction for the administration and enforcement of the laws on freeways,subd.d.the chp duties include the enforcement of all laws regulating the operation of vehicles and the use of the freeways,subd.b.it is required to perform all duties,exercise all powers and jurisdiction,assume and discharge all responsibilities,and carry out and effect all purposes vested by law in the department.this includes providing adequate patrol of the freeways at all times of the day and night.members of the chp are authorized to direct traffic according to law,and,in the event of a fire or other emergency,or to expedite traffic or insure safety,may direct traffic as conditions may require notwithstanding the provisions of this code.traffic includes pedestrians.
these statutory provisions make it clear that the chp has the responsibility to patrol the freeways and to take action to ensure the safe and efficient movement of traffic thereon.in performing this duty,a chp officer may give any order,signal,or direction that is relevant and reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that purpose.people ritter,d supp.and it is unlawful for any person to willfully fail or refuse to comply with any lawful order,signal,or direction by a chp officer.
having considered the totality of the circumstances and the law applicable to this case,i conclude that,without relying on sections and,the chp can prevent plaintiffs from demonstrating to freeway traffic from freeway overpasses.i reach this conclusion for the following reasons freeways and freeway overpasses are not public forums,and plaintiffs have no right to demonstrate to freeway traffic from within the freeway the legislature consistently has acted to exclude from the freeway all objects and activities that are not related to the purpose of providing a means of uninterrupted rapid transit for through traffic the legislature has not authorized caltrans or the chp to permit unrelated expressive activities within freeway the chp has broad responsibility over the freeways,and its duties include taking action to promote the safe and efficient flow of traffic on the freeways it was established at trial,and it is a matter of common sense,that demonstrations directed at freeway traffic from within the freeway can have a serious deleterious effect on both traffic safety and efficiency and in the performance of their duties,chp officers may issue orders,signals,and directions relevant and reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of their responsibilities.
it follows that the chp has authority to preclude plaintiffs from demonstrating to freeway traffic from freeway overpasses,regardless of any determination that we might reach with respect to the interpretation and constitutional validity of sections and.
although,in my view,sections and are not determinative of the issues presented,i pause here briefly to note my disagreement with the majority interpretation of those statutes.
section provides no person shall place,maintain,or display upon,or in view of,any highway any unofficial sign,signal,device,or marking,or any sign,signal,device,or marking which purports to be or is an imitation of,or resembles,an official traffic control device or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic or which hides from view any official traffic control device.
in the statute,the legislature used the words sign,signal,device,or marking twice,separated by the disjunctive or.the first iteration is preceded by the qualifier unofficial while the second refers to those that are related to traffic control devices.from the repetition of the words,with the unofficial qualifier limited to the first usage,it appears that the legislature understood unofficial signs to refer to signs other than those related to traffic control devices.
the majority interpretation of section limits its reach to signs related to traffic control devices,thus rendering the words unofficial sign,signal,device,or marking surplusage.but what has been called a cardinal rule of statutory construction dictates that courts must avoid an interpretation that would make some of the statutory words surplusage.moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,people gilbert cal d.in construing the statute,we must,if it is possible,give effect to the words unofficial sign,signal,device,or marking.
a statute should not be read
