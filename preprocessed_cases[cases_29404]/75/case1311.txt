background 
on june,robert black purchased two delta airline tickets for travel from worth to las vegas leaving that afternoon and returning on june.the invoice from black travel agent showed two reservations for black and his wife.although the invoice assigned black seats for both directions,his wife had an assigned seat only for the return flight.black travel agent and manager of smith travel limousine,melissa shinn,suggested that black ask the delta gate agent if he and his wife could sit together in first class for the dallas to las vegas flight.
upon arrival at the departure gate,black requested adjacent seats in first class.the gate agent said that he would see what he could do.as other passengers boarded the plane,a delta gate supervisor,al perez,appeared and informed black that he and his wife did not have two confirmed seats for the flight.while delta had a confirmed seat for black,it only had a confirmed coach seat for his wife,whom delta placed on a priority waiting list for first class.perez told black that,unless a passenger relinquished a seat,black wife would be seated in coach for the flight from dallas to las vegas.this would not,however,affect her seat for the return flight.at black request,perez spoke by telephone with shinn.shinn told perez that her computer showed two confirmed seats from dallas to las vegas.delta computers,however,did not show a confirmed seat for black wife.
unable to provide black wife with accommodations,delta offered several alternatives the blacks could sit in coach on their scheduled flight,they could fly separately on the scheduled flight,one in coach and one in first class,they could fly first class on a later flight to los angeles and then connect to las vegas,or they could take a direct flight later that day to las vegas with confirmed seats.each of these alternatives included free travel vouchers,which black asserts could be used only for coach seats.black declined delta offers.instead,the blacks drove to love field airport and chartered a private jet to and from las vegas at a cost of,which included the aircrew expenses in las vegas for two days.
black sued delta for breach of contract and intentional and negligent misrepresentation,and sued perez for misrepresentation only delta and perez moved for summary judgment on four grounds preemption under the ada,black failure to mitigate damages,lack of causation,and lack of an agency relationship between smith travel and delta.the trial court granted summary judgment for delta and perez,without specifying the grounds.black appealed the judgment.
the court of appeals reversed the trial court judgment and remanded the case for trial.the court of appeals held that fact issues precluded judgment as a matter of law on the causation,mitigation,and agency issues.at.as to the key issue before this court,the court of appeals held that black claims were not preempted by the ada because federal airline regulations allow passengers whose reservations are not honored due to overbooking to seek recovery for damages in a court of law or in some other manner.id.at.we granted perez and delta petition for review to decide the single issue perez and delta collectively,delta.
applicable 
federal preemption of state law is grounded in the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,which provides that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,art.vi,cl.under the supremacy clause,if a state law conflicts with federal law,the state law is preempted and without effect.maryland louisiana,d.preemption can take one of several forms.a federal law may preempt a state law expressly.great dane trailers,estate of wells.it may also preempt a state law impliedly,either i when the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to support a reasonable inference that congress left no room for supplementary state regulation or ii if the state law actually conflicts with federal regulations.id.a state law presents an actual conflict when a party can not comply with both state and federal regulations or when the state law would obstruct congress purposes and objectives.id.
the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case.retail clerks int l ass schermerhorn,d.congressional intent is discerned primarily from the statute language and structure.medtronic,lohr,d.also relevant is the purpose of the statute as a whole,which is revealed through the reviewing court reasoned understanding of the way in which congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme to affect business,consumers,and the law.id.
we begin our analysis with a discussion of the relevant federal statute and the united states supreme court cases that control this area.
statutory framework 
before,the federal aviation act of faa authorized the civil aeronautics board cab to regulate the interstate airline industry.current version at am.airlines,wolens,d.the act provided that nothing in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute,but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.thus,before,states were allowed to regulate intrastate airfare.morales trans world airlines,d.
in,congress amended the faa by enacting the airline deregulation act ada,which deregulated the industry.a,a a formerly codified at a,a.in enacting the ada,congress determined that maximum reliance on competitive market forces would best further efficiency,innovation,and low prices as well as variety and quality of air transportation services.morales,at.quoting a,a.congress included an express preemption provision in the ada t o ensure that the states would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own.morales,at.the preemption clause states 
except as provided in this subsection,a state,political subdivision of a state,or political authority of at least states may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier 
b emphasis added thus,to determine the propriety of the court of appeals judgment,we must ascertain whether black state law claims fall within the ada express preemption provision.if they do,black claims fail.
morales and wolens 
the supreme court has discussed the scope of the ada express preemption clause on two occasions.it first considered the ada preemptive scope in morales,at.there,the court examined whether the ada preempted enforcement of guidelines concerning regulation of airline fare advertising through texas consumer protection statutes.id.at.the court focused on the preemption clause relating to language.id.at.relying on its erisa line of cases and the ordinary meaning of the statute words,the court construed the phrase relating to broadly to preempt state enforcement actions having a connection with,or reference to,airline rates,routes,or services.id.at.based on this broad preemptive purpose,the court rejected contentions that section a only preempted states from actually prescribing rates,routes,or services,or that only state laws specifically aimed at the airline industry were preempted.id.at.
although the court warned that some state actions may affect airline fares in too tenuous,remote,or peripheral a manner to have preemptive effect,it concluded that the obligations imposed by the guidelines would impact airlines ability to market their product and the fares they charged.id.at.quoting shaw delta air lines,d.thus,the guidelines had a forbidden significant effect on the airlines rates,routes,and services,primarily because they restricted fare advertising,which relates to price.id.at.the court held that,under these circumstances,the ada preempted the fare advertising provisions in the general state consumer protection statutes at issue.id.at.
the only other time the court has addressed the scope of the ada preemption provision was in american airlines,wolens,d.that case involved state law consumer fraud and breach of contract claims arising from retroactive changes in an airline frequent flyer program.id.at.the court focused on another portion of the ada preemption phrase enact or enforce any laws to determine the ada preemptive scope.id.at.it held that,like the guidelines at issue in morales,illinois consumer fraud statute serve d as a means to guide and police the marketing practices of the airlines.id.at.thus,the ada preempted the plaintiffs consumer fraud claims.id.
the court then turned to the plaintiffs breach of contract claims.id.it held that the ada preemption clause did not shield airlines from suits alleging no violation of obligations,but seeking recovery solely for the airline alleged breach of its own,undertakings.id.at.the court reasoned that some of the terms and conditions airlines offer,such as frequent flyer programs,are private obligations and do not amount to state enactment or enforcement of any law,rule,regulation,standard,or other provision having the force and effect of law within the meaning of section a.id.at.the court limited its holding,however,to suits based on the terms of the parties bargain with no enlargement or enhancement based on state laws or policies external to the agreement.id.at.courts have interpreted this to mean that if a contract claim can not be adjudicated without resort to external law,the claim is preempted by the ada.see,smith comair,cir boon ins.agency,am.airlines,pet.denied howell alaska airlines.
in the wake of the supreme court decisions in morales and wolens,lower federal and state courts have struggled with determining when the ada preempts state law claims this court considered the scope of the ada preemption clause in continental airlines,kiefer.in kiefer,we decided the extent to which state negligence actions against airlines are preempted by the ada.id.at.following morales and wolens,we applied a analysis to determine whether the plaintiffs personal injury claims were preempted.id.at see also b.first,we examined whether the claims related to airline rates,routes,or services.id.at.second,we explored whether the claims constituted the enactment or enforcement of a state law,rule,regulation,standard or other provision.id.at.we concluded that,although the plaintiffs personal injury claims clearly related to airlines services,their claims did not amount to enforcement of a state law and thus were not preempted.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion,we acknowledged the difficulty in differentiating between claims that are preempted and those that are not.id.at.we noted that,unlike the state consumer protection legislation at issue in morales,negligence actions do not carry the same potential for intrusive regulation of airline business practices id.at quoting wolens,at.we were careful to state,however,that certain tort actions,such as negligent misrepresentation,may be indistinguishable from the statutory consumer protection actions in morales and wolens.id.at.and depending on the nature and extent of damages sought,even simple negligence actions may constitute an impermissible regulation of the airline industry through state tort law.id.at.
rather than declare categorically that personal injury claims are always excepted from preemption,we focused on the extent to which the claims in kiefer threatened to encroach on the congressional objective of airline deregulation.id.because preemption depends on the nature of the particular claim,we observed that the ada preemptive effect on other state law claims would require a closer working out.id.at.with respect to breach of contract claims,we noted that the very strict limitation wolens puts on permissible contract claims demonstrates the breadth of ada preemption.id.like wolens,we recognized that the ada allows breach of contract claims only if they involve contract terms voluntarily undertaken by the parties.id.at.and we noted that voluntary contractual undertakings do not effectuate purposes that could have a prohibited regulatory effect on airlines.id.at.
with this framework in mind,we turn to a closer working out of the ada preemption clause with respect to black claims.wolens,at.kiefer,at.
black contends that wolens and kiefer shield his breach of contract claim from preemption.he argues that,by refusing to provide his wife a seat on the flight from dallas to las vegas,delta breached a contractual obligation.because his claims arise from delta own undertakings,as opposed to an obligation imposed by state law,black argues that there is little risk similar state claims would undo federal deregulation.thus,according to black,his claims are not subject to preemption under the ada.
delta,on the other hand,contends that black claims are preempted by the ada because they relate directly to the airline services delta provides.delta argues that ticketing and boarding procedures are fundamental to airline services and are far removed in character from the voluntary frequent flyer program at issue in wolens.specifically,delta contends that because department of transportation dot regulations define and control the procedures for denied boarding,black state law claims are preempted.for the reasons discussed below,we agree with delta.
related to an airline services 
to answer whether a claim is preempted by the ada,we first determine whether the claim is related to an airline prices or services within the meaning of the ada preemption provision.kiefer,at.the ada does not specify,and the united states supreme court has not determined,what activities constitute airline services.it is not surprising,then,that courts have fashioned inconsistent tests for determining whether a state law action is related to an airline services.compare charas trans world airlines,cir,with hodges delta airlines,cir.the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit has narrowly defined services as the prices,schedules,origins and destinations of the transportation of passengers,cargo,or mail.charas,at.that court reasoned that because the word services appears next to the words rates and routes in section b,services must refer to the provision of air transportation to and from various markets at various times.id.at.under this interpretation,beverages,personal assistance to passengers,handling luggage,keeping aisles clear,and other amenities are not included in the definition of services.id.at.
the fifth circuit more expansive interpretation of airline services includes ticketing,boarding procedures,provision of food and drink,and baggage handling,in addition to the transportation itself.hodges,at.hodges relied in part on the cab statements implementing the ada,which made clear that reservation and boarding practices are services within the meaning of the ada.see id.at citing,see also smith am.airlines,cir limiting services to economic decisions concerning boarding,overbooking or charter arrangements,and contractual decisions whether to board particular ticketed passengers.the hodges court reasoned that,because these matters are all appurtenant and necessarily included with the contract of carriage between the passenger or shipper and the airline,congress intende
