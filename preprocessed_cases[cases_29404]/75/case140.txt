new york vehicle and traffic law requires automobile manufacturers to honor warranty agreements with customers and to compensate franchised dealers for labor and parts associated with warranty repair services at a rate that shall not be less than the price and rate charged by the franchised motor vehicle dealers in the community or marketing area for like services to contract customers,provided such price and rate are reasonable.veh.traf.law.the principal issue raised by this appeal is whether a franchised dealership that over many years consistently submitted claims and accepted reimbursement at a manufacturer standard rate,without ever seeking additional compensation,may thereafter hold the manufacturer liable under section for additional compensation on past claims,or whether its initial requests for and acquiescence in reimbursement at the standard rate preclude relief.
the plaintiffs in this diversity action are new york car dealerships who sued general motors corporation gm under section and their franchise agreements with the company,claiming that gm standard reimbursement rate for warranty repair parts is too low under the statute.the parties proceeded to discovery solely on the claims of fulton,fulton,and gm successfully moved for summary judgment dismissing fulton claims.this appeal followed.
background 
gm is a delaware corporation that manufactures and distributes automobiles in the united states through a network of authorized dealers operating under the trade names buick,chevrolet,pontiac,gmc truck,hummer,and cadillac.since,fulton has been an authorized cadillac and chevrolet dealer in middletown,new york,pursuant to a series of franchise agreements with gm.
like most automotive manufacturers,gm warrants certain parts,systems,and accessories in connection with the retail sale of its cars and reimburses franchised dealers for performing repair work under these warranties.in order to be reimbursed for parts and labor provided in connection with a warranty repair,dealers must submit a claim to gm using a computerized system called the warranty information network system wins to use this program,which allows gm to reimburse dealers across the country based on a uniform methodology,a dealer electronically inputs into a computer certain information about the work performed in connection with a warranty repair job.the dealer is not required to submit underlying repair orders,but must input the repair order number and date,the vehicle identification number of the car under repair,the vehicle mileage,the applicable labor operation number,the primary failed part number,and the parts reimbursement amount.the line total,which reflects the total amount of reimbursement the dealer is requesting for the warranty repair,is then calculated automatically by the dealer computer pursuant to a formula,and the dealer is given the opportunity to review the line total before submitting the claim.
wins typically reviews,approves,and pays warranty claims automatically without any individual review by a gm employee.the system will not approve a claim automatically,however,if it does not fall within certain parameters,for example,if it seeks reimbursement for repair parts in an amount that exceeds a certain ceiling.that ceiling is determined pursuant to a formula,which involves multiplying the dealer list prices for the parts being used in the repair by a standard parts markup for the dealer.the standard parts markup used by wins for most dealers in the united states currently is forty percent.hence,for most dealers,a reimbursement claim will not be approved automatically by wins if it seeks more than percent of the dealer list prices for the parts used in the repair.
although most claims submitted through wins are processed in this way,there are several mechanisms for bypassing the automated procedure and seeking reimbursement at a higher rate than that allowed by the ordinary wins formula.for example,if a dealer wants a gm employee to review an individual reimbursement claim,it can the claim via the wins program to its gm service representative and include comments explaining why individualized review is desired and seeking permission to submit a claim for reimbursement at a higher rate.in addition,dealers may submit p code claims when a warranty repair requires more parts than the limit provided for by the associated labor operation.wins allows a dealer also to submit a case add credit in circumstances where it seeks additional reimbursement on a previously submitted claim.
dealers may submit warranty reimbursement claims via wins at any time.the program processes standard claims twice per week,and provides dealers with claims memos on the day following such processing.these memos report the disposition of any warranty claims submitted during the last cycle.approximately ninety percent of warranty claims are approved upon initial submission,and ordinarily are paid within ten days.if a dealer is unhappy with the disposition of a claim,however,it can resubmit the claim using the procedure and include comments explaining the dealer dissatisfaction.the dealer also may appeal directly to its service representative,or invoke certain dispute resolution procedures described in its franchise agreement with gm.
all authorized gm dealers throughout the united states use wins to submit warranty reimbursement claims.gm processes and pays approximately million claims through wins each year.during,gm approved about million claims from new york dealers,which accounted for approximately million in reimbursements.
since,fulton regularly has submitted warranty reimbursement claims to gm.in the period from to,it submitted approximately claims,which resulted in compensation from gm in excess of million.fulton dealer sales and service agreement with gm provides that dealer agrees to timely submit true and accurate applications or claims for payments.according to the deposition testimony of fulton owner,jonathan worts,each of the claims submitted by fulton since was true and accurate.
fulton concedes that while it occasionally submitted requests for unusual or additional labor costs,it never sought additional payment for parts or otherwise requested that gm reimburse it for warranty parts at a higher markup than the rate used by wins for automatic claim processing.indeed,the parties know of no new york gm dealer that has submitted an individual warranty claim seeking in excess of gm standard rate for parts reimbursement fulton insists that such a request would be futile.the record shows,however,that gm has received such claims from dealers in other states,such as illinois,maine,and new jersey,either through wins or by letter,and typically has honored them after verifying what the appropriate rate of reimbursement should be.indeed,worts owns a chevrolet dealership in new jersey that requested a higher rate in accordance with new jersey law.since,this dealership has been able to use a special wins code to receive reimbursement at this higher rate.
on july,ten present and former gm dealers in new york filed a complaint against gm.on december,they filed an amended complaint,adding fulton and seven other plaintiffs,one of which subsequently dismissed its claims voluntarily.the gist of the amended complaint is that the standard parts markup used by wins is approximately thirty percentage points below the parts markup used by dealers in plaintiffs community for repairs the complaint alleges also that because wins allows a dealer to submit only limited information about a warranty repair,it is designed to frustrate any attempt to add additional information or add more particular information,such that if a dealer attempts to input a reimbursement rate other than the rate that gm computer sets as a default,that dealer claim can not be processed.accordingly,plaintiffs allege,gm requirement that dealers use wins to submit reimbursement claims has led to systematic undercompensation for warranty repair parts since,when new york vehicle and traffic law was amended to require reimbursement at the rate prevailing in the dealer community for repair parts 
the dealers asserted claims under section as well as a provision of gm standard franchise agreement requiring the company to comply with all applicable laws.the dealers seek,inter alia,incremental payment on previously submitted claims based on what they allegedly would have been paid had gm used a proper markup for parts,as well as an injunction barring gm from using its standard,nationwide formula to determine reimbursement amounts for warranty repairs performed by new york dealers.
fulton was chosen as the test plaintiff and the parties proceeded to discovery only on fulton claims,which revealed the above undisputed facts.gm moved for summary judgment,denying any violation of section,but arguing also that fulton is precluded from suing under the statute because it has requested and accepted payment based on the standard parts markup rate without complaint since.the district court granted the motion and dismissed fulton claims.tom rice gmc truck,motors,civ.nrb,wl.fulton now appeals.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and resolving all factual ambiguities in its favor.singh city of new york,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the movant shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
this appeal hinges primarily on a single question of law whether fulton consistent requests for and acceptance of payment at gm standard warranty reimbursement rate,without asking for more or notifying gm of its belief that a higher rate might be warranted under vehicle and traffic law,precludes recovery of additional payment under the statute for past claims.neither the new york court of appeals nor any intermediate new york appellate court has addressed this question.in the absence of authoritative law from the state highest court,we must either predict how the new york court of appeals would resolve the state law question,or,if state law is so uncertain that we can make no reasonable prediction,certify the question to the new york court of appeals for a definitive resolution.dibella hopkins,cir.in this case,we find the former option appropriate and conclude that fulton failure to demand additional compensation for any past claims pursuant to section precludes the relief it now seeks.
our cardinal function in interpreting a new york statute is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.abrams ford motor,see stat.law.as the clearest indicator of legislative intent is the statutory text,the starting point in any case of interpretation must always be the language itself,giving effect to the plain meaning thereof.majewski cent.sch,see stat.law.we therefore begin,as we must,with the text of section,which reads in relevant part as follows 
every franchisor shall properly fulfill any warranty agreement franchisor service contract and shall compensate each of its franchised motor vehicle dealers for warranty parts and labor in amounts which reflect fair and reasonable compensation for such work.all warranty claims claims under a franchisor service contract made by franchised motor vehicle dealers shall be paid within thirty days following their approval provided,however,that the franchisor retains the right to audit such claims for a period of two years following the submission thereof,and to charge back any amounts paid on false,fraudulent,incorrect or unsubstantiated claims.for parts and labor reimbursement,fair and reasonable compensation shall not be less than the price and rate charged by the franchised motor vehicle dealers in the community or marketing area for like services to contract customers,provided such price and rate are reasonable.
all warranty claims shall be either approved or disapproved within thirty days after their receipt.when any such claim is disapproved the franchised motor vehicle dealer shall be notified in writing of its disapproval within said period.each such notice shall state the specific grounds upon which the disapproval is based.
veh.traf.law 
section plainly imposes on the obligation to reimburse franchised motor vehicle dealers for warranty repair parts in amounts which reflect fair and reasonable compensation.the statute likewise plainly contemplates that franchisees will submit claims for such compensation.because fulton requested payment on past warranty reimbursement claims,the issue here is whether gm payment of the requested amount discharged its duty to pay under the statute,or whether it had an additional obligation to pay more,regardless of what was requested.that is,we must determine whether a claim for purposes of section is a demand for money in a particular amount,such that it is paid when the demanded amount is disbursed,or whether a claim more generally is a simple request for money,not necessarily for any particular amount,such that it is paid only when the statutory rate is given,regardless of the amount actually requested.
relying principally on ralph oldsmobile general motors,civ.ags,wl,fulton argues that because the statute imposes on a manufacturer the duty to provide statutorily defined fair and reasonable compensation for warranty parts,but says nothing of a dealer obligation to make a particularized claim requesting a specific dollar figure,a manufacturer is required to pay the statutory amount no matter how much is,whether any specific dollar amount is requested at all.see id.at concluding that dealers could pursue claims against gm under section despite requesting and acquiescing in payment at lower amounts.we disagree.
the relevant dictionary definition of claim is a demand for compensation,benefits,or payment in conformity with a law or contract,and also the amount or payment of such a demand.webster third new international dictionary emphasis added.a claim is thus not only a demand for payment in accordance with an insurance policy or other formal arrangement,but also t he sum of money demanded.the american heritage dictionary of the english language ed emphasis added.we conclude that the most natural and obvious understanding of claim in the context of section is a request for reimbursement in a specific amount.
this reading makes sense of section broader context.by its plain terms,the statute obliges a manufacturer not only to provide fair and reasonable compensation for warranty parts,but also to approve or disapprove all warranty claims within thirty days after their receipt to notify the dealer in writing of any disapproved claim within the thirty day period,stat ing the specific grounds upon which the disapproval is based and to pay approved claims within thirty days following their approval.veh.traf.law.though it is possible to read this language as contemplating the submission of claims without regard to amount,the more natural construction of these provisions is that they together provide a mechanism by which dealers and manufacturers can identify and communicate openly about areas of disagreement as to what constitutes fair and reasonable compensation.but this requires that dealers submit claims not in the abstract,but for specific amounts.otherwise it is hard to fathom how a manufacturer might approve or disapprove the claim in most cases,much less provide reasons for its rejection.darling ford motor,me,noting,with regard to a maine statute imposing similar obligations on manufacturers,that a ccomplishing these objectives necessarily requires that a dealer submit a claim that is sufficiently individualized to enable a manufacturer to satisfy these obligations.
furthermore,the new york court of appeals instructs courts to construe new york statutes in ways that avoid objectionable,unreasonable or absurd consequences.long state,see stat.law.adopting the position advanced by fulton would unreasonably burden manufacturers such as gm,since they could no longer assume that simply paying the full amount requested by a dealer would resolve a claim.under fulton view,if a manufacturer wished to protect itself against potentially expensive litigation,it would have to conduct an inquiry not simply with regard to contested clai
