arizona life coalition life coalition appeals a summary judgment in favor of stacey stanton and other members of the arizona license plate commission collectively the commission.life coalition contends that the commission violated its first amendment right to free speech and fourteenth amendment right to equal protection by arbitrarily denying its application for a special arizona organization license plate that would portray its message choose life.we agree that the commission violated life coalition first amendment right to free speech and therefore do not reach its equal protection argument.
messages conveyed through special organization possessing some characteristics of government primarily private speech.through its special organization license plate program,arizona has created a limited public forum for all nonprofit organizations that meet the state statutory requirements.because the commission denied life coalition application on grounds not specified in the statute or related to the limited purpose of the license plate forum,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the commission.
the parties do not dispute the facts,and there is no material issue of fact to prevent summary judgment from being entered.life coalition is an arizona nonprofit corporation that provides compassionate care to persons who are considering abortion,or who are affected by abortion.in june,life coalition resubmitted an application for a speciality plate that would display life coalition official logo,a small graphic of two children faces and the motto,choose life.the arizona department of transportation department certified that life coalition met the requirements of arizona revised statute section g and submitted life coalition request for its special license plate to the commission 
upon receiving a request,section b provides that 
t he c ommission shall authorize a special organization plate if the organization meets the following requirements 
the primary activity or interest of the organization serves the community,contributes to the welfare of others and is not offensive or discriminatory in its purpose,nature,activity or name 
the name of the organization or any part of the organization purpose does not promote any specific product or brand name that is provided for sale and 
the purpose of the organization does not promote a specific religion,faith or antireligious belief.
emphasis added.
the commission first considered life coalition application in august.members of the commission raised concerns over whether the general public would believe arizona had endorsed the message of the choose life license plate,as well as concerns over whether groups with differing viewpoints would file applications.to obtain legal advice,the commission tabled life coalition application without taking action.
to alleviate the commission concerns,life coalition filed a revised application on september.in this application life coalition proposed including its name on the plate design.the commission considered life coalition revised application in an august meeting.during the meeting,gary paisley,chairman of life coalition,explained how life coalition served the community it organized a diaper drive,after which life coalition donated thousands of diapers to the arizona diaper bank life coalition purpose is to provide compassionate services to those people that are considering or have been affected by abortion including pregnancy tests,pregnancy counseling,and relationship counseling and life coalition established a hotline for women who are pregnant.paisley also told the commission that life coalition membership included approximately organizations and individuals.paisley then confirmed that a person or organization must subscribe to life coalition statement of principles to become a member 
initially,the commission declined to take action on life coalition application.after paisley implored the commission to explain what statutory requirements life coalition failed to satisfy,a member of the commission moved to formally deny the application,which passed by voice vote.chairwoman stanton replied to paisley request for an explanation by stating that the action of the commission is final and that she did not believe now is an opportunity for further debate,or for further info that life coalition could put on additional applications.
life coalition filed suit in the united states district court for the district of arizona on september.it filed its first amended verified complaint on december.pertinent to this appeal,life coalition moved for summary judgment on november,and the commission for summary judgment on january.the district court denied life coalition motion for summary judgment,and granted the commission for summary judgment.life coalition timely appealed.we reverse.
we review de novo a grant of summary judgment.balint carson city,cir.the tax injunction act tia,imposes a jurisdictional limitation on federal courts.hoohuli ariyoshi,cir,overruled on other grounds as recognized by arakaki lingle,cir.we are required to raise jurisdictional issues sua sponte,and we note the tia application in the special organization plate context has been raised by our sister circuits.compare am.civil liberties union of bredesen,cir rejecting the argument that the tia barred suit because the extra payments for special organization plates resemble payments for simple purchases from the government and are not taxes,with henderson stalder,cir concluding that the additional charges for speciality plates are taxes because they sustain the essential flow of revenue to the government,are imposed by a state or municipal legislature,and are designed to provide a benefit for the entire community.therefore,although neither party questions whether the tia precludes jurisdiction in this case,we nonetheless address it here.
the tia provides that t he district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.in arizona,drivers must pay an additional dollar fee to obtain a special organization plate.the issue is whether the money paid to obtain a special organization plate constitutes a tax to which the tia would apply.
we find persuasive the sixth circuit analysis in bredesen and hold the extra fee is not a tax.the transaction between a state vehicle owner and the issuing authority is more akin to a contractual debt than a state imposed tax.arizona has not coerced a sale attendant to the requirement that cars bear license plates to assist in identifying their owners,but has instead induced willing purchasers to agree to pay a certain extra sum of money in return for the right to bear a special message on an organizational license plate.see bredesen,at see also women res.network gourley,d,the additional payments are voluntarily paid by a limited group of motorists who wish to both support a special cause,and presumably desire to display that support on their license plate.
the sixth circuit reasoning is supported by our decision in bidart brothers california apple commission,cir.there,we recognized that the additional charge does not have to be characterized as a tax or a regulatory fee.id.at.in determining whether the tia applies,the ultimate question remains whether an assessment is a state tax.id.because the additional charges for a special organization plate are more akin to a contractual payment than a tax,we hold that the tia does not apply to life coalition suit.we therefore retain jurisdiction to hear its federal constitutional claim.
we must decide whether,by authorizing a specialty license plate sought by a nonprofit organization to display its message and the message of the organization members,the state of arizona has adopted that speech as its own.it is undeniable that when the government speaks for itself,it may take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message is neither garbled nor distorted.planned parenthood of rose,cir plurality quoting rosenberger rector and visitors of of,d see also sons of confederate veterans,comm r of.dep t of motor vehicles,cir,reh g en banc denied,cir it is well established that the government can speak for itself.quoting bd.of regents of of.southworth,d.however,when the government regulates private speech,we must conduct a traditional first amendment analysis.rose,at see also pmg int l,rumsfeld,cir.
there is some question as to what standard we should apply in differentiating between private and government speech.in johanns livestock marketing ass n,d,the court addressed whether a federal program that requires beef producers to finance promotional messages to support the beef industry beef.it what for dinner violated the first amendment.id.at.the court held that w hen the government sets the overall message to be communicated and approves every word that is disseminated,it is government speech.id.at.and,because t he message set out in the beef promotions is from beginning to end the message established by the federal government,congress directed the implementation of a coordinated program of promotion,including paid advertising,to advance the image and desirability of beef and beef products,and the secretary of agriculture exercise d final approval authority over every word used in every promotional campaign,the beef promotional messages represented government speech.id.at.
in bredesen,the sixth circuit relied on johanns to hold that the tennessee statute authorizing a specialty license plate with a choose life logotype did not violate the first amendment,despite the fact that the legislature refused to make available license plates with a or message.id.at.in doing so,the sixth circuit nearly identical fourth circuit reasoning in rose,in part because the fourth circuit had relied on the test.see bredesen,at.
prior to johanns,the fourth,eighth,and tenth circuits had adopted a nonexhaustive list of four factors to differentiate between the two types of speech.those factors are 
the central purpose of the program in which the speech in question occurs the degree of editorial control exercised by the government or private entities over the content of the speech the identity of the literal speaker and whether the government or the private entity bears the ultimate responsibility for the content of the speech,in analyzing circumstances where both government and a private entity are claimed to be speaking.
sons of confederate veterans,at citing wells city and county of denver,cir knights of the ku klux klan curators of the of,cir 
as noted by judge martin in his dissenting opinion in bredesen,johanns is factually distinguishable from these specialty license plate cases.at martin,dissenting.johanns involved a subsidy of government speech.johanns,at.specialty license plate programs do not raise issues regarding or a.see id.discussing the difference between cases and cases see generally paramount land cal.pistachio comm n,cir applying johanns in a case.in johanns,the individual harm was being forced to give the government money to pay for someone else message.bredesen,at martin,dissenting.in specialty license plate cases,private individuals choose to pay the price for obtaining a particular specialty license plate.the first amendment harm is being denied the opportunity to speak on the same terms as other private citizens within a government sponsored forum.id.at.moreover,specialty plate programs are not part of a larger governmental scheme to encourage some private activity,like beef consumption.andy olree,specialty license plates look who talking in the sixth circuit.law,may.in light of these differences,judge martin believed that t he government speech doctrine,as it is used in johanns is inapplicable to specialty license plate cases such as this.bredesen,at.
although we agree with judge martin in that johanns is factually distinguishable,we believe that johanns is instructive when determining whether the message constitutes government or private speech.in concluding that the beef program represented government speech,the court relied on factors similar to those set forth in the test.it considered who controlled the speech,at,the purpose of the program,id.at,and the fact that the secretary of agriculture exercised final editorial control over the promotional campaign,id.we therefore adopt the fourth circuit by the supreme court decision in determine whether messages conveyed through arizona special organization plate program constitute government or private speech.
the commission argues that the primary function of arizona license special the state need to identify a vehicle and its owner.it cites kahn department of motor vehicles,th,d,where the california court of appeal stated 
a vehicle license plate is a display of registered vehicle identification.that the state permits license holders,for an additional fee,to vary minimally their vehicle identification from the prescribed form by selecting letter number combinations which may reflect an individual personal or professional identity,or possibly express a thought or idea,is purely incidental to the primary function of vehicle identification.
id.at,d.life coalition argues that the speciality license plates offer something more the opportunity to identify themselves with individualized messages via these specialized plates as well as the opportunity to benefit worthy organizations financially.
we agree with life coalition.while the primary purpose of any vehicle license plate is vehicle identification and registration,we are not concerned with the general validity of arizona licensing requirements.rose,at stating that the primary purpose of a south carolina statute authorizing a specialty license plate with the words choose life was to promote the state preference for the position sons of confederate veterans,at stating that the primary purpose of virginia special plate program is to collect revenue choose life illinois,white,wl,concluding that the purpose of the illinois specialty plate program is to raise revenue for the state as well as to allow for some private expression.rather,we must address arizona speciality license plate program as a whole.see sons of confederate veterans,at.
by allowing organizations to obtain speciality license plates with their logo and motto,arizona is providing a forum in which philanthropic organizations,see.b,can exercise their first amendment rights in the hopes of raising money to support their cause.see.setting the fee for specialty license plates at dollars id.f stating that eight dollars of the fee is a specialty plate administration fee and seventeen dollars is an annual donation to the organization.as in sons of confederate veterans,the fee structure for arizona speciality plates suggests the program aim.see at.before obtaining approval from the department,the organization must certify that it either has members or that it will agree to pay the production and program costs for the special organization plate.g sons of confederate veterans,at the very structure of the program requiring prepaid applicants ensures that only special plate messages popular enough among private individuals to produce a certain amount of revenue will be expressed.
the revenue raising purpose of the arizona special organization plate program supports a finding of private speech.
the commission de minimis editorial control over the plate design and color does not support a finding that the messages conveyed by the organization constitute government speech.the arizona legislature has chosen to limit the license plate forum to only those organizations that serve the community,contribute to the welfare of others and are not offensive or discriminatory in their purpose,nature,activity or name.b.in addition,the organizations can not promote a specific religion,faith or antireligious belief.id.
however,as life coalition notes in its brief,the statutory requirements address who may speak,not what they may say.for instance,in rose,the choose life license plate originated with the state,and the legislature determined that the plate will bear the message choose life.at.therefore,the state exercised control over the substantive content of the speech.sons of confederate veterans,at noting that virginia license plate design criteria do not contain guidelines regarding the substantive content of the plates or any indication of reasons,other than failure to comply with size and space restrictions see also johanns,at.noting that the secretary role in the beef campaign extended beyond granting final approval or rejection government officials also attend ed and participat ed in the open meetings at which proposals we re developed emphasis added.
in this case,the idea of a choose life license plate originated with life coalition.while the commission determined whether life coalition met the statutory guidelines for gaining access to the license plate forum,life coalition determined the substantive content of their message.wells,at concluding that this factor weighed in favor of government speech because there wa s no indication that any of the private speakers even knew about the happy holidays sign,much less exercised any editorial control over its design or content choose life illinois,wl,at stating that this factor weighed in favor of private speech because the idea and message of the choose life plate originated with a private organization,choose life illinois,not the legislature.
therefore,this factor weighs in favor of private speech.
o wnership of the means of communication i s a valid consideration in determining whether the license plate contained government speech.sons of confederate veterans,at wells,at.therefore,the fact that arizona owns the special organization plates supports a finding that the state is the literal speaker.however,in wooley maynard,d,the supreme court indicated that messages conveyed through license plates implicate private speech interests because of the connection of any message on the plate to the driver or owner of the vehicle.sons of confederate veterans,at discussing wooley,at.see also johanns,at.in wooley,we held that requiring a new hampshire couple to bear the state motto,live free or die,on their cars license plates was an impermissible compulsion of expression.relying on wooley,most courts that have addressed vanity plates have concluded the messages are private speech.sons of confederate veterans,at see also rose,at the literal speaker of the choose life message on the specialty plate therefore appears to be the vehicle owner,not the state,just as the literal speaker of the bumper sticker message is the vehicle owner,not the producer of the bumper sticker.perry mcdonald,cir stating that a restriction on vanity plates concern ed private individuals speech on property lewis wilson,cir characterizing a restriction on vanity plates as a restriction on private speech choose life illinois,wl,concluding that a private individual is the literal speaker with specialty plates because they pay an extra fee to express a certain message.
this factor has characteristics of both private and government speech.nevertheless,in this situation,where life coalition logo depicting the faces of two young children will also be displayed on the license plate supporting the message choose life,we conclude that it weighs in favor of finding this to be primarily private speech.
the question of who bears ultimate responsibility for the choose life license plate is very similar to the question of who is the literal speaker.see rose,at sons of confederate veterans,at.p rivate individual s choose to spend additional money to obtain the plate and to display its message s on their vehicle.rose,at.here,life coalition submitted its motto to be placed on a speciality license plate that would also identify the organization by name.life coalition controlled the message of its special organization plate,and the individual members who choose to purchase the plate voluntarily choose to disperse that message.johanns,at.noting that congress directed implementation of the promotional plan and that congress and the secretary determined what the promotional campaigns shall contain rose,at finding that the drivers bore ultimate responsibility for the choose life license plate authorized by the state legislature.
it is true that,like the secretary in johanns,arizona developed the program that allows nonprofit organizations such as life coalition to obtain specialty license plates.however,in johanns the beef producers had no choice but to support the beef ad.in comparison,there is nothing in the record to even suggest that arizona intended to adopt the message of each special organization plate as its own state speech.instead,the burden is on the nonprofit organization.if it wants to convey a certain message through the arizona specialty plate program,it must take the affirmative step of submitting an application.this suggests that it is life coalition,rather than the state of arizona,that bears ultimate responsibility for the content of the speech.
we therefore hold that the choose life message displayed through a speciality license plate if issued by arizona would constitute private speech.
having determined that the choose life message would represent private speech,we must now determine whether the commission has acted appropriately under the first amendment.the first step in assessing a first amendment claim relating to private speech on government property is to identify the nature of the forum,because the extent to which the government may limit access depends on whether the forum is public or nonpublic.sammartano first judicial dist.court,cir quoting cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d.in defining the forum,we must focus on the access sought by the speaker.when speakers seek general access to public property,the forum encompasses that property.in cases in which limited access is sought,the supreme court cases have taken a more tailored approach to ascertain the perimeters of a forum within the confines of the government property.cornelius,at.citation omitted.here,the forum is arizona license plates.lehman city of shaker heights,d treating the advertising spaces on city owned buses as the forum.
a public forum may be created by government designation of a place or channel of communication for use by the public at large for assembly and speech,for use by certain speakers,or for the discussion of certain subjects.cornelius,at.in a designated public forum,speakers can not be excluded unless it is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and the exclusion is narrowly drawn to achieve that interest.sammartano,at internal quotation marks omitted.we have further refined the concept of designated public forum by carving out a subcategory we call a limited public forum.see hopper city of pasco,cir a limited public forum is a of a designated public forum that refer s to a type of nonpublic forum that the government has intentionally opened to certain groups or to certain topics.alteration in original quoting diloreto downey unified sch.dist.bd.of,cir.the government may restrict speech in limited public fora so long as the restrictions are viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the designated and limited public forum classifications ha ve been the source of much confusion.id.at.a limited public forum exists when the government intentionally opens a nonpublic forum to expressive activity by a certain class of speakers to address a particular class of topics.cogswell city of seattle,cir citing kaplan county of los angeles,cir finding a limited public forum when california created the voters pamphlets for the specific purpose of allowing a limited class of speakers,the candidates,to address a particular class of topics,statements concerning the personal background qualifications of each candidate.
we have no trouble concluding that arizona purpose was to open up its license plate forum to a certain class of organizations for expressive activity.faith ctr.church evangelistic ministries glover,cir stating that the county intended to open its library meeting room to expressive activity when it allowed all n and civic organizations,organizations,schools and governmental organizations to use the meeting room for meetings,programs,or activities of educational,cultural or community interest internal quotation marks omitted.as the commission correctly notes in its brief,h istorically,arizona license plates have served the purely governmental function of vehicle and vehicle owner identification and have been a nonpublic forum.however,arizona took the affirmative step by passing its special license plate legislation of allowing limited access to license plates publicly displayed for expressive conduct as vehicles are driven throughout the state.see sons of confederate veterans,holcomb,d,stating,in dicta,that allowing groups to place various slogans and designs on license plates represents the commonwealth intentional action to open up a nontraditional forum for public discourse.
arizona speciality plate program encompasses a wide range of philanthropic organizations with community based.section b states that the commission shall authorize a speciality license plate to all nonprofit organizations that serve the community,contribute to the welfare of others and are not offensive or discriminatory in their purpose,nature,activity or name has an organizational name or purpose that does not promote any specific product or brand name provided for sale and the organizations do not promote a specific religion,faith,or antireligious belief.
applying this statutory mandate,the commission has authorized,and the department has issued,the following special organization plates the university of phoenix alumni network bearing the university identifier,of phoenix associated fire fighters of arizona bearing the union motto,professional fire fighters fraternal order of police bearing the order identifier,fraternal order of police legion of valor bearing the legion identifier,legion of valor and wildlife conservation council bearing the council motto,conserving wildlife in addition,the commission has authorized six additional license plates,but at the time of briefing this appeal we were told the department had yet to issue them because of factors unrelated to this appeal civil air patrol arizona association of future farmers of america rotary international arizona hospice palliative care organizations red means stop coalition and arizona historical society.
nevertheless,a policy with a broad purpose is not dispositive of an intent to create a public forum by designation.faith ctr.church evangelistic ministries,at.we must therefore look closely at the commission policy and practice to determine whether arizona intended the speciality plate forum to be open for indiscriminate use.id.in other words,if arizona intended only to open the forum to certain groups or to certain topics,it has created only a limited public forum.cogswell,at internal quotation marks omitted.for instance,despite contra costa county broad purpose in opening its library meeting room to public use,we held in faith center church evangelistic ministries that the county created a limited public forum because the county policy excludes schools from using the meeting room for instructional purposes as a regular part of the curriculum and organizations who wish to engage in religious services.at.in addition,the policy requires a potential user to submit an application describing the intended use and identifying the applicant,and the application must be reviewed and approved in advance by the county.id.
similarly,arizona by statute restricts its speciality license plate program to only nonprofit organizations with community driven purposes that do not promote a specific religion,faith or antireligious belief.b.to gain access,the nonprofit organization must have its application reviewed and approved by the commission.cornelius,at.perry,at citing the fact that vermont vehicle owners must obtain permission to receive vanity plates to support its finding of a nonpublic forum.these are not abstract policy statements,but are definite and unambiguous restrictions on gaining access to the forum.see hopper,at citing christ bride ministries,se.transp,cir.
from the record before us,it is also clear that the commission has consistently applied the access restrictions when reviewing pending applications.see faith ctr.church evangelistic ministries,at citing hopper,at c onsistency in application is the hallmark of any policy designed to preserve the status of a forum.in addition to life coalition application,the commission has denied two other applications for speciality license plates.the commission unanimously denied international dark sky society application because its suggested dark blue sky motif would replace the standard arizona license plate motif in violation of other statutory requirements.see.a.the commission also denied an application submitted by aeronautical university,explaining that arizona universities had to obtain legislative plates,whereas only alumni associations may obtain the special organization license plates.in comparison to the city in hopper,through the license plate commission,arizona has retained some substantive control over the content of its speciality license plate program.see at stating that the city failed to consistently enforce its policy as it neither submitted works,nor exercised its asserted right to exclude works.
finally,we note that the nature of the forum also supports a conclusion that arizona intended only to create a limited public forum.see faith center church evangelistic ministries,at.as the second circuit noted in perry,the primary purpose in issuing license plates in general is to aid in vehicle identification.at.however,one of the primary purposes in issuing vanity license plates and,in turn,special organization plates is to raise revenue.id.nevertheless,given the general overarching purpose of aiding in vehicle identification,expression through vanity plates and,in turn,special organization plates is subject to numerous restrictions with the general public having only limited access.id.we therefore conclude that arizona speciality license plate program is a limited public forum,and that any access restriction must be viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.see faith center church evangelistic ministries,at citing cornelius,at.
the distinction between viewpoint discrimination and discrimination is not precise.rosenberger,at.the commission contends that it did not engage in viewpoint discrimination because it did not grant a special organization plate to a group with a viewpoint in opposition to life coalition and therefore,n either side of the choose life issue is represented by a special organization plate.the supreme court rejected a similar argument in rosenberger,where it found a first amendment violation when a public university withheld funding to a student publication because its paper primarily promote d or manifest ed a particular belie f in or about a deity or an ultimate reality.at.internal citations omitted alterations in original.the dissent argued that the university did not engage in viewpoint discrimination because it limited all religious speech,both theistic and atheistic.id.at.the majority rejected this argument,stating 
the dissent assertion that no viewpoint discrimination occurs because the guidelines discriminate against an entire class of viewpoints reflects an insupportable assumption that all debate is bipolar and that antireligious speech is the only response to religious speech.our understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of public discourse has not embraced such a contrived description of the marketplace of ideas.if the topic of debate is,for example,racism,then exclusion of several views on that problem is just as offensive to the first amendment as exclusion of only one.it is as objectionable to exclude both a theistic and an atheistic perspective on the debate as it is to exclude one,the other,or yet another political,economic or social viewpoint.
unlike the university system in rosenberger,the arizona statutes do not expressly prohibit speech in the license plate forum.id.stating that the guidelines prohibit religious activity.rather,the state has opened this forum to all organizations that serve the community a
