background 
factual history 
this case was adjudicated by summary judgment,so all the facts reported herein are mere allegations,and none of the allegations have been proven.rivera began working for the national railroad passenger amtrak on august,as a night watchman.shortly thereafter,rivera asserts,he discovered that his supervisor,richard carney carney,and other amtrak employees were using and selling drugs on the job.according to rivera,randy flores,rivera foreman,also used drugs and compelled rivera to use drugs by telling rivera that otherwise flores would not be able to trust him.
rivera also claims to have overheard a telephone conversation in which carney discussed plans to steal and resell amtrak parts.when carney realized that rivera had overheard the conversation,carney offered rivera not to say anything about it to anyone else.rivera later told carney that he would not take the money and did not want to be involved in the illegal activity.larry mahon mahon,a division engineer at amtrak,also purportedly approached rivera with an offer of money in exchange for his silence.when rivera refused the money,mahon told rivera to keep silent or he would be fired.
on march,carney told rivera he was being taken out of service for excessive absenteeism and falsification of a time card.rivera personal calendar reflects that rivera worked only days during the period before being taken out of service.in fact,rivera admitted that his excessive absences were in violation of amtrak attendance policy.
shortly after rivera was taken out of service,angel acevedo acevedo,a watchman for amtrak,saw rivera and reported that rivera made the following threat do be surprised if i go to the san jose amtrak office and blow people away.acevedo reported the incident to carney,who then reported it to john fallowfield,who contacted the amtrak police.acevedo submitted a written report of the encounter to the amtrak police.rivera denied making any such threat.
as a result of the alleged threat,amtrak police contacted the local police and went to rivera home to investigate.when they arrived they discovered drugs,drug paraphernalia and an assault rifle with ammunition.rivera was arrested for drug possession and possession of an unregistered gun.rivera spent five days in jail.the charges were later dismissed in the interest of justice.
in late march,amtrak sent rivera a notice charging him with three violations falsification of a time card violation of the attendance policy and threatening with bodily harm.the notice directed rivera to appear at a formal hearing on april.at the hearing,mahon was the designated charging officer,and carney and acevedo appeared as witnesses for amtrak.dan novella,from rivera union,the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees,appeared on rivera behalf.rivera did not appear at the hearing because on march,the alameda county court had issued a restraining order against rivera,ordering him to stay away from amtrak and amtrak employees.the restraining order did not expire until july.at the hearing,no one was able to testify definitively whether or not the restraining order prohibited rivera from attending the hearing.
the hearing officer issued a decision finding rivera guilty of the charges,which were largely substantiated on the basis of carney testimony.as a result of the hearing decision,amtrak general manager don saunders terminated rivera employment.

rivera filed an amended complaint,and defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court granted defendants summary judgment motion in full and denied rivera motion to amend his complaint to replead a claim for defamation against amtrak under fela.rivera appeals the district court dismissal of his wrongful termination and defamation claims.he also appeals the district court denial of his leave to amend to assert a defamation claim against amtrak under fela 
standard of review 
the standard of review on an appeal from a grant of summary judgment is de novo.see botosan paul mcnally realty,cir.the granting of a motion to dismiss is also reviewed de novo.see id.
the court must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.lopez smith,cir en banc citation omitted.in response to a properly supported motion for summary judgment,the opposing party must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.henderson city of simi valley,cir quoting.e.in order to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists,the nonmoving party must introduce some significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint.anderson liberty lobby,d quoting first bank of arizona cities serv,d.conclusory allegations unsupported by factual data can not defeat summary judgment.see arpin santa clara valley trans.agency,cir.
discussion 
wrongful termination 
to raise a material question of fact on his wrongful termination claim,rivera must present evidence that amtrak dismissed him in violation of a public policy that is embodied in a statute or constitutional provision,beneficial to the public,articulated at the time of discharge,and fundamental.see stevenson superior court,cal th,d,public policy may be implicated when an employer fires an employee for refusing to commit a crime,reporting criminal activity to the proper authorities,or disclosing illegal,unsafe or unethical practices of the employer.see general dynamics superior court,cal th,d.rivera contends that his termination as a result of refusing to engage in illegal activity and for disclosing illegal and unsafe practices on the job falls within the public policy rubric.
amtrak counters that summary judgment was properly granted on rivera wrongful termination claim because rivera never reported the illegal activity he allegedly was privy to the amtrak supervisors who fired rivera did so without knowledge of the alleged illegal activity,and relied upon evidence warranting termination without regard to the illegal activity and no fundamental public policy was implicated.
rivera reporting of the illegal activity 
in order to implicate a violation of public policy,rivera must produce evidence that he disclosed the illegal practices of its employees to amtrak management.see gould maryland sound,th,d.
rivera reported the activity to carney,the same supervisor he alleges was condoning and enforcing the illegal activity
