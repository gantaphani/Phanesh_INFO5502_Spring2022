in order to reduce congestion at major airports the department of transportation in amended its policy regarding airport rates and charges.the amendments allow an airport to charge aircraft higher landing fees at peak times,a practice known as congestion pricing.the air transport association of america ata,on behalf of scheduled airlines,petitions for review of the amendments,arguing they allow airports to charge unreasonable and discriminatory fees,allow state and local airport authorities to charge fees that are preempted by federal law,provide inadequate guidance to airports on how the dot will evaluate the reasonableness of the fees,and constitute an unexplained reversal of prior policy.airports council international aci,which represents governmental bodies that own and operate major airports in the,including of the airports the dot deems currently congested,has intervened in support of the dot.we deny the petition for review.
background 
as the primary manager of the nation air transportation system,the dot determines whether the fees an airport charges its users comply with the various federal statutes requiring that the fees be reasonable.the secretary of transportation is required by statute to publish regulations establishing the standards or guidelines he will use to evaluate the reasonableness of an airport fees.b.this case involves a challenge to one set of regulations promulgated under that statute.
a.the problem of congestion 
in the years between the promulgation of the policy and of the amendments,the number of landings by airlines in the united states increased more than,to million from million per year.see bureau of transportation statistics,national transportation statistics,table april.this increase in traffic has led to more frequent and longer delays in,for instance,flight arrivals were delayed by a total of million hours.congress joint economic committee,report,your flight has been delayed again flight delays cost passengers,airlines,and the economy billions may.the causes for delay range from inclement weather to mechanical problems this case involves delays caused by excess demand for airport takeoff and landing capacity.
excess demand 
excess demand arises when demand for a good or service at the prevailing price exceeds the supply,which results in buyers having to queue.in the air transportation system,the buyers are airlines,the service is allowing an aircraft to land at a particular airport,and the price is the landing fee the airport charges the airline for landing.the delays in landing are manifestations of there being a queue.
in an ordinary market,supply and price adjust to eliminate excess demand,but this is no ordinary market.airports can not readily increase the supply of landing slots because building more runways takes years and at some airports is not feasible at all.see policy regarding airport rates and charges,proposed.nor may airports freely increase the price as demand increases the amount an airport may charge as a landing fee is constrained by the oversight of the dot and by several federal statutory restrictions.
adding to the difficulty of managing congestion,the volume of air traffic varies significantly both throughout the day and from one airport to another.not all airports suffer from significant congestion,even at the most desirable times or rush hours.addressing this variation in the demand for landings requires giving airports some flexibility in.
possible solutions 
there are two ways in which an airport might increase its landing fee to the is,to the price just high enough to eliminate the excess demand and hence the queue at peak times.the first is to sell at auction the right to land an aircraft at a particular airport at a particular time that right is called a landing slot.in an auction an airport would first determine the number of landings it can accommodate during a given period of time,such as an hour,and then allow airlines to bid for each slot in an auction the winning bid would determine the price of the landing slot.the alternative is congestion pricing,which entails the airport itself increasing the price landing fee until it elicits demand for only as many landings as it can accommodate,thereby eliminating queuing and delay.both a slot auction and congestion pricing will converge upon the same price and the same quantity.
in principle neither system is preferable to the other.see martin weitzman,prices quantities,econ.stud.many commentators,however,have advocated slot auctions rather than congestion pricing because an airport operator knows how many landings the airport can safely accommodate per hour but can learn only by trial and error what fee will yield that many landings.see,rassenti et,a combinatorial auction mechanism for airport time slot allocation,bell econ.grether et,the allocation of landing rights by unanimity among competitors,am.econ.but see michael levine,landing fees and the airport congestion problem,econ.proposing a system of congestion pricing.the regulations under review represent the dot attempt to implement a system of congestion pricing.
regulation of landing fees 
as the air transportation system has become increasingly congested,the department of transportation task of managing the system has become increasingly difficult.the department has tried to solve the problem of congestion using its statutory authority to supervise the fees an airport charges its users,including the landing fees paid by airlines.
statutory requirements 
the airports and airways improvements act requires that airports be available for public use on reasonable conditions and without unjust discrimination.a.we have interpreted that obligation as a requirement that an airport fees be reasonable.air transp.ass of am.dot,ata i citing new england legal found.port,cir.the tax act also requires that the fees be reasonable.see e.the federal aviation administration authorization act requires the secretary of transportation to publish regulations,such as the ones here under review,establishing the standards or guidelines that he will use in determining whether an airport fee is reasonable.b.
airports currently operate under the dot policy regarding airport rates and charges.june,vacated in part by ata i,as amended at,which,as we have noted before,provides airports with precious little guidance,see ata i,at the guideline seems to be missing a line.as a result,airlines and airport proprietors regularly ask the dot whether a particular landing fee is reasonable,see,and seek judicial review of its decision in this court.see,alaska airlines,dot,port auth.of dot,city of los angeles dot,air canada dot,city of los angeles dot.
the amendments 
the dot finally sought to update its regulations regarding landing fees in,more than a decade after we had vacated much of the policy.rather than address the various problems we identified with the original policy,however,the department promulgated amendments to the policy solely in order to implement a system of congestion pricing.this the amendments do by allowing an airport to add to its rate base certain previously excluded costs,which enables it to increase the landing fees it charges alter the structure of those fees so as to encourage airlines to use a more efficient mix of large and small aircraft at congested airports and charge higher fees during peak periods.see policy regarding airport rates and charges.july.
increasing the price.if an airport wants to reduce congestion then it must eliminate the excess demand by reducing the number of planes that airlines want to land during peak periods.in order to do so,it must have some method of allocating the scarce resource of the opportunity to land.congestion pricing accomplishes this by increasing the price.if the fee is high enough,then an airline will adjust its schedule by shifting a flight to a less congested time or an alternate airport,using fewer but larger aircraft,or simply canceling some flights.
an airport may not freely increase its prices,however,because of its public service obligation to charge only reasonable fees.the dot enforces that obligation by limiting the total airfield fees an airport may collect,including landing fees.this limit is based upon the historical costs the airport is allowed to include in its rate base.in order to increase the allowable landing fee,therefore,an airport must somehow increase its rate base.
the amendments allow an airport to do just that.in certain circumstances an airport may now for the first time include in its rate base certain costs,a portion of the costs of an airfield project under construction and the costs associated with another airport.the policy allowed an airport to include the latter costs only if the costs of the other airport to be included in the first airport rate base are reasonably related to the aviation benefits that the other airport provides or is expected to provide to the aeronautical users of the first airport.at.that condition was,however,presumed to be satisfied if the other airport was designated as a reliever airport for the first airport by the faa.id.a reliever airport is an alternative to a primary airport for general aviation,see federal aviation administration,national plan of integrated airport systems at van nuys airport in los angeles,california,for example,is a reliever airport for los angeles international airport lax,see id.at app x.under the amendments,that condition will also be presumed satisfied if the other airport has been designated by the faa as a secondary airport.at.a secondary airport is an alternative to a primary airport for commercial and general aviation,see national plan at international airport in ontario,california is a secondary airport for lax,see appendix to notice,docket no.allowing an airport to include the costs of facilities under construction and of secondary airports in its rate base enables the airport to raise the landing fee it charges.
price structure.increasing the landing fee will decrease the number of flights landing at an airport,but the dot also has an interest in ensuring airports accommodate the flying public.currently an airport may base its landing fees only upon the weight of the aircraft,which usually gives the airline little or no incentive to schedule fewer flights with more passengers on each.for example,at chicago international airport the fee to land a boeing,a midsize jet that seats about passengers,is,or about per passenger landing a canadair,a regional jet that seats about passengers,costs,or about per passenger.see katherine ashley ian savage,pricing congestion for arriving flights at chicago airport,air transp.mgmt,the difference in price per person per flight is unlikely to alter the choice of aircraft.
each flight,regardless of the number of passengers on board,imposes a cost upon all the other airlines serving the same airport and upon their passengers.the dot wants to reduce congestion but also wants to accommodate as many passengers as possible consistent with reduced congestion.the amendments,therefore,provide an incentive for airlines to offer fewer flights with more seats per aircraft,a practice called upgauging.
this they do by authorizing an airport to institute a landing fee consisting of a combination of a charge and a charge.at.the,per landing charge is fixed because the number of landings an airport can accommodate in a given time does not vary greatly.the charge is variable,reflecting that marginal airport costs do tend to vary with aircraft weight.steven morrison,the structure of landing fees at uncongested airports an application of ramsey pricing,transport econ.pol y,see walters,economic survey,transport econ.pol y.
varying the price.finally,the amendments allow an airport to use these new pricing techniques only during peak periods because there is no reason to alter the incentives facing users.this concept is not unfamiliar to airlines prices for flights frequently vary depending upon the time of day,in line with the variation in demand.the practice is common in other industries,as well.for example,mobile phone plans typically allot a different number of minutes for calls at peak versus times.
the amendments encourage higher peak pricing only indirectly during peak times,they allow an airport to include the costs of secondary airports and unfinished projects,and hence to charge a higher price and to impose the fee,including the charge.during other times,the airport will use the existing rate base and fee structure,resulting in lower fees at times.specifically,the amendments allow an airport to include in its rate base the costs of projects under construction and of a secondary airport only if doing so during congested hours would have the effect of reducing or preventing congestion and operating delays at the primary airport in those hours.at.similarly,the amendments allow an airport to implement the charge only if doing so reasonably allocates costs to users on a rational and economically justified basis.the department gives the following example 
the proportionately higher costs per passenger for aircraft with fewer seats that will result from the component of a fee may be justified by the effect of the fee on congestion and operating delays and the total number of passengers accommodated during congested hours.
these three an airport to include certain costs in the rate base for determining landing fees during congested hours,instituting the fee structure,and permitting landing fees to vary throughout the the basic elements of the dot plan to decrease congestion.the ata argues that each one is facially inconsistent with one or more statutes.
ii.analysis 
the ata makes four principal arguments.the amendments authorize airports to charge unreasonable and unjustly discriminatory landing fees,in violation of the airports and airways improvement act of,a,and the tax act,e those fees are state or local governmental regulations preempted by the airline deregulation act of,b the dot failed to meet its obligation under of the aviation administration authorization act of,to provide guidance to airports and the amendments are arbitrary and capricious because they are unexplained departures from prior policies.we find each argument unpersuasive for the reasons that follow.
unreasonable and discriminatory fees 
an airport may not charge a fee that is unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory.see e airport may collect only reasonable landing fees a airport must be available for public use on reasonable conditions and without unjust discrimination.the ata argues that including the costs of future facilities and of secondary airports in the rate base and charging a landing fee comprising a charge and a charge are each independently both unreasonable and unjustly discriminatory.
the standard of review 
the ata brings only a facial challenge to the amendments,presumably because,as the parties related at oral argument,no airport has implemented the system of congestion pricing allowed by the amendments.to prevail in a facial challenge,the ata must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the amendments would be valid.reno flores,quoting united states salerno.therefore,to make its point that the dot lacked authority to promulgate the amendments,it is not enough to show there is a mere possibility an airport might apply the amendments in such a way as to set an unlawful fee.constr.trades dep t allbaugh.
pursuant to chevron,natural resources defense council,we give substantial deference to the dot interpretation of a statute that requires it to ensure fees are reasonable but does not set standards for assessing reasonableness because the secretary of transportation,not the court,is charged with administering the federal aviation laws.northwest airlines,county of kent,citing chevron,at.the ata would have us apply the specific standard used in northwest,at,which was based upon that in airport auth.dist.delta airlines,a fee is reasonable if it is based on some fair approximation of use of the facilities,is not excessive in relation to the benefits conferred,and does not discriminate against interstate commerce.as the dot points out,however,the court in northwest was evaluating a particular set of fees imposed by a single passage of the statute that requires the secretary to establish the standards or guidelines he will use in determining whether an airport fee is reasonable,stat,u.b.the court explained that because it l ack ed guidance from the secretary of transportation regarding how to evaluate the reasonableness of those fees,it had to look elsewhere for a standard.northwest,at.the court expressly noted that when the secretary creates a standard,as he has here,for determining whether fees are reasonable his exposition will merit judicial approbation so long as it represents a permissible construction of the statute.id.at quoting chevron,at.for the same reasons,we defer to the dot reasonable interpretation of the statutory prohibition of unjust discrimination.
reasonableness 
an aircraft that lands at a congested time imposes a significant cost,in the form of delay,both upon other airlines that want to land aircraft at the same time and upon the passengers aboard those aircraft.each additional aircraft seeking to land at that time adds to the congestion and imposes additional delays upon other users of the system.meanwhile,the airline that successfully lands an aircraft at the peak time reaps a substantial benefit because it is able to offer a valuable service to its customers.as long as the costs to the airline landing the aircraft during a peak hour are less than the benefits to that airline,it will land the aircraft even if the total social delays to other users of the the total social benefits.see garrett hardin,the tragedy of the commons,science.
the ata argues the fees authorized by the amendments necessarily will be unreasonable because the amendments do not comply with the principle,common in rate regulation,that an asset must be used and useful before it can be included in the rate base of a regulated utility.coop.ferc,citing smyth ames.neither an airport nor the dot,however,is required to adhere to that principle.as the dot argues,the relevant statutes require only reasonable and fees,not fees based upon a particular form of cost recovery.we have explained elsewhere that the used and useful principle is simply one of several permissible tools of ratemaking,one that need not be,and is not,employed in every instance.jersey cent.power light ferc,en banc.accordingly,an agency may depart from the used and useful standard in order to pursue another legitimate objective.gas light baker,see,at holding it reasonable,and consistent with the principle of used and useful,to include in the rate base certain funds for unfinished projects.we focus our inquiry not upon each asset included in the rate base,but rather upon whether the end result is reasonable.see jersey,at see also fed.power comm hope nat.gas,end result test for whether rates are just and reasonable.
it is entirely reasonable to expect an airline,and in turn its passengers,to pay a premium for the opportunity to arrive at a peak time.if an airport is able to reduce congestion by using the scheme and including in its rate base the costs of a future facility or of a secondary airport then,without more,it is impossible to say its increased landing fee must be unreasonable.the increased fee will drive other aircraft in time or in thereby will benefit the airline that pays the fee to land at a peak time.depending upon the actual amount of the fee,therefore,it may well be reasonable.
unjust discrimination 
the ata complains in various ways the amendments will require an airline to subsidize its competitor,as though a necessarily implies unjust discrimination.a.the variation in the fees permitted by the amendments need not be unjustly discriminatory,however.each aircraft that lands at a particular airport during a particular hour will be subject to the same fee,adjusted only,as it is now,for weight.although landing fees will vary from one airport to another and from one hour to another,the dot has adequately justified such differences based upon variations in the degree of congestion at different airports and different times.
first,the ata complains that to include in an airport rate base the costs of a different but commonly owned airport or an unfinished project is to force that airline to subsidize its competitors.the ata objection is implicitly based upon the principle that the total fees collected by an airport may not exceed the total costs incurred by the airport if a primary airport includes in its rate base the cost of a secondary airport,then it must reduce its rate base in the second airport by an equal amount similarly,if it includes the cost of a project under construction,then it may not recover the same costs again upon completion of the project.see.at.in each case the actual users of the facilities newly included in the rate base will pay lower fees than they would otherwise do.in other words,if the fees at one airport go up,then the fees at another must come down,and that is a subsidy for users of the secondary airport,including airlines that compete with the airlines that use the primary airport likewise,the objection goes,present users paying for facilities to be used by future users subsidize them.
the effect of the pricing scheme may look like a subsidy but it does not necessarily work an unjust discrimination,regardless whether all components of the rate base are actually used by the airlines that pay the landing fees,because users are not responsible for the costs of the present congestion or of any future expansion necessitated thereby.in an industry with high fixed costs it is not unreasonable or unjust for peak load users to pay more than users because the peak price is being used to allocate a scarce resource.see alfred kahn,the economics of regulation principles and institutions the users impose no such costs on society the necessity for expansion is imposed by the customers at the peak hours.
the ata also argues a fee will more adversely affect airlines with a business model dependent on the use of certain size aircraft flying at certain times of day or with certain frequencies.that is true,of course.an airline that lands a small aircraft at a peak time,however,imposes nearly as much cost upon the other users of the airport as does an airline that lands a larger aircraft.a landing fee increased to reflect that fact might make it unprofitable for the former airline to leave its present schedule and fleet unchanged,but that is the point of pricing,not a defect that makes the price differential unjustly discriminatory.
we can not,of course,rule out the possibility that an airport will implement a system of fees that complies with the amendments but is nonetheless unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory.because an airport can also implement the amendments in a way that is reasonable and not unjustly discriminatory,however,the ata facial challenge must fail.
preemption 
in another facial attack the ata argues the dot lacked authority to promulgate the amendments because the airline deregulation act of preempts and thus prohibits any state or local airport authority attempt to implement congestion pricing.the ada provides a state or local authority may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier.u.b.this clause limits what most airports can do because most airports are operated by a local authority.see tae oum,nicole adler,chunyan yu,privatization,corporatization,ownership forms and their effects on the performance of the world major airports,air transp.mgmt.
the ata argues an airport proprietor necessarily would violate the ada by establishing congestion landing fees because varying fees based upon the time of day for the purpose of influencing airline service decisions is a measure related to a price,of an air carrier.surely,however,an airport may charge some fee authorized by the amendments without violating the ada.
first,as the dot points out,a state or local authority that owns or operates an airport is expressly authorized by the tax act to charge a reasonable landing fee.see e a state or political subdivision of a state may levy or collect reasonable landing fees.second,nothing in the ada prohibits an airport from
