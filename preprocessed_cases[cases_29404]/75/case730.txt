finally,we must decide the appropriate remedy given nhtsa inadequate ea.we have previously recognized that preparation of an eis is not mandated in all cases simply because an agency has prepared a deficient ea or otherwise failed to comply with nepa.if,for example,an ea is so procedurally flawed that we can not determine whether the proposed rule or project may have a significant effect,the court should remand for the preparation of a new ea.see metcalf daley,cir ordering remand for preparation of a new ea,where prior ea was prepared after the agency had already rendered a substantive decision on the permitting action.if an agency completely fails to prepare an ea before deciding that a proposed project or rule will have no significant environmental impact,remand for preparation of an ea is likewise the proper remedy.see jones gordon,cir remanding where agency failed to prepare any nepa document before issuing permit.and where an agency determines that consideration of certain factors are legally irrelevant to the agency action,rendering it impossible for the reviewing court to determine the accuracy of the fonsi,we also remand for preparation of an ea on a complete record.san luis obispo mothers for peace nuclear regulatory comm n,cir ordering remand for reconsideration of ea where agency rejected consideration of terrorist acts as factor to be considered in its review of application for license to construct nuclear storage facility,cert.denied sub nom.pac.gas san luis obispo mothers for peace,d.
by contrast,if the court determines that the agency proffered reasons for its fonsi are arbitrary and capricious and the evidence in a complete administrative record demonstrates that the project or regulation may have a significant impact,then it is appropriate to remand with instructions to prepare an eis.see,parks conservation ass,at idaho sporting,at.
the cases where it is appropriate to order immediate preparation of an eis and those where it is implicit in this circuit nepa jurisprudence,and has been explicitly recognized elsewhere.see army corps of eng rs,cir it is also clear that a decision to forego preparation of an eis may be unreasonable for at least two distinct reasons the evidence before the court demonstrates that,contrary to the fonsi,the project may have a significant impact on the human environment,or the agency review was flawed in such a manner that it can not yet be said whether the project may have a significant impact if the court finds that a project may have a significant impact,the court should order the agency to prepare an eis.if the court finds,on the other hand,that the ea is inadequate in a manner that precludes making the determination whether the project may have a significant impact,the court should remand the case to the agency to correct the deficiencies in its analysis.citations omitted.so,if there is uncertainty over whether the proposed project may have a significant impact,including uncertainty caused by an incomplete administrative record or an inadequate ea,the court should ordinarily remand for the agency to either prepare a revised ea or reconsider whether an eis is required.metcalf,at on reflection,and in consideration of our limited role in this process,we have decided that it is appropriate only to require a new ea,but to require that it be done under circumstances that ensure an objective evaluation free of the previous taint.see also hill boy,cir remanding where agency failure to prepare an eis was based on incorrect assumption audubon soc y hoffman,cir remanding due to incomplete administrative record.
whether to require an eis now is a very close question.petitioners evidence demonstrates,overwhelmingly,the environmental significance of emissions and the effect of those emissions on global warming.how nhtsa can,on remand,prepare an ea that takes proper account of this evidence and still conclude that the final rule has no significant environmental impact is questionable.see fonsi is a document presenting the reasons why an action will not have a significant effect on the human environment and for which an eis therefore will not be prepared emphasis added.we nonetheless give the benefit of the doubt to nhtsa and decline to order the immediate preparation of an eis for two reasons.
first,the ea primary deficiency lies with its conclusory assertion that a modest percent decrease in carbon emissions renders the final rule environmentally insignificant.the ea provides no reasons or analysis in support of this conclusion,much less convincing reasons.blue mountains biodiversity project,at.although petitioners evidence is daunting we can not,in the abstract,categorically decide that nhtsa reasons for this conclusion in a revised ea would be unconvincing.
second,we have a significant reason to defer to the agency as to whether an ea will suffice or whether an eis is necessary.during the pendency of this appeal,congress enacted the energy independence and security act of eisa,stat.eisa requires nhtsa to increase fuel economy standards for passenger and automobiles to reach a combined average of at least mpg by model year.see b a.in connection with eisa,nhtsa has already begun preparation of a complete eis to inform the nepa analysis relating to the cafe standards for my automobiles,including light trucks.notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement for new corporate average fuel economy standards,to be codified at pts.with the exception of my,the eis prepared as a result of the passage of eisa will not encompass the cafe standards implemented by the final rule.however,information developed in preparation of the eis would undoubtedly inform nhtsa decision as to the necessity of an eis in this case.see city of los angeles,at wald,dissenting stating that proper course was to remand without enjoining agency action because agency was already conducting a separate programmatic eis which may yet provide an adequate explanation for its finding of no significant impact.
taken together,these reasons lead us to conclude that the record is insufficiently complete for us to order the immediate preparation of an eis.see,at remanding without instructions to prepare eis metcalf,at same hill,at same audubon soc y,at.we therefore remand to nhtsa to prepare a revised ea or,as necessary,a complete eis.

it is so ordered.
eleven states,the district of columbia,the city of new york,and four public interest organizations petition for review of a rule issued by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa entitled average fuel economy standards for light trucks,model years,final rule codified at pt.pursuant to the energy policy and conservation act of epca,the final rule sets corporate average fuel economy cafe standards for light trucks,defined by nhtsa to include many sport utility vehicles suvs,minivans,and pickup trucks,for model years mys.for mys,the final rule sets new cafe standards using its traditional method,average unreformed cafe.for my and beyond,the final rule creates a new cafe structure that sets varying fuel economy targets depending on vehicle size and requires manufacturers to meet different fuel economy levels depending on their vehicle fleet mix reformed cafe.
petitioners challenge the final rule under the epca and the national environmental policy act of nepa,first,they argue that the final rule is arbitrary,capricious,and contrary to the epca because a the agency analysis does not set the cafe standard at the maximum feasible level and fails to give due consideration to the need of the nation to conserve energy b its calculation of the costs and benefits of alternative fuel economy standards assigns zero value to the benefit of carbon dioxide emissions reduction c its calculation of costs and benefits of alternative fuel economy standards fails to evaluate properly the benefit of vehicle weight reduction d reformed cafe standards will depend on manufacturer fleet mix and not guarantee a minimum average fuel economy or backstop e the transition period during which manufacturers may choose to comply with either unreformed or reformed cafe is contrary to the maximum feasible requirement and unnecessary f it perpetuates the suv loophole,which allows suvs,minivans,and pickup trucks to satisfy a lower fuel economy standard than cars and g it excludes most vehicles rated between and pounds gross vehicle weight comprised mostly of large pickup trucks from any fuel economy regulation,even though these vehicles satisfy the statutory criteria for regulation.
second,petitioners argue that nhtsa environmental assessment is inadequate under nepa because it fails to take a hard look at the greenhouse gas implications of its rulemaking and fails to analyze a reasonable range of alternatives or examine the rule cumulative impact.petitioners also argue that nepa requires nhtsa to prepare an environmental impact statement.
nhtsa argues that the final rule is not arbitrary and capricious or contrary to the epca,the environmental assessment evaluation of the environmental consequences of its action is adequate,and an environmental impact statement is not required.
we have jurisdiction under a to review the final rule issued by nhtsa.we hold that the final rule is arbitrary and capricious,contrary to the epca in its failure to monetize the value of carbon emissions,failure to set a backstop,failure to close the suv loophole,and failure to set fuel economy standards for all vehicles in the to gross vehicle weight rating gvwr class.we also hold that the environmental assessment was inadequate and that petitioners have raised a substantial question as to whether the final rule may have a significant impact on the environment.therefore,we remand to nhtsa to promulgate new standards as expeditiously as possible and to prepare either a revised environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement.
factual and procedural background 
cafe regulation under the energy policy and conservation act 
in the aftermath of the energy crisis created by the mideast oil embargo,congress enacted the energy policy and conservation act of,stat.see.at,as reprinted in.congress observed that t he fundamental reality is that this nation has entered a new era in which energy resources previously abundant,will remain in short supply,retarding our economic growth and necessitating an alteration in our life habits and expectations.id.at.the goals of the epca are to decrease dependence on foreign imports,enhance national security,achieve the efficient utilization of scarce resources,and guarantee the availability of domestic energy supplies at prices consumers can afford.conf,as reprinted in.these goals are more pressing today than they were thirty years ago since,american consumption of oil has risen from million barrels per day to over million barrels per day,and the percentage of oil that is imported has risen from to percent.nrdc cmt.at see also.at.
in furtherance of the goal of energy conservation,title v of the epca establishes automobile fuel economy standards.an average fuel economy standard often referred to as a cafe standard is a performance standard specifying a minimum level of average fuel economy applicable to a manufacturer in a model year.a.only automobiles are subject to fuel economy regulation,and passenger automobiles must meet a statutory standard of mpg,b whereas automobiles must meet standards set by the secretary of transportation,id.a.congress directs the secretary to set fuel economy standards at the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the secretary decides the manufacturers can achieve in that model year.id.a under this subsection,the secretary is authorized to prescribe separate standards for different classes of automobiles.id.congress also provides that w hen deciding maximum feasible average fuel economy under this section,the secretary of transportation shall consider technological feasibility,economic practicability,the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the government on fuel economy,and the need of the united states to conserve energy.id.f.
under the epca definitional scheme,vehicles not manufactured primarily for highway use and vehicles rated at lbs.gross vehicle weight or more are excluded from fuel economy regulation altogether because they are not automobiles.an automobile is defined as 
a vehicle that is propelled by fuel,or by alternative fuel,manufactured primarily for use on public streets,roads,and highways,and rated at 
a not more than pounds gross vehicle weight or 
b more than,but less than,pounds gross vehicle weight,if the secretary decides by regulation that 
i an average fuel economy standard under this chapter for the vehicle is feasible and 
ii an average fuel economy standard under this chapter for the vehicle will result in significant energy conservation or the vehicle is substantially used for the same purposes as a vehicle rated at not more than pounds gross vehicle weight.
a.although nhtsa has the authority to regulate the fuel economy of vehicles up to lbs.gvwr,see id.a b,the agency has excluded vehicles exceeding lbs.other than passenger vehicles manufactured during my or thereafter from its definition of automobile,see b.
the cafe standards nhtsa sets for automobiles or light trucks,as referred to by the agency in its regulations are lower than the standards for passenger automobiles.compare a with a.a passenger automobile is defined as 
an automobile that the secretary decides by regulation is manufactured primarily for transporting not more than individuals,but does not include an automobile capable of operation that the secretary decides by regulation 
a has a significant feature except drive designed for operation and 
b is a drive automobile or is rated at more than pounds gross vehicle weight.
the final rule sets cafe standards for light trucks,defined by nhtsa to include many suvs,vans,and pickup trucks,for mys.see.at a,g,h.a light truck is 
an automobile other than a passenger automobile which is either designed for operation,as described in paragraph b of this section or designed to perform at least one of the following functions transport more than persons provide temporary living quarters transport property on an open bed provide greater than volume or permit expanded use of the automobile for purposes or other purposes through removable or foldable,stowable seats to create a flat floor.
for mys to,congress froze the light truck cafe standard at mpg.see.at.after the legislative restrictions were lifted,nhtsa set new light truck cafe standards in april mpg for my,mpg for my,and mpg for my.light truck average fuel economy standards model years,codified at pt.
in response to a request from congress,the national academy of sciences nas published in a report entitled effectiveness and impact of corporate average fuel economy cafe standards.the nas committee made several findings and recommendations.it found that from to,cafe standards helped contribute to a percent increase in fuel economy for new light trucks.id.at.in the subsequent decades,however,light trucks became more popular since domestic manufacturers faced less competition in the light truck category and could generate greater profits.id.at.the less stringent cafe standards for trucks provide d incentives for manufacturers to invest in minivans and suvs and to promote them to consumers in place of large cars and station wagons.id.at.when the cafe regulations were originally promulgated in the,light truck sales accounted for about percent of the new vehicle market,but now they account for about half.id.at.this shift has had a pronounced effect on overall fuel economy.id.at.as the market share of light trucks has increased,the overall average fuel economy of the new light duty vehicle fleet light trucks and passenger automobiles has declined from a peak of mpg in to mpg in.id.vehicle miles traveled vmt by light trucks has also been growing more rapidly than passenger automobile travel.id.
the nas committee found that the cafe program has increased fuel economy,but that certain aspects of the program have not functioned as intended,including t he distinction between a car for personal use and a truck for work transport,which has been stretched well beyond the original purpose.id.at.the committee also found that technologies exist to significantly reduce fuel consumption,for cars and light trucks and that raising cafe standards would reduce fuel consumption.id.at.significantly,the committee found that of the many reasons for improving fuel economy,t he most important is concern about the accumulation in the atmosphere of greenhouse gases,principally carbon dioxide.continued increases in carbon dioxide emissions are likely to further global warming.id.at.in addition,the committee found externalities of about gal of gasoline associated with the combined impacts of fuel consumption on greenhouse gas emissions and on world oil market conditions that are not necessarily taken into account when consumers purchase new vehicles.id.at.
national environmental policy act 
nepa requires a federal agency to the fullest extent possible,to prepare a detailed statement on the environmental impact of major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c i see also.the purpose of nepa is twofold ensure that the agency will have available,and will carefully consider,detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts,and guarantee that the relevant information will be made available to the larger public audience.idaho sporting cong.thomas,cir quoting robertson methow valley citizens council,d see also b stating that environmental information must be provided before decisions are made and before actions are taken.nepa expresses a congressional determination that procrastination on environmental concerns is no longer acceptable.found.for am.wild sheep dep t of,cir.nepa is our basic national charter for protection of the environment.a.
if there is a substantial question whether an action may have a significant effect on the environment,then the agency must prepare an environmental impact statement eis.see,blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir internal quotation marks omitted.an eis should contain a discussion of significant environmental impacts and alternatives to the proposed action.see.as a preliminary step,an agency may prepare an environmental assessment ea in order to determine whether a proposed action may significantly affect the environment and thereby trigger the requirement to prepare an eis.see a.an ea is a concise public document that b riefly provide s sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact.id.an ea s hall include brief discussions of the need for the proposal,of alternatives as required by sec.e,of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives,and a listing of agencies and persons consulted.id.b.
whether an action may significantly affect the environment requires consideration of context and intensity.id.see also parks conservation ass babbitt,cir.context delimits the scope of the agency action,including the interests affected.parks conservation ass n,at.intensity refers to the severity of impact,which includes both beneficial and adverse impacts,t he degree to which the proposed action affects public health or safety,t he degree to which the effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be highly controversial,t he degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks,and w hether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts.b.
nhtsa proposed rulemaking and draft environmental assessment 
on december,nhtsa published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anprm that solicited comments on several proposed regulatory changes intended to increase fuel economy,including a proposal to modernize the light distinction and a proposal to increase the gvwr limit on vehicles subject to cafe standards.nhtsa acknowledged that its regulations define passenger and vehicles by the type of use to which they were generally put in the,id.at,and that t he markets for,and designs of,cars and light trucks have changed substantially,with some light trucks used primarily to transport passengers,id.at.nhtsa noted that in its original nprm promulgated in december,it concluded that congress intended that passenger automobiles be defined as those used primarily for the transport of individuals and that all other vehicles would fall within the category of automobiles.id.at.nhtsa did not present any specific proposals for reforming the cafe program,but it presented two options for including vehicles under lbs.gvwr in the program regulating passenger vehicles mdpvs which are vehicles between and lbs.gvwr designed primarily for the transportation of persons,and regulating all vehicles between and lbs.gvwr.id.at.
on august,nhtsa issued proposed cafe standards for light trucks mys of mpg for my,mpg for my,and mpg for my.nhtsa determined that these were the maximum feasible standards using a marginal analysis.see id.for my and beyond,nhtsa proposed to adopt a reformed cafe system,which would set different cafe standards for vehicles based on size,measured by the vehicle footprint the product of multiplying wheelbase by track width.id.at.nhtsa proposed six footprint categories a step function,id.at,and it proposed a transition period my to reformed cafe,during which manufacturers could choose to comply with either reformed or unreformed cafe.nhtsa also proposed not to change the criteria by which vehicles are classified as passenger automobiles or light trucks,id.at,and it proposed to regulate only mdpvs within the to lb.vehicle class as light trucks,id.at.
nhtsa issued a draft environmental assessment in august.the draft ea integrated much of the text from the final ea that accompanied nhtsa light truck rulemaking for mys released in april.see draft environmental assessment,nhtsa proposed corporate average fuel economy cafe standards draft ea.the draft ea analyzed three alternatives to the proposed rule.alternative a no action would extend the my standard of mpg through my.alternative b would be unreformed cafe in my and reformed cafe in my.alternative c would be reformed cafe set at equalized cost with unreformed cafe in my and reformed cafe in my.id.
the draft ea noted that has started to be viewed as an issue of concern for its global climate change potential.id.at.with regard to biological resources,the draft ea stated,emissions of criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases could result in ozone layer depletion and promote climate change that could affect species and ecosystems.id.at.the projected lifetime fuel savings for my light trucks under alternatives b and c would rang e from to of their fuel compared to the baseline,corresponding to billion gallons.id.at.the estimated lifetime emissions of ranged from million metric tons mmt under baseline to and mmt under alternatives b and c,respectively.id.at.the draft ea concluded that the proposed standards would result in reduced emissions of,the predominant greenhouse gas emitted by motor vehicles,reductions in contamination of water resources,and minor reductions in impacts to biological resources.id.at.in addition,the cumulative effects estimated to result from both the and light truck rulemakings over the lifetimes of the vehicles they would affect are projected to be very small.id.at.
nhtsa received over comments on the nprm and draft ea from states,consumer and environmental organizations,automobile manufacturers and associations,members of congress,and private individuals.see.at.manufacturers argued that reliance on a analysis might not adequately account for the capabilities of the industry.id.they also generally opposed subjecting vehicles greater than lbs.gvwr to cafe regulation,arguing that those vehicles are used in a different manner than lighter vehicles and that their regulation would not result in significant fuel savings.id.at.the states and environmental and consumer organizations generally argued that 
the need of the nation to conserve energy and national security require more stringent standards,and such standards are feasible and practicable,nrdc cmt.at environmental defense cmt.at public citizen cmt.at for example,the alliance to save council for an economy aceee argued that t he billion gallons of fuel that nhtsa claims will be saved through the new standards over the life of model year vehicles amount to less than one month supply of gasoline for vehicles.these savings are also insufficient to offset the expected growth in gasoline usage for even the period covered by the rule.aceee cmt.at

d.the final rule cafe standards for light trucks mys 
nhtsa issued the final rule on april.at.nhtsa set the cafe standards for my unreformed cafe at the same levels as proposed in the nprm unreformed cafe sets a average fuel economy standard with particular regard to the least capable manufacturer with a significant share of the market.at.nhtsa has reformed the structure of the cafe program for light trucks,effective my reformed cafe.under reformed cafe,fuel economy standards are based on a truck footprint,with larger footprint trucks subject to a lower standard and smaller footprint trucks subject to higher standards.at.instead of six footprint categories a step function as proposed in the nprm,reformed cafe would be based on a continuous function,meaning a separate fuel economy target for each vehicle of a different footprint.see id.at.a particular manufacturer compliance obligation for a model year will be calculated as the harmonic average of the fuel economy targets for the manufacturer vehicles,weighted by the distribution of manufacturer production volumes among the footprint increments.id.at.a manufacturer cafe compliance obligation will vary with its fleet mix.a manufacturer that produces more large footprint light trucks will have a lower required cafe standard than one that produces more small footprint light trucks 
during mys,manufacturers may choose to comply with unreformed cafe or reformed cafe.see id.at.
nhtsa used the manufacturers preexisting product plans as the baseline for its analyses of technical and economic feasibility under both unreformed and reformed cafe.id.at.nhtsa made adjustments to the product plans by applying additional technologies in a fashion,id.at,and stopping at the point where marginal costs equaled marginal benefits,id.at.nhtsa considered the cost of new technologies and the benefits of fuel savings over the lifetime of the vehicle as the costs and benefits of higher fuel economy standards.id.at.nhtsa monetized some externalities such as emission of criteria pollutants during gasoline refining and distribution and crash and noise costs associated with driving.see final regulatory impact analysis,corporate average fuel economy and cafe reform for my light trucks at,march fria.however,nhtsa did not monetize the benefit of reducing carbon dioxide emissions,which it recognized was the the main greenhouse gas emitted as a result of refining,distribution,and use of transportation fuels.fria at to nhtsa acknowledged the estimates suggested in the scientific literature,see.at fria at,but concluded 
t he value of reducing emissions of and other greenhouse gases is too uncertain to support their explicit valuation and inclusion among the savings in environmental externalities from reducing gasoline production and use.there is extremely wide variation in published estimates of damage costs from greenhouse gas emissions,costs for controlling or avoiding their emissions,and costs of sequestering emissions that do occur,the three major sources for developing estimates of economic benefits from reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
at see also fria at to.
in its analysis,nhtsa also excluded weight reduction for vehicles between and lbs.curb weight as a potential measure that manufacturers could use to increase fuel economy.at.nhtsa accepted the possibility of weight reduction for vehicles over lbs.curb weight as a technology that would not reduce overall safety.id.nhtsa relied on a study by charles kahane for this lb.figure 
t he net safety effect of removing pounds from a light truck is zero for light trucks with a curb weight greater than lbs.however,given the significant statistical uncertainty around that figure,we assumed a confidence bound of approximately lbs.and used lbs.as the threshold for considering weight reduction.
id.footnotes omitted.by net safety effect,nhtsa means that lbs.is the breakeven point the point where the total effect of reducing all vehicles heavier than the breakeven weight by an equal amount is zero.id.at.in the fria,nhtsa explained that it chose the approximately lb.confidence bound based on additional empirical work found in kahane study 
kahane estimated a crossover weight of lbs.if manufacturers changed both weight and footprint,and the interval estimated ranged from lbs.to lbs,an interval lbs.around the point estimate.although the crossover weight differs from the point of zero net impact,they would both tend to have similar sampling errors.we applied this interval to the lbs.point of zero net impact which is based on the assumption that footprint is held constant therefore,the agency felt it would be prudent to limit weight reductions to those vehicles above lbs.curb weight.
fria at internal citation omitted.
nhtsa rejected the idea of a backstop under reformed cafe.at id.at.nhtsa stated that a backstop,or a required fuel economy level applicable to a manufacturer if its required level under reformed cafe fell below a certain minimum,would essentially be the same as an unreformed cafe standard.id.at.nhtsa argued that epca permits the agency to consider consumer demand and the resulting market shifts in setting fuel economy standards,id.at,and that a backstop would essentially limit the ability of manufacturers to respond to market shifts arising from changes in consumer demand.if consumer demand shifted towards larger vehicles,a manufacturer potentially could be faced with a situation in which it must choose between limiting its production of the demanded vehicles,and failing to comply with the cafe light truck standard.id.
finally,nhtsa declined to change the regulatory definition of cars and light trucks to close the suv loophole and refused to regulate vehicles between and lbs.gwvr,other than mdpvs.see id.at.

iii.discussion 
energy policy and conservation act.nhtsa use of marginal analysis to determine maximum feasible average fuel economy level 
with respect to automobiles,light trucks,the fuel economy standard shall be the maximum feasible average fuel economy level that the secretary decides the manufacturers can achieve in that model year.a.maximum feasible is not defined in the epca.however,the epca provides that w hen deciding maximum feasible average fuel economy under this section,the secretary of transportation shall consider technological feasibility,economic practicability,the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the government on fuel economy,and the need of the united states to conserve energy.id.f.
petitioners argue that the meaning of maximum feasible is plain,and that nhtsa decision to maximize economic benefits is contrary to the plain language of the epca because feasible means capable of being done,not economically optimal.but even if feasible means capable of being done,technological feasibility,economic practicability,the effect of other motor vehicle standards,and the need of the nation to conserve energy must be considered in determining the maximum feasible standard.american textile manufacturers institute donovan does not support petitioners interpretation of feasible,d.in that case,no other language in the statute modified the phrase at issue to the extent feasible,at.here,maximum feasible standards are to be determined in light of technological feasibility,economic practicability,the effect of other motor vehicle standards,and the need of the nation to conserve energy 
the epca clearly requires the agency to consider these four factors,but it gives nhtsa discretion to decide how to balance the statutory long as nhtsa balancing does not undermine the fundamental purpose of the epca energy conservation.in center for auto safety nhtsa,the circuit considered whether nhtsa gave impermissible weight to shifts in consumer demand in setting the my and standards for light trucks.petitioners in that case challenged nhtsa rule that revised the standards downward.id.at.the court held that since congress had not directly spoken to the issue of consumer demand,the court must determine whether the agency interpretation represented a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were committed to the agency care by the statute.id.at quoting chevron,at.the court reasoned that 
congress intended energy conservation to be a long term effort that would continue through temporary improvements in energy availability.thus,it would clearly be impermissible for nhtsa to rely on consumer demand to such an extent that it ignored the overarching goal of fuel conservation.at the other extreme,a standard with harsh economic consequences for the auto industry also would represent an unreasonable balancing of epca policies.
id.at footnote omitted.the court concluded that nhtsa consideration of consumer demand was permissible because congress did not speak to the precise issue,and it specifically delegated the process of setting light truck fuel economy standards with broad guidelines concerning the factors that the agency must consider.nhtsa has remained within the reasonable range permitted by those factors.id.at see also pub.citizen nhtsa,ginsburg.
in public citizen,the petitioners challenged the nhtsa lowering of the fuel economy standard for passenger cars for my.at.they argued that nhtsa determination that the statutory mpg standard was not economically practicable improperly elevated consumer demand and market forces,subordinated the statute design,and ignored the need of the nation to conserve energy.id.at.the court held that nhtsa consideration of the likelihood of economic hardship within its assessment of economic practicability must be accorded due weight.id.at.based on economic analyses supplied by other governmental agencies,nhtsa concluded that the economic effects of the higher cafe standard would be severe,id.at,including sales losses well into the hundreds of thousands,and job losses well into the tens of thousands,id.at see also.
petitioners cite public citizen for the proposition that consideration of economic practicability allows lowering fuel economy standards only if a higher standard would cause substantial economic hardship to a manufacturer with a substantial share of the market.but that is not precisely what public citizen held.rather,that court concluded that given the extensive evidence in the record showing that severe economic hardship would result from a higher standard,nhtsa decision to lower the standard under those circumstances was not devoid of rational support.pub.citizen,at.
the public citizen court held that nhtsa balancing of the statutory factors in f was reasonable given that the possible energy savings from the higher standard did not outweigh the severe economic costs,id.at,since the maximum potential increase in annual fuel consumption attributable to th e rule would amount to less than percent of current consumption,id.at.the court observed,nhtsa found the maximum yearly impact of the lower mpg standard on gasoline consumption to be million gallons,of annual gasoline consumption and of annual petroleum consumption.that savings,nhtsa stated,was not commensurate with potential sales losses to the industry in the hundreds of thousands,job losses in the tens of thousands,or the unreasonable restriction of consumer choices.pub.citizen,at citation omitted.in sum,congress did not offer a more precise balancing formula for the agency to apply to the four factors,and i n the absence of a sharper congressional delineation,the court could not conclude that,under the circumstances presented there,nhtsa decision was not a reasonable accommodation of conflicting statutory policies.id.at.
in this rulemaking,nhtsa does not set forth its interpretation of the four factors in f.it simply states that in determining the maximum feasible fuel economy level,nhtsa assesses what is technologically feasible for manufacturers to achieve without leading to adverse economic consequences,such as a significant loss of jobs or the unreasonable elimination of consumer choice.at.at citing pub.citizen,at.nhtsa balance s the four factors in f,along with other factors such as safety,in determining the cafe standards.at.in earlier rulemakings,nhtsa interpreted technological feasibility to mean whether particular methods of improving fuel economy will be available for commercial application in the model year for which a standard is being established,economic practicability to mean whether the implementation of projected fuel economy improvements is within the economic capability of the industry,effect of other federal motor vehicle standards on fuel economy to mean an analysis of the unavoidable adverse effects on fuel economy of compliance with emission,safety,noise,or damageability standards,and the need of the nation to conserve energy to mean the consumer cost,national balance of payments,environmental,and foreign policy of our need for large quantities of petroleum,especially imported petroleum,emphasis added see also ctr.for auto safety,at.
nhtsa recognize s that it in the past has expressed its belief that the statutory consideration of economic practicability differs from,but does not preclude consideration of,cost benefit analysis.at.in its final rule establishing passenger automobile cafe standards for mys,nhtsa stated,not equating considerations with economic practicability is consistent with the goal of achieving maximum feasible fuel economy by allowing economically and technologically possible standards which will improve fuel economy but which an analysis,subject to many practical limitations,might indicate are not.see.the agency further opined,a analysis would be useful in considering economic practicability,but sole reliance on such an analysis would be contrary to the mandate of the act.id.at.in this rulemaking,however,nhtsa states that the analyses conducted today are substantially more robust than those conducted in decades past and provide a more substantial basis for consideration of economic practicability.at.
we agree with nhtsa that epca neither requires nor prohibits the setting of standards at the level at which net benefits are maximized.id.at.the statute is silent on the precise question of whether a marginal analysis may be used.see chevron,at.public citizen and center for auto safety persuade us that nhtsa has discretion to balance the factors in f when determining maximum feasible cafe standards under a.
to be clear,we reject only petitioners contention that epca prohibits nhtsa use of marginal analysis to set cafe standards.whatever method it uses,nhtsa can not set fuel economy standards that are contrary to congress purpose in enacting the conservation.we must still review whether nhtsa balancing of the statutory factors is arbitrary and capricious.additionally,the persuasiveness of the analysis in public citizen and center for auto safety is limited by the fact that they were decided two decades ago,when scientific knowledge of climate change and its causes were not as advanced as they are today the need of the nation to conserve energy is even more pressing today than it was at the time of epca enactment.see,nrdc cmt.at,when fuel economy legislation was first enacted,america consumed million barrels of oil per day and percent of oil came from imports.in the nearly years since then,oil consumption has risen to over million barrels per day and percent of oil is imported.if fuel economy standards are not strengthened,these trends are only expected to get worse,with transportation oil use driving percent of oil demand growth through and imports rising to percent of oil demand.the light duty vehicle fleet currently consumes million barrels per day,and in the absence of stronger standards,that is projected to grow to million barrels by.nas report at.what was a reasonable balancing of competing statutory priorities twenty years ago may not be a reasonable balancing of those priorities today 
failure to monetize benefits of greenhouse gas emissions reduction 
even if nhtsa may use a analysis to determine the maximum feasible fuel economy standard,it can not put a thumb on the scale by undervaluing the benefits and overvaluing the costs of more stringent standards.nhtsa fails to include in its analysis the benefit of carbon emissions reduction in either quantitative or qualitative form.it did,however,include an analysis of the employment and sales impacts of more stringent standards on manufacturers.see.at.
to determine the maximum feasible cafe standards,nhtsa began with the fuel economy baselines for each of the seven largest is,the fuel economy levels that manufacturers were planning to achieve in those years.id.at.nhtsa then add ed fuel saving technologies to each manufacturer fleet until the incremental cost of improving its fuel economy further just equal ed the incremental value of fuel savings and other benefits from doing so.id.at.the standard is further adjusted until net benefits are maximized.maximization occurs when the incremental change in compliance costs from adjusting it further would be exactly offset by the resulting incremental change in benefits.id.nhtsa claims that this analysis carefully considers and weighs all of the benefits of improved fuel savings,and that there is no compelling evidence that the unmonetized benefits would alter our assessment of the level of the standard for my.id.at.
under this methodology,the values that nhtsa assigns to benefits are critical.yet,nhtsa assigned no value to the most significant benefit of more stringent cafe standards reduction in carbon emissions.petitioners strongly urged nhtsa to include this value in its analysis,and they cited scientific literature in support.nrdc cited figures for the benefit of carbon emissions reduction ranging from to per ton,based on values assigned by the california public utilities commission,the idaho power company,and the european union eu carbon trading program nrdc cmt.at.nrdc also cited a study published by the national commission on energy policy,which found that measures mitigating climate change emissions have estimated benefits of per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.the commission recommends a price of per ton beginning in and then rising percent each year.id.at footnote omitted.environmental defense and the union of concerned scientists recommended a minimum value of per ton carbon or per ton,which reflects a mean marginal damage cost developed in studies environmental defense cmt.at,ucs cmt.at.valuing carbon emissions at per ton carbon translates into approximately per gallon of gasoline saved.ucs cmt.at.the nas committee,on which nhtsa relies for other aspects of its analysis,also valued the benefit of carbon emissions reduction at per ton carbon.nas report at.
nhtsa acknowledged that c onserving energy,especially reducing the nation dependence on petroleum,benefits the in several ways.it has benefits for economic growth and the environment,as well as other benefits,such as reducing pollution and improving security of energy supply.at.nhtsa also acknowledged the comments it received that recommended values for the benefit of carbon emissions reduction however,the agency refused to place a value on this benefit.see id.at nhtsa stated 
the agency continues to view the value of reducing emissions of and other greenhouse gases as too uncertain to support their explicit valuation and inclusion among the savings in environmental externalities from reducing gasoline production and use.there is extremely wide variation in published estimates of damage costs from greenhouse gas emissions,costs for controlling or avoiding their emissions,and costs of sequestering emissions that do occur,the three major sources for developing estimates of economic benefits from reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.moreover,commenters did not reliably demonstrate that the unmonetized benefits,which include,and costs,taken together,would alter the agency assessment of the level of the standard for my.thus,the agency determined the stringency of that standard on the basis of monetized net benefits.
see also fria,at to 
nhtsa reasoning is arbitrary and capricious for several reasons.first,while the record shows that there is a range of values,the value of carbon emissions reduction is certainly not zero.nhtsa conceded as much during oral argument when,in response to questioning,counsel for nhtsa admitted that the range of values begins at per ton carbon.nhtsa insisted at argument that it placed no value on carbon emissions reduction rather than zero value.we fail to see the difference.the value of carbon emissions reduction is nowhere accounted for in the agency analysis,whether quantitatively or qualitatively.this position also contradicts nhtsa own explanation in the final rule that the agency determined the stringency of the my standard on the basis of monetized net benefits.at emphasis added by presenting a range of values that does not begin at zero,petitioners have shown that it is possible to monetize the benefit of carbon emissions reduction.
second,nhtsa gave no reasons why it believed the range of values presented to it was extremely wide in fact,several commenters and the nas committee recommended the same value per ton carbon.the nas committee selected the value of per ton carbon although it acknowledged the wide range of values in the literature and the potential controversy in selecting a particular value.nas report at.nhtsa argues that the problem was not simply the ultimate value to be assigned,but the wide variation in published estimates of the three major underlying costs of carbon dioxide cost of damages caused by such emissions,the costs of avoiding or controlling such emissions,and the costs of sequestering resulting emissions.nhtsa br.at.but nhtsa fails to explain why those three underlying costs are relevant to the question of how carbon emissions should be valued.we are convinced by petitioners response 
to monetize the benefits of reducing emissions from automobiles,nhtsa did not need to calculate the costs of sequestering emissions.carbon capture and sequestration,though a feasible means of reducing emissions from large stationary sources such as power plants,was not within the range of actions at issue in this automobile fuel economy rulemaking.nor were costs for controlling or avoiding emissions a genuine methodological barrier here nhtsa already performed an elaborate analysis of the costs of mandating increases in fuel economy.for purposes of this rulemaking,that was the relevant category of control costs.
epca reply br.at in sum,there is no evidence to support nhtsa conclusion that the appropriate course was not to monetize or quantify the value of carbon emissions reduction at all.
citizens for clean air epa,cir,which nhtsa cites to support its contention that agencies may decline to adopt a particular monetary value when the costs and benefits are too uncertain,nhtsa br.at,is inapposite.in citizens for clean air,petitioners filed for administrative review of a state agency grant of a permit for construction of a solid waste incinerator.citizens for clean air,at.epa denied the petitions,and this court held that the decision of the epa not to consider recycling as a possible best available control technology under the clean air act was not arbitrary or capricious.id.at.the epa noted in its proposed rule that it was unable to reliably quantify the emission reductions attributable to materials separation when a waste incinerator is equipped with highly efficient air pollution control devices.id.at citation omitted.petitioners submitted no hard evidence that recycling would reduce air pollution when the waste incinerators are already equipped with pollution control equipment,scrubbers.id.at.in addition,the clean air act required that the proposed technology,recycling be the best available control technology,and in the absence of anything specific or quantifiable in support we conclude that epa decision not to consider recycling in permitting spokane incinerator was not arbitrary or capricious.id.at.the petitioners in citizens for clean air had to satisfy such a high statutory threshold best available control technology,and they could not satisfy that threshold without hard evidence.by contrast,petitioners here provided substantial evidence of the value of carbon emissions reduction,and they do not have to satisfy a high statutory threshold.
third,nhtsa reasoning is arbitrary and capricious because it has monetized other uncertain benefits,such as the reduction of criteria pollutants,crash,noise,and congestion costs,see fria at to,and the value of increased energy security.at.michael wang of the center for transportation research at argonne national laboratory stated in his peer review of the cafe compliance and effect model used by nhtsa in its rulemaking that the wide range of dollar values per ton of is not a good reason that co dollar values are not included the same can be said of dollar values for criteria pollutants.yet,monetary values for criteria pollutant emissions are included in the model.wang cmt.at 
fourth,nhtsa conclusion that commenters did not reliably demonstrate that monetizing the value of carbon reduction would have affected the stringency of the cafe standard runs counter to the evidence before it.nrdc forest,cir citation omitted.the union of concerned scientists concluded that including a value in the determination of fuel economy could increase the targets by an average of mpg.ucs cmt.at.given that the cafe standards set by nhtsa increase only mpg from my to an additional to mpg increase by my is significant.in addition,environmental defense calculate d the benefits of the cumulative reductions at and discount rate at billion by and billion by current dollars.environmental defense cmt.at.
we agree with petitioners that the values they suggest,cents per gallon of gasoline in nhtsa estimation,would not be a small benefit.under nhtsa own calculation that reformed cafe will save billion gallons of gasoline for my light trucks,see.at,cents a gallon of carbon benefits would yield hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits even after that by themselves would be substantial in relation to the net benefits that nhtsa calculated for the rule.epca reply br.at citing.at showing net benefits of million for my under reformed cafe.nhtsa simply did not examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.quoting burlington truck lines united states,d.
finally,there is no merit to nhtsa unfounded assertion that if it had accounted for the benefit of carbon emissions reduction,it would have had to account for the adverse safety effects of downweighting,and the two would have balanced out,resulting in no change to the final cafe standards.no evidence supports this assertion.the assertion is also based on the controversial assumption that higher fuel economy standards for light trucks causes adverse safety effects from downweighting.
thus,nhtsa decision not to monetize the benefit of carbon emissions reduction was arbitrary and capricious,and we remand to nhtsa for it to include a monetized value for this benefit in its analysis of the proper cafe standards.
vehicle safety analysis 
petitioners argue that nhtsa acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it omitted weight reduction for vehicles between and lbs.curb weight as a measure manufacturers could use to increase fuel economy.the nas committee found that weight reduction for vehicles greater than lbs.curb weight would result in a safety benefit total fatalities in a hypothetical fleet of relatively modern passenger vehicles would be reduced by about percent if all pickups and suvs weighing more than lbs.were replaced with pickups and suvs weighing to lbs.nas report at.the nas committee also noted that such weight reduction would improve safety in part because it improves crash compatibility,or the variance in vehicle weights between large and small vehicles.id.at 
the study by charles kahane,cited by the nas committee and nhtsa,did not find a safety benefit resulting from reducing the weight of light trucks between to,but it found that o verall,light trucks weighing pounds or more are involved in fatal crashes that result in a total of fatalities per year.a reduction would not significantly change those fatalities.kahane study at 
in the final rule,nhtsa applied a confidence bound of approximately lbs.to the figure,given the significant statistical uncertainty around that figure,and used lbs.as the threshold for considering weight reduction.at.the source of the lbs.confidence bound is additional empirical work found in kahane study dealing with the crossover weight.fria,at.nhtsa recognized that the crossover weight and the point of zero net impact lbs.differ,but it concluded that they would both tend to have similar sampling errors.id.
petitioners argue that nhtsa selection of a lbs.confidence bound is arbitrary and capricious because kahane lbs.figure already accounts for uncertainty,and the confidence bound is taken from a different part of kahane study.they also argue that nhtsa arbitrarily excluded from its uncertainty analysis the benefits of reducing crash incompatibility resulting from weight reductions in the pound class,and whether these might offset any statistically uncertain safety costs.epca reply br.at.
petitioners arguments have some merit,and we believe this is a close question.however,we conclude that nhtsa explanation for using the confidence interval for the crossover both the crossover weight and the point of zero net impact would have similar sampling not rel y on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely fail to consider an important aspect of the problem,or run counter to the evidence before the agency,and is not so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.motor vehicle mfrs.ass n,at.petitioners have not sufficiently established the deficiencies in nhtsa reasoning.
backstop for reformed cafe 
under reformed cafe,a manufacturer required cafe level would depend on its fleet mix.see.at,reformed cafe setting individual fuel economy targets for vehicles of every footprint size plus a backstop overall average would prevent manufacturers from upsizing their vehicles or producing too many large footprint vehicles,if the backstop were set high enough.under unreformed cafe,manufacturers had to meet only a average,which means that they could increase the number of small vehicles with higher fuel economy they produced in order to balance out the larger vehicles with lower fuel economy and achieve the required cafe standard.nhtsa argues that reformed cafe will alleviate the problem of downweighting because there will no longer be a large gap between the cafe targets for passenger cars and light trucks.see.at reformed cafe,as adopted today,links the level of the average fuel economy targets to the size of footprint so that there is an incentive to reduce weight only to the extent one can do so while also preserving size.
petitioners generally agree that reformed cafe,with its progressive fuel economy targets based on vehicle footprint,is an improvement over unreformed cafe.however,they argue that reformed cafe must include a backstop so that the minimum level of average fuel economy applicable to a manufacturer in a model year would not be determined solely by the manufacturer fleet mix.see a.they argue that the statutory language maximum feasible average fuel economy level,id.a emphasis added,minimum level of average fuel economy applicable to a manufacturer in a model year,id.a emphasis added and the statutory structure contemplate a fixed minimum cafe standard for light trucks.
nhtsa argues that a backstop would unduly limit consumer choice and perpetuate the problems with unreformed cafe.see.at.it argues that the statutory requirement that there be a minimum level of average fuel economy applicable to a manufacturer does not necessarily mean a fixed minimum and is consistent with a minimum standard applicable to a manufacturer based on that manufacturer fleet mix.
neither the epca language nor structure explicitly requires nhtsa to adopt a backstop the issue is whether it was arbitrary or capricious in not adopting a backstop.under reformed cafe,manufacturers would still be required to meet a minimum average fuel economy would simply be no corporate minimum average fuel economy level.that is,each vehicle of a particular footprint would be required to meet a minimum average fuel economy level,but there would be no minimum.see.at.the corporate or minimum would depend entirely on the number of vehicles of each footprint that the manufacturer decided to produce.see id.
although congress has not directly spoken on this issue,it has directed the agency to set the average fuel economy level for light trucks at the maximum feasible level,a,considering technological feasibility,economic practicability,the need of the nation to conserve energy,and the effect of other motor vehicle standards of the government,id.f.nhtsa did not consider these factors in deciding whether to adopt a backstop.see.at.instead,the agency explained 
the intent of the cafe program is not to preclude future mix shifts and design changes in response to consumer demand.a backstop would likely have this influence such a system would be in opposition to congressional intent to establish a regulatory system that does not unduly limit consumer choice.
at.nhtsa may consider consumer demand,but it would clearly be impermissible for nhtsa to rely on consumer demand to such an extent that it ignored the overarching goal of fuel conservation.ctr.for auto safety,at.we believe that nhtsa has committed this error here.although epca is not intended to unduly limit consumer choice,at,as reprinted in,energy conservation is the fundamental purpose of the statute and an explicit statutory factor that nhtsa shall consider,see f.an agency may not ignore factors congress explicitly required be taken into account.earth island inst.hogarth,cir citation omitted.nhtsa did not adequately consider the need of the nation to conserve energy,as it was required to do under f,and it has not argued that a backstop would be technologically infeasible or economically impracticable.see.at.
we do agree with nhtsa that the continuous function of reformed cafe will likely reduce the incentive to upsize because there will no longer be only two categories of cafe standards light trucks and passenger cars.see.at.but,petitioners raise concerns given the historical trend that a floating standard would continue to permit is not just a function of consumer demand,but also a function of manufacturers own design and marketing decisions.we remand to nhtsa for it to reconsider under the proper standard whether to adopt a backstop based on the factors in f.
transition period 
the final rule permits manufacturers to choose to comply with unreformed cafe or reformed cafe in mys.at.beginning in my,manufacturers must comply with reformed cafe.petitioners argue that the transition period offered by nhtsa to manufacturers is impermissible under epca since nhtsa must prescribe a single maximum feasible average fuel economy level.they argue that nhtsa has i n effect granted an automatic exemption to manufacturers unwilling to meet the reformed cafe standards between and,and that this is impermissible because the statute grants exemptions only on an individual basis and if the manufacturer meets certain statutory criteria.epca br.at citing d.
we conclude that the transition period is not prohibited by epca,and nhtsa decision to allow it is not arbitrary or capricious.first,nhtsa has not granted an exemption to manufacturers during the transition period,because manufacturers are still required to comply with the cafe just have a choice as to which standard with which to comply.
second,and more importantly,nhtsa has provided a reasoned explanation for the transition period it will minimize the potential for unintended compliance burdens that may be experienced by a manufacturer as the result of shifting to a new regulatory structure,it is critical given that this is the first comprehensive reform of the light truck cafe program since its inception,and the structure of the reformed cafe might require some manufacturers to revise their compliance strategies,since it minimizes the ability of manufacturers to offset the low fuel economy performance of larger vehicles by increasing the production of smaller vehicles with higher fuel economies.manufacturers that relied on such a compliance strategy in the past might need to revise their product plans in order to comply with the reformed cafe standard.at.nhtsa also noted that m anufacturers develop product plans for their fleets at least years in advance,plans which incorporate consideration of cafe compliance.id.at.
changing the definition of passenger and automobiles in order to close the suv loophole 
petitioners challenge nhtsa decision not to reform the suv loophole.they argue that this decision is arbitrary and capricious because it runs counter to the evidence showing that the majority of suvs,minivans,and pickup trucks function solely or primarily as passenger vehicles,and because nhtsa has not provided a reasoned explanation for why the transition to reformed cafe could not be accomplished at the same time as a revision in the definitions.
the epca defines passenger automobile as an automobile that the secretary decides by regulation is manufactured primarily for transporting not more than individuals,excluding an automobile capable of operation that the secretary decides has a significant feature except drive designed for operation and is drive or more than lbs.gvwr.a.automobiles are thus defined by exclusion.nhtsa defines an automobile other than a passenger automobile as a light truck,a term not used in the statute.under a,the secretary has discretion to decide what constitutes a passenger automobile within the confines of the listed criteria.
nhtsa initially sought input on ways to revise the regulatory distinction because the passenger truck distinction had become obsolete the application of the regulation to the current vehicle fleet designed with the regulatory distinctions in mind less clearly differentiates between passenger cars and light trucks than it did in the.at anprm.however,in the nprm,nhtsa decided not to 
chang e those classification regulations at this time in part because nhtsa believe s an orderly transition to reformed cafe could not be accomplished if nhtsa simultaneously change s which vehicles are included in the light truck program and because,as applied in my,reformed cafe is likely to reduce the incentive to produce vehicles classified as light trucks instead of as passenger cars.
at.ultimately,nhtsa did not change the light truck definition other than by expanding the flat floor provision to include vehicles with folding seats,if the vehicles have at least three rows of designated seating.see a.at.
we conclude that nhtsa decision not to otherwise revise the passenger truck definitions is arbitrary and capricious.first,nhtsa has not provided a reasoned explanation of why an orderly transition to reformed cafe could not be accomplished at the same time that the passenger truck definitions are revised.
second,nhtsa asserts that it reasonably decided to look to the purpose for which a vehicle is manufactured instead of consumers use of a vehicle because it is a more objective way of differentiating between passenger and automobiles.but this overlooks the fact that many light trucks today are manufactured primarily for transporting passengers,as nhtsa itself has acknowledged many vehicles produced today,while smaller than many other passenger cars,qualify as light trucks because they have been designed so that their seats can be easily removed and their cargo carrying capacity significantly enhanced.at emphasis added see also.at nas report noted that the passenger truck fuel economy gap created an incentive to design vehicles as light trucks instead of cars.today design differences,which capitalize on the lower light truck cafe standard,are the very reason that nhtsa sought input on ways to revise the regulatory distinction in light of the current and emerging motor vehicle fleet.see.at.
in addition,nhtsa new focus on the purpose for which automobiles are manufactured conflicts with its earlier assertion that congress intended that passenger automobiles be defined as those used primarily for the transport of individuals.id.at emphasis added see also id.at the market suggests that while some light trucks may be used primarily to transport passengers,their peak use or value capability towing boats,hauling heavy loads,may be a critical factor in the purchase decision.emphasis added.
third,nhtsa decision runs counter to the evidence showing that suvs,vans,and pickup trucks are manufactured primarily for the purpose of transporting passengers and are generally not used for operation.the nas committee found that 
the less stringent cafe standards for trucks did provide incentives for manufacturers to invest in minivans and suvs and to promote them to consumers in place of large cars and station wagons.by shifting their product development and investment focus to trucks,they created more desirable trucks with more carlike features quiet,luxurious interiors with leather upholstery,audio systems,extra rows of seats,and extra doors.
nas report at emphasis added see also id.at noting the exploding demand for light trucks such as minivans and suvs and pickup trucks with features such as extra rows of seats.consumers use light trucks primarily for purposes in large part because that is precisely the purpose for which manufacturers have manufactured and marketed them.see,app.a to public citizen cmt.kathleen kerwin,you call this the family car pickups with roomy cabs become a status accessory,business week.a pickup truck usage study conducted by polk showed that of light pickup users use their trucks to carry passengers on a daily or weekly basis,use them for personal trips on a daily or weekly basis,use them for commuting on a daily or weekly basis,never use them for towing,and never use them for driving.polk study at.percent of medium pickup users use them for carrying passengers on a daily or weekly basis,use them for commuting on a daily or weekly basis daily,and never use them for driving.polk study at.even among heavy pickup users,use them for carrying passengers on a daily or weekly basis,and never use them for driving.polk study at the nas committee further found 
when cafe regulations were originally formulated,different standards were set for passenger vehicles and for vehicles because vehicles needed extra power,different gearing,and less aerodynamic body configurations to carry out their utilitarian,functions.but this working definition distinction between a car for personal use and a truck for work transport has broken down,initially with minivans,and more recently with sport utility vehicles and other vehicles that may be designed for peak use but which are actually used almost exclusively for personal transport the distinction has been stretched well beyond its original purpose.
nas report at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.one of the changes the nas committee recommended to alleviate this problem was to tighten the definition of a light truck,a step the epa has already taken for emissions standards purposes.id.we agree with petitioners that nhtsa decision not to do the same was arbitrary and capricious,especially in light of epca overarching goal of energy conservation.thus,we remand to nhtsa to revise its regulatory definitions of passenger automobile and light truck or provide a valid reason for not doing so.
exclusion of lb.pickup trucks from cafe regulation 
petitioners argue that nhtsa decision not to regulate the fuel economy of vehicles between and lbs.gvwr generally referred to as class trucks other than mdpvs,is arbitrary and capricious because fuel economy standards for these vehicles are feasible and will result in significant energy conservation.see a.we agree.
all,fuel and alternative vehicles manufactured for use on roads and highways that are lbs.gross vehicle weight or less are automobiles.see a a.vehicles more than but less than lbs.gross vehicle weight are automobile s for the purpose of fuel economy regulation if the secretary decides by regulation that i an average fuel economy standard under this chapter for the vehicle is feasible and ii an average fuel economy standard for the vehicle will result in significant energy conservation or the vehicle is substantially used for the same purposes as a vehicle rated at not more than pounds gross vehicle weight.id.a b.since,nhtsa has defined vehicles lbs.gvwr or less as automobiles.see b iii.
the anprm presented two options under which the fuel economy of vehicles with a gwvr of up to lbs.could be regulated.see.at.one option was to include mdpvs,vehicles with a gvwr of greater than but less than lbs.that are designed primarily for the transportation of persons.nhtsa explained that t his definition would essentially make suvs between and lbs.gvwr subject to cafe,while continuing to exclude most medium and pickups and most medium and cargo vans that are primarily used for agricultural and commercial purposes.id.another option was to make all vehicles between and lbs.gvwr subject to cafe standards.id.nhtsa invited comments on these and any other proposals to regulate vehicles between and lbs.gvwr.id.the nprm discussed the inclusion of mdpvs,but it did not address the proposal to regulate all vehicles between and lbs.gvwr.see.at.
the final rule incorporates mdpvs into the definition of automobile such that these vehicles would be regulated as light trucks beginning in my.b.at.nhtsa declined to regulate other vehicles between and lbs.because unlike mdpvs,they 
are not subject to epa testing that provides the data necessary to determine compliance with the cafe program.inclusion of the would increase the test burden for manufacturers.these vehicles would be subject to a whole new testing regime.moreover,because these vehicles are not subject to comparable testing requirements,there is not sufficient data to estimate a fuel economy baseline.without a reliable baseline,the agency is unable to determine fuel economy targets that would result in required fuel economy levels that are economically practicable and technologically feasible.
we conclude that this is not a reasoned explanation for excluding class trucks from cafe regulation.first,petitioners presented compelling evidence that setting fuel economy standards for class trucks is feasible.for example,a department of energy research planning study included estimates 
based on detailed simulation modeling of both the city and highway driving cycles working from a baseline class truck baseline estimates were mpg city,mpg highway,and mpg combined the study identified technology options capable of yielding substantial improvements,including higher fuel economy with technologies available over a horizon and,with use of hybrid engines in diesel versions of the vehicles,a near doubling of the fuel economy of a baseline gasoline class pickup would be a feasible stretch goal.
app.f to environmental defense cmt.at.an argonne national laboratory study identified numerous technological improvements that could be applied to class trucks,including aerodynamic improvements,lower tire rolling resistance,improved transmissions,for diesel engines,other engine refinements,integrated,and powertrains.id.another study,published by the american council for an economy,found that the potential fuel economy improvement was over a baseline pickup.id.at.overall,while class trucks are designed with heavier frames and higher capacities,and therefore larger powertrains and other components,they primarily pickups entail substantially the same engineering as vehicles under lbs gvwr,and in many cases share components.id.at see also ucs cmt.at.
second,petitioners presented substantial evidence that setting cafe standards for class trucks would result in significant energy conservation and that these vehicles are substantially used for the same purposes as a vehicle lbs.gvwr or less class trucks constitute the majority of vehicles in the to lb.gvwr class.see aceee cmt.to anprm at p ickups constitute about of vehicles in the lb.weight range.one of the petitioners argued 
epa estimates sales of class trucks at per year.given higher per vehicle oil consumption,we estimate that trucks consume of overall demand from trucks under pounds gvwr.
if class trucks were to improve their fuel economy by per year over my,it would save barrels of gasoline and diesel fuel per day by and reduce ghg emissions by a cumulative mmtc over that time frame.even at comparable fuel economy improvements to those nhtsa proposes for the largest class trucks regulated under the reformed per year,the country would save barrels of gasoline and diesel fuel per day by.these amounts are significant a barrel per day bpd saving would be equivalent to million of annual savings at a relatively modest shadow price of gallon.this far exceeds the million threshold for a significant energy action under executive order.
environmental defense cmt.at see also ucs cmt.at estimating that i f these vehicles had been held to the same fuel economy standard as other trucks,the total fuel consumption by trucks under lbs gvwr would be approximately million gallons less in,for a savings of nearly barrels of oil per day.this corresponds to about of class fuel use.
the evidence also shows that class trucks are substantially used for the same purposes as vehicles not more than lbs.gvwr.the polk study showed that of heavy pickup truck owners use them for carrying passengers on a daily or weekly basis,use them for personal trips on a daily or weekly basis,use them for commuting on a daily basis,and never use them for driving.polk study at see also environmental defense cmt.at citing a vehicle inventory and use survey conducted by the census bureau for the argument that i n the intervening decades since nhtsa revised its definition of automobile to include class trucks but exclude class trucks,trucks of all sizes have increasingly shifted from commercial uses to personal uses.
nhtsa did not address any of this evidence in the final rule,and it does not argue that setting cafe standards for class trucks would not be feasible that it would not result in significant energy conservation,or that class trucks are not substantially used for the same purposes as smaller trucks.see.at nhtsa br.at.instead,nhtsa makes the bold assertion that the agency is not obliged to justify exclusion of such very large vehicles,as the statute has already excluded them,subject to nhtsa discretionary decision to include such vehicles.nhtsa br.at emphasis in original.this is clearly wrong.the statute gives nhtsa some discretion in deciding whether the a factors are met for class trucks,but if these factors are satisfied,then they are automobiles for which nhtsa must set fuel economy standards 
nhtsa asserts that without epa testing data,it can not set cafe standards for class trucks.at.but epa already subjects most class trucks to the city and highway fuel economy tests,city and highway chassis dynamometer testing that nhtsa asserts are needed for it to determine cafe standards.see applying test procedures to trucks above lbs.gvwr complete vehicles.nhtsa does not dispute this fact.
moreover,nhtsa has given no explanation of why it would be infeasible to set standards for class trucks without epa tests.instead,nhtsa position is merely that imposing one set of tests minimize s the test burden to manufacturers.see.at.this concern has no relevance to any of the statutory factors under a b.
finally,nhtsa reasoning is arbitrary because it decided that it is feasible to set cafe standards for mdpvs even though they are not currently subject to epa testing.see id.mdpvs are not currently required to undergo chassis dynamometer testing.epa will begin phasing in city chassis dynamometer testing for mdpvs in my,but mdpvs are exempted from highway chassis dynamometer testing.id.yet,having determined that this additional testing will not be burdensome for the manufacturers,nhtsa required highway tests as a result of including mdpvs in its automobile definition.id.
in sum,nhtsa decision not to set average fuel economy standards for all vehicles between and lbs.gvwr is arbitrary and capricious.that class trucks have never been regulated by nhtsa is not a reason for not regulating them now.we remand to nhtsa to revisit this issue and promulgate average fuel economy standards for these vehicles,or to provide a validly reasoned basis for continuing to exclude them from the regulation.
national environmental policy act 
the epca does not limit nhtsa nepa obligations 
nhtsa argues both that it has broad discretion to balance the factors of f in setting fuel economy standards and that the epca constrains it from considering more stringent alternatives in the ea.nhtsa ca have it both ways.its hands are not tied,as demonstrated by its discretionary,substantive decisions to,among other things,value the benefit of carbon emissions reduction at zero.at,peg its unreformed cafe standard to the least capable manufacturer with a substantial share of the market,id.at,apply technologies only until marginal cost equals marginal benefit id.at,reject weight reduction as a technology for vehicles between and lbs.curb weight,id.at,and not adopt a backstop,id.at.
nhtsa relies on department of transportation public citizen,d,for its contention that it did not have to consider the effect of its rule on climate change.public citizen is inapposite.
in public citizen,the supreme court held that the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa did not need to consider the environmental effects of operations of motor carriers in its ea,since it had no ability to prevent those operations.at.the court reasoned,where an agency has no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the relevant actions,the agency can not be considered a legally relevant cause of the effect.id.the critical feature of the case was the fact that fmcsa has no ability to countermand the president lifting of the moratorium or otherwise categorically to exclude mexican motor carriers from operating within the united states.id.at.fmcsa has only limited discretion regarding motor vehicle carrier registration it must grant registration to all domestic or foreign motor carriers that are willing and able to comply with the applicable safety,fitness,and requirements.fmcsa has no statutory authority to impose or enforce emissions controls or to establish environmental requirements unrelated to motor carrier safety.id.at.emphasis added citation omitted.moreover,neither of the purposes of the public and ensuring agency consideration of the environmental impacts of its be served.knowledge of the environmental impacts would not affect fmcsa decisionmaking since fmcsa simply lacks the power to act on whatever information might be contained in the eis.id.at.
here,in contrast,nhtsa clearly has statutory authority to impose or enforce fuel economy standards,a,c,and it could have,in exercising its discretion,set higher standards if an eis contained evidence that so warranted.see also sierra club mainella,d,the holding in public citizen extends only to those situations where an agency has no ability because of lack of statutory authority to address the impact.national park service,in contrast,is only constrained by its own regulation from considering impacts on the preserve from adjacent surface activities.emphasis in original.although nepa does not demand substantive environmental outcomes,public citizen,at,nhtsa possesses the power to act on whatever information might be contained in an eis.this court has recognized that nepa legislative history reflects congress concern that agencies might attempt to avoid any compliance with nepa by narrowly construing other statutory directives to create a conflict with nepa.section of nepa therefore requires government agencies to comply to the fullest extent possible.forelaws on board johnson,cir id.at holding that the bonneville power administration interpreted its statutory authority too narrowly and g iven bpa statutory duty both to conserve energy use and to preserve fish and wildlife,and the multitude of alternative proposals suggested by government agencies and citizen groups,the failure to prepare an eis demonstrating that the agency has considered all significant alternatives violates both nepa and the apa.citations omitted.
moreover,the cafe standard will affect the level of the nation greenhouse gas emissions and impact global warming.see ctr.for auto safety,at if setting a higher standard can not result in vehicles with increased fuel efficiency,then the entire regulatory scheme is pointless.nas report at the cafe program has clearly contributed to increased fuel economy of the nation vehicle fleet during the past years.nhtsa does not dispute that light trucks account for a significant percentage of the transportation sector,that the transportation sector accounts for about six percent of the world greenhouse gases,and that fuel economy improvements could have a significant impact on the rate of accumulation in the atmosphere,which would affect climate change.nas report at massachusetts.at epa does not dispute the existence of a causal connection between greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.at a minimum,therefore,epa refusal to regulate such emissions contributes to massachusetts injuries.
in sum,the epca does not limit nhtsa duty under nepa to assess the environmental impacts,including the impact on climate change,of its rule.epca goal of energy conservation and nepa goals of help ing public officials make decisions that are based on understanding of environmental consequences,and take actions that protect,restore,and enhance the environment,c,and insur ing that environmental information is available to public officials and citizens before decisions are made and before actions are taken,id.b,are complementary.nepa prohibits uninformed agency action.robertson methow valley citizens council,d.the procedures included in of nepa are not ends in themselves.they are intended to be action forcing.the unequivocal intent of nepa is to require agencies to consider and give effect to the environmental goals set forth in the act,not just to file detailed impact studies which will fill governmental archives.envtl.def.fund,corps of eng rs of the army,cir citation omitted.
sufficiency of the environmental assessment 
we examine the ea with two purposes in mind to determine whether it has adequately considered and elaborated the possible consequences of the proposed agency action when concluding that it will have no significant impact on the environment,and whether its determination that no eis is required is a reasonable conclusion.
even though an ea need not conform to all the requirements of an eis,it must be sufficient to establish the reasonableness of th e decision not to prepare an eis.found.for am.wild sheep,at see also a.an ea s hall include brief discussions of the need for the proposal and the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives.b.an ea must in some circumstances include an analysis of the cumulative impacts of a project an ea may be deficient if it fails to include a cumulative impact analysis native ecosystems council dombeck,cir see also wildlands ctr.bureau of land,cir kern bureau of land,cir.
cumulative impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change and the environment 
a cumulative impact is defined as the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency or person undertakes such other actions.cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.in wildlands center,this court held that 
cumulative impacts of multiple projects can be significant in different ways.the most obvious way is that the greater total magnitude of the environmental effects may demonstrate by itself that the environmental impact will be significant.sometimes the total impact from a set of actions may be greater than the sum of the parts.
the ea catalogues the total tonnage of emissions for light trucks for mys.final ea at.table of the final ea lists the amount of fuel consumption and emissions of criteria pollutants and emissions.id.at.for example,it shows that under unreformed cafe,the lifetime emissions for light trucks my would be million metric tons mmt.id.under reformed cafe,including mdpvs in my,emissions would be million metric tons.id.nhtsa estimated that 
together with the previous action raising my light truck cafe standards,the various alternatives for the current action will reduce lifetime carbon dioxide emissions from my light trucks by to million metric tons,or by to percent from their level if neither action had been taken.my light truck cafe standards are projected to result in cumulative reductions from the previous and current actions ranging from to percent of greenhouse gas emissions over the lifetimes of my light trucks.
id.at emphasis added.
we conclude that the ea cumulative impacts analysis is inadequate.while the ea quantifies the expected amount of emitted from light trucks mys,it does not evaluate the incremental impact that these emissions will have on climate change or on the environment more generally in light of other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable actions such as other light truck and passenger automobile cafe standards the ea does not discuss the actual environmental effects resulting from those emissions or place those emissions in context of other cafe rulemakings.this is a similar deficiency as that found in the bureau of land management ea in wildlands center,where this court held that the blm cumulative impacts analysis was inadequate because a calculation of the total number of acres to be harvested in the watershed is a necessary component of a cumulative effects analysis,but it is not a sufficient description of the actual environmental effects that can be expected from logging those acres and stating the total miles of roads to be constructed is similar to merely stating the sum of the acres to be is not a description of the actual environmental effects.at.
nhtsa does not dispute that the cafe standard will have an effect on global warming due to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.the new rule will not actually result in a decrease in carbon emissions,but potentially only a decrease in the rate of growth of carbon emissions.nhtsa concedes that the new cafe standards will not entirely offset the projected effect of increases in the number of light trucks.nhtsa br.at.however,nhtsa contends that congress is the cause of that shortfall,not the agency,since it is congress decision in epca to require that cafe standards be technologically feasible and economically practicable.id.nhtsa concludes from this that it has no obligation to assess the cumulative impact of its rule on climate change.
this argument is without merit for the reasons already discussed.nhtsa has the power to change the cafe standards based on information contained in an eis.we agree with petitioners that b y allowing particular fuel economy levels,which nhtsa argues translate directly into particular tailpipe emissions,nhtsa regulations are the proximate cause of those emissions just as epa clean air act rules permitting particular smokestack emissions are the proximate cause of those air pollutants and are unquestionably subject to nepa cumulative impacts requirements.nepa gray br.at massachusetts.at.thus,the fact that climate change is largely a global phenomenon that includes actions that are outside of the agency control does not release the agency from the duty of assessing the effects of its actions on global warming within the context of other actions that also affect global warming.states gray br.at emphasis added.the cumulative impacts regulation specifically provides that the agency must assess the impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency federal or or person undertakes such other actions.see also res,robertson,cir the forest service says that cumulative impacts from actions need not be analyzed because the federal government can not control them.that interpretation is inconsistent with,which specifically requires such analysis.
the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change is precisely the kind of cumulative impacts analysis that nepa requires agencies to conduct.any given rule setting a cafe standard might have an individually minor effect on the environment,but these rules are collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.see also native ecosystems council,at holding that the forest service road density standard amendments must be subject to cumulative impacts analysis because otherwise,the forest service will be free to amend road density standards throughout the forest piecemeal,without ever having to evaluate the amendments cumulative environmental impacts.city of los angeles nhtsa,wald,dissenting w e can not afford to ignore even modest contributions to global warming.if global warming is the result of the cumulative contributions of myriad sources,any one modest in itself,is there not a danger of losing the forest by closing our eyes to the felling of the individual trees,overruled on other grounds by.audubon soc.bentsen.thus,nhtsa must provide the necessary contextual information about the cumulative and incremental environmental impacts of the final rule in light of other cafe rulemakings and other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions,regardless of what agency or person undertakes such other actions.
reasonable alternatives 
nhtsa must r igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives.a.the alternatives section is the heart of an eis.id.ilio laokalani coalition rumsfeld,cir nrdc forest,cir.although an agency obligation to consider alternatives under an ea is a lesser one than under an eis,native ecosystems council forest,cir,nepa requires that alternatives be given full and meaningful consideration,whether the agency prepares an ea or an eis,id.at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.the agency must provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact.
in the ea,nhtsa considered a very narrow range of alternatives.all the alternatives evaluated were derived from nhtsa analysis.at the evaluated alternatives represent standards set under the traditional unreformed cafe process and under the marginal analysis previously described.the alternatives presented in the ea are as follows 
alternative a baseline my standard of mpg for mys.
alternative b unreformed cafe for mys and reformed cafe for my with fuel economy targets set using continuous function.mpdvs included in my only.
alternative c reformed cafe for mys with fuel economy targets set using continuous function.impacts are shown including mdpvs for my only and excluding mdpvs altogether.
alternative d reformed cafe as described in nprm,with fuel economy targets set using step function six footprint categories.entirely excludes mdpvs.
alternative e reformed cafe described in nprm,with revised fuel economy targets for each of its six footprint categories.impacts are shown including mdpvs for my only and excluding mdpvs altogether.
final ea at vii.the alternative nhtsa ultimately chose is a mix between alternatives b and c nhtsa adopted reformed cafe beginning in my and unreformed cafe for mys,but it allowed a transition period to reformed cafe in my,so manufacturers may choose to continue to follow unreformed cafe in mys.the adopted alternative includes mdpvs for my only.
these alternatives are hardly different from the option that nhtsa ultimately adopted.the ea states that alternatives c and e are projected to result in the largest reductions in fuel consumption,energy use,and environmental effects among these alternatives,id.at vii,but alternative c is close to what nhtsa adopted the only difference being no transition period,and alternative e barely results in less co emissions than alternative see id.at x change from baseline for alternative c and alternative e with mdpvs in my are the same mmt,and change in baseline without mdpvs is mmt for alternative c and mmt for alternative e.the entire range of alternatives considered in the ea ranged from to mpg for my,to mpg for my,and to mpg for my.id.at.the estimated lifetime fuel and energy use by my light trucks under the alternatives ranged from a to percent decrease from baseline,id.at,and the estimated lifetime emissions of ranged from to mmt,id.at,which is extremely small compared to the overall volume of emissions 
nhtsa acknowledged that the range of impacts from the considered alternatives is very narrow and minimal.at.however,the agency justified its choice of range and refusal to consider other alternatives on the ground that standards more stringent than those represented by the alternatives would not satisfy the statutory requirement to establish standards that are both technologically feasible and economically practicable nepa requirements must be applied in light of the constraints placed on the agency by epca.final ea at viii.once again,nhtsa falls back on its contention that it had no discretion to consider setting higher cafe standards.as before,we conclude that this argument is flawed.
nhtsa also erroneously contends that petitioners have not identified any specific alternative the agency should have considered.to the contrary,environmental defense submitted a detailed appendix to its comment titled,revised analysis for calculating optimal cafe targets.see environmental defense.in this document,environmental defense performed a marginal analysis,using a variety of different assumptions and inputs.table set forth different possible cafe standards for my including nhtsa figure.on the basis of its calculations,it recommended a final rule that would increase cafe standards at a rate of per year and achieve a standard of mpg by my.environmental defense,letter from kevin mills,director,clean car program,environmental defense,to jacqueline glassman,acting administrator,nhtsa.
we also disagree with nhtsa that petitioners suggested alternatives would not be reasonably related to the project purpose.the purpose of the final rule is to set cafe standards for light trucks for mys.at.nhtsa itself describes the scope of the ea as analyz ing the environmental impacts associated with various alternatives to the existing cafe program.final ea at.since epca overarching goal is energy conservation,consideration of more stringent fuel economy standards that would conserve more energy is clearly reasonably related to the purpose of the cafe standards.energy conservation and environmental protection are not coextensive,but they often overlap.the supreme court has recently recognized as much.see massachusetts.at t hat dot sets mileage standards in no way licenses epa to shirk its environmental responsibilities.epa has been charged with protecting the public health and welfare,a,a statutory obligation wholly independent of dot mandate to promote energy efficiency.the two obligations may overlap,but there is no reason to think the two agencies can not both administer their obligations and yet avoid inconsistency.citation omitted.
nhtsa must prepare either a revised environmental assessment or,as necessary,an environmental impact statement 
an agency must prepare an eis if substantial questions are raised as to whether a project may cause significant degradation of some human environmental factor.idaho sporting cong.thomas,cir.petitioners need not show that significant effects will in fact occur,but only that there are substantial questions whether a project may have a significant effect.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir parks conservation ass babbitt,cir.if an agency decides not to prepare an eis,it must supply a convincing statement of reasons to explain why a project impacts are insignificant.the statement of reasons is crucial to determining whether the agency took a hard look at the potential environmental impact of a project.blue mountains biodiversity project,at quoting save the yaak comm.block,cir see also parks conservation ass n,at.nhtsa ea is markedly deficient in its attempt to justify the refusal to prepare a complete eis.as explained below,the agency fonsi is based primarily on its conclusory by evidence in the the final rule will have no significant environmental impact because it authorizes cafe standards that will result in a very small decrease in carbon dioxide emissions.
whether there may be a significant effect on the environment requires consideration of two broad factors context and intensity.parks conservation ass n,at quoting.a number of factors should be considered in evaluating intensity,including,t he degree to which the proposed action affects public health or safety,t he degree to which the effects on the quality of the human environment are likely to be highly controversial,t he degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks,t he degree to which the action may establish a precedent for future actions with significant effects or represents a decision in principle about a future consideration,w hether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts,and t he degree to which the action may adversely affect an endangered or threatened species or its habitat.b.an action may be significant if one of these factors is met.ocean advocates army corps of eng rs,cir see also parks conservation ass n,at either degree of uncertainty or controversy may be sufficient to require preparation of an eis in appropriate circumstances.
nhtsa finding of no significant impact fonsi stated that the agency determined that its final rule will not have a significant effect on the human environment.this finding of no significant impact is based on the attached final environmental assessment ea finding of no significant environmental impact for model year light truck fuel economy standards,nhtsa docket.in the final ea,nhtsa explained that compared to the baseline alternative of extending the my light truck cafe standard through mys,its evaluated alternatives would have a minor beneficial impact on various environmental resources.final ea at.nhtsa concluded that the final rule would produce,compared to emissions of,a small decrease in emissions of,the primary component of greenhouse gas emissions,under the selected alternative.accordingly,the agency determined that the action we are adopting today will not have a significant impact on the environment.at citing final ea at.
petitioners argue that the evidence raises a substantial question as to whether the final rule may have a significant impact on the environment and that nhtsa failed to provide a convincing statement of reasons for why a small decrease rather than a larger decrease in the growth of co emissions would not have a significant impact on the environment.petitioners note that nhtsa has never evaluated the impacts of carbon emissions from light trucks or other vehicles,much less the effect of any reduction or increase in those emissions on climate change.petitioners presented evidence that continued increase in greenhouse gas emissions may change the climate in a sudden and way.without some analysis,it would be impossible for nhtsa to know whether a change in ghg emissions of or or or will be a significant step toward averting the tipping point and irreversible adverse climate change.states gray br.at.
nhtsa argues that its conclusion that a percent decrease in carbon dioxide emissions will not have a significant impact upon the environment is reasonable and consistent with city of los angeles nhtsa,and public citizen nhtsa.nhtsa br.at.nhtsa also argues that the impact of the rule on global warming is too speculative to warrant nepa analysis.
petitioners have raised a substantial question as to whether the cafe standards for light trucks mys may cause significant degradation of some human environmental factor,idaho sporting,at internal quotation marks omitted particularly in light of the compelling scientific evidence concerning positive feedback mechanisms in the atmosphere among the evidence petitioners presented to the agency was the following 
the ipcc third assessment report,which discusses the history of anthropogenic interference with the climate system,the projected increase in climate variability and extreme weather events,and the projected effects on various ecological systems.see ipcc third assessment report at.the ipcc found 
changes in climate could increase the risk of abrupt and changes in many ecosystems,which would affect their function,biodiversity,and productivity.the greater the magnitude and rate of the change,the greater the risk of adverse impacts.for example 
changes in disturbance regimes and shifts in the location of suitable climatically defined habitats may lead to abrupt breakdown of terrestrial and marine ecosystems with significant changes in composition and function and increased risk of extinctions.
sustained increases in water temperatures of as little as,alone or in combination with any of several stresses can lead to corals ejecting their algae coral bleaching and the eventual death of some corals 
inertia is a widespread inherent characteristic of the interacting climate,ecological,and socioeconomic systems.thus some impacts of anthropogenic climate change may be slow to become apparent,and some could be irreversible if climate change is not limited in both rate and magnitude before associated thresholds,whose positions may be poorly known,are crossed.

finally,petitioners have satisfied several of the intensity factors listed in b for determining significant effect.for example,the final rule clearly may have an individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impact with respect to global warming.evidence that petitioners submitted in the record also shows that global warming will have an effect on public health and safety.climate change futures report at.petitioners do not claim nor do they have to show that nhtsa final rule would be the sole cause of global warming,and that is nhtsa only response on this point.
petitioners have also satisfied the controversy factor.see b see blue mountains biodiversity project,at controversial is a substantial dispute about the size,nature,or effect of the major federal action rather than the existence of opposition to a use.alteration in original.nhtsa received over individual submissions on its proposal.see.at see also parks conservation ass n,at and fifty comments,of which opposed the agency preferred alternative was more than sufficient to meet the outpouring of public protest discussed in prior case law.more important,to the extent the comments urged that the ea analysis was incomplete,they cast substantial doubt on the adequacy of the parks service methodology and data.footnote and citation omitted.we reject nhtsa argument that petitioners controversy does not concern the size,nature,or effect of the new cafe standards,but rather the desire of some commenters for different regulations that they have not described in any detail.nhtsa br.at.the entire dispute between petitioners and nhtsa centers on the stringency of the my light truck cafe size or effect.
in light of the evidence in the record,it is hardly that a percent decrease in carbon emissions as opposed to a greater decrease is not significant.nhtsa conclusion that a small reduction compared to baseline in the growth of carbon emissions would not have a significant impact on the environment was unaccompanied by any analysis or supporting data,either in the final rule or the ea.see.at final ea at.
nowhere does the ea provide a statement of reasons for a finding of no significant impact,much less a convincing statement of reasons.for example,the ea discusses the amount of emissions expected from the rule,but does not discuss the potential impact of such emissions on climate change.in the affected environment section of the ea,nhtsa states that i ncreasing concentrations of greenhouse gases are likely to accelerate the rate of climate change.final ea at.the agency notes that t he transportation sector is a significant source of greenhouse gas ghg emissions,accounting for approximately percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the united states.id.from this,nhtsa jumps to the conclusion that c oupled with the effects resulting from the light truck rule,the effects resulting from the agency current action are expected to lessen the ghg impacts discussed above.id.
table of the ea,which shows the potential health effects of criteria air pollutants,is similarly devoid of meaningful analysis or a statement of reasons why the effects would be insignificant.the potential health effect for is described increase in greenhouse gases can lead to climate change.hot temperatures can lead to cardiovascular problems,heat exhaustion,and some respiratory problems.there may be an increased risk of infectious diseases due to increased temperatures.heat can also increase the concentration of ozone.id.at.
nor is there any analysis or statement of reasons in the section of the ea that discusses environmental impacts.the ea states that reduction in fuel production and consumption would reduce contamination of water resources,acid rain,risk of oil spills and contamination,and lead to minor reductions in impacts to biological resources includ ing habitat encroachment and destruction,air and water pollution,greenhouse gases,and oil contamination from petroleum refining and distribution.id.at see also id.at table compares the impacts under the baseline cafe standard of mpg and the analyzed alternatives.it cursorily summarizes the impacts as slower rate of growth in fuel consumption for light trucks,reduction of ghg emissions,and minor benefit to water and biological resources from reductions in energy consumption,ghg emissions and extremely small changes in criteria pollutant emissions.id.at citing no supporting data for its conclusions regarding impacts on water and biological resources.
nhtsa ea shunted aside significant questions with merely conclusory statements,failed to directly address substantial questions,and most importantly,provide d no foundation for the important inference nhtsa draws between a decrease in the rate of carbon emissions growth and its finding of no significant impact.found.for am.wild sheep,at.nhtsa makes vague and conclusory statements unaccompanied by supporting data,and the ea do es not constitute a hard look at the environmental consequences of the action as required by nepa.great basin mine watch hankins,cir.thus,the fonsi is arbitrary and capricious.see wildlands center,at t he problem with the entire table is that it does not provide any objective quantification of the impacts.instead,the reader is informed only that a particular environmental factor will be unchanged,improved,or degraded and whether that change will be minor or major.the reader is not told what data the conclusion was based on,or why objective data can not be provided.
the only reason nhtsa provided for why the environmental impact of the final rule would be insignificant is that it results in a decreased rate of growth of ghg emissions compared to the light truck cafe standard for my.but simply because the final rule may be an improvement over the my cafe standard does not necessarily mean that it will not have a significant effect on the environment.
nhtsa has not explained why its rule will not have a significant effect 
in light of the emergent consensus on global warming,chief judge wald reasoning in her dissent in city of los angeles is not only prescient but persuasive 
while nhtsa did the calculations necessary to determine how much extra carbon dioxide would be emitted,it failed completely to discuss in any detail the global warming phenomenon itself,or to explain the benchmark for its determination of insignificance in relation to that environmental danger.had the emissions been slightly over one percent,would that have been significant without some articulated criteria for significance in terms of contribution to global warming that is grounded in the record and available scientific evidence,nhtsa bald conclusion that the mere magnitude of the percentage increase is enough to alleviate its burden of conducting a more thorough investigation can not carry the day.
petitioners have raised a substantial question of whether the final rule may significantly affect the environment.nhtsa acknowledges that carbon emissions contribute to global warming,and it does not dispute the scientific evidence that petitioners presented concerning the significant effect of incremental increases in greenhouses gases.instead of providing the required convincing statement of reasons,blue mountains biodiversity project,at internal quotation marks omitted,nhtsa simply asserts that the insignificance of the effects is.
finally,we must decide the appropriate remedy given nhtsa inadequate ea.we have previously recognized that preparation of an eis is not mandated in all cases simply because an agency has prepared a deficient ea or otherwise failed to comply with nepa.if,for example,an ea is so procedurally flawed that we can not determine whether the proposed rule or project may have a significant effect,the court should remand for the preparation of a new ea.see metcalf daley,cir ordering remand for preparation of a new ea,where prior ea was prepared after the agency had already rendered a substantive decision on the permitting action.if an agency completely fails to prepare an ea before deciding that a proposed project or rule will have no significant environmental impact,remand for preparation of an ea is likewise the proper remedy.see jones gordon,cir remanding where agency failed to prepare any nepa document before issuing permit.and where an agency determines that consideration of certain factors are legally irrelevant to the agency action,rendering it impossible for the reviewing court to determine the accuracy of the fonsi,we also remand for preparation of an ea on a complete record.san luis obispo mothers for peace nuclear regulatory comm n,cir ordering remand for reconsideration of ea where agency rejected consideration of terrorist acts as factor to be considered in its review of application for license to construct nuclear storage facility,cert.denied sub nom.pac.gas san luis obispo mothers for peace,d.
by contrast,if the court determines that the agency proffered reasons for its fonsi are arbitrary and capricious and the evidence in a complete administrative record demonstrates that the project or regulation may have a significant impact,then it is appropriate to remand with instructions to prepare an eis.see,parks conservation ass,at idaho sporting,at.
the cases where it is appropriate to order immediate preparation of an eis and those where it is implicit in this circuit nepa jurisprudence,and has been explicitly recognized elsewhere.see army corps of eng rs,cir it is also clear that a decision to forego preparation of an eis may be unreasonable for at least two distinct reasons the evidence before the court demonstrates that,contrary to the fonsi,the project may have a significant impact on the human environment,or the agency review was flawed in such a manner that it can not yet be said whether the project may have a significant impact if the court finds that a project may have a significant impact,the court should order the agency to prepare an eis.if the court finds,on the other hand,that the ea is inadequate in a manner that precludes making the determination whether the project may have a significant impact,the court should remand the case to the agency to correct the deficiencies in its analysis.citations omitted.so,if there is uncertainty over whether the proposed project may have a significant impact,including uncertainty caused by an incomplete administrative record or an inadequate ea,the court should ordinarily remand for the agency to either prepare a revised ea or reconsider whether an eis is required.metcalf,at on reflection,and in consideration of our limited role in this process,we have decided that it is appropriate only to require a new ea,but to require that it be done under circumstances that ensure an objective evaluation free of the previous taint.see also hill boy,cir remanding where agency failure to prepare an eis was based on incorrect assumption audubon soc y hoffman,cir remanding due to incomplete administrative record.
whether to require an eis now is a very close question.petitioners evidence demonstrates,overwhelmingly,the environmental significance of emissions and the effect of those emissions on global warming.how nhtsa can,on remand,prepare an ea that takes proper account of this evidence and still conclude that the final rule has no significant environmental impact is questionable.see fonsi is a document presenting the reasons why an action will not have a significant effect on the human environment and for which an eis therefore will not be prepared emphasis added.we nonetheless give the benefit of the doubt to nhtsa and decline to order the immediate preparation of an eis for two reasons.
first,the ea primary deficiency lies with its conclusory assertion that a modest percent decrease in carbon emissions renders the final rule environmentally insignificant.the ea provides no reasons or analysis in support of this conclusion,much less convincing reasons.blue mountains biodiversity project,at.although petitioners evidence is daunting we can not,in the abstract,categorically decide that nhtsa reasons for this conclusion in a revised ea would be unconvincing.
second,we have a significant reason to defer to the agency as to whether an ea will suffice or whether an eis is necessary.during the pendency of this appeal,congress enacted the energy independence and security act of eisa,stat.eisa requires nhtsa to increase fuel economy standards for passenger and automobiles to reach a combined average of at least mpg by model year.see b a.in connection with eisa,nhtsa has already begun preparation of a complete eis to inform the nepa analysis relating to the cafe standards for my automobiles,including light trucks.notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement for new corporate average fuel economy standards,to be codified at pts.with the exception of my,the eis prepared as a result of the passage of eisa will not encompass the cafe standards implemented by the final rule.however,information developed in preparation of the eis would undoubtedly inform nhtsa decision as to the necessity of an eis in this case.see city of los angeles,at wald,dissenting stating that proper course was to remand without enjoining agency action because agency was already conducting a separate programmatic eis which may yet provide an adequate explanation for its finding of no significant impact.
taken together,these reasons lead us to conclude that the record is insufficiently complete for us to order the immediate preparation of an eis.see,at remanding without instructions to prepare eis metcalf,at same hill,at same audubon soc y,at.we therefore remand to nhtsa to prepare a revised ea or,as necessary,a complete eis.
iv.conclusion 
nhtsa failure to monetize the value of carbon emissions in its determination of the my light truck cafe standards,failure to set a backstop,failure to revise the passenger truck classifications,and failure to set fuel economy standards for all vehicles in the to lb.gvwr class,was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to the epca.we therefore remand to nhtsa to promulgate new standards consistent with this opinion as expeditiously as possible and for the earliest model year practicable.
we also hold that the ea was inadequate and petitioners have raised a substantial question as to whether the final action may have a significant impact on the environment.thus,we remand to nhtsa for the preparation of a revised ea or,as necessary,a full eis.
reversed and remanded.
i concur in the conclusions by the majority on all points,with the exception of its conclusion in section.i would not find that the nhtsa acted arbitrarily or capriciously in failing to adopt a backstop for a minimum level of average fuel economy.the majority admits that the epca does not require nhtsa to adopt a backstop.we must realize that the arbitrary or capricious standard is one that grants an agency a significant amount of deference.its failure to adopt this backstop was not an act which ignored factors that congress required to be taken into account.under those circumstances,when the epca did not require the adoption of a backstop,i would not find that nhtsa acted arbitrarily or capriciously by failing to do so.
petitioners also argued in their opening briefs that the epca does not preempt california clean air act motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards.they raised this argument in response to nhtsa assertion in the preamble of the final rule that the epca preempts state laws and regulations regarding fuel economy standards.see.at.we do not address this issue since the parties agreed in their response briefs and at oral argument that the preemption discussion in the preamble of the final rule is not final agency action and thus not currently reviewable.

the adverse safety effects of downweighting touted by nhtsa only applies to smaller vehicles such as passenger cars,not light trucks if an increase in fuel economy is effected by a system that encourages either downweighting or the production and sale of more small cars,some additional traffic fatalities would be expected.however,the actual effects would be uncertain,and any adverse safety impact could be minimized,or even reserved,if weight and size reductions were limited to heavier vehicles particularly those over lb.larger vehicles would then be less damaging aggressive in crashes with all other vehicles and thus pose less risk to other drivers on the report at emphasis added see also id.at.the only dispute here is whether nhtsa should have included weight re
