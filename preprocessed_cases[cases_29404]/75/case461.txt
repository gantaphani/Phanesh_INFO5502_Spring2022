pursuant to section of the labor management relations act,a,the brought suit in the district court alleging that daimlerchrysler corporation chrysler breached its contractual obligations to certain workers laid off in the late and early by failing to recall these workers for job openings at chrysler plants in kokomo,indiana.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of chrysler,reasoning in part that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their remedies prior to bringing suit.bell daimler chrysler,wl.may.we agree and affirm.
the plaintiffs are current or former employees of chrysler who,as of the late,were working at a chrysler plant in new castle,indiana.all of the plaintiffs were members of the united auto workers,local local.
the late were not a happy time for chrysler and its workforce.foreign automakers had made substantial inroads into the automobile market during that decade,and gasoline shortages and price increases in the mid and late had made larger and less american cars increasingly unattractive to the american consumer.chrysler situation became so precarious that it took billion in federal loan guarantees to keep the company out of bankruptcy.many chrysler workers lost their jobs.beginning in and continuing through,chrysler laid off hundreds of workers from its new castle plant.the plaintiffs were among those laid off.the reduction in the new castle workforce proved to be not until the early did chrysler begin to make significant numbers of new hires at that plant.
chrysler and uaw were parties to a series of collective bargaining agreements and accompanying side or letter agreements that governed the terms of the plaintiffs employment.there were more than seventy of these letter agreements,which were separately collected in a document entitled letters,memoranda and agreements and colloquially referred to as the book of letters.it appears from the record that the book of letters was updated and republished each time a new collective bargaining agreement was finalized.some but not all of the letter agreements also were appended to the master agreement and its successor agreements.the plaintiffs represent that the book of letters was not distributed to union members,that they were unaware of it at the time of their layoff,and that they did not become aware of the book of letters until shortly before this suit was filed in.
section b of the master agreement between chrysler and uaw accorded employees who had been laid off work opportunity rights that gave the workers priority over off the street,people who had never before worked at any job openings at another chrysler facility within the same labor market area,which was circumscribed by a radius of miles from the plant where the employee had worked.a series of successive letter dated november,dated october,and dated december,expanded the rights of workers beyond their labor market areas to include openings at plants within the same state that were more than miles away from the plant where they had formerly worked.that expanded range meant that workers who had been laid off from the new castle plant had work opportunity rights at chrysler multiple plants in kokomo,indiana,which was more than miles from the new castle plant.the plaintiffs aver that they were not aware of these extended rights at the time of their layoff or in the ensuing years because the relevant letter agreements were not attached to the collective bargaining agreements in force during those years and because the book of letters had not been provided to them.
between january,and december,while the plaintiffs were still on layoff from their jobs at the new castle facility,chrysler hired or more people off the street to work at its kokomo plants.contrary to the terms of letter agreements,and,these jobs were not first offered to the plaintiffs.for purposes of summary judgment below,chrysler conceded that it had violated the plaintiffs work opportunity rights in making these hires chrysler failure to offer the kokomo jobs to the plaintiffs had lasting effects beyond the loss of particular employment opportunities.a employee work opportunity rights were limited to a window of time equal to the length of his employment with chrysler or five years,whichever was greater.if an individual did not return to employment with chrysler during that recall window,he lost the seniority he had accumulated with the company prior to his layoff,which deprived him of his entitlement to priority over off the street applicants for subsequent job openings and had a deleterious effect on his retirement benefits.thus,although many of the plaintiffs eventually were by chrysler,because their took place outside of the recall window,they lost their seniority and the benefits attendant to that seniority.
as the plaintiffs work opportunity rights arose from various agreements between chrysler and uaw,disputes over those rights were subject to a grievance and arbitration process.that process consisted of multiple steps which ultimately culminated in binding arbitration if the dispute was not resolved between the parties.
although rumors and disgruntlement regarding chrysler hiring in kokomo abounded among uaw members in the and,not until april did local challenge the hiring as a violation of chrysler contractual obligations.that month,the local filed two grievances asserting that chrysler had disregarded the work opportunity rights of its workers beginning in,when it started to hire workers off the street at its kokomo facilities.not until that time,the plaintiffs assert,did they realize that the hiring was contrary to the terms of the various letter agreements between chrysler and uaw.but the belated filing of these grievances was apparently triggered at least in part by the success an individual union member had achieved the preceding month after complaining to his congressman and the department of veterans affairs.ronnie lough,like other members of local,had been laid off from the new castle plant in.lough later served in the navy from until.upon his discharge,he sought with chrysler and asked that his time in the armed services be recognized as a military leave of absence and that he be rehired by the company but lough was advised that there were still other workers with greater seniority in the queue ahead of him awaiting recall.lough eventually was able to return to work at the new castle facility,but by this time his recall window had closed and he had lost his seniority as a result.lough complained to his congressman about his loss of seniority,noting that chrysler had been hiring people with lesser or no seniority both before and after his attempt at reemployment.his congressman forwarded the complaint to veterans affairs.after the veterans employment and training services looked into the matter,lough original seniority date was reinstated as of march.
the two grievances filed on behalf of the plaintiffs were presented to chrysler labor relations representatives.chrysler denied both grievances as untimely at the second step of the contractual grievance procedure.local appealed the grievances through step and thence to what is described as the appeal board step of the process,where the two grievances were consolidated.at that stage of the grievance process,the duty fell to international union representative paul pete cutway to investigate the grievances,discuss them with company representatives,and decide whether to pursue them further to arbitration.after looking into the grievances,cutway decided to withdraw them for multiple reasons.first,cutway believed that the grievances were untimely,given that violations of employees work opportunity rights had been discussed among union members since the but no grievance had been filed until.cutway was aware of lough successful grievance and had suggested to chrysler representatives that the belated restoration of lough seniority had opened a can of worms but cutway ultimately was persuaded by chrysler position that it was lough status as a veteran of the armed services,and not his layoff from the new castle plant,that had triggered the restoration of his seniority.second,cutway believed that the grievances posed insurmountable problems of proof he could find little or nothing in the way of a paper trail that would enable him to show that chrysler had,in fact,violated the work opportunity rights of employees in hiring people more than years earlier,and a number of key witnesses to the relevant events,including past presidents of local,had either died or retired from the company.these circumstances persuaded cutway that uaw was unlikely to prevail at arbitration,and for that reason the grievances were withdrawn without precedent as of january.
pursuant to section b of the master agreement in effect at that time,grievances can be withdrawn either without prejudice or without precedent.a grievance that is withdrawn without prejudice may be reinstated within three months of the withdrawal.a grievance withdrawn without precedent may not be reinstated and so the withdrawal is with prejudice,but the withdrawal may not serve as binding precedent in another case.
local was advised of the withdrawal of the grievances by a letter dated february.that same day,when the grievances were discussed at a meeting,general holiefield,the administrative assistant to uaw international,told workers that the issue was dead.
the decision to withdraw a grievance is one that can be appealed.article of the uaw constitution provides that such an appeal may be initiated either by a local organization or by an individual union member.indeed,section of article requires that such internal appeals be pursued before an aggrieved individual or local seeks relief outside of the union 
it shall be the duty of any individual or body,if aggrieved by any action,decision or penalty imposed,to exhaust fully the individual or body remedy and all appeals under this constitution and the rules of this union before going to a civil court or governmental agency for redress.
where,as here,it is the decision of an international union representative that is being challenged,the route of appeal is first to the uaw international executive board via the uaw international president and then either to the convention appeals committee comprised of representatives from each of uaw regions or,where appropriate,to the public review committee comprised of independent union outsiders.such an appeal must be commenced within thirty days of the decision being challenged.
letter agreement number between chrysler and uaw,dated october,confirms that a grievance can be reinstated by means of such internal union appeals,even as the agreement acknowledges the parties shared interest in finality 
during negotiations of the national production and maintenance,office and clerical,engineering and parts depot agreements,the parties acknowledged the desirability of ensuring prompt,fair and final resolution of employee grievances.the parties also recognized that the maintenance of a stable,effective and dependable grievance procedure is necessary to implement the foregoing principle to which they both subscribe.accordingly,the parties view any attempt to reinstate a grievance properly disposed of as contrary to the purpose for which the grievance procedure was established and violative of the fundamental principles of collective bargaining.
however,in those instances where the international union,uaw,by either its i executive board,ii public review board,or iii constitutional convention appeals committee has reviewed the disposition of a grievance and found that such disposition was improperly effected by the union or a union representative involved,the uaw chrysler department may inform the corporate labor relations staff in writing that such grievance is reinstated in the grievance procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred.
this letter agreement thus serves to confirm that not only may a union local or one of its members appeal the withdrawal of a grievance as set forth in article of the uaw constitution,but that such an appeal can result in the reinstatement of a grievance.in this sense,letter agreement number serves to qualify section b of the master agreement by making clear that a grievance withdrawn without precedent can be reinstated through uaw appellate process if by no other means when a reviewing body concludes that the decision to withdraw the grievance was in some respect inappropriate.
however,after the withdrawal of their grievances was announced,none of the plaintiffs filed an appeal within the time period specified by article.instead,on february,many of the plaintiffs filed suit against chrysler in federal court.another group of plaintiffs filed a second,similar lawsuit against the company and the union three months later.an amended complaint in the second suit,which added three additional plaintiffs,brought the total number of plaintiffs to.the two suits were consolidated in the district court.
ultimately,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of chrysler.as the court noted,union members,before they may bring suit against their employer under section of the lmra for breach of a collective bargaining agreement,ordinarily are required to exhaust whatever private remedies are available to address their grievances,including remedies.wl,at citing clayton uaw,d.by failing to appeal uaw decision to withdraw their grievances,the plaintiffs had not complied with this requirement.the court considered each of the three factors that the supreme court and this court have identified as relevant to whether the failure to exhaust may be excused hostility of union officials that would render exhaustion futile,inadequacy of the internal appeal procedure to obtain reinstatement of the grievance or the full range of relief otherwise available under section,and whether pursuit of internal appeals would unduly delay a hearing on the merits of the plaintiff complaint.id.at citing hammer uaw,cir.no argument was made as to the possibility of undue delay,the third factor.although one of the two groups of plaintiffs argued on testimony that some of those rehired had been told by local and international union officials that they should be glad they got their jobs back,and on the statement of the international union representative at a union meeting that the issue was dead and should be pursued no court found the limited evidence they submitted insufficient to raise a triable issue on that point.id.at.this minimal effort to support the contention of futility is not enough to begin to approach what is necessary to show that the internal appeal process was poisoned to the point that any attempt to appeal would have been in vain.id.and although all of the plaintiffs contended that an internal appeal could not have obtained the reinstatement of their grievances once they had been withdrawn without therefore with court found that contention belied by the express terms of letter agreement,which in allowing the reinstatement of grievances via the appellate process drew no distinction between grievances withdrawn with prejudice and those withdrawn without prejudice.id.at the plaintiffs did suggest in passing that union leaders had not apprised them of their right to appeal the withdrawal decision,but the court noted that union members are charged with knowledge of the contents of such freely available documents as a union constitution.id.at.accordingly,the court found that the plaintiffs failure to exhaust their internal remedies was unexcused and that,consequently,they were foreclosed from seeking relief in federal court.id.
although the plaintiffs have named only chrysler as a defendant,their lawsuits unavoidably implicate uaw and its decision to withdraw their grievances.a section lawsuit is an exception to a national labor policy that favors private rather than judicial resolution of disputes arising under collective bargaining agreements.republic steel maddox,d.litigation is therefore considered the last resort in resolving such disputes,vail raybestos prods,cir.chrysler and uaw have contracted to resolve most of their disputes through a grievance and arbitration process.union members must avail themselves of these mechanisms before turning to the courts for relief.id.otherwise,the judiciary may marshal its scare resources to resolve disputes that the parties could have resolved privately.id.and had uaw taken the plaintiffs grievances to arbitration,the plaintiffs and the company both would have been bound by the result subject only to extremely narrow judicial review.see delcostello int l brotherhood of teamsters,d,dexter axle int l ass of machinists aerospace workers,cir.in fact,however,uaw opted to drop the plaintiffs grievances rather than take them to arbitration.it was that decision that opened the door to this suit.for vaca sipes,d,and its progeny recognize that a union owes a fiduciary duty to represent its members fairly and when the union fails in that obligation and mishandles a member grievance against his employer,the aggrieved union member is entitled to seek relief in federal court.see delcostello,at.at.this is what gives rise to the hybrid nature of a section representation lawsuit the plaintiff is claiming that the employer has violated the collective bargaining agreement,but he is pursuing that claim in a judicial rather than a private forum because he is also claiming that the union has breached its duty of fair representation that claimed violation.see ibid.these two claims are inextricably interdependent.id.at.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.whether the plaintiff has sued his employer,his union,or both,in order to recover from either of them he must prove that his union breached its fiduciary obligation and that his employer breached the collective bargaining agreement.id.at.at.
a claim that a union has breached its duty to fairly represent one of its members presumes that the union has been given a complete opportunity to pursue that member grievance.see republic steel,at.at.generally speaking,a member will not be heard to complain in court that his union breached its duty of fair representation unless he has first presented his grievance to the union and,if rebuffed,exhausted any and all of the internal union appeals available to long as such appeals could result either in granting him complete relief or in the reinstatement of his grievance.clayton,at.at.the qualification stems from the fact that remedies are the sole province of the union they are designed to settle disputes between a union and its members.see id.at.at.as such,intraunion remedies are distinct from the mechanisms specified by a collective bargaining agreement for resolving disputes between the union and the employer,and requiring a union member to exhaust his internal union remedies before filing suit will not in all instances further the national interest in the private resolution of disputes arising from collective bargaining agreements.ibid.that interest will not be served,for example,when the exhaustion of remedies holds out no prospect of meaningful relief to the plaintiff.ibid.however,the interest will be served when there is a reasonable possibility that a member grievance may be resolved through available remedies,either by reinstating his grievance and thus giving him another shot at relief through the procedure or by directly granting him the relief he seeks.in either case,exhaustion of internal remedies could result in final resolution of the employee contractual grievance through private rather than judicial avenues.id.at.at see also miller general motors,cir.
the decision whether to dismiss a section suit for failure to exhaust internal union remedies is one committed to the district court discretion,arnold united mine workers of,cir.among the factors bearing on that decision are whether the union has manifested such hostility to the plaintiff grievance as to render exhaustion of his internal appeal rights futile,whether the internal union appeals procedures are inadequate either to reactivate the grievance or to result in complete relief to the plaintiff,and whether demanding exhaustion would cause undue delay in the resolution of the plaintiff complaint.clayton,at.at see also hammer uaw,supra,at fulk united transp.union,cir.the plaintiffs in this case have relied on the first and second of these factors,but not the third.we must consider whether the district court abused its discretion in concluding that neither factor excused the plaintiffs failure to exhaust their union remedies before bringing suit.a court abuses its discretion when it resolves a matter in a way that no reasonable jurist would,or when its decision strikes us as fundamentally wrong,arbitrary,or fanciful.united states paul,cir.but,keeping in mind that the district court resolved this case on summary judgment,we must also consider whether the evidentiary record reflects any material dispute as to the relevant facts that might require a trial,or whether the district court committed any legal error in evaluating those facts.our review on those matters is,of course,de novo.lucas pyramax bank,fsb,cir.
to begin,there is no dispute that there were avenues of appeal open to the plaintiffs after international union representative cutway made the decision to withdraw their grievances.article of the uaw constitution describes an appellate process for review of the decisions of international representatives,makes clear that such appeals may be taken either by a union local or by an individual union member,and allows thirty days for such an appeal to be taken.it is undisputed that the plaintiffs made no efforts to take such an appeal before they repaired to federal court.in short,they did not exhaust the appeals that were available to them to challenge cutway decision to withdraw their grievances.
invoking the second of the three clayton factors,however,the plaintiffs make two threshold arguments which relate to the adequacy of the appellate process available to them.each of these arguments has to do in one way or another with letter agreement,which reveals that a grievance withdrawn by a union official can be reinstated pursuant to the appellate process described in article.the first of these is procedural they contend that chrysler brought letter agreement to the district court attention too late in the summary judgment briefing below.because chrysler did not cite letter agreement until it filed its reply memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment,the plaintiffs contend that they were deprived of the opportunity to respond to any argument based on that letter agreement and for that reason the district court should have ignored it.they go on to argue that an integration clause in the collective bargaining agreement precludes chrysler from relying on any side agreement akin to letter agreement.
the procedural the plaintiffs were caught by surprise when chrysler first cited letter agreement in its reply its force in the face of rule d of the southern district of indiana local rules.that rule gives a nonmovant seven days in which to file a surreply when the party seeking summary judgment has cited new evidence in its reply brief leave of court is not required to file such a surreply.thus,the plaintiffs were not deprived of the chance to respond to letter agreement.indeed,they are silent as to why the opportunity to file a surreply was not sufficient to address letter agreement.and for what it is worth,our review of the record satisfies us that chrysler belated citation of letter agreement number was a natural and reasonable response to what the plaintiffs had argued in their memorandum in opposition to the motion for summary judgment.see hardrick city of bolingbrook,cir 
plaintiffs invocation of the integration clause in the collective bargaining agreement poses a more intriguing challenge to letter agreement,but it is not one that we need to resolve.the integration clause section of the master agreement was not cited to the district court below,and so we do not have the benefit of the district court thinking on that question the appellate briefing on this point is less than complete neither party has cited any authority on such clauses,let alone authority that would shed light on the reach or limits of such clauses collective bargaining agreements that have been supplemented over long periods of
