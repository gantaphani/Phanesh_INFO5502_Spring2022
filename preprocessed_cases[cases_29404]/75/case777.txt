calmat company calmat petitions for review of a final decision and order of the department of labor administrative review board arb,holding that calmat violated the whistleblower protection provision of the surface transportation assistance act staa,when it suspended robert germann without pay.we have jurisdiction under c,and we deny the petition for review.
background 
after working nearly twenty years for calmat,germann was elected the local union shop steward in.on april,a fellow employee told germann that three drivers had worked for more than fifteen hours the previous day,in violation of california and federal safety regulations.germann checked the employees time cards and verified that each had worked for more than eighteen hours on april.
concerned for their safety,germann spoke with all three employees to ensure that they knew that it is illegal to drive for more than fifteen hours in one day and to encourage them not to do so,even if pressured by supervisors.germann discussions with one of these workers,tony contreras,became heated.additionally,germann contacted the california highway patrol chp,reported the violations,offered to file a formal complaint,and discussed having someone from chp do a presentation to educate calmat drivers about the safety regulations.finally,germann talked to several calmat managers about the violations.on april,germann informed benny white,calmat transportation manager,that he had reported the safety violations to chp.
on april,white spoke with contreras about germann safety complaint.contreras told white that he had worked over hours voluntarily.additionally,contreras told white that germann was harassing him about the violation,and that germann had called him a chihuahua,which contreras regards as an ethnic slur,as well as a son of a bitch and a motherfucker.the next day,may,white informed germann that he was suspended without pay,pending investigation of threats and harassment that germann allegedly made to a fellow employee.
jeff dyer,calmat director of labor relations,investigated contreras complaint against germann,and dyer investigation evolved to include the issue of whether germann had encouraged calmat employees to slow down their work.on may,calmat issued germann a written notice officially converting his suspension into a disciplinary suspension without pay for using an ethnic slur and obscene language,and for encouraging a work slowdown.germann returned to work but calmat terminated his employment on november,
meanwhile,on may,germann filed a complaint with the occupational safety and health administration of the department of labor,alleging that he was suspended in retaliation for making safety complaints in violation of the staa whistleblower protection provisions.under the staa,employers in the commercial motor transportation industry may not discipline or discriminate against an employee in retaliation for filing complaints alleging a violation of a commercial motor vehicle safety regulation,standard,or order.a.lodging complaints within a company is protected under the staa.clean harbors envtl.servs.herman,cir yellow freight,reich,cir after the department of labor issued initial findings that calmat had not violated the staa,germann requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj pursuant to b b.the hearing was held february to february.
on august,the alj issued a recommended decision and order rdo concluding that calmat had violated the staa when it suspended germann.more specifically,the alj found that calmat reasons for suspending germann were pretext for retaliation.in the alternative,using analysis,the alj held that,if calmat was motivated in part by the legitimate motive of disciplining germann for harassing contreras,the company would not have suspended germann if not for his protected activities.
calmat appealed the alj decision to the arb,arguing the alj incorrectly applied the standard for burdens of proof the alj committed prejudicial error by admitting and relying upon hearsay evidence and the alj should have deferred to the outcome of a grievance arbitration that concluded that calmat had disciplined germann with just cause.the arb concluded that the alj correctly applied the burden of proof and affirmed on the basis of pretext.additionally,the arb held that the alj did not commit prejudicial error in admitting hearsay evidence and correctly declined to defer to the outcome of germann grievance arbitration.calmat timely petitioned for review,advancing the same arguments.
ii.standards of review 
we review arb decision in an staa whistleblower case in accordance with the administrative procedure act,under which the arb legal conclusions must be sustained unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,and its findings of fact must be sustained unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.see brink,herman,cir see also truck manpower,dep t of labor,cir.we review the decision of the arb rather than the alj,but the arb is required to consider conclusive the alj factual findings if supported by substantial evidence.castle coal oil reich,cir c.

iii.discussion 
burden of proof for showing retaliation 
calmat contends that the alj erred in applying analysis to this case because germann presented no direct evidence that calmat suspended germann in retaliation for his safety complaints,and the arb abused its discretion by affirming the alj despite this error.calmat argument fails for two reasons.first,germann need not produce direct evidence to prove retaliation under either the pretext or framework.furthermore,since our review is of the arb decision and the arb affirmed solely on the alj holding of pretext,we affirm on that basis.

the alj held that germann proved retaliation in violation of the staa under a pretext theory or,in the alternative,under a theory.as to pretext,the alj held that germann made out a prima facie case of retaliation,calmat rebutted it with evidence that it disciplined germann for a legitimate reason,but germann showed by a preponderance of the evidence that calmat articulated reason for the suspension was pretext for retaliation.
the alj made various findings to support the conclusion that calmat was motivated by a desire to retaliate against germann for making safety complaints,including germann was suspended a few days after voicing safety complaints contreras complaint against germann emerged during investigation of germann safety complaints suspending a employee without pay pending investigation is an unusually severe reaction to contreras complaint the length of germann suspension was severe beyond the criteria of the company progressive disciplinary standards and calmat treated similar complaints involving racial slurs or sexual harassment less seriously.
