plaintiffs appellants dorothy biery,the julia chalfant etvir trust,farms,american packaging corporation,and collins industries,are landowners in kansas.each of them owns land abutting a mile stretch of rail corridor near the city of south hutchinson,kansas.in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,their predecessors in interest granted various deeds covering that land to the hutchinson southern railroad company.the burlington northern and santa fe railway bnsf eventually succeeded to the interests of that railroad.up until,the corridor served the operations of the bnsf.plaintiffs appellants brought this action in the united states court of federal claims,alleging that the subsequent conversion of the corridor to a recreational trail pursuant to the national trail systems act trails act,d,constituted a taking of their several property interests in the land underlying the corridor.as a result,they claimed,they were entitled to compensation under the fifth amendment.
on april,pursuant to rule b of the rules of the united states court of federal claims rcfc,the court of federal claims entered judgment in favor of the government on claims.biery united states.the court did so after ruling on summary judgment that none of the possessed a property interest in the land underlying the rail corridor that could be the subject of a taking.biery united states,initial decision.the court concluded that the land had been conveyed to the bnsf predecessor in fee simple,contrary to claims that the several conveyances at issue had only granted easements.plaintiffs appellants now appeal from the court judgment 
for the reasons set forth below,we conclude as follows the underlying land claimed by julia chalfant etvir trust and farms,chalfant was conveyed to the bnsf predecessor in fee simple.chalfant thus has no compensable property interest in the land.the underlying land claimed by dorothy biery biery was not conveyed to the bnsf predecessor in fee simple.rather,the railroad predecessor was only granted an easement over the land.biery thus retains title to the land,a compensable property interest.on the present record,it is not clear whether the underlying land claimed by american packaging corporation and collins industries,american packaging was held by the bnsf predecessor in fee simple or whether the bnsf predecessor simply held an easement over the land.of the three deeds at issue for american packaging,the granted the railroad predecessor only an easement over the land.the two subsequent deeds,though,conveyed interests.the effect of these deeds,however,is clouded by questions.thus,we can not presently say whether american packaging holds title to the land,a compensable property interest.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of federal claims as it relates to chalfant,but reverse it as it relates to biery and american packaging.the case is remanded to the court for further proceedings.
background 
the fifth amendment to the constitution provides that private property shall not be taken for public use,without just compensation.const.amend.v.the first issue to be addressed in a takings case is whether the claimant has a cognizable interest in the property that allegedly was taken.air pegasus of,united states.if the claimant does not have such an interest,that is the end of the matter.id.at.the court does not then proceed to the next step in the analysis,which is to determine whether there was a taking.id.
as noted,in,the stretch of rail corridor at issue was converted to a public trail pursuant to the trails act.if,prior to the conversion,the bnsf held title to the land underlying the corridor,then,for their part,possess no compensable property interests.that is because the railroad title would constitute complete ownership in the land.tiffany real prop.ed.if,however,the bnsf held only easements over the land,then retained a interest in the land.under those circumstances,if the bnsf conversion of the railroad tracks to a recreational trail was outside the scope of the easements and thus constituted abandonment,then the bnsf would have lost its interest because if the beneficiary of an easement abandons it,the easement disappears,and the landowner resumes his full and unencumbered interest in the land.marvin brandt revocable trust united states,citing smith townsend.in short,if hold title to the land,they may potentially have a compensable property interest for purposes of a takings claim.
the issue in this case is whether the deeds from the late nineteenth and early twentieth century,upon which the bnsf interest was predicated,granted interests to the railroad predecessor,or merely easements.we therefore begin by briefly setting forth the conveyances that are relevant to the claim of each of the several.we then turn to the events leading up to this lawsuit and the subsequent proceedings in the court of federal claims.
chalfant appellants 
the chalfant appellants claim the land referenced in the deed from julia fair the julia fair deed to the hutchinson southern railroad in the late nineteenth century.in,a condemnation decree declared a for the hutchinson,oklahoma gulf railroad across land owned by thomas fair.it is undisputed that the railroad took only an easement over the land at that time.the condemnation decree does not mention thomas wife,julia fair.after the condemnation,the hutchinson,oklahoma gulf railroad merged with the hutchinson southern railroad company.in,after thomas fair had died,julia fair executed a quitclaim deed to the hutchinson southern railroad for the same land that was subject to the earlier condemnation proceeding.the relevant language from the deed states that,for,fair transferred the following interest to the railroad 
a strip of land one hundred feet wide being fifty feet on each side of the center line of the railroad of the hutchinson southern railway as the same is now located and constructed over and across section thirty five township twenty three range six with the appurtenances and all the estate,title and interest of the said parties of the first part therein.
joint appendix.
biery appellant 
appellant biery claims the land referenced in the deed from the phillips investment company the phillips deed to the hutchinson southern railroad.similar to the land claimed by chalfant,the land claimed by biery was originally subject to condemnation proceedings.in,the phillips investment company executed an indenture in favor of the hutchinson southern railroad on a preprinted form titled right of way deed.in exchange for in consideration,the phillips deed transferred the following property interest to the railroad 
all that part of the east half of the north west quarter of section twenty three township twenty three south of range six west,lying south of the south line of tenth avenue extended and east of a line feet west and parallel to the center of the track of the hutchinson and southern railway company,containing acres,more or less,and being the tract on which condemnation proceedings were filed in the county treasurer office on july.
the deed also transfers an interest in land described as lots one hundred and sixty eight and one hundred and seventy sixth avenue west in blanchard second addition to the city of hutchinson.id.at.in language,the deed recites the transfer as being of an absolute and indefeasible estate of inheritance,in fee simple,of and in all and singular the above granted and described premises,with the appurtenances id.
american packaging appellants 
the american packaging appellants claim the land referenced in the deed from ella rowland and edward rowland the rowland deed and in two deeds from the irrigation loan trust company the irrigation loan deeds to the hutchinson southern railroad.
an condemnation decree declared a for the hutchinson southern railroad across lots in blanchard third addition in south hutchinson,kansas.subsequently,in,ella and edward rowland executed a quitclaim deed to the hutchinson southern railroad that describes a series of lots matching those described in the condemnation decree.after listing the lots,the deed states the following language of conveyance for and in consideration of and the of all the right of way now occupied by said railroad in blanchard third addition to the city of south hutchinson.
in,the irrigation loan trust company executed two quitclaim deeds to the railroad.for in consideration,the first deed quitclaims an interest in a strip of land described as t he west feet of the west half of the south quarter of section number twenty three.for in consideration,the second deed quitclaims an interest in a series of lots that make up a portion of the lots listed in the condemnation decree and in the rowland quitclaim deed.
in,for in consideration,the rowlands executed a quitclaim deed to harriet hettinger,transferring their interest in the lots described in the deed,but noting that the railroad had a right of way consisting of a strip the width of two lots feet off of and along the west side of the property.
d.the bnsf interest 
as noted,the bnsf interest in the properties at issue began with condemnation proceedings in the late nineteenth century brought by the hutchinson,oklahoma gulf railroad and the hutchinson southern railroad.sometime after those condemnation proceedings,the two railroads merged into the atchison,topeka and santa fe railroad,which subsequently merged with the burlington northern railroad to become the bnsf.
in,congress passed legislation amending the trails act to preserve shrinking rail trackage by converting unused to recreational trails.preseault interstate commerce comm preseault i,citing.et.by converting unused railways to recreational trails as an interim use,the interstate commerce commission could maintain control over the and prevent it from reverting to landowners under state law,thus preserving it for possible future railroad use.id.at.under the law,therefore,before abandoning an unused railway,a railroad must seek permission from the surface transportation board board.citizens against rails to trails surface transp.if the railroad and the board reach agreement,the land underlying the railway may be transferred to a trail operator,state,political subdivision,or qualified private organization for interim trail use.id.if no agreement is reached,the railroad may abandon the line and liquidate its interests.id.citing preseault i,at.depending on the scope of the railroad interest in the property,the conversion of the railway to a recreational trail may constitute a compensable taking under the fifth amendment.preseault united states preseault ii,en banc.
in,after having discontinued its use,the bnsf sought the board permission to abandon the railway that ran across the properties at issue in this case.soon after,the bnsf and the city of south hutchinson entered into a trail use agreement.in donating its property to the city for trail use,the bnsf noted that it may not have held title or any other interest in the property.subsequently,claimed ownership of the land underlying the railway and sought compensation for a taking.
proceedings in the court of federal claims 
plaintiffs appellants filed suit in the court of federal claims in under the tucker act,alleging a taking and seeking compensation under the fifth amendment.on cross motions for summary judgment,the court found that neither the julia fair deed,the phillips deed,the rowland deed,nor the irrigation loan deeds contained any use restrictions or reversionary clauses.initial decision at.accordingly,the court held that the bnsf and its predecessor acquired title in the properties described in the deeds.id.because the bnsf owned the properties in fee simple rather than holding mere easements,the court determined,had no compensable property interests that were subject to a taking.id.
plaintiffs appellants appealed to this court immediately after the summary judgment order.because the court of federal claims had not entered a partial judgment under rcfc b,and because claims were still pending,we dismissed the notice of appeal as premature.biery united states,app x.in,the court entered final judgment pursuant to rcfc b,dismissing the claims of the five.they appealed again.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
this appeal stems from a grant of summary judgment.we review de novo the grant of summary judgment.ladd united states.summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.rcfc a.we review de novo legal conclusions of the court of federal claims.barclay united states.
as noted,the issue on appeal is the nature of the bnsf property interest in the several strips of land underlying its former railroad tracks.more specifically,we must determine whether the bnsf predecessor took title in the land or merely an easement.the nature and scope of a property interest in a rail corridor is a question of state law.preseault ii,at.under kansas law,the interpretation and legal effect of written instruments are matters of law.stone.
with this background in mind,we turn first to kansas law.we then address the several parcels of land at issue.
kansas law 
kansas courts have uniformly held that railroads do not own fee titles to narrow strips taken as,regardless of whether they are taken by condemnation or deed.harvest queen mill elevator sanders,analyzing and reaffirming the rule laid out in abercrombie simmons.to determine whether a railroad took property as a,kansas courts first look to the deed itself.stone,at.
in construing a deed,the first step is to determine whether it is ambiguous.cent.natural,davis operating,citing wood river pipeline willbros energy servs.in making this determination,kansas courts apply the plain,general,and common meaning of the terms used in the instrument.id.citing johnson johnson.an instrument is ambiguous when the application of pertinent rules of interpretation to the whole fails to make certain which one of two or more meanings is conveyed by the words employed by the parties.id.quoting wood hatcher.if the language of a deed is ambiguous,we may consider facts surrounding the deed execution in order to clarify the parties intent.id.at.for example,the size of the land may help in determining whether a was intended in an ambiguous deed.stone,at.
if,however,the language of a deed to a railroad is unambiguous,we look no further than its four corners and analyze it according to the general rule in kansas.id.at.the general rule is that deeds purporting to convey to railroads a strip,piece,parcel,or tract of land which do not describe or refer to its use or purpose or directly or indirectly limit the estate conveyed are generally construed as passing an estate in fee.id.at.in simpler terms,when an unambiguous deed to a railroad contains no use restrictions,reversionary clause,or anything else indicating the land is for a,the title to the land is granted in fee simple.id.at.
a.the julia fair deed 
to determine whether the chalfant appellants have a compensable property interest,we consider whether the julia fair deed granted the hutchinson southern railroad title or merely an easement.finding that the deed contained no use restrictions or reversionary clause,the court of federal claims held that the deed granted the railroad title.initial decision at.
as noted,the julia fair deed quitclaimed to the hutchinson southern railroad an interest in a strip of land feet wide with the appurtenances and all the estate,title and interest therein.chalfant argues that the julia fair deed was undertaken to clarify the railroad easement.according to chalfant,the railroad needed the deed because the earlier condemnation decree had listed only thomas fair the late husband of julia.in analyzing the words of the deed,chalfant argues that it describes the conveyance as being over and across the land described,which,according to chalfant,indicates a.the court of federal claims erred,chalfant concludes,by ignoring kansas law and holding that a quitclaim deed in a strip of land to a railroad for a conveyed title.
the government responds that the deed from julia fair expressly and unambiguously conveyed all the estate,title,and interest of fair.the deed contained no use restrictions or
