charles lee filed a putative class action lawsuit on his own behalf and on behalf of all similarly situated drivers for dynamex,a parcel delivery company,alleging dynamex had improperly reclassified the drivers from employees to independent contractors in violation of california law.after first denying lee motion to compel dynamex to identify and provide contact information for potential putative class members,the trial court denied lee motion for class certification.because the trial court discovery ruling directly conflicts with the supreme court subsequent decision in pioneer electronics usa,superior court cal th,d,pioneer,as well as our decisions in landscape,superior court th,d and puerto superior court th,d puerto,and that ruling improperly interfered with lee ability to establish the necessary elements for class certification,we reverse both orders and remand for further proceedings regarding class certification.
factual and procedural background 
dynamex is a nationwide courier and delivery service based in dallas,texas,which has conducted business in california since and presently operates four business centers in california la mirada,hayward,sacramento and san diego.since dynamex has employed approximately drivers.in december dynamex converted all its drivers to independent contractors after management concluded such a conversion would generate economic savings for the company.
drivers are required to obtain insurance through the national independent contractors association nica,which,in turn,issues settlement checks as payment for work performed by the drivers.dynamex promulgates tables for the rates to be charged its customers and standardizes the amounts to be paid the independent contractors.for fixed routes,drivers are assigned a route by dynamex and service the route for either a flat fee or a set amount per package.for work,drivers maintain contact with dynamex using a required nextel cellular telephone paid for by the individual driver and are assigned work by dynamex dispatchers.in each case drivers perform pickups and deliveries using their personal vehicles but wearing dynamex uniform shirts and badges and in accordance with dynamex requirements.although dynamex maintains a policy allowing drivers to refuse work assigned by dynamex,some drivers testified they were forbidden to work for other entities,were required to be available to dynamex on their and faced blackballing were they to refuse dynamex assignments.dynamex retains the right to terminate drivers at any time for any reason.
named plaintiff lee entered into a written independent contractor agreement to perform delivery services for dynamex in january.according to dynamex,he had never before worked in the delivery industry and performed delivery services for dynamex for a total of days.he worked only as an driver dispatched by dynamex la mirada facility and never performed any deliveries directly for dynamex customers or for any company other than dynamex.on april,three months after leaving dynamex,he filed this action as the sole class representative challenging the legitimacy of dynamex relationship with its independent contractor drivers.
the gist of lee complaint is that,since december,the drivers have performed the same tasks in the same manner as they did when they were classified as employees,but dynamex now fails to comply with labor code requirements for employees.the complaint alleges five causes of action arising from dynamex purportedly wrongful reclassification of employees as independent contractors two counts of unfair and unlawful business practices in violation of business and professions code section and three counts of labor code violations based on dynamex failure to pay overtime compensation,to provide properly itemized wage statements or to compensate for business expenses.
shortly after filing the complaint,lee served interrogatories seeking to discover the names and addresses of all drivers who had worked as independent contractors for dynamex.dynamex resisted the discovery,principally under the authority of the court of appeal decision in pioneer electronics usa superior court,th,in which the court approved the use of an letter for notifying members of a putative class of the pending lawsuit although the supreme court had granted review of the case on july,dynamex continued to rely on its analysis and contended the case signals a current trend that putative class members be given the right to to the disclosure of information to class action lawyers.dynamex rejected lee proposal to use an letter.lee then moved to compel dynamex to disclose the requested identification and contact information in january.at a march,hearing on the discovery motion the trial court advised counsel for lee and the putative class it considered the motion premature and stated it would not order disclosure of names and contact information until the class had been certified.
at a december,hearing lee,acting as named representative,sought to certify a class consisting of a ll persons classified as independent contractors who personally picked up and delivered documents,packages,parcels,merchandise,and other shipments for dynamex,in the state of california between april,and the present time using their personal vehicles with gross vehicle weight ratings of less than lbs.in response to dynamex argument the proposed class was,lee refined the putative class definition to exclude individuals from the class for any period of time in which they were not affiliated with nica or another third party administrator for the purpose of providing services to dynamex provided services to dynamex through their own employees or subcontractors more than percent of the time concurrently picked up or delivered shipments for dynamex and another package delivery service that does not have a business relationship with dynamex or concurrently picked up or delivered shipments for dynamex and their own customers.the court denied the motion based on the lack of ascertainability of the class a lack of commonality among the factual situations of the various drivers a lack of typicality of the claims and defenses relating to lee,the proposed class representative and the court doubt class adjudication would be the superior remedy for resolution of the claims raised in the complaint.
lee filed a timely notice of appeal from the order denying class certification.see linder thrifty oil cal th,d,denial of certification motion to entire class is an appealable order daar yellow cab cal d,trial court order that determines the legal insufficiency of the complaint as a class suit is in legal effect a final judgment from which an appeal lies see also aguiar cintas.th,d aguiar.because the trial court discovery order necessarily affects the appealable order denying class certification,in effect a final judgment,it is also properly considered at this time.see code civ,on appeal from final judgment,appellate court may review any intermediate ruling,proceeding,order or decision which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment or order appealed from or which substantially affects the rights of a party.
contentions 
lee contends the trial court erred in its denial of the motion for class certification and in denying his earlier motion to compel discovery,a ruling that prevented him from gathering adequate information to support his motion for class certification.
discussion 
the standards for review of a class certification order 
a trial court ruling on a motion for class certification is reviewed for abuse of discretion.drug stores,superior court cal th,d.because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification accordingly,a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation citation any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.id.at,d,accord,fireside bank superior court cal th,d,see also lockheed martin superior court cal th,d.
class actions are statutorily authorized when the question is one of common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court code civ.the certification question is essentially a procedural one that does not ask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious,supra,cal th at,d.as the focus in a certification dispute is on what type of or likely to arise in the action,rather than on the merits of the case citations,in determining whether there is substantial evidence to support a trial court certification order,the reviewing court consider s whether the theory of recovery advanced by the proponents of certification is,as an analytical matter,likely to prove amenable to class treatment.id.at,d.t his state has a public policy which encourages use of the class action device.id.at,d,see aguiar,supra,th at,d.
the party seeking certification has the burden to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among class members,supra,cal th at,d.the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.accord,fireside bank superior court,supra,cal th at,d.t his means each member must not be required to individually litigate numerous and substantial questions to determine his or her right to recover following the class judgment and the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,must be sufficiently numerous and substantial to make class action advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.lockheed martin superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
a class action also must be the superior means of resolving the litigation,for both the parties and the court.citation.generally,a class suit is appropriate when numerous parties suffer injury of insufficient size to warrant individual action and when denial of class relief would result in unjust advantage to the wrongdoer.citations.citation.r elevant considerations include the probability that each class member will come forward ultimately to prove his or her separate claim to a portion of the total recovery and whether the class approach would actually serve to deter and redress the alleged wrongdoing.citation.b ecause group action also has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.citation.newell state farm ins.th,d accord,aguiar,supra,th at,d see weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,benefits of class action evaluated by interest of each putative class member in controlling his or her case personally potential difficulties in managing a class action nature and extent of already pending litigation by individual class members involving the same controversy and desirability of consolidating all claims in a single action before one court.
the trial court erred in finding the proposed class lacked ascertainability 
ascertainability is required in order to give notice to putative class members as to whom the judgment in the action will be res judicata.hicks kaufman broad home th,d.class members are ascertainable where they may be readily identified without unreasonable expense or time by reference to official records.citation.aguiar,supra,th at,d.in determining whether a class is ascertainable,the trial court examines the class definition,the size of the class and the means of identifying class members.miller woods d.a class is not inappropriate merely because each member at some point may be required to make an individual showing as to eligibility for recovery.aguiar,at,d.rather than focusing the ascertainability question on the ultimate fact class members would have to prove to establish liability,this element is better achieved by defining the class in terms of objective characteristics and common transactional facts making the ultimate identification of class members possible when that identification becomes necessary.hicks,at,d.
the trial court determined the putative class was not sufficiently ascertainable,focusing on the four exclusions offered by lee as a means of refining the categories of drivers to be included.stating it is unclear how to deal with hybrid drivers those who perform services for their own customers or an independent package delivery service or how to determine whether or not someone is excluded altogether or not by the language of the exclusions,the court concluded lee had failed to define the class in terms of objective characteristics and common transactional facts.
because the basic parameters of the class proposed by lee can be readily ascertained through company records,the trial court rejection of the proposed class on this ground was unjustified.evaluating a somewhat similar denial of a motion for class certification in aguiar,supra,th,d,we reversed the trial court refusal to certify a class consisting of current and former employees of cintas corporation who had worked on particular service contracts within a limited period because the company payroll records would identify all employees who performed functions relevant to the pertinent contracts during the timeframe in question.id.at,d.we held,even though not all employees had been assigned to work on the particular contracts,it would be reasonable to infer at this stage of the litigation that all employees in relevant positions worked to some extent on those contracts,and,if it were later determined that certain employees did not work on the contracts,they could be eliminated from the class at that time.ibid.aguiar further instructs it may ultimately be appropriate to facilitate class treatment through the use of subclasses,which can be implemented following discovery into the factual differences among members of the class id.at,d see richmond dart industries,cal d,class action need not be dismissed when trial court can use subclasses to remove any antagonism among members of the putative class see also vasquez superior court cal d,efficiency of class action may be promoted by use of subclasses hicks kaufman broad home,supra,th at,d recognizing trial court ability to divide class members into subclasses to eliminate differences in damage claims.
more recently,division one of this court affirmed the ascertainability of a class consisting of fedex drivers over fedex objection the members of this class shifted in and out,sometimes on a basis.estrada fedex ground package system,th,d estrada.as our division one colleagues explained,the class is ascertainable if it identifies a group of unnamed plaintiffs by describing a set of common characteristics sufficient to allow a member of that group to identify himself as having a right to recover based on the description.citation.if fedex claim is that every member of the class had to be identified from the outset,fedex is simply wrong.see also,supra,cal th at,d,a class action is not inappropriate simply because each member of the class may at some point be required to make an individual showing as to his or her eligibility for recovery bufil dollar financial group,th,d class of employees ascertainable in spite of absence of specific rest period records speculation that goes to the merits of ultimate recovery is an inappropriate focus for the ascertainability inquiry bell farmers ins.exchange th,d class of all employees in certain job categories ascertainable even though some employees may not have worked overtime and thus may not be entitled to any recovery.
in short,the trial court analysis unnecessarily confused issues of ascertainability with the merits of the underlying claims.dynamex records are adequate to identify those persons classified as independent contractors who qualify for membership in the proposed class.at this stage of the proceeding,nothing more is required and appropriate exclusion
