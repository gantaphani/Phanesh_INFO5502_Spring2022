in this case we must decide whether the statute that grants the railroad commission authority to regulate production of commingled oil gas deposits includes the authority to regulate drilling,and if so,whether the railroad commission may consider the commingled deposits as though they were one reservoir when regulating drilling and production in the commingled field.the court of appeals held that the railroad commission could consider the commingled deposits as one reservoir when determining correlative rights and could deny an exception to the requirements prescribed by the field rules absent proof of confiscation as to the commingled reservoir as a whole.although raised by the operator,the court did not address the constitutional implications of its decision.we conclude that the railroad commission has authority to regulate both drilling and production in a commingled field.we further conclude that the railroad commission treatment of the commingled gas as a common reservoir does not violate vested property rights.accordingly,we affirm the court of appeals judgment.
seagull energy e p,holds the acre albert davis lease in the waskom cotton valley field.this field is comprised of several discontinuous lenticular gas sands beneath seagull lease there are three vertically separate sands,the stroud,the c,and the taylor.because the waskom cotton valley field is in pressure communication through drilling,the railroad commission regulates the field as though the sands were a single common reservoir.
seagull completed its first well into the c sand well in and produced gas until june.in,seagull was granted a permit from the commission to complete a new well well in all three sands.because concurrent production from both wells violates the field rules,seagull well before producing from the new well.well was successfully completed in the stroud and taylor sands,but not the c sand.seagull therefore sought an exception permit to reopen well so it could produce from the c sand.
the commission,however,denied the permit.treating the commingled sands as a common reservoir,the commission concluded that seagull was not entitled to an exception from field rules because it had not shown confiscation.seagull appealed,but the district court agreed with the commission and affirmed its decision.the court of appeals also affirmed,and seagull petitioned for our review.
section b of the texas natural resources code,one of the statutes authorizing the commission to regulate commingled oil gas production,has been amended since this case began it formerly provided 
when as provided in subsection b of section or subsection b of section of this code,as amended,the commission has permitted production by commingling oil or gas or oil and gas from multiple stratigraphic or lenticular accumulations of oil or gas or oil and gas,the commission may prorate,allocate,and regulate the production of such commingled,separate multiple stratigraphic or lenticular accumulations of oil or gas or oil and gas as if they were a single common reservoir 
act of june,ch.laws.seagull submits that in the natural order of things it must first obtain a drilling permit,and then a production permit,and that the above statute authorizes the commission to regulate the production of commingled oil and gas,but not drilling.seagull argues then that the permit to reopen well was,in fact,a drilling permit,and not a production permit,and that the commission therefore lacked authority to deny it.
the commission agrees that a producer must first obtain a drilling permit,and then a production permit,but submits that seagull already has two drilling permits and seeks only to amend its permit for well so that it can produce from it simultaneously with well.the court of appeals agreed,concluding that because well had previously been permitted,seagull was not seeking a drilling permit,but a production permit.at.
we agree with the court of appeals that what is ultimately at issue here is seagull right to produce from both wells at the same time.but even were we to agree with seagull that its request was technically a request for a drilling permit,rather than a production permit,we would still not agree that the commission lacked authority to consider that request.we have previously determined that section b was intended to grant the commission broad authority over gas production from commingled deposits.comm pend oreille oil gas,interpreting the statute to determine its effect on the commission pooling authority.in pend oreille,we traced the history of the commingling statutes as well as the circumstances that prompted their enactment,and concluded that the legislature intended for the commission to have broad discretion in regulating commingled oil and gas.id.at.
were there any remaining doubt about the scope of the commission authority here,it was put to rest when the legislature amended section b to provide that the commission may regulate all activities that are under its jurisdiction and associated with such commingled,separate multiple stratigraphic or lenticular accumulations of oil or gas or oil and gas as if the accumulations were a single common reservoir.act of june,ch.laws now codified at.nat.b.the legislative history indicates that the amendment was intended to clarify the commission authority and was prompted by this very litigation,challenging the commission authority to regulate the placement and number of wells in fields where commingling is authorized.bill analysis,senate research center,hb,nat.resources see also bill analysis,house research organization,hb a case pending before the texas supreme court,seagull energy e p,rrc,challenges the rrc authority to treat multiple separate reservoirs as one common reservoir.the disputes the rrc authority to regulate the placement and number of wells in fields where commingling is approved.we conclude that the regulation at issue here was within the scope of that authority delegated to the commission by the legislature.
seagull also complains that the commission order,as applied to it,is unconstitutional because it amounts to a taking of its gas in the c sand.seagull submits that it has a vested property right in each separate gas deposit underlying its land and that the commission denial of a permit to complete a well in the c sand deprives it of this right.furthermore,seagull contends that the commission actions here are arbitrary because the commission has denied it access to some of the gas under its property simply by designating the separate sands as a common reservoir.
the commission responds that there has been no taking here because the three gas deposits on seagull lease have been commingled into one common reservoir in which seagull has a well and from which seagull has not shown confiscation.the commission submits that when commingled production has been authorized,confiscation must be shown from the common reservoir as a whole rather than from an individual,commingled sand thus,the commission sought proof that production from well would fall short of the current reserves remaining under seagull property.
we must decide then whether a mineral owner property right to commingled oil or gas or both extends separately to each commingled deposit or collectively to the commingled whole.the courts below have sided with the commission,concluding that because seagull failed to demonstrate that concurrent production was needed to prevent drainage as to the common reservoir,it failed to carry its burden.the trial court summed up its reasoning in the following letter that accompanied its order 
t he case turns on seagull inability to show that the one well will not allow it to recover its fair share of the field.assuming seagull recovers its fair share of the field,it does not need the second well and nothing has been wasted or confiscated.
the field in question consists of commingled separate multiple stratigraphic or lenticular accumulations of oil or gas or oil and gas.under the law the commission may distribute,prorate,apportion,or allocate the production of such commingled separate multiple stratigraphic or lenticular accumulations of oil or gas or
