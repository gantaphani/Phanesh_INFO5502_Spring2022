sarkis ghazaryan appeals from the trial court order denying his motion to certify a class of limousine drivers allegedly undercompensated by diva limousine,diva in violation of california wage and hour laws.ghazaryan lawsuit contests diva policy of paying its drivers an hourly rate for assigned trips but failing to pay for time between assignments referred to by diva employees as gap time.because the trial court incorrectly focused on the potential difficulty of assessing the validity of diva compensation policy in light of variations in how drivers spend their gap time,we reverse the court denial of the motion and remand with directions to certify ghazaryan two proposed subclasses.
factual and procedural background 
diva operates a limousine service in the greater los angeles area.at the time ghazaryan filed his class certification motion in may,diva indicated it had employed approximately drivers during the previous four years approximately still worked for the company.on any given day diva places between to drivers in the field,and those drivers are dispatched on to trips or runs however,the number of trips can fluctuate between on a slow day and more than on days when special events occur for example,the academy awards.
typically,diva notifies drivers of their first few assignments before their shift begins in part to allow them to plan their gap time.approximately percent of diva drivers have permission to take their diva vehicles home and commute to their first run using their diva vehicles.after these initial runs have been completed,drivers are assigned by the dispatcher to additional trips according to location,availability and fairness among drivers.on a busy day a driver may receive six to eight assignments.on a slow day that number often falls below five trips.drivers have no way of predicting the length of any particular period of gap time although,on occasion,dispatchers may accommodate requests to schedule assignments around the drivers personal appointments.according to anecdotal and statistical estimates submitted by both sides,it is clear drivers were placed daily for substantial periods of time.
ghazaryan was employed by diva as a shift driver for more than five years.diva concedes ghazaryan was a employee who asked for as many assignments as available.notwithstanding his readiness to accept all assignments offered by diva dispatchers,ghazaryan frequently had significant periods of time between assignments.during that gap time ghazaryan understood he was not allowed to use his vehicle for personal use a policy set forth in the official chauffeur handbook provided by diva and was required to stay near the vehicle to be available for assignments and to remain in uniform drivers were also required to utilize gap time for their mandatory rest and lunch breaks,which could be interrupted if dispatched on an assignment.after an incident in which a dispatcher required ghazaryan to cancel his lunch order and accept an assignment,diva management personnel instructed ghazaryan he was to remain available for assignments from dispatch while and was not permitted to refuse them.diva also required drivers to refuel or clean their vehicles as necessary between assignments using diva own facility or one of several predetermined gas stations or car washes.diva monitored its vehicles,including their unauthorized use or location,through gps transmitters.
ghazaryan filed his lawsuit in may alleging diva by its practice of paying drivers by the job,not by the hour,had failed to pay earned wages and overtime or to provide required rest breaks and meal periods in violation of multiple provisions of the labor code and implementing administrative regulations he further also alleged diva had engaged in unlawful business practices under business and professions code section et.although ghazaryan complaint originally identified one broad class with four subclasses,his motion sought to certify only two overlapping subclasses based on diva alleged failure to pay earned overtime and straight time,all current and former employees of defendant who worked as limousine drivers during the period of may,to the present and targeting diva failure to provide mandatory rest breaks,all current and former employees of defendant who work as limousine drivers at any time during the period of may,to the present,worked one or more increments of time without being given a rest break for each such increment and who were not properly compensated therefor.
diva opposed class certification principally because of the purported difficulties in identifying eligible members of the class and assessing the validity of diva compensation policy as applied to different drivers who may or may not have used their gap time for personal pursuits.diva explained it has several categories of drivers,some of whom are paid for gap time.thus,dedicated event drivers,hotel drivers and organ transplant drivers are paid on a strictly hourly basis including any time.diva also submitted declarations from a number of drivers who typically use unpaid gap time for their own purposes,such as working out at the gym,napping or eating at home or running personal errands.several of those drivers stated they are not in favor of ghazaryan lawsuit and do not want diva to change the way it compensates its drivers.
the trial court found these declarations convincing and denied the motion on the ground certification would raise too many individualized issues.ghazaryan filed a timely notice of appeal see linder thrifty oil cal th,d.
discussion 
the standard for review of a class certification order 
class actions are statutorily authorized when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court code civ.a trial court is generally afforded great latitude in granting or denying class certification,and we normally review a ruling on certification for an abuse of discretion.drug stores,superior court cal th,d,drug stores.this deferential standard of review,however,is inapplicable if the trial court has evaluated class certification using improper criteria or an incorrect legal analysis a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at,d,accord,gattuso shoppers,cal th,d,drug stores,at,d,see bartold glendale federal bank th,d i f the trial court failed to follow the correct legal analysis when deciding whether to certify a class action,an appellate court is required to reverse even though there may be substantial evidence to support the court order.
the trial court utilized improper criteria in analyzing ghazaryan motion 
the trial court order denying certification suggests,if ghazaryan claims are valid,class treatment of those claims is appropriate.thus,under the caption numerosity the court stated,if all the employees were during their time and not paid,then the proposed class would be ascertainable and then probably numerous.however,here it would be necessary to first determine an ultimate issue in the case,which this court can not do to determine the class.similarly,as to ascertainability the court asserted,the court first must determine if diva practices are improper and,if so,which drivers fit into an appropriate class.
the trial court is,of course,correct,under supreme court authority,the certification question is essentially a procedural one that does not ask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious.drug stores,supra,cal th at,d.but the trial court fundamentally misconceived the import of the rule against evaluating the merits of the plaintiff claims in deciding whether class treatment is appropriate.rather than denying certification because it can not reach the merits,as the court did here,the trial court must evaluate whether the theory of recovery advanced by the plaintiff is likely to prove amenable to class treatment as the focus in a certification dispute is on what type of or likely to arise in the action,rather than on the merits of the case citations,in determining whether there is substantial evidence to support a trial court certification order,the reviewing court consider s whether the theory of recovery advanced by the proponents of certification is,as an analytical matter,likely to prove amenable to class treatment.id.at,d.
ascertainability and numerosity 
having begun its analysis of ghazaryan motion from the improper assumption the class could not be certified if the underlying conduct had not yet been shown to be illegal,the trial court offered,in concluding the class proposed by ghazaryan was not properly ascertainable the legally correct but factually inapposite statement,it is error to certify a class if that class is defined in terms of ultimate liability questions.as this court explained in hicks kaufman broad home th,d,a class is properly defined in terms of objective characteristics and common transactional facts,not by identifying the ultimate facts that will establish liability.id.at,d.this is precisely what ghazaryan has done.
ghazaryan proposed class referred to without explanation or need as a subclass consists of all drivers employed by diva during a specific period of time,a class of persons already identified by diva through computerized employment records diva argues this class includes drivers who were paid for their time as dedicated event drivers,hotel drivers or organ transplant drivers.yet the existence of these separate assignments in no way renders ghazaryan proposed class unascertainable.if some drivers worked exclusively in one of these categories,they can simply be excluded from recovery if liability is ultimately found.alternatively,the class can be modified to specify only those drivers who were not paid for their or gap time.this modification may not even be necessary if,as we suspect,few diva drivers fall exclusively into a single category.as one of diva dispatchers stated in his declaration,what a driver does varies each day for each individual chauffeur these driver categories are not carved in stone.based on this statement,it would appear virtually all diva drivers have,at some point during the relevant time period,accumulated some unpaid time 
under these circumstances,therefore,the gap time class definition proposed by ghazaryan was neither inaccurate nor elusive.as we have previously explained,c lass members are ascertainable where they may be readily identified without unreasonable expense or time by reference to official records.lee dynamex,th,d see also hicks kaufman broad home,supra,th at,d a scertainability is required in order to give notice to putative class members as to whom the judgment in the action will be res judicata.
diva also argues the proposed class is not ascertainable because determination of the legality of diva policy,as well as damages flowing from any illegality,would require highly individualized assessments resulting from variations in the amount of each driver accumulated gap time and his or her use of that time.but this objection is simply not relevant to the question of the ascertainability of the proposed class.in estrada fedex ground package system,th,d estrada,division one of this court rejected fedex contention the members of the proposed class shifted in and out,sometimes on a basis.the class is ascertainable if it identifies a group of unnamed plaintiffs by describing a set of common characteristics sufficient to allow a member of that group to identify himself as having a right to recover based on the description.see also drug stores,supra,cal th at,d,a class action is not inappropriate simply because each member of the class may at some point be required to make an individual showing as to his or her eligibility for recovery bufil dollar financial group,th,d class of employees ascertainable in spite of absence of specific rest period records speculation that goes to the merits of ultimate recovery is an inappropriate focus for the ascertainability inquiry bell farmers ins.exchange th,d class of all employees in certain job categories ascertainable even though some employees may not have worked overtime and thus may not be entitled to any recovery.
because the purpose of the ascertainability requirement is to ensure notice to potential class members who at some time during their employment by diva accumulated gap time,the proposed subclass consisting of all diva drivers would simply and effectively accomplish this purpose.
community of interest 
the trial court also rejected ghazaryan attempt to establish he shared a community of interest with similarly situated diva employees.while the focus of the ascertainability requirement is to ensure notice of the action is received by putative class members as to whom the judgment in the action will be res judicata,common questions of law and fact are required in order to assure the interests of the litigants and the court are furthered by permitting the suit to proceed as a class action rather than in a multiplicity of separate suits.hicks kaufman broad home,supra,th at,d.the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.drug stores,supra,cal th at,d,accord,fireside bank superior court cal th,d.other relevant considerations include the probability that each class member will come forward ultimately to prove his or her separate claim to a portion of the total recovery and whether the class approach would actually serve to deter and redress alleged wrongdoing.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at,d,prince cls transportation,th,d.
diva contended,and the trial court agreed,ghazaryan did not satisfy the community of interest requirement because of the inherent differences among employees in the amount of gap time accumulated and how that time was spent,issues diva argues are highly relevant to the question whether gap time should be compensable in the first place and,if so,the quantum of any particular driver damages.
determining whether a sufficient community of interest exists to warrant class certification,however,depends not on the differences among individual drivers use of their gap time but on the reasonableness of diva policies as applied to its drivers as a whole.under california law the industrial welfare commission iwc is empowered to formulate regulations known as wage orders governing employment in the state of california,and the division of labor standards enforcement dlse is empowered to enforce california labor laws,including iwc wage orders.tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d,tidewater.the question whether an employer is obligated to pay overtime compensation for shifts depends on interpretation of the term hours worked contained in iwc wage order,codified in california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision g.this provision defines hours worked as the time during which an employee is subject to the control of an employer,and includes all the time the employee is suffered or permitted to work,whether or not required to do so.
in response to specific employer inquiries about the term hours worked,the dlse has issued several advisory opinion letters,which,while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority,do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.bell farmers ins.exchange th,d.one such advisory letter,issued on march,acknowledges the inquiry is highly,but t he bottom line consideration is the amount of control exercised by the employer over the activities of the worker i mmediate control by the employer which is for the benefit of the employer must be compensated.in a subsequent advisory letter dated december,the dlse summarized the factors relevant to this inquiry.whether there are excessive geographic restrictions on the employee movements.whether the frequency of calls is unduly restrictive.whether a fixed time limit for response is unduly restrictive.whether the employee can easily trade his or her responsibilities with another employe
