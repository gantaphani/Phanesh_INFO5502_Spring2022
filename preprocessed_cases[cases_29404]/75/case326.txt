this case presents an issue of first impression for this court whether amending a complaint to add a defendant commences a new suit under the class action fairness act of cafa,stat.we answer in the affirmative and,for that reason,we reverse the district court order of remand,and we remand to that court for further proceedings.
on august,pamela braud and certain other plaintiffs the braud plaintiffs filed a class action petition for damages in state court.on april,the braud plaintiffs amended their petition to name as an additional defendant ineos americas,llc ineos,which plaintiffs contend was the owner and of the chemical that allegedly spilled.ineos was served with the original and supplemental class action petition on april.
on may,ineos timely removed the action to federal court,basing removal jurisdiction on cafa.the braud plaintiffs are citizens of louisiana,and ineos is a foreign corporation authorized to do business in louisiana.
on june,the braud plaintiffs moved to remand to state court,and on july,they filed a purported unopposed motion to dismiss ineos.by order entered on december,the district court remanded,finding that cafa does not apply because the braud plaintiffs had filed their initial complaint before cafa effective date,despite the fact that ineos was not named as a defendant until after the effective date,which is february.transport service company of illinois transport,pursuant to c,filed on december,a timely application for leave to appeal which we granted on january,
section of cafa provides that t he amendments made by this act shall apply to any civil action commenced on or after the date of enactment of this act.stat.at.to determine whether a lawsuit was commenced on or after february,the district court relied on federal rule of civil procedure,which,as plaintiffs correctly point out,reads that a civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.despite the logical of this argument,the courts of appeals that have examined the issue have unanimously held that when a lawsuit is initially commenced for purposes of cafa is determined by state law we agree.
as the court in bush explained,cafa broadens diversity jurisdiction for certain qualifying class actions and authorizes their removal,and thus,given its context,cafa commenced language surely refers to when the action was originally commenced in state court.bush,at.furthermore,when an action is commenced in state court is determined based on the state own rules of procedure in most states commencement occurs either when the suit is filed or when the complaint or summons is served,but in connecticut the action commences by service in louisiana,a suit is commenced by filing of a pleading presenting the demand to a court of competent jurisdiction.therefore,the braud plaintiffs original action commenced on august.
a distinct issue,however,is whether an amendment of the complaint through the addition of a new defendant commences a new suit for purposes of cafa.the defendants urge us to employ the reasoning of knudsen i,at,and schillinger union pac,cir,to hold that the amendment of a complaint by adding a new defendant commences a new suit.plaintiffs respond that cafa was not meant to be retroactive knudsen i is inapposite,and any language that may support appellants position is mere dicta even applying knudsen i reasoning,no new suit would commence here,because the addition of ineos related back to the original complaint and in any event,ineos dismissal after removal and before the ruling on the motion to remand ousted the court of subject matter jurisdiction.
plaintiffs argument regarding retroactivity is without merit.although cafa is meant to apply only to suits commenced after the effective date,and courts apply a presumption against the retroactivity of a statute absent a plain congressional intent to the contrary,landgraf usi film,d,the issue is not whether cafa should apply to suits commenced before february,but whether the addition of a new defendant commences a new suit.that is,if under the applicable decisional law,ineos addition commenced a new suit on april,the removal would not be retroactive,because the suit would be considered commenced on or after february.
plaintiffs argument that knudsen i and the other cases cited by defendants are inapposite and provide mere dicta is also misplaced.even if the statements are dicta,they are persuasive moreover,the court in schillinger explained that the defendants correctly observe that in general,a defendant added after february could remove because suit against it would have been commenced after the effective date.schillinger,at quoting schorsch,cir.the schillinger court noted that this principle was inapplicable to the defendant in that case because his addition to the amended complaint was a scrivener error.id.
we agree with the seventh circuit that amendments that add a defendant commence the civil action as to the added party we reach this conclusion based on two considerations,of which only the latter has been discussed by that court.
first,the district court remark that there no specific language in the cafa legislation itself that would support that position that if a new party was added to a case then cafa would apply misses the mark precisely because cafa does not define commencement of an action,it is obvious that cafa is not intended to replace caselaw deciding when a lawsuit is considered commenced as to a new defendant.
the caselaw holds that generally a party brought into court by an amendment,and who has,for the first time,an opportunity to make defense to the action,has a right to treat the proceeding,as to him,as commenced by the process which brings him into court.united states martinez.citing miller,pet.as the miller court explained,this is because it would be a novel and unjust principle to make the defendants responsible for a proceeding of which they had no notice.miller,at therefore,if a defendant was added,the suit commences as to him.
second,we agree with the knudsen i court that the addition of a new defendant opens a new window of removal under b section b indicates that a case that was previously can become removable when a new party is added.as explained in wright,miller cooper,supra,at,b supplements the removal period described in the first paragraph of the provision,which covers only the period for effecting removal to federal court following the receipt or filing of the initial pleading.
that is,if an original complaint is not amended,removal must be determined based only on the law and facts as to removability at the time of filing or receipt of the initial pleading under b.if the complaint is amended,however,b provides that the new defendant has a new window to remove as of the date of receipt of service of the amended complaint 
i f the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable,a petition for removal may be filed within thirty days after receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.
b.therefore,as to the new defendant,removability is determined as of the date of receipt of service of the amended complaint,not as of the date on which the original suit was filed in state court.
furthermore,under cafa a new defendant may remove regardless of whether it was added more than one year after the original complaint was filed in state court.therefore,the district court incorrectly pointed out that the addition of a new party does not commence a new suit because as the district court improperly reasoned congress give s you a specific time period within which you must remove or forever lose your right to remove without regard to if you happen to add a the plaintiff decides to add a party a year and a half from now,your time period does run again.
instead,a new defendant can remove even if the plaintiff decided to add it more than one year after the initial suit.therefore,there is no indication that the time when the initial suit was filed has any relevance as to when an action commences under cafa for an a
