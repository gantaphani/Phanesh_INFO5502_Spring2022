background 
a.the three benchmark framework for rate reasonableness 
by statute,rail carriers are authorized to engage in a certain amount of differential pricing in order to earn adequate revenues,d,whereby captive shippers who are more dependent on rail service due to the lack of transportation alternatives may be charged a higher markup as compared to competitive shippers who are free to pursue transportation options.see bnsf ry.stb,noting that rail carriers would lose revenue if they imposed a strict pro rata share of the joint and common costs to each shipper regardless of the shipper degree of captivity.however,in order to protect captive shippers from shouldering an unconscionable share of carriers general operations costs,congress has provided that,in situations when a rail carrier has market dominance over the transportation to which a particular rate applies,the rate established by such carrier for such transportation must be reasonable.d.in reviewing rate challenges,the board must therefore consider whether carriers are maximizing revenue from competitive shippers,id.d b,and whether one commodity is paying an unreasonable share of the carrier overall revenues,id.d c.
mindful of the high litigation costs associated with full cost sac presentations in cases involving rate challenges,congress instructed the board to establish a simplified and expedited method for determining the reasonableness of challenged rail rates in those cases in which a full cost presentation is too costly,given the value of the case.id.d see also simplified standards at commenting that recent presentations had incurred nearly million in litigation expenses and that even presentations could run to a cost of million.pursuant to this congressional mandate,the board adopted the three benchmark framework,a relatively straightforward,final offer methodology that measures the reasonableness of a rate by comparing the cost ratio of the challenged rate to the ratios of a comparison group of similar movements.the challenged rate is held presumptively unreasonable if it has a higher ratio than the calculated upper boundary of the comparison group.see simplified standards at explaining that the upper boundary is the percent confidence interval from a hypothesis test constructed around the mean of the comparison group.
the three benchmark framework allows both the rail carrier and the challenging shipper to submit a comparison rate group,with the only requirement being that all movements included must be captive movements.id.at explaining that a captive movement is defined as a movement with a ratio greater than percent,meaning that the revenue produced from shipping the movement was enough to cover percent of the variable costs and still left a surplus in the amount of percent of the variable costs to be applied towards the rail carrier joint and common costs.the movements are drawn from an unmasked sample of a carrier waybill comprehensive database that includes detailed information on all of the movements shipped by a rail carrier,including origin and destination points,type of commodity shipped,tonnage shipped,and revenue.there are multiple rounds of revisions,during which each party is given an opportunity to adjust its proposed comparison rate group.after the parties submit their final offers,the board then selects the comparison rate group that is most similar in the aggregate to the challenged movement.id.at.
in making its selection,the board considers a variety of factors,such as length of movement,commodity type,traffic densities of the likely routes involved,and demand elasticity.id.at.while movements with different cost characteristics may be included in the comparison group,the board will favor a comparison group that consists of movements of like commodities.id.to encourage both parties to offer competitive and reasonable comparison groups,the board selection is an choice between the parties final offers,with no modifications allowed.id.at.
after a comparison rate group is selected,the ratio of each movement in that chosen group is then multiplied by the carrier revenue need adjustment factor,a figure that serves to reflect differential pricing principles.stb decision at.if the challenged rate ratio is greater than the upper boundary of the adjusted comparison group,the rate will be presumed unreasonable.since the revenue need adjustment factor is derived from static figures published annually by the board,the three benchmark framework reasonableness determination generally turns on the board selection of a comparison group.the shipper bringing the rate challenge will naturally have an economic incentive to pick movements with low ratios while the rail carrier defending the reasonableness of the rate will have an equal incentive to pick comparison movements with high ratios.although the board recognizes that the three benchmark framework has some inherent limitations,neither party challenges the validity of the framework itself in this case.
factual history and proceedings before the board 
usm operates the nation only primary magnesium production facility in rowley,utah,and generates chlorine as a of the magnesium production process.due to chlorine status as a toxic inhalation hazard tih,usm relies on up to transport the chlorine as liquefied compressed gas by rail service to two receiving facilities in eloy and sahuarita,arizona.in march,usm began shipping its chlorine under up common carrier tariff rates,having been unable to secure an extension of the previous contract rates.up charged usm per carload for shipments from rowley to eloy,and per carload for shipments from rowley to sahuarita,a marked increase from the previous years contractually negotiated rates.based on variable costs of and,respectively,the resulting ratios were percent for eloy and percent for sahuarita.stb decision at.usm filed a rate challenge with the board in may,opting to use the three benchmark framework established in simplified standards.since up acknowledged its market dominance over the chlorine movements at issue,the board immediately moved to the comparison group selection process.
the eloy and sahuarita movements at issue are chlorine shipments traveling in privately owned tanker cars with capacities of less than gallons for and load miles,respectively,on car service.usm opening evidence proposed two separate comparison groups,one for the eloy movement and one for the sahuarita movement,including movements of all tih commodities but limiting the groups to movements on service within a range of plus or minus miles of the actual rail distances.stb decision at.up submitted a single comparison group for both the eloy and sahuarita movements,including both and rebilled traffic and increasing the mileage band to miles but limiting the movements to those of traffic and those traveling in cars that are smaller than gallons in capacity.id.at.
both usm and up challenged the other proposed groups.among other things,up argued that usm did not select like commodities because its groups were comprised,in large part,of anhydrous ammonia movements and wrongly included movements traveling in cars larger than gallons.usm countered that up group had too few movements,wrongly included rebilled traffic,and was due to the larger range.the board agreed that the comparison rate groups submitted by both parties were flawed.
all else being equal,local chlorine movements would be the preferable comparison group for the issue movements.however,neither party presented that comparison group.rather,both parties chose relatively extreme comparison groups in their initial tenders.and while the deficiencies in each of the comparison groups were evident at opening,and either party could have strengthened its selection by adopting movements from the other group s,both parties stood rigidly behind their initial,deficient comparison group selections.
the board analysis focused on the two most pivotal differences usm inclusion of movements and up inclusion of rebilled traffic.id.at.it acknowledged up argument that anhydrous ammonia had significantly different demand characteristics and lower transportation risks as compared to chlorine,thus distorting the comparability of usm proposed groups.id.at nn.however,it found up inclusion of rebilled traffic similarly problematic,noting that the ratios for the rebilled movements in the up comparison group were much higher than those of the movements.id.at.faced with two imperfect offers,the board attempted to compare the distortions.the board found that anhydrous ammonia had an average ratio percent less than chlorine and that rebilled chlorine had an average ratio percent greater than chlorine.id.at.when these distortions were weighted based on their proportional representation in the parties comparison groups,usm eloy and sahuarita comparison groups had a distortion effect of percent and percent,respectively,while up comparison group had a distortion effect of percent.id.the board conceded that this difference in weighted impacts may not be statistically significant,but concluded that the analysis confirms what usm has advocated,which is that significant bias was introduced when up included rebilled traffic in its comparison group.id.at.
having decided that,chlorine traffic would be the preferable comparison group,id.at,the board noted that the ratios of usm comparison groups were nearly identical to the markups of the,chlorine traffic in up group.id.at,finding adjusted ratio for usm groups to be percent and percent as compared to percent for up chlorine movements while up rebilled movements had an ratio of percent.the board referenced the residual differences between the groups,finding that usm groups were strengthened by a larger sample size and narrower mileage bands,which are more reasonable with respect to the length of haul than up mileage bands because they are closer to the two issue movements actual miles.id.at.
the board then offered this telling explanation 
in sum,based on our quantitative analysis and the residual differences between the groups,we find that usm comparison groups provide the best evidence of a reasonable level of contribution to joint and common costs for the issue movements 
b ased on this record,usm comparison groups provide a better gauge of the proper comparison group.the traffic at issue constitutes,chlorine movements.yet up submitted a comparison group containing traffic and rebilled,interchanged traffic.movements are different from rebilled movements.movements travel over a single carrier,and in this case an average distance of just over miles.rebilled traffic,on the other hand,is carried by multiple carriers with multiple interchanges and handoffs,and the total distance traveled by the commodity typically will be much longer.as such,the costs of transporting the commodity are different.further,the markup over variable cost up will charge for its portion of the total trip will not only be a function of the shipper elasticity of demand for transportation,but also a function of up relative bargaining power compared with other carriers involved in the movement.
when we scrutinize up comparison group,the difference in the average adjusted ratios between and rebilled movements is significant for chlorine traffic in up comparison group compared to for rebilled traffic in up comparison group.up was unable to justify allowing rebilled traffic to skew its comparison group.moreover,as usm stressed at our oral argument,its comparison groups actually provide levels nearly identical to the markups of the,chlorine traffic in up group.the adjusted ratios submitted by usm for the eloy and sahuarita movements were and,compared to for,chlorine movements in up group 
to address differences in both demand elasticities and transportation risks,nothing prevented up from providing a comparison group containing just,chlorine movements,and excluding rebilled movements.we appreciate why it chose not to it would have won the battle the selection of the comparison group and lost the war the result would be the same as in this case.if up had provided a comparison group of,chlorine movements,the issue of how our costing model treats movements of chlorine would be largely irrelevant,because this is a comparison approach,and the issue movements and comparison movements would be treated similarly by our costing model.see simplified standards,at.
id.at,emphases in original.the board ultimately chose usm comparison rate groups,stating that usm submission notwithstanding the relative lack of chlorine traffic provides more reasonable comparison groups than one so sharply skewed by rebilled traffic.id.at.
using usm groups for the remainder of the three benchmark analysis,the board found the maximum reasonable ratio to be percent for the eloy movement and percent for the sahuarita movement.id.at.as both challenged rates had ratios that exceeded these upper boundaries,the board ordered up to establish and maintain new rates within the allowable range and to reimburse usm for amounts previously collected above the prescribed levels.id.at.
commissioner nottingham dissented from the decision,focusing on the lack of chlorine movements in usm comparison groups and questioning the majority reliance on rebilled traffic distortive effect without a clear understanding of the reasons for the apparent difference between the ratios of rebilled chlorine movements,particularly when usm had the burden as the challenging party of showing unreasonableness.id.at.the dissent criticized the majority use of a narrow and quantitative analysis to break the tie.id.at.up timely petitioned for review of the board decision,and usm intervened.
