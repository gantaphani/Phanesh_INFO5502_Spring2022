background 
the technology at issue involves crash sensing devices for deployment in an occupant protection apparatus,such as an airbag,during an impact or crash involving the side of a vehicle.ati is the assignee of the patent,entitled side impact sensors.the invention is directed to a sensor placed in a position within a vehicle in order to sense a side impact.a sensor is a sensor that triggers when a velocity change sensed in a crash exceeds a threshold value.representative claim reads as follows 
a side impact crash sensor for a vehicle having front and rear wheels,said sensor comprising 
a a housing 
b a mass within said housing movable relative to said housing in response to accelerations of said housing 
c means responsive to the motion of said mass upon acceleration of said housing in excess of a predetermined threshold value,for initiating an occupant protection apparatus and 
d means for mounting said housing onto at least one of a side door of the vehicle and a side of the vehicle between the centers of the front and rear wheels,in such a position and a direction as to sense an impact into the side of said vehicle.
the prior art sensors used for sensing side impacts were crush configured to trigger only when crushed or deformed,thereby closing a circuit.patent.such sensors,however,are deficient in that they will not trigger during a crash in which a side door is not hit directly but the impact is severe enough such that the occupant would need the protection of an airbag.id.sensors,on the other hand,can be adjusted to a desired sensitivity to detect a side impact and deploy an airbag,even though the side door is not directly hit.id.at.according to ati,conventional wisdom was that sensors,which had been successfully used for sensing impacts to the front of a vehicle,would activate too slowly to deploy an airbag during a side impact crash.the inventors of the patent discovered that sensors when properly designed could successfully and timely operate to deploy an airbag in a side collision.an example of a velocity type sensor according to the invention is illustrated below 
when installed on a vehicle,the sensor faces the outside of the side door in the direction of the arrow patent.when the sensor is subjected to a crash pulse of sufficient magnitude and duration,the flapper moves toward the second contact.id.at.the first contact engages with the second contact and closes an electrical circuit to initiate deployment of an airbag.id.because side impact sensors require greater insensitivity for short,impulsive velocity changes,the specification discloses that an inertially damped sensor is the most suitable type of sensor for properly sensing side crashes.id.at.the specification states,however,that other sensors that are simpler and easier to manufacture,can be used to effectively sense a side impact.such sensors include sensors and sensors.id.at.
the specification also states that an electronic sensor assembly can be used to sense side impacts.patent.the following figure,figure,depicts such an electronic sensor assembly 
the accompanying text states that figure is a conceptional view of an electronic sensor assembly built according to the teachings of this invention.this sensor contains a sensing mass which moves relative to housing in response to the acceleration of housing which accompanies a side impact crash.id.at.the specification further states that the motion of the sensing mass can be sensed by a variety of technologies using,for example,optics,resistance change,capacitance change or magnetic reluctance change.id.at.the enablement of this electronic side impact sensor is at issue in this appeal.
in may,ati filed a complaint against numerous defendants in the automotive industry,alleging infringement of the patent.in september,the district court conducted a markman hearing,and,in march,the court issued an order construing the relevant claims.auto.tech.int l bmw of,claim construction order.relevant to this appeal,the court construed the phrase,means responsive to the motion of said mass upon acceleration of said housing in excess of a predetermined threshold value,for initiating an occupant protection apparatus.the parties agreed,and the court found,that the limitation was in format and that the stated function is initiating an occupant protection apparatus.the parties disagreed as to the structure corresponding to the claimed function.ati contended that the corresponding structure included not only mechanical switch assemblies,but also electronic switch assemblies,as identified in the specification.the defendants countered that the only clearly linked structure identified in the specification is a mechanical switch assembly.
the district court agreed with ati that the specification contains structure corresponding to the claimed function in the form of mechanical and electronic means.the court noted that the specification includes several descriptions of mechanical switches as preferred embodiments that would perform the intended function of initiating an occupant protection apparatus.the court also observed that figure and its accompanying textual description in column,lines,describe,albeit in vague detail,an alternative structure for initiating the occupant protection apparatus in the form of an electronic switch.the court concluded 
corresponding structure includes mechanical switches with two contacts that engage in response to a force of sufficient magnitude and duration,and their equivalents.the specification identifies such mechanical switches in figures and at column,lines figure at column,lines figure at column,lines and figures and,lines.
corresponding structure also includes an electronic switch or assembly as described in figure at column,lines of the patent specification and its equivalents.the electronic switch or assembly contains a sensing mass that moves relative to the housing in response to the acceleration of the housing caused by a side impact crash.
claim construction order,slip op.at.
the district court also construed the phrase means for mounting said housing onto at least one of a side door of a vehicle and a side of the vehicle between the centers of the front and rear wheels,slip op.at.the parties disputed the construction of the onto at least one of a side door of a vehicle and a side of the vehicle between the centers of the front and rear wheels.id.at.the court construed that phrase to require that the housing be capable of being mounted at both locations,not that the housing must be located at both locations at the same time.id.at.the court also construed the phrase side of the vehicle to mean the side perimeter structure of the vehicle and not the top or bottom of the vehicle.id.at.
after the district court issued its claim construction order,several defendants,including siemens automotive,ford motor,and hyundai motor,filed a motion for partial summary judgment of noninfringement,arguing that their accused sensors did not infringe because they are mounted on the floor of the vehicles,not on the side of the vehicle.the district court granted the motion,concluding that,pursuant to its claim construction,sensors mounted in locations other than the side perimeter structure of the vehicle could not infringe.infringement order,slip op.at.because the accused products include sensors mounted on the floor of the vehicles and not on the side perimeter structure,the court found that there could be no literal infringement.id.the court also found that there could be no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents because allowing floor sensors to be equivalent to side sensors would vitiate the side of the vehicle limitation.id.at.
defendants calsonic and nissan filed a separate motion for summary judgment of noninfringement alleging that their accused sensors are located on the structure between the front and rear doors of a vehicle,but are not capable of being mounted on a side door without modifying the sensor.the district court denied their motion for summary judgment,concluding that there was still a triable issue of material fact as to whether the accused sensors were capable of being mounted into a side door.denial of noninfringement order,slip op.at.
after the district court issued its claim construction order,various defendants including honda motor,daimlerchrysler,ford motor,hyundai motor,mazda motor,and saab cars sales usa,filed a motion for summary judgment that claims are invalid for failing to comply with the written description requirement under.delphi corporation also filed a motion for summary judgment that the claims that cover an electronic side impact sensor are invalid for lack of enablement.the court addressed and granted both motions in its invalidity order.
the district court first granted defendants motion for summary judgment of invalidity for failing to satisfy the written description requirement.the defendants argued that the asserted claims failed to satisfy the written description requirement because the claim limitation means for mounting the housing at a location between the centers of the front and rear wheels is not adequately described in the specification.defendants also asserted that the claims failed to satisfy the written description requirement because they include side impact sensors mounted at locations other than the side door,and the specification clearly states that the side impact sensor must be placed on the side door to be effective.
the district court next granted delphi motion for summary judgment of invalidity for lack of enablement.delphi argued that the claims of the patent that cover an electronic sensor were invalid for failing to teach those skilled in the art how to make and use the full scope of the claimed invention without undue experimentation.the court noted that the corresponding structure for the means responsive claim limitation included both mechanical means and electronic means and therefore the full scope of the claims included both types of sensors.the court determined,however,that the specification failed to enable electronic sensors for sensing side impacts.the court reasoned that the specification failed to provide sufficient details to teach a person of ordinary skill in the art how to make and use an electronic sensor.the court observed that not only did ati representative admit that the specification failed to disclose structure for the general references to sensing technology,but that figure,the only depiction of an electronic sensor in the patent,was not meant to represent any specific design of an electronic sensor.moreover,the court determined that the text describing figure was vague and that the specification fails to disclose reasonable basic enabling structure to show how one skilled in the art would use existing electronic sensing technologies to achieve the desired novel characteristics of an electronic acceleration sensor.invalidity order,d at.
the district court also considered the factors set forth in in re wands,and concluded that they weighed in favor of a finding that undue experimentation would have been necessary to make or use an electronic side impact sensor based upon the disclosure.relying on testimony from delphi expert and ati expert,the court found that the factors of quantity of experimentation necessary,the amount of direction or guidance presented in the specification,and the absence of a working example favored a finding of lack of enablement.
the district court finally considered and rejected ati argument that the claims are enabled because one embodiment or mode of practicing the invention,a mechanical means,is enabled.the court noted that ati vigorously advocated for and obtained a broad claim construction that both mechanical and electrical sensors be included within the scope of the claims.invalidity order,d at.because the specification does not enable both the mechanical and electronic side impact sensors,the court concluded that the full scope of the claims was not enabled and that the claims are invalid for lack of enablement.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,reapplying the standard applicable at the district court.see rodime plc seagate.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in addition,in deciding a motion for summary judgment,t he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.whether the subject matter of a patent claim satisfies the enablement requirement under,is a question of law,reviewed de novo,based on underlying facts,reviewed for clear error.ak steel sollac ugine.because a patent is presumed to be valid,the evidentiary burden to show facts supporting a conclusion of invalidity is one of clear and convincing evidence.id.
on appeal,ati argues that because one embodiment of the invention is enabled,a mechanical side impact sensor,the enablement requirement is satisfied according to ati,there is a dichotomy in our case of our cases hold that the enablement requirement is satisfied when one mode of practicing the invention is enabled,while others hold that every embodiment of the invention must be enabled in order for the enablement requirement to be met.according to ati,the district court chose to follow the wrong line of cases.ati further argues that,in any event,the specification does enable an electronic side impact sensor assembly.according to ati,the specification discusses specific structure for an electronic side impact sensor and depicts such a structure in figure.ati contends that delphi expert never addressed whether making an electronic side impact sensor based on the disclosure would require undue experimentation.ati also contends that electronic sensors,albeit for sensing frontal impacts,were widely known at the time of filing and therefore there was no need for the specification to describe them in detail.
delphi and general motors hereinafter collectively delphi respond that it is well established that the specification must enable the full scope of the claims as construed by the court,and the full scope of the claims includes mechanical side impact sensors and electronic side impact sensors.according to delphi,providing an enabling disclosure of only mechanical side impact sensors is insufficient to satisfy the enablement requirement because the full scope of the claims is not enabled.delphi further responds that the short recitation of an electronic sensor in the specification does not in fact enable an electronic side impact sensor because it does not teach one skilled in the art how to make and use such a sensor without undue experimentation.delphi further responds that the specification expressly states that side impact sensing is a new field and hence ati could not rely on the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art to supply the missing details.moreover,delphi asserts that the district court correctly found that the wands factors,the quantity of experimentation,the lack of direction or guidance presented,and the nature of the prior art,favor a conclusion of invalidity for lack of enablement.
we agree with delphi that the district court correctly gran
