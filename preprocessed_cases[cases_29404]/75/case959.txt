in a recent rulemaking,the surface transportation board changed aspects of its rail methodology.railroads and shippers both petition for arguing that certain changes improperly benefit shippers and shippers arguing that certain changes improperly benefit railroads.we conclude that the board changes are reasonable and reasonably explained.we therefore deny the petitions.
since congress enacted the interstate commerce act in,the federal government has regulated the rates of interstate railroads.until,the interstate commerce commission regulated the rates since then,the surface transportation board has done so.see icc termination act of,stat.
under federal law,a party may file a complaint with the board challenging a railroad rate.see b.after receiving a complaint,the board first must determine whether it has jurisdiction over the challenged rate.the board jurisdiction covers only those railroads that possess market dominance.see d,b c.to have market dominance,a railroad must have revenue that meets or exceeds percent of its variable costs for the traffic to which the rate applies.see d a.variable costs are those costs that increase as traffic over the railroad example,the cost of fuel.
after the board determines that it has jurisdiction over a challenged rate,the board must decide whether the rate is reasonable.see d.if the board finds the rate unreasonable,it sets the maximum rate the railroad may charge.see a.in setting that rate,the board must permit the railroad to cover its costs plus a reasonable and economic profit or return or both on capital employed in the business.a.
part of what makes railroad rate regulation complex is that a railroad incurs many costs that can not be attributed to any one that the board has appropriately termed unattributable costs.see rate proceedings,at guidelines.for example,how does the railroad allocate the cost of a railroad terminal shared by multiple shippers allocation is difficult,moreover,because railroads serve a mix of competitive shippers and captive shippers can secure alternative transportation relatively cheaply but captive shippers can not.see id.therefore,a railroad can not simply charge each shipper a pro rata share of the unattributable costs without the risk of losing competitive shippers to other carriers.see id.
in,the board promulgated guidelines to calculate rates for shipping coal.see coal rate guidelines,nationwide,wl guidelines.the guidelines approach,which has since been extended to rates,established certain principles to resolve rate disputes.those principles sought to approximate ramsey pricing,which sets rates for individual shippers in inverse proportion to those shippers demand elasticities.see guidelines,at.ramsey pricing enables a railroad to collect a higher share of unattributable costs from captive shippers than from competitive shippers.because captive shippers have inelastic demand,the railroads can charge them higher rates with a lower risk of losing their business.
recently,however,the board decided that the guidelines approach had become increasingly complex and costly,and in some respects contrary to congressional intent.to address those problems,it began a rulemaking proceeding in early.the board completed the rulemaking later that year,changing how to determine its jurisdiction and how to evaluate rate reasonableness.both railroads and shippers filed timely petitions for review challenging various aspects of those changes.
we review board decisions under the deferential standards of the administrative procedure act.as relevant here,we will set aside a board decision if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.the board may depart from its own precedent,moreover,so long as it provides a reasoned explanation.ppl,llc stb.in the area,our review is particularly deferential,as the board is the expert body congress has designated to weigh the many factors at issue when assessing whether a rate is just and reasonable.
we first consider the board new method for determining whether it possesses jurisdiction over a challenged rate.
as a general matter,the board has jurisdiction over a rate if the railroad ratio of revenue to variable costs for the traffic to which that rate applies is at least percent.therefore,to determine whether it has jurisdiction,the board must have a method to calculate variable costs.the statute requires that the board use a method called the uniform rail costing system,referred to as urcs,or an adequate substitute.see d b adoption of the uniform costing,wl.the railroad submits various data to the board,and the board,via a computer program,plugs the data into urcs to produce a figure for average variable costs.see generally surface transp,industry data urcs.the amount of revenue from the relevant traffic is then divided by a figure incorporating the average variable costs and a number of operating characteristics of the shipment to arrive at the ratio.if the ratio is less than percent,the board has no jurisdiction.
in the past,the board has permitted parties to propose adjustments to the average variable costs figure produced by urcs.in other words,parties could argue that a higher or lower figure better reflected the variable costs of a particular movement.shippers,of course,propose adjustments that would lower the figure,because that would result in higher ratios and thus make board review more likely.railroads favor adjustments that would raise the figure,thereby lowering ratios and making board review less likely.
in the rulemaking at issue here,the board eliminated the ability of parties to suggest adjustments.both the railroads and the shippers challenge that change as an unreasonable departure from agency precedent.the board acknowledged that permitting adjustments has been its longstanding practice,but nevertheless concluded that these adjustments may not serve a useful public purpose.major issues in rail rate cases,stb ex parte,at.the board gave seven interrelated reasons for the change 
first,the analysis of proposals for adjustments is complex,expensive,and time consuming.second,the board believed that congress intended,in adopting the limitation on board rate review,to create an administratively quick and regulatory safe harbor for the railroads.third,the urcs program already tailors the variable cost calculation to the movement at issue.fourth,disallowing variable cost adjustments would eliminate substantial uncertainty in the current rail rate adjudication process.fifth,railroads do not consistently keep certain types of information that shippers have relied on for favorable adjustments.sixth,adjustments to urcs may not provide more reliable results than using the expenses.finally,piecemeal or incomplete adjustments to urcs are suspect.
id.emphases added.the board ultimately concluded that it must balance the costly burden and complexity created by adjustments against any improvements in the resulting variable cost,and it found that notwithstanding its past allowance of these adjustments,such expense and complexity are not justified.id.at.
the railroads,except bnsf,challenge the board decision on statutory grounds.section of title directs that variable costs for a rail carrier shall be determined only by using such carrier unadjusted costs,calculated using the uniform rail costing system cost finding methodology with adjustments specified by the board.d b.the railroads claim that the last phrase with adjustments specified by the board means that the board may not eliminate all adjustments.we disagree.to begin with,the railroads did not raise this argument before the board,so it is forfeited.see of faculty ass fin.responsibility management assistance.in any event,it is meritless.the statute does nothing more than broadly delegate to the board the authority to make reasonable adjustments to the figures produced by urcs.it does not require the board to adopt any adjustments.the board interpretation is therefore consistent with the statutory text.
the railroads also claim that the board did not give adequate consideration to alternative proposals that would allow the board to take into account certain categories of adjustments.we reject that argument as well.the board explained that it had considered the alternatives and found none of them preferable in light of the seven considerations listed above.the board said that the elimination of adjustments would save up to million per party,per case.moreover,the board cited its years of experience in dealing with those adjustments as the basis for concluding that they are not especially accurate.in short,the board made a policy judgment that the cost savings and increase in predictability of the board jurisdiction,among other factors,outweigh any gains in accuracy from the railroads or shippers adjustment proposals.that kind of judgment call,which balances inherently incommensurable costs and benefits,falls within the expertise of the agency,and we will not disturb it.central southern motor freight tariff ass united states,deference is particularly appropriate delegation of power is very broad and necessarily involves the administrative weighing of the costs and benefits of regulation.
for the same reason,we reject the shippers arguments that the board decision to eliminate adjustments was unjustified.the shippers contend that the board placed too much emphasis on the expense of litigating adjustments and that the board underestimated the increase in accuracy effected by those adjustments.again,the board possesses the responsibility to balance those kinds of competing considerations.the shippers have not demonstrated that the board decision was unreasonable or unsupported by substantial evidence.
the fact that both the railroads and shippers contest the board elimination of adjustments is not enough to persuade us that the board decision was arbitrary and capricious.the board has an institutional interest in reducing the cost for parties litigating rate cases.and the board has discretion to consider the interests of the railroads and shippers that could not afford to participate in the rulemaking proceeding.
we turn now to petitioners challenges to the changes in the board methodology.to provide necessary context for our discussion,we begin with a brief overview of how the board evaluates railroad rates.
as we have said,railroads serve a mix of competitive and captive traffic.because of the varying demand elasticities of the different shippers,a railroad has no interest in apportioning costs evenly among the shippers for facilities or services that the shippers share.if it imposes a pro rata share of unattributable costs on each shipper,competitive shippers with transportation alternatives may opt for those alternatives,and the railroad would lose revenue.despite that problem,the railroads can not go too far in the other direction and overload captive shippers with excessively high rates.even though captive shippers do not have practical access to alternative carriers,they do have access to board review,and the board has a statutory duty to ensure that their rates are reasonable.
the board solution to the railroads problem,adopted in guidelines,has been the principle of constrained market pricing.see coal rate guidelines,nationwide,wl guidelines.constrained market pricing sets three constraints on a railroad rates,including the constraint,which ensures that a captive shipper does not pay for services that provide it no other words,that it does not other shippers.see bnsf ry.stb,guidelines,at.
to determine whether a complaining captive shipper is paying for only those services that benefit it,the board uses an approach called the test.the test posits a hypothetical railroad that serves a subset of the movements in the railroad network,including the route used by the complaining shipper.that hypothetical railroad is called a railroad,known as a sarr,and it is designed to be optimally efficient.the test determines the rate that the shippers using the sarr the traffic group would be charged by taking into account the costs of running the sarr,including a reasonable return on investment,the costs.see ppl,llc stb.the amount of those costs becomes the maximum amount that the railroad may collect from the traffic group.see id.
the underlying logic is that there are cost savings when the portion of the railroad that constitutes the sarr is combined with the rest of the real railroad therefore,the costs of that segment as part of the real railroad could never exceed the costs of that segment if it stood alone.with a ceiling,no shipper or shipper group subsidizes others,at least in a strict sense of the term though some bear a higher share of fixed costs than others,they still pay no more than what they would for a facility designed to serve only them.burlington northern icc.
the board rulemaking changed various aspects of the test.petitioners challenge three of those changes i the method the board uses to determine maximum reasonable rates ii the degree to which productivity gains are taken into account when forecasting the sarr operating expenses and iii the allocation of revenue to the sarr from shippers that use both the sarr and other,facilities.shippers also challenge the board application of its new rule to a case that was pending when the board issued its notice for proposed rulemaking.
we first address the board change to its method of determining a complaining shipper maximum reasonable rate.
under the test,if the hypothetical sarr total revenue from the traffic group exceeds the cost,then the traffic group in real life is covering more of the costs of the real railroad than are attributable to it,and the rates of the shippers in the traffic group are reduced.once the board decides to reduce the rates of the traffic group for purposes of the test,it then must determine how to allocate that reduction among various members of the traffic group to set maximum reasonable rates.in the rulemaking,the board changed the way that it performs that allocation.
in the past,the board reduced the excessive rates in a relatively straightforward way.using the percent reduction method,the board would reduce the rate of each shipper in the traffic group by the same percentage the percentage by which the revenue from the traffic group exceeded the costs.thus,if revenue exceeded the costs by percent,the board lowered the rate of each shipper,including the complaining shipper,by percent.the rationale for that approach was that it maintained the same proportion of rates among members of the traffic group.for example,if one shipper initially paid twice the rate of another shipper,that would continue to be true after the reduction.the underlying assumption was that the existing rate structure reflected the varying demand elasticities among members of the traffic group.under the ramsey pricing principle discussed above,which sets shippers rates in inverse proportion to their demand elasticities,the board thought it important to maintain that rate though the rates are entirely within the control of the railroad.the railroads,of course,favor that assumption in their view,the board should assume that the rates they set adequately reflect differences in demand between the complaining captive shipper and the other shippers.
in recent cases,however,the board realized that railroads can easily manipulate the percent reduction method.in particular,a railroad can game the system by initially setting an exceedingly high rate for a captive shipper.if the shipper then challenges the rate and the board uses the percent reduction method to reduce it,the new rate will still be a function of the initial rate the higher the initial rate,the higher the final rate.
to prevent gaming,the board adopted a new method to correct excessive rates the maximum markup methodology.rather than requiring an cut for every shipper,this new methodology lowers only the rates of those shippers that make excessive revenue contributions relative to the variable costs that they impose on the railroad.and it requires that those shippers ratios of revenue to variable cost be the same.the railroads can not manipulate this methodology because the higher they set the initial rate of a captive shipper,the higher that shipper revenue contribution relative to the variable costs it imposes on the the bigger the percentage cut for that shipper.
the railroads argue that the board failed to sufficiently explain what it meant by gaming.we,however,have no trouble understanding the board concern a railroad could charge any rate,including an inefficient monopoly rate,simply by setting the rate incrementally higher than the rate it wanted prior to the proceeding.
the railroads further argue that the board decision is arbitrary and capricious because there is no evidence of gaming by railroads.they cite our decision in national fuel gas supply ferc,which vacated a prophylactic rule aimed at preventing market manipulation.see.in that case,ferc had specifically relied on a supposed record of abuse to justify a rule,yet ferc had not produced any evidence of abuse.see id.at.the court order instructed ferc to either compile the record of abuse or try to support its rule by setting out its best case for relying solely on a theoretical threat of abuse.id.at.in this case,the board reasonably explained that the undetectable nature of the problem plainly justifies the board reliance on the theoretical threat.to discern whether an initial rate is set because it reflects a railroad perception of relative demand or a railroad effort to game the system would require the board to either divine the motives of the railroad in setting the challenged rate or undertake the costly task of estimating the railroad marginal costs and the complaining shipper demand elasticity.the board reasonably concluded that either endeavor would be utterly impracticable.
in addition to the rationale,the board offered another justification for adopting the maximum markup methodology by statute,railroads must maximize revenue from competitive shippers before increasing captive shippers rates.see d b guidelines,at under constrained market pricing,a carrier must charge its competitive traffic as much of the unattributable costs as the demand will permit.according to the board,this reflects a congressional directive that captive shippers not bear a differentially larger share of the joint and common expenses until the railroad has charged its competitive shippers as much of the unattributable costs as demand will permit.stb ex parte,at.the board determined that the maximum markup methodology better implemented that statutory directive unlike the percent reduction method,it allows captive shippers,which tend to contribute more revenue relative to the variable costs they impose on railroads,to receive a disproportionately higher share of a rate reduction.
the railroads counter that giving a disproportionately higher share of a rate reduction to captive traffic runs directly counter to the ramsey pricing principle that the guidelines approach adopted.those principles instruct that rates should be set in inverse proportion to shippers demand elasticities.the railroads argue that once the rate structure has been established in that way,it should be maintained.the percent reduction method preserved the rate structure because the board would reduce the rates of all shippers in the traffic group by the same percentage when it would conclude that a railroad was receiving excessive revenue.
the board maximum markup methodology is not a departure from ramsey pricing principles as reflected in guidelines unless one assumes that railroads set the initial rate structure in inverse proportion to the shippers demand elasticities.the board conclusion that rate structures are susceptible to gaming rejects that assumption.moreover,the maximum markup methodology preserves differential pricing to a significant degree shippers that pay low rates relative to the variable costs attributable to them will still bear considerably less of the railroad unattributable costs than shippers that pay high rates relative to the variable costs attributable to them.
there is therefore no contradiction between the maximum markup methodology and the board goal under guidelines under both approaches,the objective is for railroads to ensure that competitive traffic contributes as much as possible toward unattributable costs,which includes ensuring that competitive traffic does not leave the railroad for transportation alternatives.at.as the board put it,congress envisioned that captive shippers would be the residual suppliers of capital,but only where the competitive traffic can not provide a sufficient share of the contribution needed to support the rail infrastructure that it uses.stb ex parte,at.the board has simply changed its mind about how best to achieve that goal.it no longer assumes that whenever it finds a railroad to be receiving excessive revenue in a case,every shipper rate is too high and the railroad must lower all of its shippers rates by the same percentage to maximize revenue from competitive traffic.now the board believes that it makes the most sense to lower the rates of only those shippers that are paying a high rate relative to the variable costs attributable to them.the board has license to change how it implements its statutory duties,either with or without a change in circumstances,so long as it supplies a reasoned analysis.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d internal quotation marks omitted.the board has met that requirement here,and we find no reason to overturn its decision.
finally,the railroads argue that the maximum markup methodology violates this court decision in burlington northern railroad icc.but that decision addressed a substitute for the entire analysis,not a different method of reducing rates after performing the test.we found multiple defects in the approach at issue in burlington,including a flaw that deprived the icc approach of any glimmer of supporting principle or intellectual coherence.id.at.by contrast,the board here responded to a flaw in its existing percent reduction method,and adopted the maximum markup methodology to correct the problem.this new methodology,as explained above,furthers the board goals under guidelines and d b.therefore,we are satisfied that the board decision is consistent with burlington.
we next address the board change to its method for forecasting the sarr future operating expenses.
to calculate the costs that the hypothetical sarr would likely incur over the analysis period,the board must estimate the operating expenses that the sarr would face.since,the board has used some form of the rail cost adjustment factor,established by statute,as an index to track changes in railroad costs.before this rulemaking,the board forecasts did not take into account the possibility that the sarr could experience productivity in efficiency that would reduce operating expenses.the board figured that,because the sarr is designed to be an efficient replacement for the railroad,it would not be able to realize the same productivity gains as the rest of the industry,particularly in the early years.stb ex parte,at.in its tests,the board thus had used the rail cost adjustment index,which measures the change in the prices of inputs,such as labor and fuel,used to produce railroad services,but does not factor in anticipated productivity gains.id.at.a separate index,the rail cost adjustment index,takes into account the industry productivity gains.shippers have urged the board to adopt that index because,if there are productivity gains,then operating expenses will be lower.and the lower the forecasted operating expenses of the sarr,the lower the revenue needed to cover the sarr costs,and the lower the maximum permissible rate for shippers.the railroads,by the same logic,have favored the status quo.
in the rulemaking,the board settled on a hybrid approach.based on its special expertise in rail regulation,the board posited that a new hypothetical railroad would not immediately experience the same level of productivity growth as the anticipated industry average a sarr is presumed to begin the analysis period at a higher productivity level than the industry as a whole,and as a result,in the early years,it would not have as much room to increase productivity in certain areas.id.at.for example,railroads realize productivit
