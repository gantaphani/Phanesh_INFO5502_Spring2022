background 
late at night on september,two union pacific freight trains collided near beaumont,causing the derailment of more than cars.hulcher,a company which provides rerailment and derailment cleanup services,was contacted,along with another contractor.at the site of the derailment,a chemical smell was detected,raising concerns about a hazardous material hazmat spill,so law enforcement barricaded the roads leading to the site.for this reason,hulcher heavy equipment was directed to an area one and miles east of the derailment site where they could assemble their equipment while waiting for the hazardous material team to investigate.the area where the equipment was assembled is referred to as the staging area.on this occasion,the staging area was located approximately yards past the freeway offramp,on a small side street next to the freeway offramp which intersected with san timoteo canyon road.
hulcher was directed by union pacific to bring two and two modified sideboom pipelayers.plaintiff was with the.because the equipment is too wide and too heavy to drive on a public street,hulcher had to obtain permits to move the sidebooms and loaders from the hulcher facility to the staging area.the sidebooms had to be transported in sections and reassembled at the staging area due to their size and the damage they might cause to asphalt.
a sideboom has an pole on one side with two cables running through a block and tackle.one cable controls the boom,allowing it to be raised and lowered,and the second cable goes through the block and tackle,controlling the up and down movement of the hook.to lower the boom,the brake must be released simultaneously with the boom to prevent tension from building up on the block and tackle assembly.the sideboom could pick up a derailed train car and rerail it.
at approximately or on september,the hazmat and fire officials gave the okay for the heavy equipment to come down to the derailment site,and union pacific informed hulcher of the release.the operators of the heavy equipment proceeded down san timoteo road when a power pole and power lines spanning the road were spotted.the first lowered its boom and proceeded under the power line and cleared it.the second sideboom then proceeded,with plaintiff guiding and directing it under the power line.when the second boom lowered,the block came loose and fell,striking the plaintiff on the head.
plaintiff suffered a fractured jaw,extensive facial laceration,cerebral bleeding which was resolved prior to discharge from the hospital,multiple fractures of the face near the nose with mouth displacement,swelling of the sinuses at the front of head and base of skull,a punctured lung,and soft tissue swelling of the throat which required a tracheostomy.plaintiff jaw was surgically rebuilt in staged surgeries,with bone grafts from his hip,and he suffered from cognitive deficits after the accident.plaintiff suffered percent impairment from the brain injury and was determined to suffer a permanent partial disability.
plaintiff was out of work,recovering from his injuries,from september to january.he was in pain and confused,and questioned his ability to plan or make decisions as he could not track exactly what was going on when he gave directions.because he had difficulty with sleep,his doctor prescribed ambien,which prevented him from being on call for eight hours hulcher gave plaintiff an ultimatum to either take the medication and go on leave of absence,or to stop taking the medication,so plaintiff went on medical leave in,approximately two years after returning to work.plaintiff remained out of work until,when he got a job working at white steel as a crane operator.however,he was fired eight months later,because a drug test was positive for prescription medication after he blew out a tire on a crane.as a result,plaintiff stopped taking all pain medication and moved to texas to stay with family.at the time of trial,plaintiff was working as a crane operator in texas,earning less than he did when he was employed by hulcher.
a cal osha investigation concluded that the equipment was not maintained in a safe manner to prevent it from loosening and falling.one of the likely causes of the incident was the failure of the operator of the sideboom to slack the line as he lowered the boom,causing tension and pulling the tail of the cable through the block.
on june,plaintiff filed an action for damages against union pacific,under the fela.trial was bifurcated.following the liability portion of the bifurcated jury trial,special verdicts were rendered in favor of plaintiff.specifically,the jury found union pacific had the right to control the work of plaintiff and his fellow hulcher coworkers at the time of plaintiff injury union pacific was negligent under the fela and plaintiff was not negligent.
during the damages portion of the trial,plaintiff expert,who treated plaintiff and prepared a report in,described the severity of plaintiff injury and the continuing problems he experienced during his recovery.plaintiff expert described the brain injury as severe.in his opinion,plaintiff required continuing treatment in the form of a vocational rehabilitation team as well as a neuropsychologist to evaluate his cognitive skills and provide therapy.the cost of such programs was estimated at.however,at his most recent evaluation of plaintiff,he noted that plaintiff denied any cognitive complaints and was not currently receiving medical attention due to financial limitations and plaintiff work schedule.another doctor who treated plaintiff noted in that plaintiff had no cognitive or neurological deficit.
a defense expert evaluated plaintiff in.although he found some residual problems from the facial and other physical injuries,and while he determined it was reasonable to conclude plaintiff had suffered trauma to his head and face,he characterized the injury as mild traumatic brain injury.his diagnosis was based on the fact that someone with moderate to severe brain injury would not be able to maintain gainful employment.he also explained that the plaintiff expert had conducted tests within five weeks of plaintiff trauma when plaintiff was still on narcotic pain medication.
following the damages portion of the trial,the jury determined that plaintiff should recover a lost earnings in the amount of b past medical expenses of c future lost earnings of d future medical expenses of e past noneconomic loss pain and suffering of million and f future noneconomic loss of million,for total damages in the amount of.
on may,union pacific filed motions for a new trial based on excessive damages,as well as a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict challenging the jury finding that plaintiff was a borrowed servant.union pacific also made a motion to amend the judgment to reflect a of against the damage award,for the workers compensation lien which hulcher assigned to union pacific.
the court granted the motion for new trial on damages,subject to the condition that the motion for new trial would be denied if plaintiff consented to a reduction.the court determined that plaintiff expert the injury and its effect on plaintiff.the court determined that the award of noneconomic damages was excessive,and should be reduced to million.the court reduced the award for future noneconomic damages to million.the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied,but ordered that the damages be offset by the amount of the workers compensation lien.the final judgment reflected that plaintiff would recover net damages in the amount of,plus interest,after being reduced by the amount of the lien,which in turn was reduced by for attorney fees pursuant to labor code section.
on july,plaintiff accepted the remittitur.union pacific and plaintiff each appealed.
discussion 
union pacific appeal 
whether plaintiff recovery of worker compensation benefits precluded recovery under fela.
defendant,union pacific,argues that the remedies provided by labor code section,are the exclusive remedies for an injured employee,even if one is determined to be a dual employee.thus,it argues,as a special employee,plaintiff was barred from recovering damages against either employer.we disagree.
labor code section provides that where the conditions of compensation set forth in section concur,the right to recover compensation is the sole and exclusive remedy of the employee against the employer,and the fact that the employee also occupied another or dual capacity at the time of the injury shall not permit the employee to bring an action at law for damages against the employer,subd.a piscitelli friedenberg th.under the statutory scheme,an employee injured in the workplace may request workers compensation benefits for medical treatment and other services reasonably required to cure or relieve the employee from the effects of the injury.charles vacanti,state comp.ins.fund cal th.
in determining whether exclusivity bars a cause of action against an employer,courts determine whether the alleged injury falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions,or whether the injury is collateral to or derivative of an injury compensable by the exclusive remedies of the workers compensation act wca,et.charles vacanti,state comp.ins.fund,supra,cal th at.importantly,the existence of a workers compensation remedy does not by itself establish that the remedy is exclusive.city of moorpark superior court cal th.rather,the scope of workers compensation exclusivity depends on the terms of the exclusive remedy provisions.ibid.
it is undisputed that hulcher was plaintiff general employer,but this fact does not preclude a finding that defendant was plaintiff special employer and does not answer the question of whether defendant may rely on the doctrine of exclusivity.an employee may at the same time be under a general and a special employer,and where,either by the terms of a contract or during the course of its performance,the employee of an independent contractor comes under the control and direction of the other party to the contract,a dual employment relation is held to exist.kowalski shell oil cal d.if general and special employment exist,the injured workman can look to both employers for workers compensation benefits,and,if workers compensation is available,it constitutes the worker sole remedy against the employer.id.at.our resolution of this issue is interdependent with our determination of the borrowed servant issue in the next section.
california injured employees are generally entitled to workers compensation benefits,et,but those benefits are not available to railroad employees who suffer injuries their right of recovery is governed by the fela.lund san joaquin valley railroad cal th.a fela action may be brought in either federal or state court.see also kinsey union pacific railroad th.where a plaintiff is found to be a special employee of a railroad,he may bring an action under fela to recover for his injuries from the railroad company notwithstanding the fact he sought workers compensation benefits from his general employer.see kelley southern pac,d.
in kelley southern pac,supra,the plaintiff was an employee of a trucking company who was injured while transferring automobiles in the railroad company rail yard.the plaintiff had recovered workers compensation benefits from the general employer,and brought an action against the railroad under the fela.while the court did not address the exclusivity of workers compensation benefits in the dual employment context,its remand of the matter to the lower court for further consideration of the legal standard applicable under the fela suggests there was no procedural bar to recovery under fela.
more on point is deshong seaboard coast line,in which a truck driver recovered workers compensation benefits from his direct employer under florida statutory scheme,and brought an action against the railroad under the fela.the railroad sought and obtained summary judgment on the ground the plaintiff was estopped from recovering against it after obtaining workers compensation benefits.that judgment was reversed by the eleventh circuit court of appeals,which relied on kelley southern pacific,supra,finding the plaintiff could establish his employment with the rail carrier even while nominally employed by another for purposes of bringing a fela action,notwithstanding the fact he had received workers compensation benefits through his primary employer.deshong,at,fn.
as indicated earlier,where general and special employment exist,a plaintiff may look to both employers for workers compensation benefits,if available.here,they were available only with respect to the general employer,and not respecting the defendant railroad.plaintiff acceptance of workers compensation benefits did not constitute a binding election of remedies which would bar a subsequent recovery under fela,subject to credit for the prior recovery.see freeman norfolk western ry.this result does not create a special class of employees who are entitled to double recovery,as defendant suggested at oral argument.as the circuit court of appeal observed in freeman,supra,any benefits received under the worker compensation statutes would be credited against an fela award.see also artis norfolk western ry,citing freeman,supra.
the court did not err in determining that plaintiff could seek recovery against the railroad under fela after accepting workers compensation benefits through his general employer.
whether plaintiff was a special or borrowed employee of union pacific.
defendant argues there was insufficient evidence to support the jury finding that defendant had a right to control the details of plaintiff work such that plaintiff could be considered a special employee or a borrowed servant.we disagree.
the question of whether a special employment relationship exists is generally a question of fact reserved for the jury.wedeck unocal th.because the appeal challenges the jury finding of fact,we are bound by the substantial evidence standard of review.consequently,we have no authority to the conclusion reached by the fact finder instead,the determination that a person is an employee or independent contractor must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence.cristler express messenger systems,th.
the fela provides that a covered railroad is liable for negligently causing the injury or death of any person while he is employed by the railroad.in kelley southern pacific,supra,at,the united states supreme court identified three methods by which a plaintiff can establish his employment with a rail carrier for fela purposes,even while he is nominally employed by another.first,the employee could be serving as the borrowed servant of the railroad at the time of his injury.second,he could be deemed to be acting for two masters simultaneously.in order to be deemed a special or borrowed employee,the special employer must play a significant supervisory role over the work of the injured person in the particular operation being performed at the time of the injury.third,he could be a subservant of a company that was in turn a servant of the railroad.ibid.
where an independent contractor carries out operational activities of the railroad,it is deemed an agent of the railroad.sinkler missouri pacific railroad,d.when the nominal employer furnishes a third party with men to do the work and places them under his exclusive control in the performance of it,then those men become pro hac vice the servants of him to whom they are furnished,under the loaned servant doctrine.shenker balt,d,quoting standard oil anderson.
the determination of whether a worker is a borrowed servant is accomplished by ascertaining who has the power to control and direct the servants in the performance of their work,distinguishing between authoritative direction and control,and mere suggestion as to details or the necessary cooperation,where the work furnished is part of a larger undertaking.linstead chesapeake ohio railway.there is thus a distinction between authoritative direction and control by a railroad,and the minimum cooperation necessary to carry out a coordinated undertaking which does not amount to control or supervision.shenker balt,supra,at.the control need not be exercised it is sufficient if the right to direct the details of the work is present.wedeck unocal,supra,th at.
in the present case,the jury heard testimony from both hulcher and union pacific employees describing the working relationship of hulcher employees union pacific derailments.hulcher employees were required to follow union pacific safety rules.union pacific supervised work at the derailment site.a union pacific supervisor or manager could tell a hulcher employee to stop doing something if something was being done unsafely.he could also tell a hulcher manager to remove a hulcher employee.on one occasion,a union pacific supervisor told a hulcher manager to get rid of another hulcher manager who refused to give workers a break with food and water when working in el centro in the heat.union pacific would order the type of equipment it wanted hulcher to bring to a particular derailment.union pacific told hulcher what work it wanted done whether to rerail or remove cars.
union pacific surveyed the area to determine what hazards were present and would mark potentially dangerous power lines.if proper clearance is not possible,union pacific would have the power shut off or have the lines dropped.when working on a specific rerailment,union pacific met with hulcher managers to plan the work.also,union pacific would explain any safety hazards.hulcher seeks union pacific approval before bringing equipment down to the derailment site and follows union pacific directions at the site.
additionally,by contractual agreement,union pacific was responsible for facilitating hulcher ingress and egress respecting a derailment site,indemnifying hulcher against any property damage that might be caused by heavy equipment traversing private property.this required hulcher to obtain approval from union pacific of the intended route to the derailment before crossing through public or private property.although union pacific did not tell hulcher employees how to operate their equipment,it could and would tell a hulcher crew what it wanted done and how to do it.a union pacific supervisor might give signals or directions to hulcher employees directing them in the operation of hulcher equipment.
reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment,there is substantial evidence to support the jury finding that union pacific had the right to control the work of plaintiff and the coworker whose negligence caused the accident at the time of plaintiff injury.
whether the court properly reduced the workers compensation lien to pay for attorney fees 
defendant argues that the lower court erred in deducting attorney fees from the amount of the workers compensation lien.we disagree.
labor code section provides that the claim of an employee pursuant to the wca for compensation does not affect his or her claim or right of action for all damages resulting from the injury or death against any person other than the employer.labor code section,subdivision b,provides that in the event of suit against a third party by an employee,the court shall first order paid from any judgment for damages recovered the reasonable litigation expenses incurred in preparation and prosecution of such action,together with a reasonable attorney fee which shall be based solely upon the services rendered by the employee attorney in effecting recovery both for the benefit of the employee and the employer.
labor code section governs the allocation between the employee and the employer of a judgment obtained against a negligent third party.phelps stostad cal th.where third parties were responsible in tort for the employee injuries,the employer may seek recoupment of benefits paid or owed to the employee,either by suing such third parties directly,or by asserting a lien or credit against any tort recovery by the employee richards owens illinois,cal th.this prevents an employee from retaining both the third party damages and workers compensation benefits for the same injuries and disabilities.engle endlich,supra,th at.this section requires that a workers compensation lien be satisfied out of the judgment and not the verdict.manthey san luis rey downs enterprises,th.

plaintiff appeal 
whether the trial court properly granted union pacific motion for new trial unless plaintiff agreed to a remittitur.
plaintiff argues in his that the trial court erroneously granted defendant motion for new trial on the ground of excessive damages.defendant responds that plaintiff waived his right to challenge the reduced damage award by accepting the remittitur.normally,when the plaintiff has consented to a remittitur he can not thereafter appeal on any inseverable issue.miller national american life ins.d.however,when a plaintiff accepts a remittitur and the defendant appeals,the case is in a different posture and the plaintiff can not be held to have waived his right to appeal.rosenau heimann d,see also neal farmers ins.exchange cal d.we now turn to the merits.
