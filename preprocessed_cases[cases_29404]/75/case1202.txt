defendant community college district the district prepared a master plan approving construction and remodel projects hereafter the project at its cuyamaca college campus in the unincorporated community of rancho san diego that will accommodate a substantial growth in student population and result in significant impacts to traffic.acting pursuant to the california environmental quality act ceqa and the ceqa guidelines the district prepared and certified the adequacy of the final environmental impact report final eir for the project,adopted a statement of overriding considerations with ceqa findings,and approved the master plan,asserting that it is legally and economically infeasible for the district to pay for any road improvements to mitigate the traffic impacts and that the unavoidable adverse environmental effects of the project are acceptable because the project benefits outweigh those effects.
the county of san diego the county filed a petition for writ of mandate to challenge the district decisions to certify the final eir,adopt the ceqa findings and statement of overriding considerations and approve the master plan,claiming that the district is subject to the requirements of ceqa,the district findings are not supported by substantial evidence,and the district must adopt feasible measures to mitigate the significant adverse impacts of the project on traffic.the court denied the petition and entered judgment in favor of the district.
the county appeals,contending the district is subject to the mitigation requirements of ceqa the district findings of infeasibility are not supported by substantial evidence or the law,and thus the district failed to comply with its ceqa obligations the district claim of legal infeasibility is erroneous the district failure to adopt mitigation measures is not excused by its adoption of the statement of overriding considerations because it is not supported by substantial evidence and the district argument that its funding of traffic mitigation measures would be an unconstitutional gift to the county of public funds is unavailing because ceqa does not require a gift of public funds.
we must determine whether the district prejudicially abused its discretion by certifying the final eir,adopting the ceqa findings and statement of overriding considerations,and approving the master plan without adopting feasible measures to mitigate the project adverse significant traffic impacts that are identified in the final eir.to make this determination,we must decide whether the district is authorized by the legislature to spend public funds to improve roads and intersections,some of which are owned and maintained by the county,and therefore whether it is legally feasible within the meaning of ceqa for the district to fund its proportional share of the needed road improvements as a means of mitigating the traffic impacts identified in the final eir.we must also decide whether substantial evidence supports the district claim of economic infeasibility.
we conclude the district is authorized under the provisions of the community college construction act of,et,education code section,and pertinent regulations specifically,tit,subd.f to spend public funds to mitigate the project significant adverse traffic impacts,and thus the district claim of legal infeasibility fails.we also conclude the district claim of economic infeasibility is not supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,we hold that the district prejudicially abused its discretion,and the judgment must be reversed.
factual background 
cuyamaca college master plan 
in april,in an effort to expand and improve its cuyamaca college campus,the district prepared a cuyamaca college master plan the master plan that identified construction and remodel projects that were needed to accommodate anticipated growth in the student population at the campus.the proposed projects include the construction and remodeling of academic and administrative buildings,expansion of parking lots and physical education facilities,and renovations of existing buildings for code compliance and technology upgrades.the proposed improvements will be built through about and will allow the campus to accommodate the anticipated growth from the current enrollment of about students to the projected enrollment of students.
a portion of the funds needed to implement the master plan will come from bond revenues authorized by proposition r,which the district voters approved in november.county counsel analysis of proposition r,contained in the voter information pamphlet,stated that t he proceeds of the bonds of the district would be used to repair leaking roofs,worn wiring and plumbing,and aging restrooms renovate aging and deteriorating classrooms and labs and repair,acquire,construct and equip college buildings,sites,and science and computer labs at grossmont college and cuyamaca college in order to prepare students for jobs and colleges,to train medical workers,nurses and safety officers,and to relieve overcrowding.no proposition r funds were authorized to be spent on offsite traffic improvements.
draft environmental impact report 
as the lead agency for the project under ceqa,the district prepared a draft environmental impact report the draft eir that examined the significant environmental impacts that will result from implementation of the master plan.included in the draft eir was a discussion of the traffic impacts.specifically,the draft eir examined a number of intersections and road segments that would be affected by the master plan and stated that the plan would result in significant impacts to transportation network operations absent mitigation measures the draft eir stated that certain roadway improvements are planned as part of the county circulation element,and labeled those improvements as mitigation measures.the draft eir also stated that several recommended mitigation measures addressing project impacts to intersection operations will be incorporated into the county improvements planned as part of the circulation element.
county objection to the draft eir 
in early april the county objected to the draft eir traffic study and its identification of the county as the entity responsible for implementing mitigation measures for the project.the county detailed its concern that the draft eir failed to provide adequate mitigation measures for potentially significant traffic impacts.the district then prepared the final eir.
final eir,ceqa findings,and statement of overriding considerations 
the district governing board hereafter the district board considered certification of the final eir and adoption of a statement of overriding considerations for the project.following a public meeting,the district board certified the adequacy of the final eir under ceqa,adopted ceqa findings and the statement of overriding considerations,and approved the master plan.
the district itself made no commitment to implement any traffic mitigation measures.the final eir stated,however,that to the extent permitted by law,the district may participate with the county italics added to mitigate the project traffic impacts.
in its ceqa findings,the district made a finding hereafter sometimes referred to as the infeasibility finding that certain economic and legal considerations made infeasible the traffic mitigation measures identified in the final eir.in support of its infeasibility finding,the district stated that the county and state of california,department of transportation caltrans,rather than the district,have jurisdiction over the roadway improvement projects,and the district lacks statutory authorization to even fund a proportional share of any traffic improvements to any roadway segments.
in its statement of overriding considerations,the district asserted that its board,after balancing the specific economic,legal,social,technological,and other benefits of the project against its unavoidable environmental impacts,determines that the unavoidable adverse environmental effects may be considered acceptable due to the following specific considerations,which collectively are sufficient to outweigh the unavoidable,adverse environmental impacts of the project.the district then listed the following eight overriding considerations implementation of the master plan,increased employment opportunities,increased sales tax revenue,establishment of a framework for the expenditure of proposition r funds,revitalization of cuyamaca college campus facilities,implementation of state building code compliance measures on existing facilities,increased economic benefits to the local community,and inability of the district to fund traffic improvements.
procedural background 
county writ petition 
the county challenged the district refusal to mitigate the traffic impacts of the project by filing a petition for a writ of mandate directing the district to set aside its certification of the final eir,adoption of ceqa findings and the statement of overriding considerations,and its approval of the master plan and prepare a new environmental impact report.in support of its petition,the county asserted that the traffic mitigation measures set forth in the final eir were inadequate because substantial evidence did not support the finding that the county should be responsible for the needed road improvements,the final eir did not demonstrate that either the district or the county made a binding commitment to implement the mitigation measures,and the failure to adopt mitigation measures was not excused by the adoption of the statement of overriding considerations.
the county also asserted that the district finding that it was infeasible to make improvements to mitigate the significant impacts on area traffic was erroneous because government code section,subdivision d discussed,post did not apply,the district reliance on san marcos water district san marcos unified school district cal d,san marcos was unavailing because that case did not involve ceqa,the district ceqa mitigation obligation is not a special assessment,and the legislature has authorized the imposition of mitigation responsibilities on the district.the county also maintained that although the state constitution prohibits gifts of public funds,ceqa does not require such a gift.
district opposition 
in its written opposition to the petition,the district argued it was infeasible for the district to mitigate the offsite traffic impacts resulting from its project because no authority allows it to utilize educational monies to enhance the county local transportation infrastructure,and the county can not use ceqa mitigation requirements to overcome precedent that prohibits one public agency from charging another agency to pay for local infrastructure improvements absent express authorization from the legislature.citing san marcos,supra,cal d,government code section,subdivision d,and education code section,the district also claimed that traffic impact fees demanded by the county are special assessments that the legislature has not authorized the county to impose on the district.
following oral argument on the petition,the court took the matter under submission.in april the court issued a minute order denying the county petition.the court found that substantial evidence supported the final eir,the statement of overriding considerations,the master plan,and the district infeasibility finding.based on its independent review,the court also found that the obligation to mitigate environmental impacts of the project does not include payment of traffic impact mitigation expenses or payment of special assessments by the district.such an obligation does not exist without express legislative authorization.the county appeal from the judgment followed.
standard of review 
in mira mar mobile community city of oceanside th,d mira mar mobile community,this court explained that i n a mandate proceeding to review an agency decision for compliance with ceqa,we review the administrative record de novo citation,focusing on the adequacy and completeness of the eir and whether it reflects a good faith effort at full disclosure.citation.our role is to determine whether the challenged eir is sufficient as an information document,not whether its ultimate conclusions are correct.citation.an eir is presumed adequate,subd.a.
we review an agency action under ceqa for a prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.mira mar mobile community,supra,th at,d.
in defining the term substantial evidence,the ceqa guidelines state substantial evidence means enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion,even though other conclusions might also be reached.whether a fair argument can be made is to be determined by examining the whole record before the lead agency.argument,speculation,unsubstantiated opinion,narrative or evidence which is clearly erroneous or inaccurate does not constitute substantial evidence.ceqa guidelines,subd.a.in applying the substantial evidence standard,we resolve all reasonable doubts in favor of the administrative finding and decision.citation.mira mar mobile community,supra,th at,d.
although the district factual determinations are subject to the foregoing deferential rules of review,questions of interpretation or application of the requirements of ceqa are matters of law.citations.while we may not substitute our judgment for that of the decision makers,we must ensure strict compliance with the procedures and mandates of the statute.citation.save our peninsula committee monterey county board of supervisors th,d.
discussion 
the county maintains that the district is subject to the mitigation requirements of ceqa.it also asserts that the district infeasibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence,and the district claim of legal infeasibility is erroneous.
in response,the district does not dispute that it is subject to the provisions and requirements of ceqa.the district contends,however,that substantial evidence and applicable legal authorities support its findings that mitigation of the adverse traffic impacts identified in the final eir is not feasible within the meaning of ceqa because the county has exclusive jurisdiction over the affected roads,the district can not assure the needed road improvements will actually be implemented,construction of many of the required traffic mitigation measures is constrained by limited and would require eminent domain and displacement of residents,and the district can not lawfully pay for the offsite traffic improvements.the district thus posits that mitigation of the adverse traffic impacts is not legally or economically feasible.the district also contends that substantial evidence supports its finding that the benefits of the project outweigh its unavoidable adverse environmental effects,and thus its statement of overriding considerations meets the requirements of ceqa.
we reject the district contentions and conclude the county has met its burden of showing the district infeasibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence or applicable law.
a.the district infeasibility finding 
in its infeasibility finding,which it adopted under section,subdivision a and ceqa guidelines section,subdivision a discussed,post,the district stated that there are no other feasible mitigation measures that would mitigate the near and traffic impacts of the project to below a level of significance and specific economic,legal,social,technological or other considerations make infeasible the mitigation measures identified in the final eir.the district board has determined that this impact is acceptable because of specific overriding considerations and benefits of the project which outweigh the significant effects on the environment as outlined in the attached statement of overriding considerations.italics added.
in support of the infeasibility finding,the district stated in part that the mitigation measures identified in the final eir were infeasible because the county and caltrans,not the district,have jurisdiction over the roadway improvement projects,and the district is without statutory authorization to even fund a proportional share of any offsite traffic improvements to any roadway segments and to do so would constitute an impermissible gift of public funds.the district also stated that specific economic considerations make further mitigation measures infeasible,because insufficient exists to further widen the affected roadway segments intersections and unspecified costs for acquisition would likely be significant.
applicable provisions of ceqa and the ceqa guidelines 
ceqa substantive mandate 
ceqa codifies the important statewide policy of ensur ing that the protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions,subd.d.the foremost principle under ceqa is that the legislature intended the act to be interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d,citing friends of mammoth board of supervisors cal d.
ceqa contains a substantive mandate requiring public agencies to refrain from approving projects with significant environmental effects if there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures that can substantially lessen or avoid those effects.mountain lion foundation fish and game commission cal th,d,mountain lion foundation,italics added see also the legislature finds and declares that it is the policy of the state that public agencies should not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects.the ceqa guidelines define the term feasible as capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time,taking into account economic,environmental,legal,social,and technological factors.ceqa guidelines,italics added.
findings under section and ceqa guidelines section 
ceqa substantive mandate that public agencies refrain from approving projects for which there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures is effectuated in section.citation.mountain lion foundation,supra,cal th at,d.section effectuates the substantive mandate of ceqa by requiring an agency to make certain findings before approving any project with significant effects.remy et,guide to cal.environmental quality act ed,fn.omitted.
section provides in part that no public agency shall approve or carry out a project for which an environmental impact report has been certified which identifies one or more significant effects on the environment that would occur if the project is approved or carried out unless among other things the agency makes one or more of three findings specified in subdivision a of that section with respect to each significant effect.see also ceqa guidelines,subd.a hereafter ceqa guidelines section a.
citing section,subdivision a hereafter section a and ceqa guidelines section a,one leading commentator has explained that f or each significant effect identified in the eir,the approving agency must make one or more of the following findings that changes or alterations have been required in,or incorporated into,the project that avoid or substantially lessen the effect that the agency making the findings lacks jurisdiction to make the change,but that another agency does have such authority,and either has made,or can and should make,the change that specific economic,legal,social,technological,or other considerations,including considerations for the provision of employment opportunities for highly trained workers,make infeasible the mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the final eir.remy et,guide to cal.environmental quality act,supra,at,italics added.
an agency finding of infeasibility under section a and ceqa guidelines section a must be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.in making the findings required by section a,the public agency shall base its findings on substantial evidence in the record ceqa guidelines b the findings required by ceqa guidelines section a shall be supported by substantial evidence in the record.
statement of overriding considerations 
also pertinent to this appeal is subdivision b of section hereafter section b which codifies an override requirement and comes into play where the lead agency has issued an infeasibility finding under section a and ceqa guidelines section a.see remy et,guide to cal.environmental quality act,supra,at.the corresponding implementing regulation is ceqa guidelines section under the provisions of which the district adopted its statement of overriding considerations in this case.subdivision b of that ceqa guideline hereafter ceqa guidelines section b provides in part that when the lead agency approves a project that will result in significant environmental effects that are identified in the final eir but are not avoided or substantially lessened,the agency shall state in a written statement of overriding considerations the specific reasons to support its action based on the final eir other information in the record.
in sierra club contra costa county th,d,the court of appeal explained that a statement of overriding considerations reflects the final stage in the decisionmaking process by the public body.a public agency can approve a project with significant environmental impacts only if it finds such effects can be mitigated or concludes that unavoidable impacts are acceptable because of overriding concerns.citations.if approval of the project will result in significant environmental effects which are not at least substantially mitigated,the agency shall state in writing the specific reasons to support its action based on the final eir other information in the record.citation.these reasons constitute the statement of overriding considerations which is intended to demonstrate the balance struck by the body in weighing the benefits of a proposed project against its unavoidable environmental risks.citations.whereas the mitigation and feasibility findings typically focus on the feasibility of specific proposed alternatives and mitigation measures,the statement of overriding considerations focuses on the larger,more general reasons for approving the project,such as the need to create new jobs,provide housing,generate taxes,and the like.citation.
the statement of overriding considerations,like an infeasibility finding under section a and ceqa guidelines section a discussed,ante,must be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.ceqa guidelines section,subdivision b.
claim of legal infeasibility 
in support of its claim of legal infeasibility,the district first asserts that n owhere in the comprehensive statutory scheme relating to community college districts is there any legislative authorization for the district to fund or build offsite street improvements.asserting that its primary mission is to offer academic and vocational instruction,the district relies on education code section discussed,post for the proposition that statutory limits on its expenditures do not permit use of the funds for offsite transportation infrastructure.
we recognize that an agency authority to impose mitigation measures must be based on legal authority other than ceqa.kotska zischke,practice under the cal.environmental quality act ed,see also ceqa guidelines,subd.b the record shows,however,that the district accepts its responsibility under ceqa to mitigate significant impacts on air quality,aesthetics and visual quality,biological resources,cultural resources,hydrology and water quality,paleontology,and noise.the district does not explain how expenditure of funds to mitigate these environmental impacts is permitted if,as it claims,the district is only authorized to spend funds on educational services.
the district reliance on education code section is misplaced.that section provides in part that t he amount transferred to section b of the state school fund pursuant to section of article xvi of the state constitution shall to the maximum extent feasible be expended or encumbered during the year received solely for the purposes of instructional improvement and accountability.by its own terms,education code section applies only to t he amount transferred to section b of the state school fund pursuant to section of article xvi of the state constitution.however,article,section of our state constitution expressly requires the state controller during each fiscal year to allocate funds i n addition to the amount required to be applied for the support of community college districts pursuant to section.italics added.thus,education code section restricts only a portion of the state funds provided to the district 
the district reliance on education code section as a broad legal limitation on expenditures is further undermined by education code section,one of the statutes set forth in the community college revenue bond act of,et,which provides that the district may use for the payment of the costs of acquisition,construction,or completion of any project,any funds made available to the board by the state of california or any other funds provided by the board from any source,to be expended for the accomplishing of the purposes set forth in this chapter,together with the proceeds of revenue bonds issued and sold by the board,italics added.
the district is statutorily authorized under the community college construction act of to utilize its funds to construct adequate facilities to meet the needs of a growing community college student population.specifically,the legislature expressly declared in section,subdivision b of the education code that it is in the interest of the state and of the people thereof for the state to provide assistance to community college districts for the construction of community college facilities.the community college system is of general concern and interest to all the people of the state,and the education of community college students is a joint obligation and function of both the state and community college districts.in enacting this chapter,the legislature considers that there is a need to provide adequate community college facilities that will be required to accommodate community college students resulting from growth in population and from legislative policies expressed through implementation of the master plan for higher education.italics added.
the foregoing declaration in education code section makes clear the legislature contemplated that as california community college student population grows,the state will be required to provide assistance to community college districts for the construction of adequate community college facilities that are needed to accommodate that growing population.
a growing community college is not an island unto itself,particularly in rancho san diego where cuyamaca college is surrounded by residential and commercial development.in our view,expenditure of the district funds on road and intersection improvements designed to accommodate the increased volume of student and faculty vehicular traffic to and from the cuyamaca college campus that the project will generate,is implicitly authorized by section of the community college construction act of discussed,ante and pertinent regulations.specifically,the ceqa guidelines are expressly adopted as part of the regulations promulgated to implement the community college construction act of california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision f,expressly provides that the chancellor of california community colleges shall withhold authorization for the use of state funds for construction until requirements of ceqa have been met.italics added.
to the extent the district is required under ceqa to help fund road and intersection improvements that are needed to mitigate adverse offsite traffic impacts that are created by the project,but fall within the responsibility of the county the ceqa compliance mandate set forth in california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision f discussed,ante and education code section authorize the district to make those expenditures.education code section provides that t he board may construct any project and acquire all property necessary therefor on such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable,and w hen any part of the work is to be done or performed by any public body jointly or in conjunction with the board,the portion of the cost thereof to be borne by the board may be turned over to any other public body to be expended by it in the completion of the project.italics added.
the district relies on education code section for the proposition that o nly direct frontage traffic improvements by a community college are permitted by statute.that section provides in part that t he governing board of any community college district may grade,pave,construct sewers,or otherwise improve streets in front of real property owned or controlled by it.italics added.the district reliance on that section is misplaced.
the fundamental rule of statutory construction is that a court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.citation.to determine the intent of legislation,we first consult the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.citations.citation.where the statutory wording is clear a court should not add to or alter it to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.citation.citation.johnston sonoma county agricultural preservation open space dist.th,d.we must also construe statutes to reach a reasonable legislatively intended result citation,and to harmonize competing statutes to effectuate the legislative policy.ibid.
here,the term may in education code section is permissive and authorizes a community college district to grade,pave,construct sewers,or otherwise improve streets however,that section makes no mention of ceqa and contains no prohibitory language indicating a legislative intent to abrogate a community college district obligation under ceqa substantive mandate discussed,ante to refrain from approving projects with significant environmental effects if there are feasible mitigation measures that can substantially lessen or avoid those effects.see mountain lion foundation,supra,cal th at,d.under this interpretation,the permissive language in education code section may be harmonized with applicable provisions of ceqa,the ceqa guidelines,and thus the ceqa compliance mandate set forth in california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision f also discussed,ante requiring the chancellor of the california community colleges to withhold authorization for use of state construction funds until the requirements of ceqa have been met.
citing san marcos,supra,cal d,the district also contends that the county demand under ceqa that the district pay road improvement fees or spend funds for street improvements is functionally equivalent to a prohibited special assessment,and any such payment by the district would be a gift of public funds in contravention of article xvi,section of the california constitution.we reject these contentions and conclude the district reliance on san marcos is unavailing.
in san marcos,the california supreme court held that a school district was not obligated to pay a sewer capacity fee imposed by a water district because the fee was a special assessment which has not been authorized by the legislature.san marcos,supra,cal d at.the high court explained that a special assessment is a compulsory charge imposed on particular real property for a public improvement of direct benefit to that property.id.at,see also loyola marymount university los angeles unified school dist.th,d.the supreme court also explained in san marcos that t he rationale behind a public entity exemption from special assessments is to prevent one entity from siphoning tax money from another such entity the end result of such a process could be unnecessary administrative costs and no actual gain in tax revenues.citation.san marcos,supra,cal d at,italics added.
san marcos is inapplicable here because it did not involve ceqa.furthermore,the district mitigation obligation under ceqa can not
