in,the federal aviation administration faa issued a finding of no significant impact fonsi record of decision rod approving the modification of the departure route at las vegas mccarran international airport that would direct a third of the eastbound flights departing west from one of the runways to complete a turn to the north of the airport instead of the south.the city of las vegas and other communities to the north of the airport,as well as individual residents of those communities,have filed a petition for review challenging the under the administrative procedure act apa,the national environmental policy act nepa,and the clean air act caa.we deny the petition.
factual background 
this case involves the flight departure paths from one of the runways at the las vegas mccarran international airport.there are two sets of parallel runways at the airport one set oriented from east to west and and one set oriented from north to south and.most of the planes depart to the west and to the south due to prevailing winds,but many of those flights are bound for destinations to the east.prior to,more than of eastbound flights departing to the west from runway flew west for some time and then turned to the right over the territory to the north of the airport.
in,the faa issued a to implement a new plan the four corner post plan that directed approximately of the flights departing westward from runway but heading to the east to turn left over the territory to the south of the airport.the remaining of the flights still turned right and completed the turn in the northerly direction,following a slightly different path from that taken before.according to the petitioners,this new plan was an improvement over the earlier route because it avoided flying above the more densely populated area to the north of the airport,including las vegas,or near the nellis air force base and north las vegas airport.
in,the faa proposed another change to the flight paths about a third of the eastbound flights departing west from runway would turn right along a new northern path,while would continue the left turn under the four plan.the stated purpose of increasing the air traffic to the north was to improve airspace efficiency and reduce departure delays.on november,the faa made available for public review and comment the draft supplemental environmental assessment dsea of the proposed flight paths.
at the end of december,after the publication of the dsea,the faa learned that its proposal violated the design criteria for flight paths in faa order a,which establishes the minimum leg lengths between each waypoint predetermined geographical positions that map out the desired departure path of the flights,including when the flight should begin its turn.the faa air traffic division then modified the proposed flight path by adding another waypoint,setting the maximum flight speed,and imposing some limits on the use of the procedure.because these changes to the route still did not satisfy faa order a,the air traffic division also applied for a waiver of the design criteria pursuant to faa order c.such waivers are forwarded to the faa flight technologies and procedures division for approval.see faa order c i.
on november,the faa made the final supplemental environmental assessment fsea available to the public,and concurrently issued the,which gave agency approval to the proposed route without the need for a more detailed environmental impact statement eis.see notice of availability.at that point,however,the waiver of the design criteria had not been approved yet by the flight technologies and procedures division.the waiver was approved on january,
petitioners filed a petition for review of the agency order on january.we denied petitioners emergency motion for stay pending review of agency order on march,and thereafter the faa began to use the northern departure path.we now deny the petition for review.
ii.standing 
to bring the petition for review,at least one of the petitioners must have standing.see watt energy action educ,d.las vegas asserts that it has standing based on a procedural injury.to establish such standing,las vegas must show that it was accorded a procedural right to protect its interests and that it has concrete interests that are threatened.see douglas county babbitt,cir.it satisfies the first requirement because nepa accords a procedural right to local agencies,which are authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards,c,and las vegas is a local agency so authorized under nevada law.see.churchill county babbitt,cir,as amended by cir.it also satisfies the second requirement because the proposed departure path directs flights over densely populated parts of the city,which threatens the city interests in the environment and in land management.
in addition to the procedural injury,las vegas must also meet the statutory requirements for standing under the administrative procedure act apa,by establishing that there is a final agency action adversely affecting the city,and that,as a result,it suffers injury within the zone of interests of the statutory provision it seeks to this case,nepa.churchill county,at.las vegas also satisfies these requirements,as the is a final agency action that adversely affects las vegas,and the city alleges a concrete injury to its interests in the environment and in safety which falls within the zone of interests of nepa.see id.
iii.jurisdiction and exhaustion 
petitioners challenge the,an order issued by the faa administrator under chapter and.we have jurisdiction under.
under d,however,we may only review objections that were raised in the administrative proceeding,unless there is a reasonable ground for not making the objection in the proceeding.petitioners have raised many issues before us that they did not raise before the agency they argue that they had no opportunity to do so because the fsea was issued on the same day as the,which was the final agency action that terminated the agency proceeding.given this timing,we conclude that,for the information that was available to the petitioners for the first time in the fsea,the petitioners present a reasonable ground for not raising the objections to the new information in the proceeding.these are objections to the issuance of fonsi before the approval of the waiver and objections to the safety,noise,and air quality analyses based on modifications to the path made after the dsea.
petitioners,however,also raise many challenges for the first time before us based on information that was available in the dsea and remained the same in the fsea.for such information,petitioners had full opportunity to voice their objections during the comment period for the dsea.petitioners have thus failed to provide a reasonable ground for not making the objection s in the proceeding,d,and we will not review them in the first instance.
iv.the faa did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in violation of nepa in its analysis of the modifications to the flight path 
nepa requires federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement eis before undertaking major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.under the regulations implementing nepa,an agency prepares an environmental assessment ea in order to determine whether to prepare an eis or to issue a finding of no significant impact fonsi,the latter of which excuses the agency from its obligation to prepare an eis.see morongo band of mission indians faa,cir.
a court upholds the agency decision to issue a fonsi instead of preparing an eis unless the decision is arbitrary and capricious.see greenpeace action franklin,cir.this standard requires the court to ensure that an agency has taken the requisite hard look at the environmental consequences of its proposed action,carefully reviewing the record to ascertain whether the agency decision is founded on the reasoned evaluation of the relevant factors.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
petitioners argue that the faa decision to issue the was arbitrary and capricious because it did not adequately consider the modifications to the flight path.specifi
