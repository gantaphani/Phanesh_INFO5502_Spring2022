joseph resch,a driver for krapf coaches,kci,filed this collective action on behalf of himself and other kci drivers collectively,plaintiffs seeking unpaid overtime under the fair labor standards act of flsa and the pennsylvania minimum wage act of pmwa.because plaintiffs fall within the motor carrier act exemption to these statutes overtime provisions,the district court correctly granted summary judgment to kci and we will therefore affirm.
kci is a motor coach company based in west chester,pennsylvania,and has a transit division that provides bus and shuttle services on set routes.since,kci has operated such routes,four of which cross state lines.from through,the share of total transit division revenue generated by interstate routes fluctuated between and.
kci employs between and drivers in a given month and trains its drivers on multiple interstate and intrastate routes.plaintiffs concede that kci retains the discretion to assign a driver to any route on which he has been trained,including interstate routes,and to discipline a driver who refuses to drive a route as assigned.
because kci is a common carrier by motor vehicle authorized to engage in interstate commerce,it is subject to federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa regulations ja.accordingly,kci possesses a department of transportation dot registration number,requires that each driver possess a commercial driver license cdl,maintains a driver qualification file for each driver that includes documentation,and must submit to dot audits to ensure its compliance with fmcsa regulations.kci also provides each driver with a federal motor carrier safety regulations pocketbook detailing the driver responsibilities under dot regulations,ja,as well as a separate kci handbook making clear that they are expected to meet fmcsa regulations.ja.
plaintiffs were transit division drivers who,at some point during the relevant time period,worked more than forty hours in a week without receiving overtime pay.of the total trips plaintiffs drove,or required them to cross state lines.sixteen plaintiffs never crossed state lines,eight crossed state lines only one time,and five crossed state lines fewer than five times 
resch brought this collective action under the flsa and pmwa to recover unpaid overtime.the district court granted his request to conditionally certify a class of individuals who were employed by defendant as transit route drivers who worked over hours during any workweek within the past three years,ja,and thereafter granted kci summary judgment motion,holding that plaintiffs are ineligible for overtime under the motor carrier act exemption to the flsa and pmwa.b.ann.b.plaintiffs appeal.
this appeal requires consideration of two statutes the flsa and the motor carrier act of the mca the flsa requires employers to pay overtime compensation to employees who work more than forty hours per week,unless one or another of certain exemptions applies.packard pittsburgh transp,cir a.congress enacted the flsa to protect all covered workers from substandard wages and oppressive working hours and to ensure that covered employees would receive a fair day pay for a fair day work.parker nutrisystem,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
congress enacted the mca in response to a wide scope of problems in the motor carrier industry and to adjust a new and growing transportation service to the needs of the public.united states am.trucking ass ns.the mca vest s in the dot power to establish reasonable requirements with respect to qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees and safety of operation and equipment of common and contract carriers by motor vehicle.levinson spector motor.the mca requirements in this area are intended to prevent accidents due to fatigue,without regard to consideration of adequacy of compensation.starrett bruce,cir.
at issue is the mca exemption that removes from the flsa overtime protections any employee with respect to whom the secretary of transportation has the power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of section of title of the mca.b.section a applies to transportation described in,which in turn gives the dot jurisdiction over transportation by motor carrier to the extent that passengers,property,or both,are transported by motor carrier between a place in a state and a place in another state.through the mca exemption,congress has prohibited the overlapping of jurisdiction between the department of labor and the dot regarding maximum hours of service.levinson,at see also southland gasoline bayley,because it enacted the mca before the flsa,congress apparently relied on the mca to work out satisfactory adjustments for employees charged with the safety of operations in the transportation industry mcmaster.armored,cir recognizing that the mca establish es a strict separation between the secretary of transportation jurisdiction and the ambit of the flsa overtime guarantee.
two considerations dictate whether the mca exemption applies the class of the employer and the class of work the employees perform.see a.specifically,the mca exemption applies if the employer is a carrier subject to the dot jurisdiction and the employee is a member of a class of employees that engage s in activities of a character directly affecting the safety of operation of motor vehicles in the transportation on the public highways of passengers or property in interstate or foreign commerce within the meaning of the mca.id.in determining whether the exemption applies,we are mindful of the flsa broad remedial purposes,and that exemptions from the flsa are construed narrowly against the employer,with the employer bearing the burden to prove plainly and unmistakably that its employees are exempt.packard,at 
the parties agree that kci is a motor carrier subject to the dot jurisdiction,thus satisfying the first requirement.we must therefore examine whether plaintiffs many of whom rarely or never crossed state lines satisfy the second requirement by being a member of a class of employees engaging in activities of a character directly affecting the safety of operation of motor vehicles in the transportation of passengers or property in interstate commerce.a.the district court answered yes to this question based primarily on morris mccomb.
in morris,the supreme court addressed whether a group of truck drivers and mechanics employed by a common carrier fell within the mca exemption.only of the truck drivers trips were interstate,and the employer assigned such trips to the truck drivers generally throughout the year and in the normal operation of its business.morris,at.all of the truck drivers shared indiscriminately in the interstate trips,which were mingled with the performance of other like driving services they rendered.id.of the employer truck drivers every driver except two made at least one interstate trip the average truck driver made sixteen interstate trips and the only two truck drivers who did not drive interstate had been employed for only about the year and that was during the months when the trips in interstate commerce were less frequent.id.
the supreme court held that the dot predecessor,the icc,had jurisdiction to regulate all drivers even those who never drove interstate and that none of the drivers were entitled to overtime under the flsa.see id.at.from the point of view of safety in interstate commerce,the supreme court reasoned,the case would be the same if each of the employer driver s drove of his driving time each day in interstate commerce,as there would be the same essential need for the icc establishment of reasonable requirements with respect to qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees.id.at see also starrett,at observing that it is not the amount of time an employee spends in work affecting interstate safety,rather it is what he may do in the time thus spent,whether it be large or small,that determines the effect on safety.
applicable regulations echo the morris court focus on the class of work performed by the employees occupying the same position,a,and the likelihood of the employer distribu
