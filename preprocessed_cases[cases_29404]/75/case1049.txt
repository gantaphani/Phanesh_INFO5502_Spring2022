the petitioners,air transport association of canada,societe air france,deutsche lufthansa lufthansa german airlines,british airways plc,ltu,qantas airways limited,air new zealand and klm royal dutch airlines,challenge an interim final rule issued by the federal aviation administration faa establishing fees for certain flights that transit through united airspace but neither take off from,nor land in,the united states overflights.they argue,inter alia,that the rule does not accord with the authorizing statute.because the faa has failed to explain why the fees it established satisfy the statutory requirements,we vacate the rule and remand to the faa for further proceedings.
the federal aviation reauthorization act of,stat,codified at act,directs the faa to establish a fee schedule and collection process to cover air traffic control and related services provided to overflights the act requires that the fees imposed on overflights be directly related to the faa costs of providing the service rendered to those flights.the faa has twice attempted to establish the fees authorized by the act.
in the faa issued an interim final rule establishing the first fee schedule for overflights rule.see fees for air traffic services for certain flights through airspace.the rule explained that the services provided to overflights required two types of expenditures incremental,costs that increased with the quantity of services provided and fixed and common,costs that remained unchanged regardless of the quantity of services example the cost of radar installations and computer costs that could not be attributed to any particular flight or class of flights.see asiana airlines faa,describing rule.the faa decided to recoup from overflights both types of expenditures.to compute the appropriate amount of fixed and common costs that should be allocated to overflights,the faa relied on a methodology called ramsey pricing,which distributed the costs among classes of users based on the elasticity of their demand for services in an effort to minimize the effect of the regulation on the behavior of users.id.at.
airlines affected by the fee schedule challenged the rule,contending that the faa exceeded its statutory authority by computing fees,at least in part,on the value of the services to the recipient rather than on costs.we were persuaded by the argument.see id.at.we explained that s tatutory language requiring that each fee be directly related to costs of providing the service rendered,expresses a clear congressional intent that fees must be established in such a way that each flight pays according to the burden associated with servicing that flight,id.at,and insofar as the faa allocated fixed and common costs using the ramsey pricing methodology,its fee structure impermissibly included a component based on value to the user.id.at.accordingly,we vacated the rule and remanded to the faa for further proceedings.
in june the faa published another interim final rule establishing a new schedule of overflight fees rule.see fees for faa services for certain flights.june.effective august,an overflight travelling in enroute airspace must pay per nautical miles or portion thereof,while an overflight using only oceanic airspace must pay per nautical miles or portion thereof the rule itself does not explain how the faa arrived at the enroute and oceanic rates but refers to two record documents that detail how the fees in this rule were determined and calculated.id.the first document is a report by the arthur anderson accounting firm entitled cost methodology used to develop cost of enroute and oceanic atc services arthur anderson report.it describes how the faa cost accounting system tracks the costs incurred by the faa and how the faa assigned those costs to enroute and oceanic air traffic control services.the second document is a report entitled overflight fee development report overflight report.it was prepared by the faa itself and details the faa methodology used to calculate the fees imposed by the rule.
the overflight report explains that the fee development process involved four steps determining the faa full costs of providing both enroute and oceanic air traffic control services to all is,overflights and determining which of the costs identified in step one met the requirement of being directly related to the services rendered by the faa determining,based on the costs computed in step two,unit costs for providing enroute and oceanic air traffic control services to overflights and establishing overflight fees that cover air traffic control service costs as well as billing and collection costs.to compute the unit costs step three,the faa divided the directly related costs identified in step two by the total number of miles flown by all aircraft using the enroute airspace and oceanic airspace,respectively.explaining that the unit costs computed in step three were an appropriate measure of the cost of services provided to overflights,the faa stated 
because the level of air traffic control services are sic assumed identical for all aircraft operations within a particular environment,enroute or oceanic,it is reasonable to assume that the costs of providing air traffic control services to overflights are proportional to total atc costs within each environment.consequently,the unit costs of providing air traffic control services to overflights within each environment is sic identical to the unit costs of providing air traffic control services to all air traffic within each environment.
revised joint appendix ja see also ja same.based on this methodology,the faa concluded that unit costs for enroute overflights were per nautical miles or portion thereof and unit costs for oceanic overflights were per nautical miles or portion thereof.the amounts were adjusted to include billing and collection expenses,resulting in the and fees set forth in the rule.
within days of publication of the rule,the petitioners sought review in this court.see a 
the petitioners first argument is that in promulgating the rule the faa was required but failed to comply with the notice and comment requirements of the administrative procedure act apa section of the apa requires an agency to publish a g eneral notice of proposed rule making and to give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making.b,c see asiana,at.the congress may modify the requirements but a s ubsequent statute may not be held to supersede or modify the apa except to the extent that it does so expressly.see asiana,at.in asiana,we held that section b exempted the rule from the apa notice and comment requirements.see id.at to summarize,we hold that,to the extent that specified otherwise,the faa was not required to conform to apa procedures.because the faa complied with,the process by which it implemented fees for overflights withstands the petitioners challenge.the question now before us is whether section b authorizes the adoption of the rule without notice and comment as well.we conclude that it does.
the act authorizes the faa to publish in the federal register an initial fee schedule and associated collection process as an interim final rule,pursuant to which public comment will be sought and a final rule issued.b.the petitioners reason that,because the rule already established the initial fee schedule authorized by the statute,the fee schedule established by the rule was not the initial fee schedule and,accordingly,in promulgating it the faa should have complied with the apa notice and comment provisions.we disagree.
our decision in asiana vacated the fee schedule in its entirety.as we have explained before,t o vacate means to annul to cancel or rescind to declare,to make,or to render,void to defeat to deprive of force to make of no authority or validity to set aside.action on smoking health civil aeronautics,per curiam citations omitted.thus,the asiana holding had the effect of restoring the status quo ante,namely that no fee schedule was in effect.see id.b y vacating or rescinding the recissions sic proposed by,the judgment of this court had the effect of reinstating the rules previously in force.in light of t
