in this case,the state asks whether a conviction is final for purposes of the mandatory driver license suspension statute after a defendant pleads guilty and is sentenced,but before the time for filing a notice of appeal has expired we hold that,when there is no evidence that a defendant ever filed a notice of appeal,a conviction is deemed to be final on the date of sentencing.therefore,we reverse the judgment of the amarillo court of appeals which had reversed and acquitted appellant for the offense of driving with license suspended.jones state.
appellant pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana on july.the trial judge sentenced him to ninety days in jail,probated for days,and a fine of.the trial judge also told appellant that his driver license would be automatically suspended for six months because he was convicted of a drug offense 
approximately three weeks later,on august,an allen city police officer stopped appellant for running a stop sign.when the officer radioed for a check on appellant driver license,the dispatcher told him that appellant license had been suspended on july.the officer arrested appellant for driving with a suspended license.
at appellant bench trial on april,the state introduced a copy of the july,judgment and sentence for possession of marijuana.this document did not contain any notation concerning an appeal.the state also introduced a copy of appellant driver license record showing that his license was automatically suspended on july,through january.that document reflects that appellant had surrendered his driver license to the department of public safety dps on september,and it was returned to him by dps on january.the state also introduced a copy of the order of suspension dps sent to appellant on august,based on this evidence,the trial court found appellant guilty of driving with a suspended license and sentenced him to eleven days in jail and a fine.
appellant appealed,contending that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient because,when he was arrested for driving with a suspended license,he still had time left in which he could have appealed the drug offense.according to appellant,no conviction is final until either the time for filing a notice of appeal has expired or the defendant has appealed and the mandate from that appeal has issued.
the amarillo court of appeals agreed and stated we conclude that because appellant underlying conviction remained subject to appellate review at the time he was charged with driving while his license was suspended,his underlying conviction was not final.we granted review to determine whether a conviction which is not appealed,or for which there is no evidence that it is appealed,becomes final at the time sentence is imposed or only when the time period for any appeal has expired 
as a part of its case,the state had to prove that appellant driver license was actually suspended at the time he was arrested on august.if the state failed in that proof,the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support appellant conviction and he is entitled to an acquittal.section states that the driver license of a person with a final conviction for a drug offense is automatically suspended for days,but the statute does not define the term final conviction.
thus,the two issues in this case are,under section when does a conviction become final if there is no evidence that an appeal was ever filed and what evidence must the state produce to meet its burden of proof to show that a conviction is final 
the state argues that,in the absence of evidence to the contrary,courts should presume the regularity of the trial court judgment and records.thus,because the record is silent as to any notice of appeal or other irregularity,appellant did nothing to rebut that presumption and the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the trial court ruling that appellant driver license was suspended on july.
appellant argues that,as a matter of law,the state failed to prove all elements of its case.appellant contends that the issue presented is whether the judgment was final,not whether the judgment was regular on its face.appellant notes that the state did not introduce any evidence that appellant had waived his right to appeal,thus the judgment of conviction did not become final until the time for any right to appeal had expired.
we have not previously addressed this question of the sufficiency of evidence to prove a final conviction in the context of section of the transportation code the present situation is analogous,however,to the proof of final convictions in the context of punishment enhancements under section of the penal code the general rule,in that context,is that a conviction from which an appeal has been taken is not considered final until it is affirmed by the appellate court and that court mandate becomes final intermediate courts of appeals have stated that a conviction which is on appeal is not a final conviction,for purposes of the automatic suspension of a driver license the automatic suspension of a driver license is stayed during the pendency of an appeal appellant argues that the automatic suspension of a driver license should likewise be stayed during the time period for which a defendant could file an appeal.however,all of the intermediate courts of appeals cases that appellant relies upon involved actual appeals 
here,the state provided ample evidence that appellant had been convicted of a drug offense on july,and nothing in the record suggests that appellant ever appealed that conviction.we have held that a fter the state establishes that a defendant has been previously convicted,this court will presume that a conviction is final when faced with a silent record regarding such.put another way,in the absence of evidence to the contrary,this court presumes the regularity of the trial court judgment and records thus,when the state offers into evidence a certified copy of a judgment and sentence,it has made a prima facie case that the conviction reflected within that judgment and sentence is a final conviction worthy of respect that evidence is legally and factually sufficient to prove that a prior conviction is a final conviction absent any evidence to the contrary if the judgment of conviction has been set aside,vacated or appealed,the defendant must offer some evidence to support that fact once the defendant offers that evidence,the state must prove,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the conviction has been affirmed and the mandate has issued.
appellant contends that this general rule does not apply in the present case because here the judgment shows,on its face,that it was not final on the day appellant was arrested as he still had sufficient time to appeal the drug conviction if he chose to.appellant is correct in stating that,on august,when he was arrested for driving with the suspended driver license,he still had time in which to file an appeal however,there is no evidence in this record that he did,in fact,file an appeal of the drug conviction.although the wish may be father to the thought,the possibility of a future appeal is not the fact of a present appeal.the right to take an appeal does not equal the pendency of an appeal 
thus we hold that,for purposes of section of the transportation code,a conviction which appears to be regular,valid and final on its face,does not lack finality merely because the defendant still has an opportunity to appeal that conviction.the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support a prima facie finding of a final conviction for purposes of section once the state offers a judgment and sentence which appears to be final on its face.only when there is evidence that the defendant actually perfected an appeal is the conviction deemed to be lacking finality.
in the present case,the state offered legally and factually sufficient evidence to prove a prima facie case that appellant drug conviction was final.the appellant offered no evidence that the conviction had been appealed.therefore,the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to prove that appellant driver license was automatically suspended on july.we affirm the judgment of the trial court.
today the majority holds that a conviction becomes final the moment it is entered,before the time period for filing notice of appeal has expired.if the defendant subsequently files notice of appeal,that action will retroactively render his conviction.but if he does not do so,his conviction remains final.in contrast,i would hold that a conviction,at the moment of its being entered,is just conviction.it would not become a final conviction until the time period for appealing has expired.
everyone agrees that,once notice of appeal is filed,a conviction is not final until the appellate court mandate issues.the question is what to do with that time time period after conviction but before the deadline for appealing.the court rule creates a gray area for this time period,rendering a conviction finality unclear.it can be final for part of this period and then become retroactively.i believe a clearer rule would be for the conviction to remain during this time period.
the issue before us can be illustrated with the following table and hypothetical case.
on march,four friends are all convicted for possessing drugs.abe files a notice of appeal on march.then all four decide to drive their cars on march.on march,betty files a notice of appeal.chris never does file a notice of appeal.denise files a motion for new trial on march.all four of them then drive again on april.denise eventually files a notice of appeal on april.
who is guilty of driving with a suspended license on march under the court opinion,abe,betty,and denise are not guilty,but chris is.abe is not guilty because he filed his notice of appeal before he drove.at the time he was driving,his drug conviction was pending on appeal and therefore was not final.betty and denise are not guilty,too.although their drug convictions were final at the time they were driving on march,their convictions were retroactively rendered by their later decisions to appeal.chris is guilty.his conviction was final when he was driving and it remained never took any action to appeal.
who is guilty of driving with a suspended license on april under the court opinion,the result is the same.abe and betty are not guilty because their convictions were on appeal and therefore not final at the time they were driving.denise is not guilty because her conviction was retroactively rendered by her subsequent filing of notice of appeal.chris is guilty because he never took any action to appeal,so his conviction remained final.
under my rule,what would happen with regard to march,nobody is guilty.the time for filing notice of appeal has not yet expired,so nobody has a final conviction and nobody is guilty of driving with a license suspended.with regard to april,only chris is guilty.for chris,the time for filing notice of appeal has expired,and he has done nothing to appeal his case,so his conviction became final.the other three are not guilty.abe and betty have cases on appeal,and denise has taken action to extend the deadline for filing notice of appeal in her case.
no matter which rule we adopt,there will always be some inconsistencies.but the latter rule seems more consistent to me than the former.i see no rational basis for treating betty and chris differently on march.both have convictions and neither has filed notice of appeal,yet betty will be not guilty because she later files notice of appeal,and chris will be guilty because he does not do so.
by treating them differently,the court enables a defendant to change his guilt for an offense after the offense has been committed.though guilty on march,betty actions on march render her retroactively not guilty.this simply does not make sense to me.in the same way that a defendant should know,at the time of his actions,whether or not he is guilty of committing a crime,the state should also know,at the time of the defendant actions,whether or not that defendant is guilty of a crime.there ought not be a way for a defendant guilt to change after the fact.a criminal offense must be finite,not fluid,changing after the date of commission.the defendant can not be guilty one day and then do something later which retroactively affects his guilt on the date in question.by giving defendants this power,the court rule encourages defendants to file frivolous notices of appeal after they are caught driving in order to render their prior convictions.i would not adopt such a rule.
the court rule also results in there being no difference between a conviction and a final conviction.under my rule,all four defendants have a conviction on march,but nobody has a final conviction.under the court rule,all four defendants have a conviction and a final conviction on march.only later are some convictions rendered.but it seems to me that,on the date of conviction,a defendant has just conviction.there ought to be something extra required to convert a conviction into a final conviction.it should not simply be a final conviction immediately.
the practical effects of the majority rule are this.suppose the grand jury meets on march and indicts betty for driving with a suspended license on march.at the time the grand jury meets,the evidence demonstrates that betty is guilty.yet the next day,she files notice of appeal in her drug conviction,rendering that conviction retroactively.as a result,she is no longer guilty of committing any offense on march,and the court acquits her of that offense on april.then,six months later,betty drug conviction is affirmed and mandate issues.her drug conviction is now final once again.she was,essentially,guilty of driving with a license suspended for a day,not guilty of that offense for six or seven months,and now she is guilty of it once again.this is true even though the facts of the driving a car on march after being convicted on march changed.nevertheless,although she is now guilty once again,the state can not her.jeopardy attached from the first proceeding and she was properly acquitted under the majority rule.
suppose the trial court rejects betty defense and she is convicted on april of driving with a suspended license.her appeal in that case,for whatever reason,moves faster than her appeal of the drug conviction.the appellate court issues its opinion in four months,reversing her conviction of driving with a suspended license because her drug conviction was rendered retroactively by the subsequent filing of notice of appeal.then,two months later,the appeal in the drug conviction is affirmed.once again,the drug conviction has become final and valid,but the driving with a suspended license conviction has been reversed on appeal anyway,and the state may not.
given these possibilities,the practical effect of the court rule is that any wise prosecutor will wait to bring his allegations before the grand jury until the time period for filing notice of appeal has expired,so as not to run the risk of losing a perfectly valid conviction.and if this is the practical effect,then why not simply define a final conviction for purposes of the statute as not occurring until the time period for filing notice of appeal has expired 
admittedly,my rule has some problems as well.the facts of this case indicate that dps is routinely suspending drug defendants drivers licenses upon their conviction.but under my rule,all four individuals in the hypothetical above are free to drive after their drug convictions for at least thirty days.if they file a notice of appeal or motion for new trial,their period is extended.my rule would require either the court or the prosecutor to inform dps when a defendant conviction becomes final.rather than relying on the date of conviction,dps would have to wait until it received notice that the conviction was final,and then suspend the driver license.although this would somewhat complicate matters,i can not believe that this would create chaos in today world of computers.presumably,a computer program could be developed with relative ease which would notify dps upon a conviction becoming final.
another potential problem with my rule is,as the majority points out,the fact that any given drug conviction will have a different date o
