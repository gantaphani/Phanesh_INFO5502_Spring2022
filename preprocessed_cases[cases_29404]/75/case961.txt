a provision of the transportation recall enhancement,accountability,and documentation tread act limits the disclosure,pursuant to section b of the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act,of certain early warning reporting data.appellant rubber manufacturers association contends that the limits imposed by the tread act apply not only to disclosures made pursuant to section b,but also to disclosures made in response to requests under the freedom of information act.the secretary of transportation,appellee public citizen,and the district court all disagree with the rubber manufacturers association.we do as well.concluding that the plain language of the tread act means what it says,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of the safety act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment to submit certain information to the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa in order to reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries resulting from traffic accidents.in november,congress enacted the tread act,stat,which amended the safety act and directed the secretary of transportation to promulgate a regulation expanding the scope of the information that manufacturers are required to submit to nhtsa.this additional information,which the statute refers to as early warning reporting ewr data,is information that may assist the agency in identifying safety defects in motor vehicles or motor vehicle equipment.see m b.nhtsa published the regulation called for by the tread act on july.reporting of information and documents about potential defects.july,relevant provisions codified at.for tire manufacturers,the rule requires the reporting of,inter alia,information regarding property damage claims,warranty adjustments,and claims that a defect in the manufacturer tires caused injury or death.
in addition to increasing the flow of industry information to the agency,the tread act contains a provision regarding disclosure of ewr data.section m c,which is entitled disclosure,provides that n one of the information collected pursuant to the final ewr rule shall be disclosed pursuant to section b unless the secretary determines that disclosure will assist in carrying out specified provisions of the safety act.m c emphasis added.section b,referenced in the quoted provision,is a section of the safety act that requires the secretary to disclose information obtained under this chapter related to a defect or noncompliance that the secretary decides will assist in carrying out the same provisions of the safety act specified in m c.section b expressly states that its disclosure requirements are in addition to the requirements of section of title,which is the freedom of information act foia.b.
in april,nhtsa initiated a rulemaking to address the treatment of ewr data under the agency confidential business information cbi rule,pt.confidential business information.that rule sets forth the procedures and standards by which nhtsa considers claims that information submitted to the agency is entitled to confidential treatment under foia.see.
on july,nhtsa issued a final cbi rule,which accepted the position of the rubber manufacturers association rma that certain categories of ewr data,the disclosure of which would cause substantial competitive harm,are protected from public disclosure under foia exemption.see confidential business information,july,final cbi rule exemption provides that foia disclosure requirements do not apply to matters that are trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.b.
the final cbi rule rejected,however,rma suggestion that m c is a withholding statute that renders all ewr data protected from disclosure under foia exemption unless the secretary determines the disclosure of such information will assist in carrying out the specified provisions of the safety act.final cbi rule.at quoting m c.exemption provides that foia disclosure requirements do not apply to matters that are specifically exempted from disclosure by statute,provided that such statute a requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue,or b establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.b.
public citizen and rma each petitioned for reconsideration.the former challenged the agency conclusion that entire categories of ewr data are protected from disclosure under exemption the latter challenged the decision not to treat all ewr data as protected from disclosure pursuant to exemption.on april,nhtsa denied both petitions.see confidential business information.
public citizen then filed suit in district court alleging that nhtsa promulgation of the final cbi rule violated the requirements of the administrative procedure act apa,and challenging the agency decision that foia exemption applies to entire categories of ewr data.see public citizen,mineta,d.rma intervened to defend the exemption decision,and it filed a against the secretary of transportation challenging the decision that m c is not an exemption withholding statute.
on march,the district court held that nhtsa was authorized to make categorical determinations regarding the confidentiality of ewr data.id.at.but it also found that the agency had failed to provide adequate notice and opportunity to comment as required by the apa.id.at.the court remanded the rule to the agency without reaching the parties other claims,including rma that m c is a withholding statute for purposes of foia exemption.id.at.rma then filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,asking the court to address its exemption.
on july,the district court granted rma motion to alter or amend,but ruled against rma on the merits.the court upheld nhtsa decision that m c is not an exemption statute.it did so on the ground that the section neither establishes particular criteria for withholding nor refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.public citizen,mineta,d,quoting b.determining that there was no just reason for delay,the court entered a final judgment on rma pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.rma now appeals the district court holding that m c is not an exemption withholding statute.that is the only issue before this court.
with specific exceptions,the freedom of information act requires executive branch agencies to make their records available to any person upon request.a a.foia was intended to provide for open disclosure of public information,baldrige shapiro,d,and it has long been understood to create a strong presumption in favor of disclosure,united states dep t of state ray,d.although congress enumerated nine exemptions from the disclosure requirement,these limited exemptions do not obscure the basic policy that disclosure,not secrecy,is the dominant objective of the act.national ass of home builders norton,quoting department of the air force rose,d.accordingly,foia exemptions are to be narrowly construed.id.
as noted in part i,foia exemption permits the government to withhold information specifically exempted from disclosure by statute,provided that such statute a requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue,or b establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.b.a statute need only satisfy one of these disjunctive conditions to qualify as an exemption statute.see association of retired workers united states ret.before a court inquires into whether any of the conditions are met,however,it must first determine whether the statute is a withholding statute at all by deciding whether it satisfies the threshold requirement that it specifically exempt matters from disclosure.reporters comm.for freedom of the press united states dep t of justice,emphasis added,rev on other grounds,d.
the question on appeal is whether m c is a withholding statute for purposes of foia exemption.according to the secretary,j udicial deference is neither sought nor owed to the agency interpretation of the tread act disclosure provision as ineligible for treatment under foia exemption,and this court should therefore make its own determination de novo.secretary br.citing,inter alia,reporters,at.rma and public citizen concur.see rma br.public citizen br.in part iii,we explain our determination that m c does not come within the purview of exemption.in part iv,we consider rma arguments to the contrary.
section m c states 
none of the information collected pursuant to the final ewr rule shall be disclosed pursuant to section b unless the secretary determines the disclosure of such information will assist in carrying out sections b and through.
m c.according to rma,this means that no ewr data may be any statute,including the secretary makes the specified determination with respect to b and.those sections set forth rules relating to defect and noncompliance notifications and remedies.rma contends that,because the ewr data submitted pursuant to the tread act is not necessarily indicative of any problem needing investigation,the secretary could make the specified findings about only a small subset of the ewr data in nhtsa possession.rma br.quoting final cbi rule.at.hence,the vast bulk of ewr data would not qualify for disclosure because it is unrelated to a defect or noncompliance investigation.id.
if m c actually said that no ewr data may be disclosed without the specified determination,it might well be an exemption withholding statute.see consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania,d.but m c does not say that.instead,it says that no ewr data may be disclosed pursuant to section b without that determination.m c.thus,in order to decide whether m c is an exemption statute,it is necessary to examine b.
section b states in full 
subject to subsection a of this section,the secretary shall disclose information obtained under this chapter related to a defect or noncompliance that the secretary decides will assist in carrying out sections b and of this title or that is required to be disclosed under section a of this title.a requirement to disclose information under this subsection is in addition to the requirements of section of title foia.
id.b section b thus creates a mandatory disclosure requirement it obligates the secretary to disclose information obtained under the safety act when doing so will assist in carrying out b and,the same sections cited in m c.it is a requirement that applies whether or not any member of the public has requested the information.and,as the section states,it is a requirement to disclose information that is in addition to the requirements of foia.
it is therefore plain that m c does not mean that no ewr data may be disclosed without the specified secretarial determination.rather,it provides that ewr data is not subject to the secretary mandatory obligation to disclose information pursuant to b whether requested or the secretary makes that determination.accordingly,m c can not be a foia exemption statute because it does not specifically exempt certain matters from disclosure.b.at most,it specifically exempts ewr data from disclosure under b,a section that expressly states that its disclosure requirement is in addition to the requirements of foia.
the fact that m c simply limits disclosures that b requires the secretary to make sua sponte distinguishes that section from the statute the supreme court found to be an exemption withholding statute in gte sylvania,d.in that case,the court considered the consumer product safety commission contention that the disclosure prohibitions of b of the consumer product safety act cpsa,b,are limited to disclosures initiated by the commission and do not apply to disclosures requested under foia.id.at.after examining the language of the act,the court rejected that contention because b by its terms applies to the public disclosure of any information obtained by the commission pursuant to its authority under the cpsa,and to any information to be disclosed to the public in connection therewith.id.emphasis in original quoting b.
unlike b of the cpsa,m c does not state that it applies to public disclosure of any information,but instead states that it applies to disclos ure pursuant to section b.it therefore can not be read to limit the agency obligations to disclose ewr data under given the foia savings provision at the end of the latter section.because m c does not meet the threshold criterion for qualification as an exemption,that it specifically exempt ewr data from do not need to consider whether the statute meets the additional conditions of b a or b.
rma offers three reasons why the reading of m c set forth the section only applies to disclosures pursuant to b can not be correct.we address those arguments below.
rma first contends that this reading of m c violates the canon of statutory construction that instructs courts to give effect to all statutory language when it is reasonable to do so.before addressing this contention,we note the supreme court frequent reminder that 
canons of construction are no more than rules of thumb that help courts determine the meaning of legislation,and in interpreting a statute a court should always turn first to one,cardinal canon before all others.we have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.when the words of a statute are unambiguous,then,this first canon is also the last judicial inquiry is complete.
connecticut bank germain,d internal quotation marks omitted citing,inter alia,united states ron pair,d,and rubin united states,d.as we have noted,the words of m c are unambiguous it applies,as it says it does,to disclosures made pursuant to section b.under these circumstances,we have no need to employ,nor any legitimate purpose in employing,canons of construction designed to reconcile confusing language.atkinson dev.bank,quoting united states espy.in any event,we conclude that rma argument fails on its own terms.
rma argues that a change in statutory language must be read,if possible,to have some effect,rma br.emphasis added by rma quoting american red cross,d,and that m c would have no independent effect if all it did were limit disclosures pursuant to b.section b itself requires disclosure of all defect and noncompliance information obtained under this chapter which after the tread act amendment includes ewr the secretary determines will assist in carrying out b and.rma contends that,because m c states that ewr data may not be disclosed pursuant to b unless the secretary makes that same determination,it limits only the same disclosures that b itself limits.hence,if m c only affects disclosures under b,it has no independent effect.
for m c to have an independent effect,rma continues,it must limit disclosures made pursuant to any not simply those made pursuant to b.thus,rma maintains,m c must be read as requiring that disclosure of ewr data is to be made pursuant to b,or not at all.rma reply br.emphasis added see rma br.same.that is,ewr data may be released only pursuant to b.rma br.emphasis added.
the principal problem with rma reading is that the italicized words do not appear in the statute.as the supreme court has cautioned,our preference for avoiding surplusage constructions is not absolute.lamie united states,d.while a court should,if possible,construe a statute so as to give effect to every clause and word,n o canon of construction justifies construing the actual statutory language beyond what the terms can reasonably bear.amoco prod.watson,quoting united states menasche.rma asks us to do just that,by adding words that are not in the statute that the legislature enacted.see united states monsanto,d i nterpretative canon s are not a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature.internal quotation marks omitted.congress knows well how to say that disclosures may be made only under specified provisions or circumstances but it did not do so here.as roberts said with respect to a similar argument in the amoco case,any inference to be drawn from the canon does not dissuade us from the more natural reading of the express l
