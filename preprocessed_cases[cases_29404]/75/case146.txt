this dispute between the association of flight attendants afa and northwest airlines northwest is situated in a peculiar corner of our law more evocative of an eero saarinen interior of creative angularity than the classical constructions of cardozo and holmes.northwest,under the protection of chapter of the bankruptcy code and with the bankruptcy court imprimatur,has rejected the agreement that until recently governed its relationship with the afa and imposed new terms and conditions of employment upon its flight attendants.the afa does not wish to accede to these terms and conditions of employment and threatens a work stoppage unless northwest agrees to terms and conditions that are more favorable to the flight attendants.
the district court for the southern district of new york victor marrero,judge issued a preliminary injunction precluding the afa and its members from engaging in any form of work stoppage.it held that any such work stoppage would cause irreparable harm and,at this juncture,violate the railway labor act.on this basis,the district court concluded that the act did not deprive it of jurisdiction to issue the injunction.
we agree,but for substantially different reasons than those advanced by the district court.we hold that section first of the railway labor act forbids an immediate strike when a bankruptcy court approves a rejection of a agreement that is subject to the railway labor act and permits it to impose new terms,and the propriety of that approval is not on appeal.
background 
in december,northwest,one of the nation largest air carriers,began negotiating changes to the agreement cba governing its relationship with its flight attendants,who were then represented by the afa predecessor,the professional flight attendants association pfaa.since april,these negotiations have been conducted under the auspices of the national mediation board nmb,which is authorized by the railway labor act to mediate disputes between carriers and their employees.
in september,northwest filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code.northwest plan for reorganization required that its employees make significant concessions.most of the unions that represent groups of northwest employees have since negotiated new agreements.
unable to reach an accommodation with its flight attendants,on november,northwest sought bankruptcy court approval of certain interim modifications to the relevant cba under.on november,the bankruptcy court granted northwest the requested relief.nevertheless,the parties continued to negotiate in the hope of reaching a new mutually satisfactory agreement.on march,the pfaa leadership tentatively agreed to a new cba the march agreement the membership,however,rejected the agreement by a margin of.
in addition to seeking interim relief from its cba,northwest sought in september to obtain permanent relief from its cba pursuant to.after the flight attendants rejected the march agreement,northwest reiterated this request,and,this time,the bankruptcy court granted northwest motion to reject its cba.the bankruptcy court explained 
t he court would do the flight attendants and the debtors thousands of other employees no favor if it refused to grant the debtors relief,and the debtors joined the ranks of the many other airlines that have liquidated as a consequence of a chapter filing.
in re nw.airlines.along with this relief,the bankruptcy court permitted northwest to impose the terms of the march agreement upon the flight attendants.neither party appealed this decision.
the bankruptcy court conditioned its decision on northwest agreement to negotiate for an additional two weeks before it would allow the march agreement to take effect.negotiations ensued,this time with the association of flight attendants afa,which the flight attendants had elected as their new representative on july.on july,northwest and the afa reached another tentative agreement again,however,on july,the flight attendants rejected the proposed agreement,this time by the narrower margin of.
northwest then imposed the march agreement.the afa responded by notifying northwest of its intent to disrupt northwest service by using a tactic suitably named chaos create havoc around our system,which entails mass walkouts for limited periods of time and pinpoint walkouts at certain airports or gates.see ass of flight attendants alaska airlines.
northwest moved to enjoin the strike.bankruptcy judge gropper denied the motion on the basis that northwest rejection of the cba and imposition of the march agreement amounted to a unilateral action in changing the status quo that in turn frees the employees to take job action.nw.airlines ass of flight in re nw.airlines,at.on appeal,the district court reversed and granted the preliminary injunction.judge marrero held that northwest had not unilaterally changed the status quo and that the union remained bound by the status quo provisions of the rla,which forbid the exercise of pending the exhaustion of various mechanisms to resolve disputes,including nmb mediation.nw.airlines ass of flight in re nw.airlines,t his court finds that an order authorizing rejection of a collective bargaining agreement pursuant to does not terminate the section of the rla process.

discussion 
i.the statutory framework 
the afa appeals entry of a preliminary injunction.we review the district court judgment for abuse of discretion,although our review of its application of the law is de novo.see green party new york state bd.of elections,cir.we inquire whether northwest has shown,
first,irreparable injury,and,second,either a likelihood of success on the merits,or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits and a balance of hardships decidedly tipped in its favor.
this appeal turns on northwest likelihood of success on the merits,any assessment of which,in turn,requires us to interpret and heed three different statutory schemes section of chapter of the bankruptcy code,the railway labor act of rla,et and the norris laguardia act of nlga,et.
a.the bankruptcy code 
section a of title provides that a carrier subject to the rla may reject a collective bargaining agreement if the bankruptcy court determines among other things that the balance of the equities clearly favors rejection of such agreement and that rejection is necessary to permit the reorganization.a,b a,c.however,to make such a determination,the bankruptcy court must specifically find that the carrier has ma de a proposal to its employees which provides for those necessary modifications in the employee benefits and protections that are necessary to permit the reorganization,the carrier has provided its employees with such relevant information as is necessary to evaluate the proposal,and the authorized representative of the employees has refused to accept such proposal without good cause.id.b,c emphasis added.moreover,also explicitly precludes carriers from terminat ing or alter ing any provisions of a collective bargaining agreement prior to compliance with the provisions of.id.f.
congress passed in response to the supreme court decision in nlrb bildisco bildisco,d.in bildisco,the court held that a debtor did not violate the national labor relations act nlra by unilaterally changing the terms of the cba after filing for bankruptcy,at,and that the bankruptcy court should permit rejection of a cba that burdens the estate if after careful scrutiny,the equities balance in favor of rejecting the labor contract,id.at.section,by precluding a debtor from unilaterally changing the terms of its cba without court approval upon entering bankruptcy,see supra,overturned the supreme court first holding,while leaving the second more or less intact.see daniel keating,the continuing puzzle of collective bargaining agreements in bankruptcy,mary,noting that commentators have question ed whether the new code provision was indeed nothing more than a version of the most central holdings in the very case that it was thought to overrule.
the nlga deprives federal courts of jurisdiction to issue any restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute,except in a strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter.while this provision generally admits of only limited exception,the supreme court has held that the nlga does not preclude courts from enforcing the mandates of the rla.see burlington of maint.of way employees,d.even so,however,a party seeking an injunction under the nlga must have clean hands 
no restraining order or injunctive relief shall be granted to any complainant who has failed to comply with any obligation imposed by law which is involved in the labor dispute in question,or who has failed to make every reasonable effort to settle such dispute either by negotiation or with the aid of any available governmental machinery of mediation or voluntary arbitration.
c.the railway labor act 
the rla abhors a contractual vacuum.see air line pilots ass n,int l ual,cir.accordingly,a agreement between a carrier subject to the rla and its employees or their union we use the two terms interchangeably hardly ever expires.see manning am.airlines,cir the effect of of the rla is to prolong agreements subject to its provisions regardless of what they say as to termination.rather,once a cba becomes amendable,the carrier and the union are bound by statute to embark upon an almost interminable process.detroit toledo shore line united transp.union,d.during the pendency of this process,the rla obligate s the parties to maintain the status quo.consol.rail ry.labor executives ass n,d.
the term status quo,found throughout the case law,appears nowhere in the rla.several of the rla provisions require that parties to a cba governed by the rla maintain objective working conditions during the pendency of any dispute arising under or during the of their cba.see seventh,first,see also aircraft mechs.fraternal ass atl.coast airlines atlantic coast ii,cir explaining the statutory basis for the requirement that both parties maintain the status quo.the supreme court has described the function of these status quo provisions as follows the rla status quo requirement is central to its design.its immediate effect is to prevent the union from striking and management from doing anything that would justify a strike.in the long run,delaying the time when the parties can resort to provides time for tempers to cool,helps create an atmosphere in which rational bargaining can occur,and permits the forces of public opinion to be mobilized in favor of a settlement without a strike or a lockout.shore line,at.only after the parties have fully exhausted the dispute resolution and processes does a cba expire,freeing the parties from their contractual obligations and the rla rules governing the preservation of the status quo.pan am.world airways int l of teamsters,chauffeurs helpers of america,cir.
while the status quo provisions are integral to the rla,the heart of that statute is section first,of trainmen jacksonville terminal,d,which requires carriers and employees to exert every reasonable effort to make agreements,to maintain agreements and to settle all disputes,whether arising out of the application of such agreements or otherwise,in order to avoid any interruption to commerce,first.the broad command of section first fills the interstices of the explicit status quo provisions a carrier or its employees may invoke it either to ensure effective compliance with the explicit status quo provisions,see chicago nw.ry.united transp.union,d the strictest compliance with the formal procedures of the act the rla is meaningless if one party goes through the motions with a desire not to reach an agreement,or to further justify an injunction premised primarily on those provisions,see shore line,at.holding that the explicit status quo provisions,together with first,form an integrated,harmonious scheme for preserving the status quo from the beginning of the major dispute through the final period.we thus conceive of this implicit status quo requirement of section first,see id.at,as supplementary to the rla explicit status quo provisions.
critical to this case,however,section first also imposes a separate duty,which is less closely related to the rla status quo provisions carriers and unions must exert every reasonable effort to make agreements and to settle all disputes,first,even when the rules governing the rla status quo are not in effect.as the supreme court has explained,t he statute does not undertake to compel agreement between the employer and employees,but it does command those preliminary steps without which no agreement can be reached.it at least requires the employer to meet and confer with the authorized representative of its employees,to listen to their complaints,to make reasonable effort sic to compose short,to enter into a negotiation for the settlement of labor disputes virginian ry.fed.compare int l ass of machinists aerospace workers transportes aereos mercantiles pan americandos,cir,with regional airline pilots ass wings west airlines,cir,and int l ass of machinists aerospace workers trans world airlines.
we conclude that,in light of northwest rejection of its cba under,the act does not bar the district court preliminary injunction because the union proposed strike would violate this separate duty under section first to exert every reasonable effort to make agreements and to settle all disputes.first.the union concedes that it has an ongoing duty to negotiate under section first,but,nevertheless,argues that it is free to strike because northwest unilaterally alter ed the contractual status quo.appellant br.at.as we explain below,this argument fails because section first operates independently of the rla status quo provisions and the implicit status quo requirement of section first.moreover,the afa fails to recognize the unique effect on the status quo of a debtor rejection of a cba pursuant to.because this unique effect informs the bulk of our analysis,it is to this latter issue that we now turn.
ii.the effect of contract rejection under 
to understand the legal consequences of northwest rejection,we turn first to the plain text of,see leocal ashcroft,d.bank germain,d,and then to that of the rla,reading these two statutory schemes seriatim,from the most recent to the oldest,see,shugrue air line pilots ass n,int l in re ionosphere clubs,cir w e must give effect to the most recently enacted statute since it is the most recent indication of congressional intent,and from the more specific to the more general,see,morton mancari,d.we also assume that congress passed each subsequent law with full knowledge of the existing legal landscape,miles apex marine,d we assume that congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation,and without intending the absurd,see green bock laundry mach,d 
with these principles in mind,we reach three conclusions northwest rejection of its cba after obtaining court authorization to do so under abrogated without breaching the existing agreement between the afa and northwest,which thereafter ceased to exist northwest abrogation of the cba necessarily terminated the status quo created by that agreement,after which termination both the rla explicit status quo provisions and the implicit status quo requirement of section first ceased to apply but the afa proposed strike would,at present,violate the union independent duty under the rla to exert every reasonable effort to make an agreement,first,and thus may be enjoined.we proceed to discuss these conclusions in some detail.
rejection of the cba pursuant to the bankruptcy court order abrogates that agreement.
in theory,northwest rejection of its cba under could lead to one of three possible legal consequences northwest abrogated the cba in its entirety and replaced it with the march agreement northwest replaced certain terms of the cba with the more favorable terms of the march agreement,but the cba otherwise continued in force and northwest did not breach it or northwest replaced certain terms of the cba with the more favorable terms of the march agreement,but the cba otherwise continued in force and northwest did breach it the first interpretation of the effect of northwest rejection of the cba is far and away the most plausible.
the latter two interpretations suffer from one common defect they ignore the unique purpose of.section of title,like,authorizes contract rejection in bankruptcy and,to be sure,under,if a debtor rejects an executory contract,it does not completely terminate the contract.med.malpractice ins.ass hirsch in re lavigne,cir.but northwest did not reject the cba at issue pursuant to.it acted with the authority of a court order entered pursuant to.contract rejection under,unlike contract rejection under,permits more than it allows one party,with the court approval,to establish new terms that were not mutually agreed upon,the antithesis of a status quo a carrier obligation to comply with those new terms can not be reconciled with the continued existence of its prior contract.compare in re lavigne,at holding under that because the rejection does not terminate all contractual and statutory obligations,the parties are not absolved from compliance with the contract,with comair,air line pilots ass n,int l in re delta air lines,section is and it necessarily terminates the debtor obligation to comply with the prior agreement.if a rejected cba were somehow to remain in force to whatever extent,a carrier adherence to a new,contract would surely violate section seventh of the rla,which prohibits carriers from chang ing the rates of pay,rules,or working conditions of its employees,as a class as embodied in agreements except in the manner prescribed in such agreements or in section of this title.seventh emphasis added see also shore line,at.requiring a carrier to maintain actual,objective working conditions.
likewise,these two interpretations cba still in breach cba still in are also difficult to square with the structure of.see gade solid wastes mgmt.ass n,d w e must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look to the provisions of the whole law.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.f of provides that a carrier may not unilaterally terminate or alter any provisions of a collective bargaining agreement prior to compliance with the provisions of.f emphasis added.if f forbids unilateral alteration of a cba unless and until a carrier properly invokes a,were we required to definitely interpret a,we might well agree with appellants that it permits a carrier unilaterally to alter its employees terms and conditions of employment.but such a unilateral change would no doubt breach the rla status quo provisions both explicit and implicit,see consol.rail,at.post at.and this would lead to an odd result indeed an airline exercise of its options under,a statute that was passed after the rla and specifically contemplated use by air carriers,see a extending coverage to air carriers but not railroads,would constitute a violation of the rla.
the second possible interpretation of the effect of contract rejection under cba still in breach is also at odds with bankruptcy precedent of which congress was presumably aware when it passed,holding that under,a party who rejects an executory contract also breaches it.as the fifth circuit explained in in re continental airlines,it is difficult to reconcile a holding that damages are due when a cba is rejected with an argument that that agreement at the same time does not effectively exist.cont l airlines,in re cont l airlines,cir.the converse is equally true it is difficult to understand how a carrier can partially assume a cba but not have its partial rejection of the cba effect a simultaneous breach of the agreement.
the third possible interpretation of the effect of contract rejection under cba still in is equally flawed.if a carrier that rejected a cba simultaneously breached that agreement and violated the rla,the union would be correspondingly free to seek damages or strike,results inconsistent with congress intent in passing.in re delta air lines,at in re blue diamond coal,aff.moreover,even if a carrier breached that agreement but did not violate the rla,the union would probably still be free to strike.the obligations of carrier and union under the explicit status quo provisions of the rla are equal and mutual.shore line,at.and if a carrier may breach its cba without violating the rla,it is plausible that a union might go on strike without violating the rla.nlrb ins.agents int l union,d strike not incompatible with duty to bargain in good faith.
under the circumstances of this case,we adopt the first of the three possible interpretations we have identified we hold that northwest,acting pursuant the authority conferred to it by the bankruptcy court,abrogated its cba.the purpose of permit cba rejection in favor of alternate terms without fear of liability after a final negotiation before,and authorization from,a bankruptcy leads to such a conclusion.in addition,this holding suffers from none of the defects that we have identified in the two other possible interpretations of nor does it offend our decisions in two ostensibly analogous,but in fact quite different,classes of cases those arising under and those governed by the nlra.
we have intimated that a union would be free to strike following contract rejection under.see,truck drivers local carey transp,cir.however,substantial differences between and justify a different understanding of the consequences of invoking the former.congress passed in response to the supreme court holding that a debtor did not violate the nlra by unilaterally changing the terms and conditions of employment detailed in a cba after entering bankruptcy.see united food commercial workers union,local,almac,cir explaining this history.congress sought to ensure that carriers could not avoid their agreements with their employees immediately upon entering bankruptcy,e authorizing interim changes under limited circumstances rather,it made contract avoidance possible only after a debtor procured court permission.but under,if a debtor rejects an executory contract,courts assume a breach as of the date immediately prior to the debtor filing for bankruptcy.in re lavigne,at.rejection under thus leads to a legal fiction at odds with the text of and impetus behind.consistent with congress purpose,we are obligated to construe the statutory scheme to distinguish the legal consequences of rejection under our suggestion that employees aggrieved by the rejection may the legal consequences of rejection under.in re ionosphere clubs,at applying traditional canons of statutory construction to.
in cases governed by the nlra,we have also hinted that a union is free to strike,even following contract rejection under.see,in re royal composing room,aff cir nlrb burns int l sec,d.but a union right to strike under the nlra depends upon the terms of the cba to which it is a party for instance,the existence or continued viability,or lack thereof,of a contractual clause.see.if successful procurement of a order permits an employer to abrogate a cba,it follows that a union subject to the nlra would become free to strike consistent with in re royal composing room precisely because it would no longer be bound by any contractual clause to which it might at one point have agreed.at the same time,however,a union subject to the rla would still be under an obligation first to exert every reasonable effort to make agreements and to settle all disputes pursuant to section first,notwithstanding the of any contractual clause.see infra.
we thus conclude that a governed by the rla and authorized by the bankruptcy court acting pursuant to to reject its cba and impose new terms abrogates its cba.
rejection under terminates the status quo.
we must next consider how,if at all,the rla applies in the event a carrier abrogates its cba.the rla explicit status quo provisions attach to rates of pay,rules,or working conditions as embodied in agreements,seventh emphasis added.see,carriers and representatives of the employees shall give at least thirty days written notice of an intended change in agreements.the plain text of these provisions compels the conclusion that they do not apply after a carrier has abrogated its cba and the agreement has ceased to exist.see,atlantic coast ii,at refusing to apply the rla status quo provisions to the parties objective working conditions prior to their agreement to an initial cba atlas air,air line pilots ass n,by their express terms,the status quo provisions of the act only prohibit unilateral changes in wages or working conditions where there is a preexisting collective bargaining agreement.in re delta air lines,at the meaning,logic and purpose of both the contract rejection provisions in section and the status quo provisions in the rla compel the conclusion that a collective bargaining agreement which has been rejected can no longer constitute an agreement within the meaning of rla section seventh and section such that the proscription in those provisions against changes in terms of employment would apply.the rla does not contemplate the inauguration of a new status quo absent the mutual agreement of labor and management.pan,at rejecting the notion that a new status quo has been created by changed circumstances and the passage of time 
nor does the implicit status quo requirement of section first apply in the absence of a agreement to which both carrier and union have assented.first,like the explicit status quo provisions,section first refers to agreements between the parties,second,not terms and conditions of employment opposed by one party.second,it would be odd to construe the implicit status quo requirement of section first to reach farther than the explicit status quo provisions,since the supreme court only clarified that section first was judicially enforceable more than forty years after passage of the rla.see chicago ry.united transp.union,cir we construe,first,as a statement of the purpose and policy of the subsequent provisions of the act and not as a specific requirement anticipating judicial enforcement,rev,d w e think the conclusion inescapable that congress intended the enforcement of first to be overseen by appropriate judicial means.
rejection under leaves intact the duty to make agreements under section first.
the explicit duty to exert every reasonable effort to make agreements,however,is distinct from the implicit status quo requirement of section first.first imposing the duty not only to maintain agreements but also to make them.the duty to make agreements governs the parties conduct both after a agreement has lapsed,see pan,and pending the negotiation of an initial agreement,see atlantic coast ii.the difference between the strict requirement that carriers and their employees maintain agreements and the somewhat more flexible duty to make agreements is a natural result of the different treatment the law affords a rrangements made after collective bargaining and those made by a carrier or a union for its own convenience and purpose,jacksonville terminal,at.as the supreme court has explained,arrangements made after collective bargaining are entitled to a higher degree of permanency and continuity.id.
we thus conclude that a bankruptcy court acting pursuant to may authorize a debtor to abrogate its cba,effectively shielding it from a charge of breach.such abrogation,by terminating the parties working conditions,also absolves them of their status quo duties under the rla it does not,however,free the parties from their section first duty to exert every reasonable effort to make a new contract that would effect a new status quo.indeed,the afa conceded as much at oral argument.accordingly,the relevant inquiry is whether the flight attendants proposed strike would violate such a duty at this time.
iii.the duty to make agreements under the rla and the afa proposed strike 
the reasonable effort required by section first has uncertain contours.at times,this court has suggested that injunctive relief under section first may be limited to cases where parties have bargained in bad faith.united air lines,airline,int l of teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen helpers of,cir shore line,at.on the other hand,the supreme court has expressly reserved decision on whether the duty entails more than avoidance of bad faith.chicago,at.
the critical fact is that the section first duties are not fully reciprocal.this conclusion,that carriers and their employees may at times bear different,even unequal burdens,despite being subject to the same standard,is compelled by our decisions in the atlantic coast cases.in aircraft mechanics fraternal ass atlantic coast airlines,atlantic coast i,we held that a carrier did not breach section first by making unilateral changes to the terms and conditions of employment so long as it did not bargain in bad faith.cir.yet in atlantic coast ii,we held that a union did breach section first by making even if in good faith a unilateral change to the terms and conditions of,by the railroad had taken no bad faith action to provoke such a response.see.in line with our precedent,we hold today that in the absence of carrier bad faith,a union must come closer to exhausting the dispute resolution processes of the rla than the afa has in this case in order to satisfy its duty under section first.there is no need at this point to decide when and if the afa will have fulfilled its duty it has not done so yet.
in approving northwest motion to reject its agreement,the bankruptcy court found,as it was required to do,see b a,that northwest rejection of the cba was necessary northwest remains willing to negotiate,including with regard to terms more favorable to the flight attendants than those the afa has already accepted on their behalf and the nmb has yet to conclude that further negotiations would be futile.the afa proposed strike can not therefore be justified as a response to northwest violation of the rla.see united air lines.
simply put,the afa has not exerted every reasonable effort to reach agreement.it has not sought to persuade its members of the need to face up to economic reality.in re nw.airlines,at united air lines,int l ass of machinist aerospace workers,cir holding that union had duty under section first to control employee behavior and prevent wildcatting.nor has it sought the assistance of the nmb,which is at least available on consent of the parties finally,since reasonableness under the rla,like reasonableness under the nlra,see,ass of flight attendants,horizon air,cir,is informed by the reasonableness of the proposals,our conclusion is buttressed by the afa failure to take account,as it must,of the duty northwest owes the public,of ry.and steamship clerks,freight handlers,express and station employees,florida east coast ry,d.
the afa argues that the foregoing reasoning is too in the carrier favor and thus is at odds with the legislative history of the rla,which was drafted by a team composed of representatives of both management and labor.see summit airlines,teamsters local union,cir emphasis added.but the duty section first imposes upon carriers is not toothless.of maint.of way employees union pac,cir t he duty to exert every reasonable effort requires a carrier to do more than discharge its legal obligations.indeed,were a carrier simply to go through the motions of negotiating,see archibald cox,the duty to bargain in good faith,harv,it would violate its duty.moreover,the scope of the duty to bargain in good faith increases as the parties approach agreement for instance,whether the carrier has already agreed to a tentative deal,see transportes aereos,at,and whether it has a history of negotiating with a particular union,see virgin atl.airways,mediation,cir,are relevant variables.cox,supra suggesting that under certain circumstances unilateral changes to the terms and conditions of employment may constitute circumstantial evidence of bad faith.finally,carriers must meet with union representatives,united air lines,at,and,whether or not an agreement exists,must accede to a union request for nmb assistance,or face a strike,of trainmen enter.lodge,toledo,peoria.if northwest simply adheres to the march agreement and refuses to deal with the afa in good faith,the afa may seek an injunction of its own.
iv.the clean hands requirement 
finally,the afa argues that northwest has not made every reasonable effort to settle this dispute,see,and thus lacks the requisite clean hands to secure an injunction under the nlra.however,only if a carrier has failed to take the steps required of it by the railway labor act,do we forbid it injunctive relief against the strike of its employees.rutland ry.of locomotive eng rs,cir.but as we have already explained,northwest has,to this point,fulfilled its duties under section first.moreover,because it abrogated the existing cba under authority of a court order,northwest did not violate either the rla explicit status quo provisions or the implicit status quo requirement of section first.we have no indication in the record that northwest is unwilling to return to the nmb,and indeed would expect it to do so.nor has it sought to the rla procedures in any other way.toledo,peoria,at.
conclusion 
although this is a complicated case,one feature is simple enough to describe northwest flight attendants have proven intransigent in the face of northwest manifest need to reorganize.on that basis,we conclude that the afa has violated section first of the rla and affirm the preliminary injunction.
i agree with the majority in affirming the preliminary injunction,but i take a different route.
as the majority explains,the association of flight attendants afa has yet to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements as required by first in light of its failure to exhaust the bargaining procedures of the railway labor act rla and its rejection without good cause of northwest proposed modifications to the collective bargaining agreement cba.
but does that answer the afa argument that northwest alteration of the status under of the bankruptcy the afa a reciprocal right to strike,without violating its first duty the afa argues,with real force,that a strike would not compromise its first duty or the status quo obligation incorporated therein if northwest has already violated its own obligation to the status obligation that the supreme court has strongly implied if not held is reciprocal.
the majority sidesteps this argument,holding that once northwest implemented the terms of the bankruptcy court order,the status quo simply terminated.majority op.at.in other words,the status the protections it offered to the said to have terminated when and because it was abrogated.i could not possibly explain this to the flight attendants if i agreed with the majority that northwest violated a reciprocal duty to maintain the status quo,i would vote to vacate the injunction and permit the afa to strike.
i vote to affirm nevertheless because,although northwest effected a change in the status quo,it did not do so unilaterally.a rejection of a labor agreement in to strict statutory conditions and court be described fairly as a unilateral divergence from the status quo,and does not trigger a reciprocal right to strike.northwest resort to therefore did not affect the afa first duties,which keep the union at the bargaining table and off the picket line.
we affirm the injunction on the basis of the afa first duty.because the vagueness of the obligation under first could provide a cover for freewheeling judicial interference in labor relations,chicago ry.united transp.union,d,the section is understood to incorporate an implicit status quo requirement,see detroit toledo shore line united transp.union,d.given this implicit status quo obligation,strikes are generally inconsistent with exerting every reasonable effort to settle disputes without interruption to interstate commerce,id.at.but if a resort to violates its duty to maintain the status quo,and if that duty is reciprocal,id.at,then a union strike might be fully consistent with first.in my view,then,we can not avoid deciding the antecedent question whether northwest violated its duty to maintain the status quo.
the rla does not expressly reference a status quo,yet the supreme court has read it to require that w hile the dispute is working its way through the rla stages,neither party may unilaterally alter the status quo.of trainmen jacksonville terminal,d emphasis added.the obligation is an affirmative legal duty upon both employers and unions is enforceable by the courts.united air lines,int l ass of machinist aero.workers,cir emphasis in original.only if the parties exhaust rla procedures and remain at loggerheads,may they resort to in attempting to resolve their dispute.burlington of maint.of way employees,d.
northwest does not seriously dispute that its resort to effected a change in the status quo and,like the majority,i do not endorse the district court conclusion that the change simply created an altered baseline,northwest airlines ass of flight in re northwest airlines.the question is whether that change was one that violated northwest duty to maintain the status quo.see air line pilots ass n,int l united air lines,cir i t is a difficult question to determine when,if ever,an otherwise legitimate measure begins to impede upon a statutory protection.the majority evades this question.but that is the question the afa puts to us,and,as i have explained,we can not avoid answering it.
the supreme court has consistently characterized the duty to maintain the rla status quo as a duty to avoid changing it unilaterally.see consol.rail ry.labor executives ass n,d burlington,at.shore line,at.jacksonville terminal,at.we have preserved that distinction.see aircraft mechanics fraternal ass atlantic coast airlines atlantic coast ii,cir pan am.world airways,int l of teamsters,cir.and our sister circuits have done the same avoidance of unilateral changes in the status quo is an aspect of the duty to eschew.see shore line,at.unilateral alteration of the status quo is so subversive of the rla process that it supports injunctive relief without a further showing of irreparable harm.see consol.rail,at.
northwest did not effect a change in the status quo that is unilateral.a unilateral act is one in which there is only one party whose will operates.black law dictionary ed.in the context of an rla status quo,it is an act without negotiations,without bargaining.of locomotive eng rs atchison,topeka santa fe ry,cir.the characterization of the status quo duty as a duty to avoid changing it unilaterally prevents,promotes negotiation,and enlists and serves the interest of the public,as set out in shore line 
the act status quo requirement is central to its design.its immediate effect is to prevent the union from striking and management from doing anything that would justify a strike.in the long run,delaying the time when the parties can resort to provides time for tempers to cool,helps create an atmosphere in which rational bargaining can occur,and permits the forces of public opinion to be mobilized in favor of a settlement without a strike or lockout.
a conduct pursuant to can not fairly be described as unilateral,or as unmoored from negotiations.the procedure is essentially collective bargaining on wheels.before terminating or altering a labor agreement,a debtor must make a proposal to the authorized representative of the employees covered by such agreement,which proposal i must be based on the most complete and reliable information available at the time of such proposal,ii must provide for those necessary modifications in the employee s benefits and protections that are necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor,and iii must assure that all creditors,the debtor and all of the affected parties are treated fairly and equitably.b a.the debtor must then confer in good faith with the employees representative and attempt to reach mutually satisfactory modifications of such agreement.id.b.

an order pursuant to is thus implicitly the product of negotiations successful or unsuccessful.the process 
ensure s that and good faith negotiations occur in the market place,not as part of the judicial process.reorganization procedures are designed to encourage such a negotiated voluntary modification.knowing that it can not turn down an employer proposal without good cause gives the union an incentive to compromise on modifications of the collective bargaining agreement,so as to prevent its complete rejection.because the employer has the burden of proving its proposals are necessary,the union is protected from an employer whose proposals may be offered in bad faith.

at oral argument,the afa pointed out that the order merely authorized northwest to act,and that the decision to act on that authorization was taken by northwest alone,unilaterally.this argument can not be squared with the findings of the bankruptcy court that the modifications were necessary,and no greater than necessary northwest choice was to do what the order allowed,or risk dissolution there and then.as a,northwest might well have violated its fiduciary duty to creditors and the estate had it not exercised its right to implement the authorized changes.see a see also in re ionosphere clubs,the fiduciary obligation to its creditors includes refraining from acting in a manner which could hinder a successful reorganization of the business.an act under compulsion does not violate the status quo obligation.see,csx,united transp.union,cir enjoining strike threatened in response to changes mandated by compulsory arbitration and found necessary by the interstate commerce commission laffey northwest airlines,the status quo obligation does not stop an employer from immediately equalizing wages upward in accordance with a judicial determination that an existing wage disparity violates the equal pay act.

i would therefore hold that a resort to does not work a unilateral alteration of the rla status quo and therefore does not violate the status quo obligation.because northwest did not violate that obligation,the afa never accrued a right to strike,and a strike would therefore be inconsistent with its first duty to exert all reasonable efforts in pursuit of agreement.
the majority might well agree that permits a carrier unilaterally to alter its employees terms and conditions of employment and breach the rla status quo provisions,majority op.at,yet nevertheless rejects the afa position that this breach justifies a reciprocal action in the form of a strike.the majority avoids reconciling these positions by holding that once northwest turned to,i the cba ceased to exist,and ii the status quo was accordingly terminated and thereby incapable of sustaining a reciprocal right to strike.id.at.in my view,the very purpose of the rla status quo is to perpetuate rates of pay,rules,or working conditions regardless of whether the cba is terminated.

the majority opinion is the first to hold that the status quo obligation perishes with the underlying agreement.true,the supreme court has said that the status quo provisions are inapplicable where no collective bargaining agreement had ever existed between the parties.see williams jacksonville terminal.but the court subsequently limited even this exception it operates only where in contrast to our case there was absolutely no prior history of any collective bargaining or agreement between the parties on any matter.shore line,at.see also virgin atlantic airways,mediation,cir.
thus,in aircraft mechanics fraternal ass atlantic coast airlines,atlantic coast i,we concluded that a newly certified union that has no collective bargaining agreement with the carrier is not entitled to a status quo freeze under the rla,cir.the holding of atlantic coast i rested on the fact that no agreement had ever existed between the parties,and,for that reason,the status quo provisions had never applied.there is therefore no basis for the majority view that an existing status quo can terminate,and the authorities cited by the majority furnish no support for this idea 
i would not thus discard the status quo provisions in cases involving an abrogated cba.the status quo obligation is not subject to the horsetrading of collective bargaining it is superimposed by statute on every labor agreement subject to the rla,and was thus designed to survive such agreements rather than die with them.see manning american airlines,cir the very purpose of is to stabilize relations by artificially extending the lives of agreements for a limited period regardless of the parties intentions.further,speaks of an intended change in agreements,se
