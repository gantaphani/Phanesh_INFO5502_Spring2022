several american airlines,passengers claim that they and others similarly situated lost their luggage on international american flights.the passengers sued american in federal court seeking damages for their lost or damaged luggage and various forms of injunctive and declaratory relief.they sued under the warsaw convention,a treaty that governs claims for property damage arising out of international transportation of people and property the individual plaintiffs also moved to certify their suit as a class action on behalf of two categories of passengers.the district court granted american partial summary judgment and declined to certify the class.plaintiffs now appeal both of those rulings.because they have shown no reversible error,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
a.the cruzes and their luggage 
this case arises from some bad luck the cruz family purportedly had with their luggage.we glean the statement of facts that follows from the parties statements of material undisputed facts,unless otherwise indicated.see local civ.in,five members of the cruz family flew on an american airlines flight from washington,reagan national airport to santo domingo,the dominican republic,checking two bags each.when they arrived in santo domingo,the cruzes reported to american that five of their bags were missing.
the cruzes subsequently filed a statement of property loss with american,claiming that the bags were worth.american,however,offered the cruzes no compensation.american refused to offer compensation because,according to american records,the cruzes had filed their claims significantly more than days after their loss.american policy at the time was not to settle claims voluntarily if the claimant submitted a form more than days after the date of loss,though there were unspecified exceptions to this internal policy we refer to this policy as the rule.
the cruzes luggage travails did not end there.in,beato cruz,who had been on the previous american flight,again flew on an american flight,this time from the dominican republic to new york city.when he arrived in new york,according to cruz deposition testimony,his bag was badly damaged and was missing its contents.
the next day,cruz filed a statement of lost property with american,declaring that the value of his bag was.that same day american gave cruz a travel voucher.when he received the form,cruz signed his name next to the following statement 
customer receipt and release the above sum received from american airlines is in full satisfaction of all claims,liabilities and demands that i may have against said company.
several months later,american issued cruz a check for as compensation for his damaged luggage.the check came with a letter stating that this figure was the maximum amount of compensation american was legally obligated to provide under the terms of its international tariff governing baggage loss and under the warsaw convention.article of the warsaw convention generally provides passengers a cause of action for damages against international carriers for lost or damaged checked bags.under article,that liability is limited to per pound of lost or damaged baggage.american international tariffs which govern the rates for its international flights and which under federal law it must file with the department of transportation,see specify a default deemed weight for caribbean passengers lost bags.this deemed weight,under the tariffs,is used to calculate american liability under the warsaw convention.the tariffs,specifically,provide that the baggage weight of a caribbean passenger with a single bag is assumed to be pounds the bag maximum allowable weight unless the passenger ticket states the actual weight.
american calculated the it offered cruz based on a flawed understanding of the deemed weight of cruz bag.american computed that figure by multiplying by pounds,which it stated was the maximum allowable weight of cruz bag under its tariffs.the true maximum weight of cruz bag under the tariffs was pounds.therefore,the calculation underestimated the limit applicable to cruz lost bag by at least minus.
cruz cashed the check.the back of the check had a legend of release on it,which stated that 
by endorsement or deposit of this check i we hereby release american airlines,its agents,including other airlines providing transportation,its employee sic and representatives from all claims rising in connection with the loss,damage or delay of my belongings transported or authorized to have been transported on the travel date indicated on the remittance advise.
cruz signed his name next to this statement when he endorsed the check.at that point,cruz had already retained his current attorney and was a party to this lawsuit against american,which at the time only involved the cruz family trip.cruz also testified at his deposition that,when he cashed the check,he believed he could sue american for the additional amount he believed he was owed,which,according to positions he later took,was the bag fair value.again,cruz position at the time was that the fair value of his bag was.
b.the first phase of litigation 
on december,five cruz family members,including beato cruz,sued american in federal district court to recover the value of their bags.relying on the warsaw convention,they sought damages equal to the fair value of the contents of their lost and damaged luggage.they also alleged that american unlawfully required them to complete a form and illegally applied the rule to them.the cruzes accordingly sought both a declaration that these procedures were illegal and an injunction preventing american from applying the procedures to future passengers.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs declaratory and injunctive claims for lack of article iii standing.the court reasoned that as american admitted,it had incorrectly required the cruzes to fill out a claim form,mistakenly applied the rule to the cruzes claims,and agreed to process the cruzes claims as timely filed,the cruzes personally stood to gain little from the requested declaratory and injunctive relief.moreover,reasoned the court,the possibility that american would in similar circumstances again misapply those procedures to the cruzes was highly improbable.the district court concluded,therefore,that the cruzes had no standing to raise the declaratory and injunctive claims.
american also moved for partial summary judgment on the cruzes damages claims to the extent the cruzes sought damages in excess of the warsaw convention per pound liability limit.american,however,conceded that it was liable to the cruzes to the extent of per pound of their lost bags.consequently,american also moved for entry of final judgment in the cruzes favor to the extent of times the poundage of the cruzes bags.
the district court granted both of american motions,holding that american liability to the cruzes under the warsaw convention was limited to per pound of lost luggage.the cruzes had argued that the warsaw convention liability limit did not apply because american had failed to state the weight of each suitcase on the cruzes baggage stubs,as required by article f of the convention.the district court rejected this argument.because american conceded liability to the cruzes and moved for partial judgment in the cruzes favor,the district court entered a judgment in the cruzes favor to the extent of times the poundage of their bags.
while american motions were pending,the cruzes moved to amend their complaint.their motion sought to transform their individual claims into class action claims on behalf of others who had lost their luggage in similar circumstances.that motion was pending when the district court ruled on american motions.after its ruling,the district court dismissed the cruzes motion to amend as moot.
the cruzes successfully appealed the district court judgment to this court.on appeal,the cruzes attacked,among other things,the district court ruling regarding the warsaw convention liability limit.in particular,they argued that the liability limit did not apply to the cruzes damages claims,because american had failed to record the baggage weight of each suitcase on the cruzes baggage stubs.we accepted that argument and accordingly vacated and remanded the district court judgment.cruz am.airlines.cruz did not,however,address whether the district court standing rulings were correct.nor did cruz address whether the district court correctly dismissed as moot the cruzes motion to amend their complaint.cruz merely reinstated the cruzes action to its prior,judgment status and thus revived the cruzes motion to amend their complaint to a class action.id.at.
c.the second phase of litigation 
after remand,the cruzes,in april,filed an amended complaint asserting two claims.the complaint described the claim i class as 
consist ing of all persons who during the period beginning two years prior to initiation of this suit,december,and ending on the date of final judgment herein the claim i class period a checked their baggage for transport for an international air journey to or from the united states in whole or part performed by american,b sustained the loss of or damage to their checked baggage in circumstances where american is made liable for such under warsaw article,c gave timely notice of such consistent with warsaw article or applicable carrier tariff rules,d made claim for the fair value of such,and e suffered the or rejection of their claim because of their alleged failure to comply with the requirements of defendant rule.
claim i sought,inter alia,a declaration that american application of its rule to checked baggage claims was unlawful and an injunction preventing american from applying the rule to the claims of future passengers,and noting damages.
the complaint defined the claim ii class as 
consist ing of all persons all persons sic who during the period beginning two years prior to initiation of this suit,december,and ending on march,the claim ii class period a checked their baggage for transport for an international air journey to or from the united states in whole or part performed by american and without the weight of that baggage having been recorded on the passenger combined passenger ticket and baggage check,b sustained the loss of or damage to their checked baggage in circumstances where american is made liable for such under warsaw article,c gave timely notice of such consistent with warsaw article or applicable carrier tariff rules,d made claim for the fair value of such,and e thereafter received from american for such claim a payment of compensation less than the claimed fair value of such,being an amount usually but sometimes which american asserted was the limit of its liability for such baggage under warsaw article liability limit and its tariff rules.
claim ii asked the district court to award this class compensatory damages equal to the fair value of their lost or damaged bags.claim ii also alleged that american had typically as it did with beato cruz settled the claim ii class members damages claims for per bag,based on american representation that this figure was the limit of its liability under the warsaw convention.as discussed,those settlement offers pounds times erroneously assumed that,for a single bag,the maximum weight provided in american tariff was pounds,not.
american moved for partial summary judgment,arguing,as it had before the first appeal,that the claim i plaintiffs lacked standing to obtain a declaration that american rule was unlawful and an injunction preventing american from applying that procedure to future customers.as to claim ii,american argued that beato cruz claim was barred by the two american forms he signed.the cruzes,for their part,moved to certify both claim i and claim ii as class actions.
in their reply to american opposition to the cruzes motion to certify the two classes,filed on november,the cruzes for the first time requested an additional form of relief under claim i,one mentioned in neither their complaints nor their previous certification and documents.the cruzes asked the district court to declare that american had an obligation to process the claim i class members claims without regard to american since repudiated rule,and for american to offer the claim i class compensation.the cruzes requested that the district court issue an injunction requiring american to do both of those things.
the district court granted american partial motion.the court decided to address american motion before addressing the cruzes certification motion.as to summary judgment,the court concluded that beato cruz had released his claim for money damages by cashing the check.cruz had argued that this release should be rescinded on grounds of misrepresentation or mutual mistake.american,cruz claimed,mistakenly represented to cruz in the letter accompanying the offer of settlement that the maximum weight of his bag,as defined in american tariffs,was,not,pounds.as a result,american had underestimated the maximum extent of its warsaw convention liability to him.the district court rejected that argument,in part because american pointed to cruz deposition testimony showing that this mistake or misrepresentation did not contribute in any material way to cruz decision to sign the release.cruz testimony at his deposition was that,at the time he cashed the check,he was represented by his present attorney and believed that he could successfully sue american for more than this amount even after he signed the release.
the district court also agreed with american that none of the claim i putative class representatives had standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy american misapplication of the rule to them.that relief,the court reasoned,only would address american prospective application of the rule,and therefore would not redress the putative representatives actual injury their lost bags.moreover,the court continued,the possibility that these same plaintiffs would again fly on an international american flight,lose their bags,and have the rule again applied to them was simply too speculative an injury to establish article iii standing.the district court did not address whether the cruzes had standing to seek relief under their newly articulated theory specifically,whether they had standing to seek a declaration and injunction ordering american to process their claims and make offers to them.having dismissed much of the cruzes case on the merits,the district court directed the cruzes to file a new motion in light of the posture of the case.
the cruzes filed exactly three motions.first,they renewed their motion to certify the claim i class.they claimed that their complaint,even after the district court ruling,still presented three common issues whether american was legally obligated to compensate the claim i class members whether the district court should issue an injunction requiring american to process their damages claims on their merits without regard to the rule and whether the cruzes were entitled to a declaration that the warsaw convention liability limit did not apply to those class members whose baggage weight american did not record on their claim tickets.
second,the cruzes requested that the district court reconsider its ruling.the sole ground on which the cruzes sought reconsideration was that the district court had mistakenly granted american summary judgment as to the claim ii representatives claims.specifically,they repeated their argument that the release signed by the representatives,contrary to the district court ruling,was fatally tainted by american misrepresentation of the deemed weight of their bags.that motion,however,did not challenge the district court ruling that the cruzes lacked standing to assert their claim i injunctive claims.because the cruzes interpreted the district court ruling to have implicitly denied their motion to certify the claim ii class,the cruzes did not formally renew that motion in their reconsideration petition.
finally,the cruzes filed a motion they styled as a contingent motion for disclosure and notification.this motion asked the district court to direct american to disclose to the cruzes the identities of the claim i putative class members and to invite them to intervene as plaintiffs,assuming the district court concluded that the existing complement of plaintiffs seeking to serve as the claim i class representatives requires supplementation or substitution.
the district court denied all three motions.as for the cruzes claims for declaratory and injunctive relief,the district court noted that it had already ruled that the cruzes lacked standing to challenge the legitimacy of the rule.thus,the court concluded,the cruzes only had standing to seek damages for their lost bags.on the issue of damages,the district court declined to certify a class.the court relied primarily on federal rule of civil procedure a,which requires that there be questions of law or fact common to the class before a court may certify a class.the court reasoned that the class members claims for damages did not present a common issue.resolution of any individual damage claim,the court said,would require a detailed,individualized inquiry into the value of each person lost luggage,miring the court in an unmanageable series of that would destroy the efficiency rationale undergirding rule.for substantially the same reason,the court concluded,alternatively,that the cruzes remaining damages claims did not present question s of law or fact that predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.c.the district court also denied the cruzes motion for disclosure and intervention and their motion for reconsideration of its earlier ruling.
following the district court disposition,the cruzes settled their individual damages claims with american.the district court accordingly entered an order granting american judgment on beato cruz claim ii claim and dismissing the claim i and claim ii class claims with prejudice.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the cruzes raise two sets of issues on appeal.the first relates to the district court disposition of the motion to certify the claim i putative class.as to this claim,the cruzes argue that the district court mistakenly found they lacked standing to pursue declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of that class.they also say that the district court abused its discretion in declining to certify the class.and they complain that the district court violated rule d by denying their contingent request for the court to order american to disclose the identities of the claim i putative class members and to invite those people to intervene in this action.
the second set of issues relates to the claim ii class.plaintiffs attack the district court ruling that beato cruz damages claim was released.plaintiffs also appear to argue in their reply brief that the district court mistakenly declined to consider the propriety of certifying the claim ii class.
for the reasons that follow,we reject all of these assertions and affirm the judgment of the district court.we first address the claim i issues,then the claim ii issues.
claim i issues 
we review de novo the district court decision to grant american summary judgment,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the cruzes,the nonmoving parties.the district court ruling should be affirmed only if american has satisfied its burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact about whether it is entitled to judgment.tao freeh.we may reverse a district court refusal to certify a class only if it abused its discretion or applied incorrect legal criteria in doing so.hartman duffey.the district court decision not to order notice to the class is also a matter within the district court discretion,larionoff united states,and so we will also reverse that only if the decision was an abuse of discretion.
plaintiffs challenge to the prospective enforcement of the rule.
the district court correctly found that the cruzes lack article iii standing to obtain an injunction forbidding american from enforcing its rule and a declaration that this rule is unlawful.to establish standing,the cruzes must show that american actions have caused them some concrete injury that this declaratory and injunctive relief will redress.audubon soc y bentsen,en banc.the cruzes have made no such showing.
in particular,they have not shown that their challenge to the prospective enforcement of american policy will redress any concrete injury they have asserted.plaintiffs have alleged the loss of their luggage on american flights but a prospective injunction against future applications of the rule will do nothing to remedy that past harm.there is a chance that plaintiffs could lose their luggage on a future american flight but plaintiffs have not alleged,much less presented evidence,that they have any such travel plans.even if they did,the likelihood that american would,once again,lose plaintiffs luggage is minuscule.and even assuming plaintiffs lost their luggage on another international american flight,the likelihood that they would again file their claims late is small,given their previous experience with american indeed,beato cruz actions he filed his second claim for reimbursement on time shows that these plaintiffs are unlikely to file their claims late again.even then,it is unlikely that american would again reject any claim,given the litigation its rule spawned and given that it has disavowed the rule.
plaintiffs speculative interest in prospectively challenging the rule parallels the one the supreme court found fell short of establishing a concrete interest in city of los angeles lyons,d.in lyons,a person whom police officers stopped and applied a chokehold to sued the city of los angeles and the officers for money damages and an injunction declaring that this practice was unlawful.id.at.at.the supreme court held that the plaintiff lacked standing to seek the injunctive remedy,since it was highly unlikely that the plaintiff would be again stopped by the police and subjected to the same sort of chokehold.id.at.at.therefore,the court reasoned,the plaintiff had no concrete interest in obtaining a prospective injunction.
the reasoning of lyons applies to the claims before us.it is not likely that plaintiffs will again lose their luggage on an international american flight,much less again be denied compensation as a result of the misapplication of the rule.though plaintiffs dismiss lyons as involving a wholly concluded and unlikely to be repeated incident of a police,that characterization aptly describes plaintiffs asserted injury as well.
plaintiffs request for a retrospective injunction ordering american to process their claims and offer to settle their claims.
plaintiffs argue that the district court decision to grant american summary judgment failed to consider a separate claim for injunctive relief a claim for a retrospective injunction ordering american to process plaintiffs compensation claims without regard to american rule.this assertion challenges the district court ruling that the cruzes lacked standing to assert their claim i requests for declaratory and injunctive relief regarding american rule.the district court never addressed plaintiffs request for a retrospective,as opposed to a prospective,injunction and declaration,but that was because the cruzes lawyer failed to apprise the district court of it sufficiently.we therefore decline to address its merits.
we root this decision in our discretion not to consider claims that litigants fail to raise sufficiently below and on which district courts do not pass.see singleton wulff,d.the issue is whether,in light of the policy of this rule to encourage parties to communicate with each other and the trial judge,edmond postal,plaintiffs apprised the district court with sufficient clarity of this challenge to its ruling.
they did not.plaintiffs never mentioned this request in their pleadings.their revised complaint,in particular,contained no hint of this odd request for an injunction,as plaintiffs counsel conceded when pressed at oral argument.nor did their papers,although those papers did stress the uncontroversial and distinct proposition that american has a duty to compensate passengers whose luggage it loses.the first clue plaintiffs gave the district court of their new theory came in their reply to american opposition to their motion to cert
