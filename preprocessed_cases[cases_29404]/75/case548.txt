esteban gutierrez was driving a bearing the insignia of fedex ground package system,while walter huggins slept in the back of the truck huggins was injured when gutierrez collided with the in front of him,which tony johnston,an employee of teton transportation,was driving.shortly before the collision,as he topped a hill,johnston saw a swanston equipment pickup truck traveling slowly down the left shoulder of the highway and displaying a sign that read,left lane closed ahead.johnston slowed his truck,and,when the vehicle immediately in front of him came to a sudden stop,he applied his brakes and stopped about ten feet behind it.the gutierrez then collided with the back of the teton vehicle.huggins brought an action in missouri state court for damages arising out of the collision and teton removed it to federal district court.
the district court granted summary judgment to teton and fedex but denied summary judgment to swanston.after obtaining an order designating the rulings in favor of teton and fedex as final judgments,see.b,huggins appealed.we dismissed his appeal sua sponte for lack of appellate jurisdiction because of the unresolved claims against swanston.huggins fedex ground package,cir.on remand,the district court granted huggins motion to dismiss his claims against swanston without prejudice and huggins again appealed,challenging the orders granting summary judgment to teton and fedex on his negligence claims.we conclude that we have jurisdiction and we affirm the judgment in favor of teton.but we reverse the judgment in favor of fedex and remand the case for further proceedings.
in its motion for summary judgment,teton contended that huggins could not make out a negligence claim because he could not show that teton alleged negligence was a proximate cause of his injuries.see teichman potashnick.the parties agree that missouri substantive law applies in this case.in support of its motion,teton relied on the part of johnston deposition testimony that described a straightforward collision he drove over the hill in the right westbound lane,saw the closure sign,eventually stopped in that lane,and was hit from behind.huggins filed a timely response,relying on another part of johnston account to argue that the teton driver contributed to the collision by engaging in a game with gutierrez.johnston had attested that the two trucks had traveled together for some time before the collision occurred.he had further declared that,during this period,gutierrez had tried to pass johnston about five times and attempted to engage another driver to assist him,but johnston did not allow him to pass and once slightly exceeded the speed limit to prevent gutierrez from passing him.the district court concluded,however,that under missouri law these earlier activities could not be a proximate cause of the collision,and huggins does not challenge that determination on appeal.
huggins maintains instead that the district court erred by denying his untimely motion to supplement his response to teton summary judgment motion.the court,after conferring with the parties,had previously extended its deadline for dispositive motions,including motions for summary judgment,and had ordered the opposing party to file any desired response to a dispositive motion within thirty days after such a motion was filed thus providing ten more days for filing a response than did the local rules,see.b.after huggins filed his timely response to teton motion for summary judgment,fedex filed its response to a summary judgment motion that huggins later filed and it attached gutierrez affidavit.in the affidavit,gutierrez attested that the teton truck cut in front of him i mmediately prior to the accident,thereby preventing him from having sufficient stopping distance to avoid the collision.about a week after fedex filed the affidavit and two weeks after the time ran for responding to teton motion,huggins moved to supplement the record relevant to teton motion by incorporating gutierrez affidavit into his response.teton,in turn,asked the court either to deny huggins request to supplement the record or to allow teton additional time to depose gutierrez pursuant to.f under that rule,a district court may grant time for a party opposing summary judgment to take a deposition if that party shows by affidavit that,for specified reasons,it can not present facts essential to justify its opposition.
some three weeks later,teton and the other defendants moved to continue the trial and to amend the court case management order,asserting,among other things,that the case had been delayed because of disputes about diversity jurisdiction,that huggins had only recently completed his medical treatment,and that the parties were trying to coordinate a date for deposing gutierrez.the court granted the motion in part,extending discovery and setting a later trial date,but it did not change the deadlines for dispositive motions or for responses to those motions.none of the parties deposed gutierrez before the new discovery deadline passed.about a month later,the court denied huggins motion to supplement the record and granted teton summary judgment motion.huggins federal express,wl.april.though the court acknowledged the potential significance of gutierrez testimony,it declined to consider the affidavit because huggins obtained it after what was then the deadline for discovery,as well as the deadline for filing dispositive motions,had passed.the court explained that it appear ed that plaintiff opted against timely interviewing,deposing,securing the affidavit of,gutierrez,and that huggins should not be permitted to take unfair advantage of the presumably accessible,subject by fedex after the close of discovery.in support of its conclusion that the evidence had been accessible,the court cited rule f,on which huggins could have relied if the evidence had been unavailable to him.huggins,wl at.
although rule provides deadlines for filing summary judgment materials,the district courts have broad discretion to manage their dockets and address particular circumstances by enforcing local rules and by setting enforceable time limits.see reasonover louis county,cir see also sipe workhorse custom chassis,llc,cir.here,huggins does not dispute that he moved to supplement the summary judgment record two weeks after his response to teton summary judgment motion was due,and after he had already filed a timely response without indicating any need for additional time.
under.b,w hen an act may or must be done within a specified time,the court may,for good cause,extend the time on motion made after the time has expired if the party failed to act because of excusable neglect.the district court has discretion to admit or exclude materials under this rule,and its refusal to accept untimely filed materials will not be reversed for an abuse of discretion unless the proponent of the materials has made an affirmative showing of excusable neglect.african american voting rights legal def.fund,villa,cir citing lujan national wildlife fed n,cert.denied,see also dg g,flexsol packaging of pompano beach,cir.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion here because huggins failed to make an affirmative showing of excusable neglect.
interpreting the term excusable neglect in a bankruptcy rule derived from rule b,the supreme court has held that neglect does not require a showing that the party was without fault but encompasses inadvertence,mistake,or carelessness,though the neglect will not necessarily be excusable.pioneer inv.services brunswick associates.partnership,see noah bond cold storage,cir.but the untimeliness here was not the result of mistake or carelessness.as huggins counsel confirmed at oral argument,he consciously elected not to depose gutierrez for strategic reasons on hearing johnston attest that gutierrez,after repeatedly trying to pass him,had been angrily cursing at johnston over his cb radio shortly before he slammed into the back of the johnston truck,huggins attorney decided not to preserve gutierrez testimony.since gutierrez had relocated to hawaii,huggins counsel reasoned that fedex might have difficulty producing him at trial to counter johnston negative characterization of gutierrez behavior.the district court thus did not clearly err in finding that huggins consciously opted against timely obtaining gutierrez testimony.
we reject huggins contention that the district court order granting additional time for discovery should alter the outcome.as we have explained,the court did not change the date for filing and responding to dispositive motions,it merely gave the parties additional time to conduct discovery before trial in a case that had been pending for over two years.we do not believe that the court order distinguishes our case from villa and others holding that a district court does not abuse its discretion by denying leave to file supplementary matter out of time where the proponent fails to show excusable neglect.
huggins contends that the district court erred in entering summary judgment for fedex based on its conclusion that the evidence could not support a finding that gutierrez was a fedex employee and so his negligence could not be imputed to fedex.reviewing the evidence and inferences from it favorably to huggins,as we must,ridpath pederson,cir,we conclude that huggins presented sufficient evidence to avoid summary judgment.
because huggins based his negligence claim against fedex on the doctrine of respondeat superior,he had to establish that the driver,gutierrez,was a fedex employee.under missouri law,the resolution of this issue depends upon the particular facts of each case and is usually a question for the jury,although it may be decided as a matter of law when the material facts are undisputed and only one reasonable conclusion can be drawn from those facts.johnson development agency,superseded on other grounds,state ex rel.metropolitan louis sewer dist.sanders,ascoli hinck.
the principal factors that missouri courts routinely consider in determining whether one acting for another is an employee or an independent contractor for purposes of respondeat superior liability are set out in of the restatement second of agency.lee pulitzer pub,see johnson pacific intermountain exp,dean young.the very first of these considerations is the extent of control which,by the relevant agreement,the master may exercise over the details of the work,restatement second of agency a,and the missouri supreme court has frequently emphasized the importance of the right to control the conduct of another in the performance of an act,describing it as the touchstone for determining whether a relationship exists,see,shell oil.
in support of its summary judgment motion,fedex relied on a linehaul contractor operating agreement under which jon ireland who did business as ani logistics agreed to provide certain shipping and tractor leasing services to fedex.although rps,originally contracted with ani,fedex later acquired rps and the relevant contract,and thus we refer to fedex as the contracting party.the parties agree that gutierrez drove an ani tractor and was an ani operator as that term is used in the agreement,and although gutierrez was not a party to the agreement,some of the contract provisions address the role of ani drivers.
based on the agreement,the district court concluded that the parties intended to disclaim any employment relationship between ani employees and fedex,that fedex did not have the right to control gutierrez work,and that the contract supported the conclusion that gutierrez was an independent contractor with respect to fedex.after determining that huggins had not offered admissible evidence to the contrary,the court granted summary judgment to fedex because mr huggins failed to adduce evidence sufficient to support a finding that gutierrez was a fedex employee.
in reaching its conclusion,the court relied heavily on specific provisions in the agreement stating that the parties intend that ani will provide its services strictly as an independent contractor,and not as an employee of fedex for any purpose and will direct the operation of the equipment and determine the methods,manner and means of performing the obligations specified in the agreement.although the district court acknowledged that the contract defined certain requirements regarding standards of operator appearance customer service,it concluded that ani had discretion as to how to carry out these objectives.the court relied on provisions giving ani sole discretion in determining the means and methods by which to carry out the foregoing objectives.the restatement notes the important distinction that exists between service in which the actor physical activities and his time are surrendered to the control of the master,and service under an agreement to use care and skill in accomplishing results.restatement second of agency,comment e see also skidmore haggard.in the former case,the actor is an employee or servant,in the latter an independent contractor.
of course,general contract provisions that confer on a party the discretion to determine the means and methods for carrying out objectives language often used to describe the role of an independent contractor will not trump provisions that actually reserve the right to control the details of that party performance.having carefully reviewed the agreement in this case,we conclude that it did not simply require ani and its drivers to use skill and care in their work under the agreement,fedex retained the right to control at least some of the means and methods used by ani and its drivers to achieve the contract stated objectives.
we observe initially that the agreement makes plain that the ani drivers performed work that was part of the regular business of fedex,a fact that the restatement lists as supporting the existence of a relationship.restatement second of agency h.for instance,the contract begins by stating that fedex is a duly licensed motor carrier engaged in providing transportation and delivery service and that fedex wants to provide for package and delivery services through a network of nationwide terminals served by what it terms independent contractors.unlike truck drivers engaged by other types of businesses,however,ani and gutierrez performed work that was the essence of fedex business,namely,transportation and delivery service.brister ikenberry,no.ed,wl,at.
we note,moreover,that the agreement required ani and its drivers to look and act like fedex employees while they performed fedex services,and we believe that these provisions show the extent of fedex control over some details of gutierrez work,see restatement second of agency,a.the agreement states that ani will conduct its business so that it can be identified as being part of the fedex system and that its operators will f oster fedex professional image and good reputation.more specifically,each person having contact with the public will wear a fedex approved uniform,maintained in good condition,and will otherwise keep personal appearance consistent with reasonable standards of good order as maintained by competitors and promulgated from time to time by fedex.the agreement also required ani trucks to have fedex insignia or identify the equipment as part of the fedex system and to be maintained in a clean and presentable fashion free of body damage and extraneous markings.
in addition,in a section addressing customer service,the agreement states that fedex will familiarize ani with various quality service and safety procedures developed by fedex,supporting an inference that ani and its drivers were required to follow fedex procedures.fedex also reserved the right to monitor ani safety practices fedex terminal personnel,at their option,were permitted to take a safety ride with contractor or presumably the contractor driver to verify compliance with standards in the agreement.furthermore,drivers had to submit daily fuel receipts and daily shipping documents to fedex.they also organized and returned undeliverable packages to fedex,and ani agreed to provide fedex with advance notice of routes to be taken for each linehaul movement and a state by state mileage report for interstate package and delivery movement.
