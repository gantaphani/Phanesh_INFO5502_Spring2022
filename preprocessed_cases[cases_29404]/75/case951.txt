under department of transportation regulations,employees in the aviation,rail,motor carrier,mass transit,maritime and pipeline industries who either fail or refuse to take a drug test must successfully complete a drug treatment program and pass a series of urine tests as a condition of performing any duties.to prevent cheating,the department modified its regulations in to require that such tests be conducted under direct observation.petitioners,a railway company and several transportation unions,challenge the revised regulation,arguing that it violates both the administrative procedure act and the fourth amendment.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we find the department considered justification for its policy neither arbitrary nor capricious,and although we recognize the highly intrusive nature of direct observation testing,we conclude that the regulation complies with the fourth amendment.
acting pursuant to the omnibus transportation employee testing act of,tit.v,stat,the department of transportation promulgated regulations requiring,random,and drug and alcohol tests for employees throughout the transportation industry.pt.employees who fail or refuse to take drug tests are barred from performing duties until they complete a treatment program under the supervision of a substance abuse professional.employees who successfully complete the program must then pass a urine test before resuming duties.during the next twelve months,the employees must also pass at least six unannounced urine tests.d.
prior to the rulemaking at issue in this case,employers had the option of conducting and tests using direct observation,a procedure that requires a observer to watch the urine go from the employee body into the collection container.i.concerned that employers were underutilizing this option,especially in light of evidence of a growing proliferation of products that facilitate cheating on drug tests,the department solicited comment on additional procedures to strengthen testing integrity.in,the department promulgated a regulation requiring transportation industry employers to use direct observation for all and testing.procedures for transportation workplace drug and alcohol testing programs,direct observation rule.the regulation also requires that immediately prior to all direct observation tests,employees must raise their shirts above the waist and lower their lower clothing so as to expose their genitals and allow the observers to verify the absence of any cheating devices.i.
several transportation industry unions and the bnsf railway company,supported by amicus association of american railroads,petition for review.although the partial disrobing requirement became effective on august,we stayed the direct observation requirement pending our resolution of these consolidated petitions.bnsf ry.dot.petitioners argue that the department decision to impose these requirements violates the administrative procedure act apa prohibition on arbitrary and capricious agency action and the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable searches.we consider each argument in turn.
under the hobbs administrative orders review act,we evaluate department of transportation orders using the familiar standards set forth in the apa.icc of locomotive eng rs,d a.under that framework,agencies must provide a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the united states,state farm mut.auto.ins,d internal quotation marks omitted.petitioners argue that the department promulgation of the revised regulation was arbitrary and capricious under this standard.we disagree.
the department marshaled and carefully considered voluminous evidence of the increasing availability of a variety of products designed to defeat drug tests.it cited congressional testimony describing the ready availability,through internet sales,of hundreds of different cheating products,direct observation rule.at,the most elaborate of which is a prosthetic device that looks like real human anatomy,that can be used to deliver synthetic or urine,id.at.the department also relied on a government accountability office gao report indicating that existing drug testing protocols were inadequate to prevent cheating.according to the report,gao undercover investigators were able to adulterate their urine specimens even at testing sites that followed procedures.id.at.based on this and similar evidence,the department determined it was not practicable to ignore the cheating problem.id.at.
petitioners dispute none of this evidence.instead,they fault the department for failing to provide direct evidence that employees are actually using cheating devices.acknowledging that it had no statistics on the rates of actual use of such devices,the department inferred their use from the anecdotal evidence of their availability.id.at.as any successful use of cheating devices would not show up in statistics,the department reasoned,it was illogical to require statistical evidence of cheating.id.given that people presumably buy cheating devices to use them,we think this approach quite reasonable.as the supreme court said just over two weeks ago,it is one thing to set aside agency action under the administrative procedure act because of failure to adduce empirical data that can readily be obtained.it is something else to insist upon obtaining the unobtainable.fcc fox television stations,d citation omitted.
petitioners devote most of their effort to a separate whether or not cheating is a problem generally,the department acted arbitrarily and capriciously in concluding that returning employees are more likely to cheat than employees not subject to direct observation testing.but the department approach was sound.acknowledging the intrusiveness of direct observation testing,the department sought to limit it to situations posing a high risk of cheating,id.at,and then in our returning employees have a heightened incentive to cheat,and that this incentive,coupled with the increased availability of cheating devices,creates such a high risk,id.at.
the department conclusion that returning employees have a heightened incentive to cheat rested in part upon the heavy sanctions reserved for repeat violations.the department noted that many employers have adopted two strikes and out policies that require termination upon a second drug violation,id.at,and that in the aviation industry second offenders are subject to a statutory permanent bar on employment,see c.petitioners object that the department reasoning is inconsistent with its treatment of testing.as petitioners point out,although employees involved in accidents are subject to mandatory testing immediately after the event,see,b a b a,that testing is not directly observed,a c.according to petitioners,treating and returning employees differently is irrational because the former,subject as they are to civil or criminal liability,have just as great an incentive to cheat as the latter.
petitioners argument might have had some force had the department relied solely on this theory.but it did.substantial additional evidence supports the department conclusion that returning employees are particularly likely to cheat.specifically,several substance abuse professionals submitted comments supporting the direct observation requirement,and the department reasonably put a great deal of weight on their assessments,stressing their expertise and experience in administering the treatment programs and planning the testing.id.at.to be sure,several substance abuse professionals spoke only generally about the cheating problem,but others expressly stated that returning employees in particular have a heightened motive to cheat.one said that p ersons who have broken trust with the traveling public by testing positive for a prohibited substance,although they knew they would be drug tested,are high risk for using that substance again and motivated to conceal their conduct.comments of evan peterson,dep t of transp.docket no.another said that those who have tested positive in the past,and who continue to abuse drugs,are motivated by their addiction to adulterate,substitute,or use d
