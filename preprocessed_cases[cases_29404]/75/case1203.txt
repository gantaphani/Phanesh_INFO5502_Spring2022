plaintiffs gary weinstein and ryan mitchell were injured in a collision on highway and sought to hold defendant california department of transportation liable for their injuries on the ground that the accident location was in a dangerous condition.defendant obtained summary judgment based on design immunity,and plaintiffs appeal.we affirm the judgment.
background 
the operative complaint is plaintiffs second amended complaint.plaintiffs alleged that,on december,a northbound vehicle crossed over the highway median miles north of burnett avenue in the city of morgan hill and collided with a southbound vehicle.the driver of the northbound vehicle was killed.plaintiffs were injured.
plaintiffs alleged that defendant was liable under government code section,subdivision b for their injuries because the accident location was dangerous.they asserted that a lane drop occurred at that location without warning with both horizontal and vertical sight distance restrictions,and cyclone fencing in the median was inadequate to prevent accidents.
defendant filed an answer in which it alleged that it was not liable for the condition of the property because it had design immunity for that condition under government code section.
defendant filed a motion for summary judgment based on its design immunity defense.defendant claimed that the following facts were undisputed highway was an essentially straight road at the accident location with no horizontal or vertical sight restrictions the relevant state standards did not require a median barrier at that location because a the median was feet wide at that location,and a median barrier was not required where the median was wider than feet,b a median barrier was not required to close a median barrier gap of less than kilometers as the gap here was larger,and c there was no significant history of crossover median accidents at the accident location so the accident rate did not justify a median barrier and the cyclone fencing in the median had been installed solely to prevent,not to prevent crossover median accidents.
defendant independent traffic engineer expert edward ruzak submitted an extensive declaration in support of defendant summary judgment motion.the plans for this portion of highway were approved in,and the roadway was completed in accordance with the plans in.as planned and built,this section of highway had a paved median shoulder,which was in compliance with state standards.cyclone fencing was added in the middle of the median in as part of an approved plan aimed at eliminating the high incidence of in the median.this fencing complied with the applicable state standards.a median barrier was added to the median south of the accident location in november.no median barrier was placed in the median at the accident location.vehicular traffic volume on this roadway doubled between and,and,in the period ending in,million vehicles travelled through this area northbound and southbound.yet there had been only one prior collision near this location prior to december.
south of the accident location there were three northbound lanes and a median.this section was followed by a transition area with a warning sign on the side lane ends merge left and pavement arrows indicating that the number lane was merging with the number lane.the sign and pavement arrows met all applicable standards.the median remained feet wide through the transition area.just before the accident location,the median widened to feet and remained at that width through the accident location and beyond.the roadway was essentially straight at the accident location,and there were no sight restrictions.
plaintiffs filed opposition to the motion.they asserted that there were factual disputes underlying defendant design immunity defense,defendant had lost its design immunity due to changed physical conditions,and notwithstanding design immunity,defendant was liable for failing to warn motorists of the lane drop by placing a warning sign on the median side.
the only element of defendant design immunity defense that plaintiffs disputed was the reasonableness element.they claimed that the design was unreasonable because it did not conform to state standards.plaintiffs asserted that the design violated state standards in four respects the transition area was not straight but on a curve no sign appeared on the left hand median side warning of the lane drop the median shoulder width was below the standard and a median barrier was required at that location due to the potential for accidents and the gap closure policy.
plaintiffs independent traffic engineer expert ronald shields submitted a declaration in support of their opposition.shields asserted that a photograph of the accident location showed that the median shoulder width was less than five feet.he also declared that state standards required transition areas to be on a straight away and not on a curvature,and the transition area near the accident location was in the middle of a horizontal curve.shields claimed that a median barrier was required at this location under the gap closure policy and due to a higher than average accident rate.with respect to the signage,plaintiffs relied on a standard that said o n roadways where the width of the median island will permit,two such signs can be placed facing approaching traffic,one on the right side and the other on the median island.italics added.
defendant reply contended that plaintiffs could not base their opposition on the shoulder width because the second amended complaint had not addressed that contention.it asserted that the slight curvature in the transition area was,according to accepted traffic engineering practice and state standards,essentially a straight section.ruzak submitted a supplemental declaration in support of defendant reply.he asserted that the roadway is basically straight and any curvature is so minute as to be unobservable with no horizontal or vertical sight restrictions.defendant noted that the signage standard relied on by plaintiffs did not require a sign on the median side.
at the hearing on the motion,plaintiffs asserted that they were not required to list each and every meticulous dangerous condition in terms of whether it was median,shoulder or signage.plaintiffs claimed that the gap closure policy was applicable because a bridge with railings counted as a median barrier for measuring the size of the gap.
the superior court granted defendant motion.it found that defendant had established the reasonableness of the design,plaintiffs had failed to produce substantial evidence of loss of design immunity,and the absence of a sign was not independent because it was part of the design.judgment was entered for defendant,and plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.

standard of review 
appellate review of a ruling on a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion is de novo.brassinga city of mountain view th,d.the purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there are no triable issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.aguilar at,d.the moving party also bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.id.at,d.a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.aguilar at,d.
existence of design immunity 
except as provided by statute,a public entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the plaintiff establishes that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the injury,that the injury was proximately c
