burlington northern and santa fe railway company bnsf petitions for review of the decision of the surface transportation board vacating the rate prescription governing its transportation of coal from the rawhide coal mine in the powder river basin of wyoming to a electric generating station owned and operated by intervenor aep texas north company aep texas.utils.burlington santa fe ry,wl,decision.bnsf contends that the board contravened congress policy of minimizing federal regulation of the railroad industry in two ways first,by granting aep texas motion to vacate the rate prescription without requiring the shipper to satisfy the evidentiary requirements for reopening under the interstate commerce commission termination act of the act,c,and second,by endorsing disparate treatment of shippers and carriers seeking to vacate a rate prescription.we reject aep texas challenge to bnsf standing,and hold that the board explanation for disparate treatment of shippers and carriers bound by the same rate prescription is arbitrary and capricious.accordingly,we grant the petition,vacate the decision,and remand the case to the board.
under the act,a railroad ordinarily may establish any rate it chooses for the transportation it provides,provided it does not discriminate against connecting lines.see c.however,where a railroad has market dominance over the transportation to which a particular rate applies,its rate must be reasonable.id.d see id.a.a carrier is conclusively presumed not to have market dominance where it shows that the revenues produced by the rate are less than the statutory floor for regulatory intervention percent of the carrier variable cost of providing the transportation.id.d a.even where a carrier has market dominance,the board may not examine the reasonableness of the carrier rate except upon complaint filed by an affected shipper.see id.b.

the underlying dispute involves aep texas challenge to bnsf tariff for transporting coal from the rawhide mine to the oklaunion generating station after the expiration of the parties rail transportation contract in.the background to the current appeal appears in burlington surface transp.see also burlington surface transp.in,responding to aep texas predecessor challenge,the board found that bnsf rate was excessively high,and based on a sac analysis covering to prescribed the maximum reasonable rate level at percent of bnsf variable cost of providing service.utils.burlington,wl,west texas i.the rawhide mine closed in.for several years thereafter,bnsf voluntarily charged aep predecessor the rawhide rate for traffic from its other mines.then,in june,bnsf announced its intention to increase the rate from mines.utils.burlington,wl.aep texas predecessor objected,arguing the rawhide prescription applied more broadly to other mines in the powder river basin.id.at.the board disagreed but stated it would consider supplemental evidence and reopen the proceeding to receive evidence concerning other mines.id.at.
when the rawhide mine reopened in,bnsf sought clarification of the west texas i rate prescription,requesting the board rule,in light of the fact that the sac rate no longer fell below the regulatory floor,that bnsf was entitled to charge the higher of the sac rate or the regulatory floor.the board obliged,observing that while the analysis in west texas i showed that the sac rate initially fell below the jurisdictional threshold,it should have been clear that the rate might exceed that threshold in future years,and therefore the board should have prescribed a maximum reasonable rate at the higher of the sac rate or the statutory jurisdictional rate threshold,as the board had done in subsequent proceedings.util.burlington santa fe ry,wl,may,west texas ii.the board rejected the argument by the shipper that it first should have the opportunity to the sac rate,explaining that to reopen the proceedings based on new evidence or substantially changed circumstances,the shipper would need to file an appropriate petition for reopening.id.two months after denying reconsideration.utils.burlington,wl,the board clarified that the invitation to submit evidence of substantially changed circumstances should not be construed as allowing a change in the fundamental assumptions upon which the original sac analysis was based.utils.burlington santa fe ry,wl,july,west texas iii.the board instructed that 
if a shipper wishes to establish a current maximum reasonable rate using a sac analysis that is based on different assumptions than originally used,its recourse is to have the rate prescription vacated,allow the railroad to establish a new common carrier rate,and then file a complaint challenging the railroad new rate.
id.at.the board added this limitation is necessary to achieve a proper balance between the interests of fairness to all parties and of administrative finality and repose.id.citing.pub.serv.atchison,wl.
thereafter,on august and september,respectively,aep texas filed a new rate complaint and a petition to vacate the rate prescription to enable bnsf to establish a new common carrier rate which,if necessary,aep texas could then challenge and seek reparations,which it subsequently did.on march,the board granted aep texas petition and vacated the rate prescription.decision,wl at.the board stated 
as the proponent and beneficiary of the rate prescription,the complaining shipper should be entitled to have that prescription vacated upon request,without having to show that the prescription is now defective.this policy is appropriate to ensure that a captive shipper who prevails on its rate complaint in the first instance does not later end up in a worse having to bear a higher rate than would be justified under a new sac if it had not earlier challenged the rate or had been unsuccessful in its earlier challenge.this is a particular concern given the long period of time covered by a sac analysis usually looking forward years and any resulting rate prescription.the economic and regulatory conditions reflected in the sac analysis can change significantly over that time period.the rate prescription,which was imposed to protect the captive shipper from unreasonably high rates,should not become the source of a rate that would now be considered unreasonable under a sac analysis.
id.at.the board rejected bnsf concern that it would be subject to repetitive rate litigation over the same traffic,stating that nothing prevents an unsuccessful complainant from pursuing a new complaint immediately,and nothing binds that shipper to its prior evidentiary presentation.id.the board also observed that while the carrier is restored to rate setting freedom,the shipper has relinquished the benefits of a prior rate prescription,must take service under the new rate established by the carrier,and bears the risk that a new rate complaint may be unsuccessful.id.bnsf petitions for
