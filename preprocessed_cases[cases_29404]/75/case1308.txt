the texas department of transportation txdot destroyed a portion of jones road in the city of sunset valley when it expanded state highway.to regain the vital transportation link lost in the expansion,the city constructed a substitute street.we must decide whether the city can recover the cost of that construction from txdot under section a of the texas transportation code,the common law of nuisance,or article i,section of the texas constitution.we hold that it can not because section a does not waive txdot immunity from suit,nor is the city a state agency within the statute purview absent an applicable waiver,txdot retained immunity from the city nuisance claim and txdot can not be liable for an unconstitutional taking because the state owns the property that was appropriated for highway expansion.we also hold that the city mayor and a council member lack standing to assert claims on their own behalf or on behalf of the city residents.finally,we hold that the mayor individual nuisance claim does not rise to the level of a constitutional taking and is thus barred by sovereign immunity.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment for txdot.
background 
in,txdot expanded state highway to create a highway.the expansion extended to parts of the city of sunset valley,a municipality approximately one square mile in size located in southwest travis county.to complete the project,txdot closed jones road at its western intersection with brodie lane.jones road was a main thoroughfare that connected the city center to the northern,western,and southwestern portions of the city.according to the city,the road closure increased threefold the travel time across the city,significantly impacting the city ability to combat crime and respond to police and other emergencies.to remedy the problem,the city constructed a substitute road at its own expense.
in may,the city sued txdot to recover its costs in constructing the substitute road.the city asserted several liability theories,including a right of reimbursement under section a of the texas transportation code,an unconstitutional taking under article i,section of the texas constitution,and nuisance and trespass.txdot filed a plea to the jurisdiction asserting sovereign immunity and challenging the plaintiffs standing,which the trial court denied.on interlocutory appeal,the court of appeals affirmed.on remand,the city mayor,terrance cowan,and one of its council members,donald hurwitz,intervened in the suit on behalf of sunset valley citizens claiming txdot had violated their rights by failing to post adequate highway signs like those present in other similar municipalities and by installing floodlights not used on other highways.mayor cowan also asserted individual nuisance claims for injuries that he alleged were particular to his property.the trial court held txdot liable to the city for the cost of constructing reasonably necessary substitute facilities,and awarded the city approximately in interest and attorneys fees.the trial court also granted injunctive relief on the intervenors claims,abating the floodlights and ordering txdot to post adequate signs.it also awarded cowan and hurwitz in attorneys fees.finally,the trial court awarded cowan in damages,as well as injunctive relief,based on his individual nuisance claim.
the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment in part and reversed in part.it held that section a of the texas transportation code supported the city right to recover,but concluded that the statutory scheme required the texas general land office to determine the amount of compensation that should be awarded and remanded the case accordingly.id.at.because it upheld the judgment based on the statutory claim,the court of appeals did not address the city alternative constitutional or claims.id.in all other respects,the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment.id.we granted review to consider the plaintiffs respective claims arising out of txdot highway expansion and the closure of jones road.
ii.texas transportation code 
state agencies like txdot are immune from liability in texas unless the legislature waives that immunity.see fed.sign,duhart state.we have long recognized the legislature exclusive power to create a cause of action that waives the state immunity.see.dep t of transp.jones.but sovereign immunity is waived only when the legislature has clearly and unambiguously expressed that intent.see kerrville state hosp.fernandez,see also.gov t code codifying standard for immunity waiver a statute shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity unless the waiver is effected by clear and unambiguous language.
the city claims that the legislature waived txdot sovereign immunity in section a of the texas transportation code,which provides 
if the acquisition of real property,property rights,or material by the department from a state agency under this subchapter will deprive the agency of a thing of value to the agency in the exercise of its functions,adequate compensation for the real property,property rights,or material shall be made.
transp.code a.the city contends this provision clearly and unambiguously provides a judicial right of recovery against txdot for property that it appropriated in closing jones road.the court of appeals agreed,holding that the city is a state agency entitled to compensation under the statute.at.
txdot claims that in enacting section a the legislature did not intend to create a statutory cause of action for which the state may be sued,but merely intended to establish a mechanism by which state agencies may be compensated if txdot uses their property in exercising powers conferred under chapter.txdot further argues that,even if section a does create a right of action,the city is not a state agency as defined in the statute.see.transp.code defining state agency as a department or agency of this state.we agree with txdot on both points 
our primary objective when construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature intent.see mcintyre ramirez,citing.dep t of transp.needham.in discerning that intent,we begin with the plain and common meaning of the statute words.id.quoting state ex rel.state dep t of highways pub.transp.gonzalez,quoting fitzgerald advanced spine fixation.we must read the statute as a whole and not just isolated portions.see city of san antonio city of boerne,citing gonzalez,at.if the statutory language is unambiguous,we must interpret it according to its terms,giving meaning to the language consistent with other provisions in the statute.see mcintyre,at.we also consider the objective the law seeks to obtain and the consequences of a particular construction.gov t code,see also mcintyre,at.
nothing in the plain language of section indicates the legislature intended to waive immunity in situations like the one presented.the statute provides that when the state acquires property from a state agency pursuant to its chapter powers,it must make adequate compensation.transp.code a.the statute then outlines the actual accounting procedures by which compensation is to be accomplished.see id.b e.for example,subsection b states that compensation will be paid on vouchers,and subsection c indicates to which budget item compensation shall be credited.subsection d concerns situations in which it is unclear which appropriation item or agency account is to be credited.finally,subsection e provides that the general land office will determine appropriate compensation if the agency and txdot can not agree on an amount.nowhere does the statute expressly waive txdot immunity.that the statute imposes a financial obligation on the state does not in itself mean that the legislature intended to create a private right of action,as evidenced by the fact that the statute expressly vests the power to determine adequate compensation in the general land office.id.e.in deciding whether the legislature intended to waive txdot immunity,we must look at whether the statute makes any sense if immunity is not waived.kerrville state,at.clearly section does,in that it provides a mechanism by which state agencies may ensure budgetary protection when property is transferred between them.
moreover,the city is not a state agency within section a purview.the court of appeals determined that it was,relying on our decision in proctor andrews.but that reliance is misplaced.in proctor,we addressed whether a provision of the civil service act that allowed police officers and fire fighters who had been suspended,passed over for promotion,or recommended for demotion to appeal to an independent hearing examiner was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority or impermissibly infringed on a city governmental authority to direct,control,and discipline its civil servants.id.at.presuming that the delegation did in fact infringe upon the city police powers,we held that the infringement was permissible if the legislature by general law clearly intended it.id.at.concluding that the legislature did so intend,we made the following statement that the court of appeals in this case relied on municipal corporations including home rule cities are created for the exercise of certain functions of government i n so far as their character is governmental,they are agencies of the state,and subject to state control.id.at alteration in original quoting yett cook.thus,we described the relationship that exists between the state and a political subdivision in exercising certain governmental powers.see also payne massey,municipalities are creatures of our law and are created as political subdivisions of the state as a convenient agency for the exercise of such powers as are conferred upon them by the state.guard armory bd.mcgraw,in its governmental capacity a city is a political subdivision of the state,and in many instances is considered as an agent of the state and the state may use such agent in the discharge of its duties.
that a municipality may exercise governmental powers as an agent of the state for certain purposes does not mean that it is a state agency within section a meaning.when used in this context,we have long recognized a distinction between agencies of the state,which generally exercise statewide jurisdiction,and political subdivisions like municipalities,which have limited geographic jurisdiction.see monsanto cornerstones mun.util,a political subdivision differs from a n agency of the state.a political subdivision has jurisdiction over a portion of the state a n agency of the state exercises its jurisdiction throughout the state t he legislature has consistently recognized these distinctions between agencies on the one hand and political subdivisions on the other.chapter itself reflects that the legislature recognized a distinction between a state agency,a political subdivision,and a municipality.section provides that a commission order under section supersedes a conflicting rule or ordinance of a state agency or subdivision of this state or any county or municipality.transp.code.yet the legislature did not include a political subdivision,county,or municipality in the definition of a state agency.id.we see nothing in the statutory language that would support the broad meaning that the city ascribes to the term state agency in section a.
because nothing in the statutory language indicates that the legislature intended to waive immunity by creating a private right of action for entities like the city,we hold that it can not seek compensation thereunder for txdot closure of jones road.
iii.nuisance 
the city nuisance claim is similarly foreclosed.see city of dallas jennings.txdot is immune from liability for its governmental actions unless that immunity is waived.id.at.txdot expansion of the state highways is a governmental function.civ.prac.a.therefore,txdot can not be liable for damage resulting from its expansion of state highway without a clear waiver of immunity.as we have said,the city reliance on section a of the texas transportation code to establish that waiver is misplaced,and the city has asserted no other basis to support a waiver.accordingly,txdot retained immunity from the city nuisance claim.the only claim the city could potentially assert against txdot,then,is for an unconstitutional taking under article i,section of the texas constitution,to which we now turn.
iv.unconstitutional taking 
article i,section of the texas constitution provides no person property shall be taken,damaged or destroyed for or applied to public use without adequate compensation being made,unless by the consent of such person.const.art.i.the city claims that it is entitled to recover its cost of constructing a substitute road under this constitutional provision.txdot argues that,as against the state,the city has no proprietary title or vested property right in jones road sufficient to confer a right to compensation.because the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment based on the statutory claim,it did not address the city constitutional claim.at.whether there has been a taking is a question of law for the court to decide.see tarrant reg l water dist.gragg,wl.
it is fundamental that,to recover under the constitutional takings clause,one must first demonstrate an ownership interest in the property taken.const.art.i,no person property shall be taken.the city relies upon its fee simple title to jones road to support its right to compensation under the takings clause.txdot,on the other hand,contends the city merely holds the road in trust with legal title belonging to the state.as a result,txdot claims,the city takings claim fails as a matter of law.we agree.
this court has consistently recognized that the state has a superior ownership interest in its public roads.see state hale,robbins limestone county,travis county trogden.we have also recognized that the state ownership interest in its roads is superior to that of its political subdivisions.see robbins,at.in robbins,the county argued that a recently enacted statute allowing the state to place public roads under the state highway department direct control resulted in an unconstitutional taking because the roads were built with funds raised by local taxation.id.in response to questions certified by the court of civil appeals,we held that there could be no taking because the legislature has sole and exclusive power pertaining to public roads and highways which may only be modified by another constitutional provision.id.the county argued,as does the city here,that it was entitled to compensation under the constitution because it held legal title to the roads taken.id.we disagreed,stating that,even though legal title was taken in the county name,title was held for the benefit of the state and the general public.id.we specifically said public roads are state property over which the state has full control and authority.see also city of mission popplewell,the city controls the streets as trustee for the public.it has no proprietary title nor right to exclusive possession.
the city attempts to distinguish robbins and the cases upon which it relies,claiming that they involved control over road maintenance rather than outright destruction or closure as presented here.once jones road was closed and ceased operating as a public road,the city argues,it was no longer held for the benefit of the public,thus entitling the city to compensation.we are not persuaded.the state right to control its roads includes the right to close them,and we see nothing in the cases the city cites that would support the distinction it seeks to draw neither do factual differences among those cases undermine their fundamental the state has a superior ownership interest in its roads.
this does not mean,however,that municipalities have no possessory interest in their roads.municipalities like the city of sunset valley are political subdivisions created by the state and,as such,possess those powers and privileges that the state expressly confers upon them.see payne,at.as the state agent or trustee,a municipality does possess a superior interest in its public roads private citizens.see popplewell,at.thus,we have said that the legislature may grant cities and towns exclusive dominion over the public ways within their corporate or municipal boundaries.s
