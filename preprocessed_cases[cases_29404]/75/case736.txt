the air line pilots association alpa petitions this court to review a final decision and order of the national labor relations board the board or nlrb.the nlrb petitions for enforcement of its order.abx air,the charging party before the nlrb,intervenes in this appeal as a matter of right.
the nlrb complaint against alpa alleged that,by attempting to enforce certain provisions of a collective bargaining agreement with dhl airways,alpa had committed unfair labor practices.after a hearing,an administrative law judge alj ruled that alpa had violated the national labor relations act nlra,et,and ordered alpa to take remedial action.alpa filed exceptions to the alj decision.the nlrb issued a decision and order,likewise finding that alpa conduct violated the national labor relations act and adopting the alj order.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to e and f.for the reasons stated below,we will grant alpa petition for review and deny the board for enforcement.
factual and procedural background 
alpa was certified by the national mediation board as the representative of the dhl airways pilots in,pursuant to the railway labor act rla,et.at that time,dhl airways was a subsidiary of a holding company that we will refer to as dhl holdings.the principal business of the dhl holdings network is the rapid pickup,sorting,and carriage on a basis of documents,small parcels,and other freight.
alpa is the oldest and largest labor organization in the united states,representing airline pilots covered by the railway labor act.alpa national membership includes over pilots.at the time of the present dispute,alpa represented approximately seventeen pilots of ross aviation.it is undisputed that because the ross aviation pilots are covered by the national labor relations act,alpa is considered a labor organization within the meaning of the act.
alpa and dhl airways entered into a collective bargaining agreement in.the scope clause of that agreement provides,in part,that all present and future flying performed on dhl airways behalf shall be performed by dhl airways pilots and that it is dhl airways intent to handle permanent increases in volume through the acquisition of additional airlift capacity rather than subcontracting,and to use dhl airways pilots to the maximum extent possible.dhl holdings subsequently agreed in a side letter agreement that it and any of its successors would be bound by the scope clause.
restructuring of the dhl entities 
the dhl network restructured its operations in both march and july.the march restructuring was necessary because a foreign entity dhl international,wanted to acquire majority ownership of the dhl holdings network.law requires that a minimum of percent of the voting power of a airline be held by citizens,that the president and at least of the board of directors and other managing officers be citizens,and that the airline be under the actual control of citizens.a.thus,in march,dhl holdings transferred the ground operations of dhl airways to a new,dhl holdings subsidiary called dhl worldwide express,dhl worldwide.dhl airways was left with only the assets related to the air operations.in light of the ownership restrictions,a majority of the voting and equity interest in dhl airways was sold to a citizen.
dhl holdings,dhl worldwide,and dhl airways entered into contractual arrangements with each other that enabled the air and ground network to be operated just as it had prior to the restructuring.the dhl airways air operations personnel remained employees of dhl airways and continued to perform roughly the same work that they had previously performed.
dhl holdings sold its remaining shares of dhl airways on july.following the sale,dhl airways was by a group of independent investors,one of whom was its chief executive.the new owners changed dhl airways name to astar air cargo.on july,astar and dhl worldwide entered into a new aircraft,maintenance and insurance agreement with respect to the provision of freight services.
meanwhile,in march,the parent company of dhl holdings announced an agreement to merge with airborne.airborne was similarly engaged in the business of delivery of documents,small packages,and other freight.airborne had its own flying subsidiary,abx.abx pilots are represented by the teamsters and governed by the railway labor act.when the merger was completed on august,abx became an independent company and airborne,consisting only of ground operations,became a subsidiary of dhl holdings.abx entered into its own aircraft,maintenance and insurance agreement with airborne.
the abx pilots serve more cities,serve different cities,fly different machinery,and handle considerably more volume than astar pilots.abx pilots use a hub system,with wilmington,ohio,as the primary hub.astar pilots do not have a regional hub system.the abx pilots serve over different markets,while the astar pilots serve only about.the abx pilots fly different airplanes than the astar pilots because the abx airplanes are specifically configured for a different type of container on which abx holds a patent than that used by astar and others in the freight transportation industry.the loading of the abx containers requires a unique conveyer belt system also covered by an abx patent.the abx pilots typically fly crews,whereas the astar aircraft require crews.abx pilots transport about million pounds of cargo a day,while astar handles only about pounds.finally,astar pilots have category i certifications,whereas abx pilots have category ii and iii certifications,which enable them to land under weather conditions with more limited visibility.
alpa efforts to enforce the collective bargaining agreement 
on june,prior to completion of the airborne merger,alpa sent dhl holdings a letter asserting that the flying generated by the former airborne operations would be subject to the scope provisions of the dhl airways now astar collective bargaining agreement.representatives from alpa and the dhl holdings network met to discuss the matter on august.at the conclusion of the meeting,alpa submitted a grievance against dhl holdings and dhl worldwide,alleging violations of the collective bargaining agreement and requesting expedited arbitration as required by the agreement.
dhl holdings then filed an action against alpa in the district court for the southern district of new york.dhl holdings sought a declaratory judgment that the collective bargaining agreement did not require that astar perform future flying on behalf of airborne.in the alternative,dhl holdings sought an order that alpa claim over the airborne work was a representation dispute within the exclusive jurisdiction of the national mediation board under the railway labor act.alpa filed an answer and counterclaim,contesting the allegations and requesting that the district court compel dhl holdings to submit the underlying dispute to arbitration,declare that the collective bargaining agreement was in full force and effect,and restrain dhl holdings from implementing any agreement with abx pursuant to which any flying on behalf of dhl airways or its subsidiaries would be performed by pilots.
on september,abx filed a charge with the nlrb against alpa alleging that,by filing the grievance and attempting to force dhl holdings not to do business with abx,alpa had violated the national labor relations act.the district court action was stayed pending resolution of abx charge.
the nlrb issued a formal complaint against alpa on december.the complaint alleged that alpa filing of the counterclaim as well as the grievance violated the secondary boycott provisions of the national labor relations act.alpa countered that the nlrb did not have jurisdiction over the dispute,arguing in part that the present dispute was a railway labor act dispute and that,under the supreme court holding in brotherhood of railroad trainmen jacksonville terminal,d,the national labor relations act did not apply the railway labor act did alpa also argued that it had not violated the secondary boycott provisions of the national labor relations act.
an administrative law judge alj held a hearing on the nlrb complaint against alpa on march and.in a july,decis
