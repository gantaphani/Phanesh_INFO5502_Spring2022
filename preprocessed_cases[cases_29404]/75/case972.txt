the petitioners challenge a final rule final rule or rule of the federal aviation administration faa which amends its drug and alcohol testing regulations,promulgated pursuant to a,to expressly mandate that air carriers require drug and alcohol tests of all employees of its employees of subcontractors at any perform functions such as aircraft maintenance.antidrug and alcohol misuse prevention programs for personnel engaged in specified aviation activities.the petitioners challenge the rule on the grounds that it impermissibly expands the scope of employees tested in violation of the unambiguous statutory language of section a,the administrative procedure act,and the fourth and fifth amendments to the united states constitution.in addition,they challenge the faa conclusion that it was not required to conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis under the regulatory flexibility act rfa because the rule does not have a significant adverse effect on small entities.for the reasons set forth below,we uphold the substance of the rule but reject the faa rfa determination.
the faa first promulgated drug testing regulations in pursuant to the congress general directive in app.a that the secretary of transportation promote safety of flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing reasonable rules and regulations,or minimum standards.see program for personnel engaged in specified aviation activities,rule the rule required that each employer test each of its employees who performs one of eight enumerated sensitive safety or functions,and defined employee as a person who performs,either directly or by contract any of the enumerated functions,pt,app.i ii.
in the congress enacted the omnibus transportation employee testing act omnibus act,which for the first time expressly directed the faa to promulgate alcohol and drug testing regulations 
the administrator shall,in the interest of aviation safety,prescribe regulations within months after october.such regulations shall establish a program which requires air carriers and foreign air carriers to conduct preemployment,reasonable suspicion,random,and testing of airmen,crewmembers,airport security screening contract personnel,and other air carrier employees responsible for functions as determined by the administrator for use,in violation of law or federal regulation,of alcohol or a controlled substance.the administrator may also prescribe regulations,as the administrator considers appropriate in the interest of safety,for the conduct of periodic recurring testing of such employees for such use in violation of law or federal regulation.

on february,the faa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking to revise its drug and its alcohol testing regulations.antidrug and alcohol misuse prevention programs for personnel engaged in specified aviation activities,nprm.significantly,the nprm proposed to amend the definition of a covered employee subject to testing as e ach employee who performs a function listed in this section directly or by contract including by subcontract at any tier for an employer.at drugs proposed to be codified at pt,app.i iii,alcohol proposed to be codified at pt,app.j ii emphasis added.the faa explained that it proposed including the italicized language to clarify that each person who performs a function directly or by any tier of a contract for an employer is subject to testing.at emphasis added.the faa maintained that the added language did not work a substantive change because the current rule language states that anyone who performs a function directly or by contract must be tested and t he regulations have always required that any person actually performing a function be tested,and we are proposing to clarify that performance by contract means performance under any tier of a contract.id.at.the faa further explained that it believed the clarification necessary because of conflicting guidance provided by the faa.id the nprm requested comment on its proposal to clarify this subject.id.at.
in early,after receiving a substantial number of critical comments,the faa issued a final rule in which it announced that,i n order to gather more information on the concerns expressed by the commenters,it was not adopting the proposed revision in th e final rule but would be publishing a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking snprm in the near future.antidrug and alcohol misuse prevention programs for personnel engaged in specified aviation activities.
on may,the faa published the snprm,addressing the subcontractor issue at length and responding to comments it had received.antidrug and alcohol misuse prevention programs for personnel engaged in specified aviation activities.may.the snprm again proposed adding the subcontract at any tier language and reopened the subject for public comment.
the final rule,issued january,amended the testing regulations,as proposed in the nprm and the snprm,to require testing employees who perform the listed functions directly or by contract including by subcontract at any tier.antidrug and alcohol misuse prevention programs for personnel engaged in specified aviation activities.in addition,the faa certified that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and that it was therefore not required to conduct an rfa analysis.at.
the petitioners filed petitions for review on march and march.
the petitioners challenge the final rule on four grounds.we address each ground separately.
statutory authority 
first,the petitioners assert that the scope of employee testing expressly required under the final employees of subcontractors at any tier exceeds the faa statutory authority under the omnibus act.we review the faa interpretation of the statutory language under the familiar framework of chevron natural resources defense council,d.under chevron,we ask first whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue if it has,that is the end of the matter and the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.the omnibus act directed the faa to establish regulations requiring testing of airmen,crewmembers,airport security screening contract personnel,and other air carrier employees responsible for functions as determined by the administrator.stat.at.we conclude that the statutory language is ambiguous as to whether the testing requirement applies to employees of all subcontractors,at whatever tier,and that the faa reasonably construed the statute under the second step of chevron to determine that it does.
other air carrier employees 
first,the faa reasonably concluded that the phrase other air carrier employees can include employees of an air carrier contractors as well as its direct employees.although not perhaps its most common meaning,employee can be used to refer to an employee of a contractor as well as to an employer direct employee.see.metro.area transit auth.johnson,d while word employee denotes a contractual relationship and a contractor never is contractually bound to the employees of a subcontractor,general contractor and its subcontractor employees were held to be employer and employees under section a of longshoremen and harbor workers compensation act,a,based on statute language and history internal quotation omitted.indeed,the language of the omnibus act indicates the congress may have intended that employee have just such an expansive meaning.on its face,the omnibus act as initially enacted expressly required testing employees of certain contractors in addition to direct employees,namely,airport security screening contract personnel.stat.at emphasis added.further,the phrase and other air carrier employees,immediately following the list of the three specifically enumerated testing categories,suggests that the congress considered airport security screening contract personnel to be employees just as it did the other two listed classes airmen and crewmembers id.emphasis added.else the word other,used in the sense of more or additional,see webster third new int l dictionary,would have been entirely inappropriate.see also,at may,groups of employees required to be covered by the new testing programs include airmen,crew members,and airport security screening contract personnel emphases added.the juxtaposition of the statutory terms likewise suggests that the class of other air carrier employees subject to testing can be read to include other contractors point the petitioners do not dispute.see pet rs br.at a person need not be on an air carrier payroll to qualify as an air carrier employee.the industry,for example,has long accepted that employees of certificated repair stations may meet this description.they do,however,vigorously contest that the phrase includes employees of all subcontractors at whatever tier,whether or not certificated,contending instead that the phrase can not reasonably embrace employees of noncertificated subcontractors.before addressing their argument,we provide some background on the faa certificated maintenance program.
as the petitioners explain,air carriers routinely contract with repair stations that are certificated under ch.i,subch.h,pt.pet rs br.at.a part repair station is authorized to p erform maintenance,preventive maintenance,or alterations on aviation components or to a rrange for another person,that is,a subcontractor,whether certificated or not,to perform the maintenance.a if the subcontractor is not certificated,the certificated repair station must ensure that the noncertificated person follows a quality control system equivalent to the system followed by the certificated repair station,id.a,and must approve the aviation component for return to service,see id,b a certificated repair station may contract a maintenance function pertaining to an article to a noncertificated person provided the noncertificated person follows a quality control system equivalent to the system followed by the certificated repair station the certificated repair station remains directly in charge of the work performed by the noncertificated person and the certificated repair station verifies,by test inspection,that the work has been performed satisfactorily by the noncertificated person and that the article is airworthy before approving it for return to service.with this background,we first address the faa interpretation of the statutory language as extending to employees of subcontractors generally,then consider the petitioners objection to employees of noncertificated subcontractors in particular.
first,as to employees of subcontractors generally,having concluded that the statute itself expressly contemplates testing certain contractors employees airport security screening contract personnel and that the statutory phrase other air carrier employees may include contractors employees,we see nothing in the statutory language that prevents the faa from also treating a sub contractor employees as statutory employees of air carriers.the omnibus act itself does not mention subcontractors and we believe the faa,under chevron step,reasonably included subcontractors among the contractors whose employees are other air carrier employees subject to testing.the faa soundly reasoned that it is important that individuals who perform any function be subject to drug and alcohol testing under the faa regulations and that to conclude otherwise would be inconsistent with aviation safety.final rule.at.
as for employees of noncertificated subcontractors in particular,we believe that they too may be reasonably treated as other air carrier employees and thus subject to mandatory testing under the omnibus act.the petitioners do not object to the faa requiring drug and alcohol testing of certificated subcontractors employees,noting that the aviation industry has long accepted that employees of certificated repair stations may meet this description because they work in the aviation industry,deal directly and routinely with air carriers,are heavily regulated by the faa,and like an air carrier own specially licensed employees are involved in the critical function of making airworthiness determinations,pet rs br.at.they insist,however,that employees of noncertificated subcontractors may not be considered air carrier employees subject to mandatory testing and they offer what may well be a valid ground for treating certificated and subcontractors differently,namely,that f or certificated entities,drug and alcohol testing logically operates as part and parcel of an program of government supervision so that the certificated because it chooses to be be seen as acting as an alter ego of the air carrier,so that its workers can be fairly characterized as air carrier employees.id.at.this distinction,however,is not mandated by the language of section a which says nothing about certification vel non.what section a does require is that the faa administrator determine those functions performed by other than airmen,crewmembers,and airport security screening contract personnel subject to drug and alcohol testing and the faa has consistently and reasonably included aircraft maintenance work among such functions.see alcohol rule.at including aircraft maintenance or preventive maintenance duties among duties drug rule.at same rule.at including maintenance or preventive maintenance among sensitive safety or duties subject to drug testing.it is not unreasonable,then,to construe the statute,as the faa does,to require testing of maintenance employees,certificated or not,in order to ensure that all maintenance work,by whomever performed,is done properly and that each aviation component is safe for aviation use.in the faa view,it would be inconsistent with aviation safety for individuals performing maintenance work within the certificated repair station to be subject to drug and alcohol testing,while individuals performing the same maintenance work under a subcontract would not be subject to drug and alcohol testing.at.the petitioners nonetheless cite four principles of statutory interpretation,pet rs br.at,which,they contend,undermine the faa interpretation.we find none of them compelling.
the petitioners first assert the faa interpretation would offend the basic principle that statutes must be harmonized because it runs headlong into a robust congressional policy of promoting the nation small businesses.pet rs br.at quoting cjs statutes citing a it is the declared policy of the congress that the government should aid,counsel,assist,and protect,insofar as is possible,the interests of concerns.we note no disharmony in the faa regulation.the congress has provided a specific statutory procedure under the rfa to ensure that agencies shall endeavor,consistent with the objectives of the rule and of applicable statutes,to fit regulatory and informational requirements to the scale of the businesses,organizations,and governmental jurisdictions subject to regulation.rfa,b,stat.this is the procedure which the congress mandated to harmonize the express interest advanced in the omnibus act testing provisions the interest of aviation safety,a with the concerns of small businesses.if the faa properly follows the procedure in its matter we address infra part discharges its responsibility in this regard.
the petitioners next assert the faa interpretation will impermissibly imping e upon important state interests,pet rs br.at quoting bfp resolution trust,d,because extension of the federal government testing regime to noncertificated subcontractors necessarily will disrupt state choices about both i the privacy interests of local employees and ii the business prerogatives of local employers,id.state statutory citations omitted.this argument fails,however,because the omnibus act expressly preempts state drug testing laws.see a a state or local government may not prescribe,issue,or continue in effect a law,regulation,standard,or order that is inconsistent with regulations prescribed under this chapter.
third,the petitioners contend that the faa interpretation would violate the rule that a statute must be construed,if fairly possible,so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score,relying on its contention that the final rule violates the fourth amendment.pet rs br.at quoting united states,d.as our discussion below reveals,however,the petitioners fourth amendment challenge offers no grave concerns about the final rule constitutionality.see infra part.
finally,the petitioners assert the faa interpretation ignores the context of the,the major legal and political concerns that widespread drug testing of employees might raise,pet rs br.at the congress own admonition that the administrator be very selective in extending the coverage of this provision to other categories of air carrier and faa employees and that the statute should not be treated as an open authorization to test all aviation industry employees,at may.in the quoted report,however,the congress singled out mechanics as among the employees required to be tested a s defined in statute and regulation.id.at.and nowhere does the legislative history distinguish between mechanics employed by certificated subcontractors and those employed by noncertificated subcontractors.
employees responsible for functions 
second,the petitioners assert that the faa exceeded its statutory authority because noncertificated subcontractors employees are not employees responsible for functions as required under section a.they argue that under faa regulations,if a certificated repair station has used a noncertificated subcontractor,only the certificated repair station is responsible for the safety aspects of the subcontractor work.pet rs br.at citing b,requiring certificated repair station to verify satisfactory performance of subcontracted noncertificated work and airworthiness of aviation component before return to service.the faa responds that responsible for as used in section a does not mean legally responsible for,as the petitioners argue,but simply the agent or cause,in this case denoting the person performing the maintenance work.faa br.at.the faa interpretation of the phrase responsible for is a permissible one.see webster third new int l dictionary defining responsible as answerable as the primary cause,motive,or agent hines blue cross blue shield of,cir the ordinary meaning of a person responsible for such injuries is the person who caused the injuries,who did the damage.because the congress expressly directed the faa administrator to determine by regulation those other air carrier employees responsible for functions,we defer to the faa interpretation.see envtl.def.epa,if congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill,we uphold agency reasonable statutory interpretation quoting chevron,at.
administrative procedure act 
next,the petitioners contend that requiring testing of maintenance employees of all subcontractors violates the apa in three respects.we disagree on all counts.
the petitioners contend the faa mischaracterization of the new regulatory language as a clarification tainted all aspects of the rulemaking process with error,pet rs br.at,and,in particular,rendered the agency notice of proposed rulemaking misleading and thus procedurally improper,id.at.there is some substance to the petitioners claim that the inclusion in the final rule of the subcontract at any tier language is more than simply a clarification,as the faa repeatedly dubbed it.see,final rule.at.the faa concedes that its own informal guidance,to which it adhered until the,took the position that employees of noncertificated subcontractors did not have to be tested.see nprm.at final rule.at and it appears that any subsequent guidance to the contrary may not have been effectively disseminated.see,snprm.at although we believe that we are merely clarifying the regulations,we recognize that,due to the previous conflicting guidance,some companies with existing programs and some contractors may have to modify their current alcohol misuse prevention and antidrug programs.thus,the additional language may more accurately be viewed as a choice between two conflicting positions than as a clarification.nonetheless,the alleged mischaracterization does not warrant overturning the final rule.the faa went out of its way to ensure that interested parties had the opportunity to participate and comment in the the point of issuing the snprm seeking additional comment,and thereby delaying issuance of a final rule,precisely because of the conflicting guidance and possible consequent confusion.see snprm.at.as a result,the entire air carrier industry,of which the petitioners are part,was well aware of the rulemaking and its substance and can not reasonably claim ignorance of the proceeding or inadequate opportunity to comment.if anything,the faa proceedings provided industry with a far greater opportunity to participate in the rulemaking than a plain vanilla proceeding.natural res.def.council,epa.thus,the parties had abundant opportunity to comment on the proposed rule and any error was harmless.id.
arbitrary and capricious standard 
the petitioners assert the final rule violates the apa proscription against arbitrary and capricious rulemaking in two respects.first,they claim the final rule is arbitrary because it is inconsistent with the faa overarching regulatory scheme for maintenance and certification.pet rs br.at.the petitioners maintain that because only certificated persons can perform maintenance under,employees of noncertificated subcontractors can not perform maintenance but only maintenance functions.but the faa regulations permit a certificated repair station to contract out maintenance work it would otherwise have performed provided the certificated entity performs an airworthiness on the work before the component is returned to service.see.the task performed by subcontractors is no less for being contracted out to another entity.
second,the petitioners contend the faa did not adequately explain the need to test all subcontractors employees.we disagree.as noted above,the faa reasonably determined it would be inconsistent with aviation safety to treat employees of certificated and noncertificated contractors differently given that they all perform the function of maintenance.at.ensuring that maintenance workers do not make errors on account of drug or alcohol use makes it less likely that such errors will compromise air safety.
the petitioners reply with four reasons they claim testing is not necessary.they first contend there is no evidence that any accident has resulted from drug or alcohol use by any worker employed by any noncertificated subcontractor.pet rs br.at.nonetheless,they acknowledge that testing has revealed drug and alcohol use in the past,and expanded testing will sometimes turn up such use among workers at the noncertificated subcontractor level.pet rs br.at.thus,it may be only a matter of time before an accident attributable to substance abuse occurs.we do not believe the faa until then.fed of fed.employees cheney,it is readily apparent that the army has a compelling safety interest in ensuring that the approximately civilians who fly and service its airplanes and helicopters are not impaired by drugs.employees in each of the covered traffic controllers,pilots,aviation mechanics and aircraft tasks that are frought with extraordinary peril a single lapse by any covered employee could have irreversible and calamitous consequences.
the petitioners second reason relates to their contention that the subcontractor testing requirement is redundant given the airworthiness review required to be performed by a certificated repair station that subcontracts a maintenance task.we do not believe,however,it is arbitrary to impose a second line of defense,involving the very employees performing the repairs,to further promote air carrier safety.see final rule.at while there might be redundancies built into the maintenance system,the supervisory and other quality assurance processes involved in aviation maintenance do not constitute a substitute for the protections afforded by drug and alcohol testing.therefore,we will continue to require subcontractors be subject to drug and alcohol testing.
the petitioners next reason that the faa should have considered alternative less restrictive forms of regulation.pet rs br.at.the supreme court,however,has made clear that the reasonableness of a particular technique does not necessarily or invariably turn on the existence of less intrusive alternatives,fed of fed.employees,at quoting skinner ry.labor executives ass n,d.
finally,the petitioners contend the final rule will have a net negative safety impact,pet rs br.at emphasis in original,because it will divert inspection resources from employees of certificated contractors and subcontractors and drive away both qualified,experienced noncertificated subcontractors and their skilled employees.the petitioners,however,offer no evidentiary support for this claim nor did so before the faa and we therefore reject it.
the petitioners also contend the faa failed to respond adequately to comments on the final rule impact on industry business costs and employees privacy costs.we conclude the faa response was adequate.
with regard to the industry costs,the petitioners rely in particular on an industry survey they submitted to the faa,along with an analysis of it by a distinguished aviation industry economist,pet rs br.at,which they claim contradicts the faa assessment that none of the commenters opposing the proposal provided specific data challenging the faa fundamental economic assumptions,final rule.at.yet immediately following the quoted statement,the final rule went on to note that t he regulatory evaluation accompanying this final rule specifically addresses the comments about costs and benefits.id.in the cited evaluation,the faa responded at length to the information the commenters submitted,finding,inter alia,that most of the survey information was not useful or credible,ja,and rebutting the expert opinions,ja.
with regard to employees privacy interests,the petitioners assert the faa ignored comments complaining that subjecting employees of all subcontractors to the testing requirements will trigger countless invasions of privacy through the administration of preemployment,and ongoing random testing,including for employees with flawless past work records and no hint of prior substance abuse.pet rs br.at.again,the faa responded,albeit succinctly t he issues regarding invasion of privacy were resolved more than years ago when the drug testing regulation carefully balanced the interests of individual privacy with the federal government duty to ensure aviation safety.the purpose of this rulemaking is not to reopen the issue of invasion of privacy.at.the petitioners respond that the final rule presents privacy concerns,pet rs br.at,but do not explain precisely what the heightened concerns are or point to comments that do so.to the extent the purported expansion of the testing class affects privacy rights,we address this issue in our fourth amendment discussion.see infra part.
constitutional challenges 
the petitioners raise two constitutional challenges to the final rule,alleging the faa violated the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the fourth amendment guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure.we reject each challenge in turn.
the petitioners first claim the final rule,insofar as it extends the testing to employees of noncertificated subcontractors,is so vague as to violate due process because it is unclear what constitutes maintenance for which testing is,in particular,where the faa draws the line between maintenance and preventive maintenance,for which testing is not required.see defining maintenance as inspection,overhaul,repair,preservation,and the replacement of parts,but exclud ing preventive maintenance.whatever uncertainty exists regarding the meaning of maintenance,however,existed,according to the petitioners,was enhanced by guidance disseminated final rule issued and is therefore not attributable to it.in any event,the court allow s greater leeway for regulations and statutes governing business activities than those implicating the first amendment no more than a reasonable degree of certainty can be demanded.throckmorton ntsb,internal quotations citations omitted.in this case,employers can clarify the term meaning as they always recourse to the written guidance which the faa routinely provides on testing issues raised by interested parties.see,ja,pet rs br.at noting guidance on meaning of maintenance issued since final rule.thus,the regulated enterprise has the ability to clarify the meaning of the regulation by its own inquiry,or by resort to the administrative process.vill.of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d.
the petitioners next contend the final rule drug testing requirement subjects employees of noncertificated subcontractors to unreasonable searches in violation of the fourth amendment.again we disagree.
in national federation of federal employees cheney,the court upheld against a fourth amendment challenge the army practice of subjecting civilian aviation maintenance personnel to compulsory,random toxicological urine testing because the army had a compelling interest in ensuring air safety given the quintessential risk of destruction to life and property posed by aviation.at.the same justification exists here.nonetheless,the petitioners offer three grounds for finding the testing program unconstitutional.
first,the petitioners assert that the employees subject to testing are ordinary citizens.the same is true,however,of the employees of certificated air carrier contractors and subcontractors and was true of the civilian employees in national federation.yet the petitioners do not suggest these groups may not constitutionally be tested.
second,the petitioners object to the expansive scope of the testing insofar as it applies to all maintenance work,all employees who participate in the work and,especially,to current employees of noncertificated subcontractors.these objections applied as well to employees of a certificated contractor or subcontractor when they first became subject to testing in the late.further,as to the first objection specifically,as indicated previously,the faa can work out through guidance and consultation with subcontractors as it has with certificated contractors and subcontractors what is and is not maintenance work.further,as to the third objection,while testing of incumbents may as a general matter require a closer relationship between the employee job and the government interest served than does testing of new applicants,see stigile clinton,willner thornburgh,the nexus between aircraft mechanical work and aviation safety is sufficient,as our decision in national federation made clear.
third,the petitioners argue,as earlier,that the additional testing simply is not needed in light of the airworthiness testing all aviation components undergo before being placed in service.pet rs br.at quoting chandler miller,d.we reject this argument here for the same reasons given earlier.see supra part.because of the quintessential risk of destruction to life and property posed by substance impaired lapses by maintenance workers at any tier,the testing is justified under national federation.
regulatory flexibility act 
last,we address the petitioners rfa challenge.under the rfa an agency required to file a notice of proposed rulemaking shall prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis,which shall describe the impact of the proposed rule on small entities.a.along with the final rule,the agency shall prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis which shall contain,inter alia,
a summary of the significant issues raised by the public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis,a summary of the assessment of the agency of such issues,and a statement of any changes made in the proposed rule as a result of such comments and 
a description of the steps the agency has taken to minimize the significant economic impact on small entities consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes,including a statement of the factual,policy,and legal reasons for selecting the alternative adopted in the final rule and why each one of the other significant alternatives to the rule considered by the agency which affect the impact on small entities was rejected.
id.a.these requirements,however,shall not apply to any proposed or final rule if the head of the agency certifies that the rule will not,if promulgated,have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.id.b.
in the nprm,the faa performed a tentative rfa analysis and counted among rfa small entities both air carriers and part repair stations but,because it was unable to determine how many of the part repair stations are considered small entities,it call ed for comments and request ed that all comments be accompanied by clear documentation.at.
in the snprm,the faa determined that the small entity group is considered to be part repair stations.at,but still unable to determine how many of the part repair stations and their subcontractors are considered small entities,concluded that m ost,if not all maintenance contractors would be considered small entities,id.based on its calculation of annualized costs of less than of annual median revenue,the faa stated it believe d that this proposed action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities but solicit ed comments on this determination,on these assumptions,on the annualized cost per company,and on their annual revenue.id.
after receiving comments,the faa took a different tack in the final rule and disagree d with commenters who raised rfa issues,asserting that contractors are not among entities regulated under the testing regulations for the purpose of the rfa.at.the faa noted that the directly regulated employers are air carriers operating under cfr parts and c operators and air traffic control facilities not operated by the faa or by or under contract to the military,who must conduct drug and alcohol testing under the faa regulations.id.for drug and alcohol testing purposes,certificated repair stations are contractors,and contractors are not regulated employers.id.citing cfr pt,app.i,ii defining employer id.app.j,i d same.accordingly,the faa concluded it was not required to conduct an rfa analysis,including considering significant alternatives,because contractors including subcontractors at any tier are not the targets of the proposed regulation,and are instead indirectly regulated entities.id.at.the petitioners contend the faa determination is incorrect.we agree with the petitioners that the contractors and subcontractors are regulated employers and that the rfa therefore requires that the faa consider the economic impact of the final rule on them.in reviewing this conclusion,we do not defer to the faa interpretation of the specifically whether contractors and subcontractors are regulated entities directly affected by the the faa does not administer the rfa.see am.trucking ass ns epa,no deference to epa or sba interpretation of rfa,modified in other respect,reversed in other respect,whitman am.trucking ass ns,d.
in making its determination,the faa relied on a line of decisions in which this court held that under the rfa the regulating agency need consider only the economic impact of agencies directly affected and regulated by the subject regulations.we find the situation here materially different from the cases the faa cites.
initially,in electric cooperative ferc,we reviewed a challenge by wholesale customers to a rule permitting utilities to recover costs and held that ferc correctly determined that it need not prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis because the regulated utilities,which were subject to the rule,were not small entities,while the wholesale customers,many of whom were small entities,were not regulated by the rule.at.we explained it is clear that congress envisioned that the relevant economic impact was the impact of compliance with the proposed rule on regulated small entities,id.at.that is,the rfa is satisfied if the agency determines the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities that are subject to the requirements of the rule.id.emphasis added.as the court noted,the congress did not intend to require that every agency consider every indirect effect that any regulation might have on small businesses in any stratum of the national economy.id.at.in,ferc was not required to consider the indirect economic effects on the wholesale customers of the utilities or on the ultimate retail consumers,neither of which was regulated by the challenged rule.
in cement kiln recycling coalition epa,our latest iteration of,environmental groups and industry representatives challenged emission standards for hazardous waste combustors.the court rejected a cement manufacturer argument that epa incorrectly confined its rfa analysis to the economic effects on the hazardous waste combustion facilities,without considering the effect on generators of hazardous waste like itself.the court explained 
epa rule regulates hazardous waste combustors,not waste generators.we explained in that the language of the statute limits its application to the small entities which will be subject to the proposed regulation that is,those small entities to which the proposed rule will apply,at quoting b first emphasis in second emphasis in original.congress did not intend to require that every agency consider every indirect effect that any regulation might have on small businesses in any stratum of the national economy.id.at.
at.the court further rejected the cement manufacturer attempt to distinguish its situation on the basis that epa actually intended to affect the conduct of hazardous waste generators by raising the cost of incineration,stating 
a pplication of the rfa does turn on whether particular entities are the targets of a given rule.the statute requires that the agency conduct the relevant analysis or certify no impact for those small businesses that are subject to the regulation,that is,those to which the regulation will apply.
id.quoting,at b.
unlike the parties claiming economic injury in the cited cases,contractors and subcontractors are directly affected and therefore regulated by the challenged regulations.it may be true that the regulations are immediately addressed to the employer air carriers which are in fact the parties certified to operate aircraft.see pt,app.i i b c making employer responsible party for ensuring drug program is conducted properly,ii definition of employer pt,app.j i b c employer responsible for alcohol testing program,i d definition of employer.nonetheless,the regulations expressly require that the employees of contractors and subcontractors be tested.see pt,apps.i iii,j ii.thus,the contractors and subcontractors at whatever tier are entities subject to the proposed regulation that is,those small entities to which the proposed rule will apply.cement kiln,at quoting,at quoting b first emphasis in cement kiln second emphasis in original.in other words,the final rule imposes responsibilities directly on the contractors and subcontractors and they are therefore parties affected by and regulated by it.the faa acknowledged as much when it advised 
if a contractor company has testing programs,it must ensure any in
