introduction 
appellant john greenwood brierton appeals the denial of his petition for a writ of mandate seeking to prevent the department of motor vehicles dmv from enforcing an april,order of suspension against him.brierton contends that the dmv suspension of his driver license under vehicle code section,subdivision a,which requires the dmv to suspend for two years the driving privileges of any person who suffers two driving offense convictions within years,violates the separation of powers doctrine because it imposes a term of suspension different from the suspension the trial court imposed in brierton criminal case.according to brierton,by allowing the dmv to suspend his license for two years the legislature has usurped the sentencing discretion of the trial court.we reject this contention and affirm the trial court denial of brierton petition for a writ of mandate.
factual and procedural backgrounda.factual.brierton july arrest 
on july,a san diego state university police department officer saw brierton accelerate his vehicle and lose traction for approximately feet.the officer stopped brierton and observed that brierton exhibited a number of symptoms indicating that he was intoxicated,including bloodshot and watery eyes,an unsteady gait,and slurred speech.the officer also detected the odor of alcohol.the officer arrested brierton for driving while intoxicated.chemical test results indicated that brierton had been driving with a blood alcohol content of percent.
after an administrative hearing in september,the dmv suspended brierton driving privilege under the administrative per se provisions of the vehicle code for driving with a prohibited blood alcohol content.
brierton october arrest 
on october,two officers from the san diego police department were walking across street when they observed brierton car approaching.officer trevor riley shined his flashlight in the direction of the car to indicate his presence,but brierton continued to drive toward the officers without slowing down.the officers had to run between parked cars to avoid being struck by brierton car.officer riley yelled for brierton to stop,but brierton failed to do so.the officer noted the car license plate number,got into his patrol car,and effected a traffic stop.
officer riley noticed that brierton had a blank stare and that he was slow to respond to instructions.brierton said he had not seen the officers in the street.brierton failed to successfully complete a series of field sobriety tests.officer riley transported brierton to san diego police department headquarters where he administered a breath test.the breath test established that brierton had been driving with a blood alcohol content of percent.
the dmv again administratively suspended brierton driving privilege under the administrative per se provisions for a period of one year,beginning january,and ending january.brierton was represented by counsel at the administrative hearing.
brierton criminal convictions 
the state criminally prosecuted brierton for both the july and the october offenses.in march,brierton pled guilty to a violation of sections,subdivision a and reckless the july incident.at the same time,brierton pled guilty to a violation of section,subdivision b for driving with a blood alcohol content of percent or greater,relating to the october incident.
as part of brierton sentence in the criminal cases,the trial court imposed fines,required brierton to complete a multiple conviction program,and ordered a license suspension for the violation of section and a license suspension for the violation of section,subdivision b.the court indicated that brierton suspensions should run concurrently with any dmv.
as part of his guilty plea,brierton signed a form entitled,dui driving under the influence addendum for each of his two convictions.paragraph of the form provides 
the department of motor vehicles dmv may consider any of my other convictions for driving under the influence or reckless driving,even those that are not charged in this proceeding,and impose a more severe license restriction,suspension,or revocation as a result of such other conviction s.
paragraph provides 
the dmv may restrict,suspend,or revoke my license under a procedure which is separate from this criminal action.the dmv action,if any,will be in addition to the court sentence and i must obey it.the dmv may not authorize a restricted license even if the court might so direct.
in addition to signing the form,brierton initialed the boxes next to paragraphs and,indicating that he had read and understood the contents of both paragraphs.
the dmv administrative suspension of brierton driving privilege as a result of his two criminal convictions 
in april,the dmv sent a letter to brierton advising him that it was administratively suspending his driving privileges for two years pursuant to section,subdivision a the letter explained that the dmv was taking this action due to brierton convictions of march,in case numbers and.it also informed brierton that after one year of the suspension,he could apply for a license that would permit him to operate vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device.
procedural background 
on may,brierton filed a petition for writ of mandate in the san diego superior court.brierton challenged the dmv april administrative suspension order.he argued that the suspension order was inconsistent with the criminal court sentencing order and was thus unconstitutional.the dmv responded,contending that an administrative suspension independent of a criminal proceeding is constitutional.the trial court denied brierton petition for a writ of mandate on august.
on august,brierton timely appealed the denial of his petition.
discussion 
brierton asserts that his suspension under former section,subdivision a,is unconstitutional because the dmv has imposed a more stringent license suspension than that imposed by the trial court.brierton contends that by granting the dmv the power to suspend his driving privilege based solely on the fact that he incurred two driving convictions,the legislature has usurped the power of the trial court to impose its sentence.he claims that t o the extent these statutes countermand the sentencing orders of the judicial officer in brierton case,they are unconstitutional infringements on the judicial power,under the separation of powers doctrine.
brierton raises questions of law,which we review de novo.alford department of motor vehicles th,d.
separation of powers 
the california constitution establishes a system of state government in which governmental power is divided among three coequal branches the legislative branch cal,art.iv,the executive branch cal,art.v,and the judicial branch cal,art.vi.the constitution provides that those charged with the exercise of one power may not exercise any other.cal,art.iii.
the separation of powers doctrine limits the authority of one of the three branches of government to arrogate to itself the core functions of another branch.citations.carmel valley fire protection dist.state of california cal th,d.however,t he doctrine recognizes that the three branches of government are interdependent,and it permits actions of one branch that may significantly affect those of another branch.citation.id.at,d.thus,the separation of powers doctrine is violated only when the actions of a branch of government defeat or materially impair the inherent functions of another branch.in re rosenkrantz cal th,d.
brierton does not dispute that he has suffered two convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol,and thus,that he falls squarely within the scope of former section,subdivision a.he also does not dispute that section,subdivision a,requires the dmv to impose a license suspension in situations such as his.he contends,however,that the dmv imposition of the mandatory suspension is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine because it usurps the trial court power to sentence him to a license suspension for his criminal convictions.he maintains that the power to sentence a criminal defendant rests solely with the judicial branch,and that the dmv conflicting suspension based solely on his criminal convictions has thwart ed the trial court penal sanction.we disagree with brierton contentions 
what brierton fails to acknowledge is that the dmv suspension of his driving privilege under section,subdivision a,is substantively distinct from any punishment a court may impose as a result of a criminal conviction.in numerous instances under provisions of california law,a criminal conviction may give rise to a variety of collateral consequences.larsen department of motor vehicles cal th,d.a conviction may have consequences outside the criminal context,and,for example,may provide a basis for the suspension or revocation of a license or other benefit that the state has granted to the convicted individual,citing,subd.a bus,subd.b.
brierton claims that the dmv order would defeat or materially impair the court exercise of its constitutional function to resolve the controversy relating to the misdemeanor charges against brierton,between the prosecutor on behalf of the people of the state of california,and brierton.brierton suggestion that the dmv mandatory suspension under section,subdivision a intrudes on the ability of the trial court to resolve the criminal charges against a defendant is simply incorrect.the dmv duty to impose a suspension pursuant to section is triggered only after the trial court has resolved the controversy between the state and the defendant.it is the fact of the represents the resolution of the criminal forms the basis of the dmv administrative duty under section.contrary to brierton suggestion on appeal,the fact that a criminal conviction may invoke collateral consequences does not mean that the administrator of those collateral consequences has in any way defeated or materially impaired the function of the court.
to the extent brierton contends that the dmv mandatory suspension thwarts the trial court discretion to sentence a defendant because it may involve a term of suspension longer than that imposed by the trial court,we disagree.the dmv suspension,imposed pursuant to section,is an administrative civil sanction that is independent of the trial court penal sanction expressed by the court criminal sentence,and serves different interests the suspension imposed by the dmv is an administrative remedy devised by the legislature,based on compelling public policy considerations.corley department of motor vehicles d.corley.the purpose of the administrative license provisions is to protect others from the possibility of the drunk driver future harmful conduct,rather than to punish him for his past offenses the thrust of the legislative concern under vehicle code section remains protection of the public from drivers whose prior conduct demonstrates they can not currently be trusted with a license to drive.pollack department of motor vehicles cal d,pollack.
courts have repeatedly noted the difference between the dmv power to impose an administrative suspension and the power of the trial courts to impose a penal sanction.see larsen department of motor vehicles,supra,cal th at,fn,d,citing multiple cases in which the dmv suspension of license is a sanction that is civil and not penal.both the court in which a person is convicted of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and the dmv have statutory powers with respect to suspension or revocation of the operator license of the person convicted.citation.as we explained in robertson department of motor vehicles th,d robertson,the legislative scheme contemplate s two involving court proceedings and criminal in nature,the other involving administrative proceedings and civil in nature and these processes are,for the most part,intended to operate independently of each other and to provide for different dispositions.mcdaniel department of motor vehicles th,d.
brierton cites to the principle that a trial court sentencing decision will not be disturbed in the absence of a clear showing that it was arbitrary or irrational,suggesting that the dmv mandatory suspension order has disturbed the sentence the trial court imposed in this case.however,the dmv suspension has not disturbed or otherwise interfered with the trial court sentencing decision.the sentence remains in effect,and that portion of the sentence suspending brierton license runs concurrently with the dmv suspension.see robertson,supra,th at,d when multiple suspensions are in effect at the same time,they will ordinarily run concurrently.the mere fact that the conditions the dmv imposed in suspending brierton license are different from the conditions of brierton criminal sentences resulting from his guilty pleas does not mean that the dmv administrative suspension conflicts with the trial court suspension or that it would in any way prevent brierton from being able to fully serve his criminal sentence.
we note that a number of courts have upheld mandatory suspensions under section in instances where a trial court has imposed a sentence different from the suspension required under section.see,pollack,supra,cal d at,baldwin department of motor vehicles th,d dmv properly revoked license of multiple offender,and despite fact that sentencing court imposed only probation and license restriction,dmv revocation of license did not violate prohibition against double jeopardy corley,supra,d at.a lthough corley was most recently sentenced as a first offender,he in fact suffered two drunk driving convictions within a period.the department has a mandatory duty to suspend his license pursuant to subdivision a of vehicle code section citation,and absolutely no power or duty to enforce the terms of his plea bargain.a writ of mandamus will not lie to compel the performance of an act where no duty exists.
in pollack,the supreme court concluded that the dmv may suspend the license of a drunk driving offender under section,subdivision a,even where the prior conviction was neither alleged nor proven during the defendant second criminal proceeding.in reaching this conclusion,the pollack court considered the relationship between the criminal sentencing provisions applicable to driving offenses and the dmv administrative duties under section.pollack argued that because the prosecution in his second criminal case failed to allege or prove his prior conviction,he was not punishable under the criminal sentencing provision as a second offender within the meaning of section,and that the dmv could not treat him as such.pollack,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.the supreme court disagreed,concluding that despite the reference to offenses punishable under the criminal sentencing provision in section,subdivision a,the dmv is required to suspend the license of a drunk driver,regardless of whether the prior conviction is alleged or proved in the criminal proceeding.pollack,supra,at.since no prior conviction was alleged or proved in the criminal proceeding,the defendant criminal sentence would have been less severe than the dmv mandatory suspension under section.the supreme court nevertheless upheld that administrative suspension.
none of these cases appears to have involved a challenge to section based on an argument that the dmv mandatory suspension violates the separation of powers doctrine.however,we have little doubt that the separation of powers issue was not raised in these cases because it is clear that the civil and criminal legislative schemes created,respectively,to protect the public from,and to impose punishment on,individuals who are convicted of multiple drunk driving offenses do not implicate separation of power concerns in vary forrest d,the court noted,while pollack deals specifically with the effect on license suspension of a prosecutor failure to plead and prove a prior conviction for driving under the influence,its reasoning is applicable to a claim that sentencing consideration or restrictions in the underlying criminal case are relevant to the department duties to suspend and revoke under section.the department duty is to suspend or revoke a license based on the fact of convictions,and not on how offenders can be,or are,sentenced in the criminal courts.
