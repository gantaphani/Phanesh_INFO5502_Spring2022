these consolidated appeals arise from the district court final judgment resolving a series of cases that were filed after a passenger train of the national railroad passenger corporation amtrak,as it moved on the railroad track of csx transportation,csx,collided with a hauler rig owned by rountree transport and rigging,rountree.the rountree vehicle had become immobilized on a railroad crossing as it attempted to transport a combustion turbine and a turbine enclosure to a power plant of the kissimmee utility authority kua near kissimmee,florida.american home assurance corporation aha,subrogee of stewart and stevenson services,commenced these appeals to challenge several district court rulings that affected its entitlement to damages flowing from the collision.the issues in this aspect of the appeal include the propriety of excluding certain evidence offered by aha to prove its damages whether transport of the combustion turbine properly was deemed an inherently dangerous work activity the propriety of reducing aha damages under the florida comparative fault statute and whether aha should have been denied prejudgment interest on its damages.we affirm the district court rulings with regard to the first,second,and fourth issues.the third issue,however,raises unsettled questions of state law which we certify to the florida supreme court for resolution.
in addition to aha appeal,kua,florida municipal power agency fmpa,and black veatch have appealed the decision by the district court that general electric company ge did not have to defend and indemnify them for the collision.we affirm the district court decision.kua and fmpa also have appealed the district court decision requiring them to defend and indemnify csx and amtrak.within this latter appeal,kua and fmpa have raised the issue of whether state law sovereign immunity shields them from being required to defend and indemnify csx and amtrak.because the sovereign immunity issue involves unsettled questions of state law,we certify the issue to the florida supreme court for review.in sum,we have decided that with respect to these consolidated appeals,we affirm in part but stay all further proceedings,pending the florida supreme court resolution of our certified questions.
background 
construction of the cane island power plant 
kua is an municipal agency created by the city of kissimmee,florida,to construct,operate,and manage the city municipal electrical utility systems.as part of its charge,kua oversaw the construction of the electrical facility known as the cane island power plant the plant near kissimmee,florida.to effectuate the construction,kua contracted with,who agreed to serve as project engineer.kua also entered into a participation agreement with fmpa,a agency organized under florida law with authority to undertake and finance electric projects.by entering into the participation agreement,fmpa acquired a ownership interest in the plant and agreed to share with kua the production costs of electricity.
in overseeing the construction,kua took steps to ensure that there would be vehicular and pedestrian access to the plant.accordingly,kua entered into a private road grade crossing agreement the crossing agreement with csx,who granted the utility a license to construct,use,and maintain a private road grade crossing over csx railroad tracks.in return for the license,kua was required under the crossing agreement to defend,indemnify,protect and save csx harmless from and against designated losses and casualties.exh.a at.the crossing agreement further mandated that kua defend and indemnify any company whose property was operated by csx at the railroad crossing.id.at.
in its oversight role,kua also contracted with ge for purchase and delivery of certain customized power generation equipment,including a combustion turbine.kua and ge entered into a turbine purchasing agreement the purchasing agreement,which included an indemnification provision under which ge promised to defend and indemnify kua,its agents,and to the extent of and on account of any negligent act or omission of ge in performing the work under the contract.exh.a at gc.
upon entering into the purchasing agreement,ge contracted with,who agreed to purchase and then customize the equipment that would be delivered to the plant.in turn,contracted with a transportation broker,woko transportation woko,who arranged for transport of the customized turbine equipment.woko contracted with rountree to have certain pieces of the customized combustion turbine and an enclosure for housing to the plant on november.the combustion turbine and its enclosure made up only one out of boxes of customized turbine equipment transported to the plant.not included in the november shipment were boxes,which contained additional equipment customized by,including,among other things,an air filter,turbine generator controls,a control house,and lube oil cooler fans.
b.the collision 
because the combustion turbine weighed tons,rountree transported the turbine and its enclosure by using a road tractor that pulled a hauler rig.the height of the hauler rig could be adjusted to deal with gradations in the terrain.the underlying casualty occurred on november as rountree,while transporting the combustion turbine and its enclosure to the plant,attempted to adjust the height of the rig at the railroad crossing licensed to kua from csx.the railroad tracks at the crossing were on an elevated grade.as the hauler rig was driven onto the crossing,the hauler crew realized that the rig would be unable to negotiate the elevated terrain without its height first being adjusted.the crew adjusted the height of the rig without first removing the rig from the railroad tracks.before the rig was removed from the tracks,an amtrak passenger train collided with it.the collision destroyed the rig,the combustion turbine,and the turbine enclosure.the amtrak train also was damaged,and some of the passengers and train crew suffered personal injuries.
c.the lawsuits 
multiple lawsuits were filed against various parties and their insurers seeking to establish responsibility for the collision.csx and amtrak collectively,the rail companies brought suit against,among others,rountree,and kua.the rail companies raised several claims,including that the crossing had been improperly designed and constructed by,and that rountree and kua were negligent in the transport of the combustion turbine and its enclosure.they further claimed that,by virtue of the crossing agreement,kua was obligated to defend and indemnify them.
additionally,numerous passengers and crew members who were aboard the amtrak train at the time of the collision sued for personal injuries and property damage.later,aha,as subrogee of,commenced suit against several entities,including the rail companies,rountree,kua,and fmpa,after it compensated its insured,for loss of the combustion turbine and the turbine enclosure.aha claimed that the negligence of the defendants collectively caused to sustain the loss which was covered by its insurance policy with aha.in turn,as part of the aha litigation,kua brought a complaint against ge claiming that the purchasing agreement required ge to defend and indemnify kua.
procedural history 
the various cases were consolidated,and the district court bifurcated the proceedings into a liability phase and a damages phase.during the former phase,the rail companies moved for summary judgment on the indemnification issue.they asked the court to rule as a matter of law that kua had to defend and indemnify them as a result of the crossing agreement.the court granted summary judgment in favor of csx but denied the motion by amtrak.the court concluded that amtrak claim for indemnity involved factual issues that had not yet been resolved 
a jury trial subsequently was held in on the liability issue for all claimants and all defendants in the consolidated cases.on the same day as the jury rendered its verdict,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law to and ge,holding that they were free of direct negligence for the collision.the jury,in turn,absolved all parties of direct negligence except for rountree,csx,and amtrak.the jury determined that rountree was at fault for the collision,csx was at fault,and amtrak was at fault.the district court then issued orders that damages trials would be held for all plaintiffs,starting with the personal injury plaintiffs,then with the rail companies,and finally with aha.additionally,the court granted motion for a ruling that transportation of the combustion turbine was inherently dangerous as a matter of law.the court further held that,as a result of the inherent dangerousness in transporting the combustion turbine,woko,and ge were vicariously liable for rountree negligence.
before a jury trial on damages ensued,kua,and fmpa moved for summary judgment against ge.they alleged that,under the indemnification provision contained in the purchasing agreement,ge had to reimburse them for the expenses they incurred as a result of successfully defending themselves in the turbine litigation.the district court denied the motions and ruled that the losses suffered by the three parties were not within the scope of the indemnification provision.also before the damages trial,the court reconsidered the issue of whether kua had to defend and indemnify amtrak under the crossing agreement.having reconsidered the issue,the district court granted amtrak renewed motion for summary judgment and ruled as a matter of law that kua was contractually obligated to defend and indemnify amtrak.in addition to its other decisions,the court granted rountree motion for a ruling as a matter of law that its liability to aha was limited to.
then,in december,the district court oversaw a jury trial on the issue of aha damages.by the time of the damages trial,the rail companies had settled their claims with all other parties.indeed,all parties in the various consolidated cases had settled their damages claims by that time,except for aha as subrogee of.at the damages trial,aha wanted to prove the amount of damages incurred by by using the formula that its personnel had employed in adjusting the insurance claim of.under this formula,the loss to was measured by taking the total value of all the customized turbine equipment contained in boxes and then subtracting the value of the equipment contained in boxes,equipment that was undamaged because boxes were never on the rountree hauler.pursuant to its valuation method,aha tried to substantiate the value of the customized equipment contained in boxes through invoices and witness testimony.aha also sought to introduce certain documentary evidence and witness testimony concerning both how it arrived at the monetary figures in its insurance valuation and how much it paid out to.the district court refused to admit any of this documentary and testimonial evidence.
after aha rested its,several parties orally moved for the district court to direct a verdict as to the amount of proven damages.they maintained that the court should enter judgment in favor of aha and against rountree,csx,and amtrak in the amount of,which represented of the damages they argued aha had proven.orally granting the motion,the court ruled that aha,standing in the shoes of,had proven that had incurred in damages,only of which aha was entitled to recover.the district court previously had ruled that was vicariously liable for rountree negligence based on the inherent dangerousness of transporting the combustion turbine.the court reasoned that,just as rountree could collect only of its damages under florida comparative fault principles,the vicariously liable and hence aha could collect only of the damages incurred by.having reduced aha damages,the court then denied aha request for prejudgment interest on its damages award.since the district court already had held that rountree liability to aha was limited to,the court proceeded to enter final judgment against the rail companies jointly and severally for the remaining.
upon entry of final judgment the turbine litigation,a train wreck in its own right,came crashing into our court.aha commenced appeal to seek review of several rulings made by the district court during the damages trial.on appeal,aha argues that the district court erred in restricting the evidence it could introduce to prove the amount of its damages.aha also asserts that the court erroneously concluded that transport of the combustion turbine was inherently dangerous as a matter of florida law a ruling that led the court to impute rountree negligence to and thus to aha for damages purposes.moreover,aha contends that even if properly was imputed with rountree negligence,the district court erred in applying florida comparative fault principles to limit aha,as subrogee of,to recovering of proven damages.finally,aha contends that the court mistakenly refused to grant prejudgment interest on its damages award.
in addition to the appeal over aha damages,kua,fmpa,and have commenced appeals against ge on the issue of contractual indemnification.they argue that the district court erred in holding that,under the indemnification provision in the purchasing agreement,ge did not have to reimburse them for the expenses they incurred in defending themselves.they maintain that the indemnification provision is applicable here because they had to defend themselves against claims resulting from the turbine collision that arose out of ge failure to have the turbine transported safely.
finally,kua and fmpa have commenced cross appeals against the rail companies.they seek review of the district court grant of summary judgment to csx and amtrak on the issue of contractual indemnification.they assert that,for several reasons,the court erroneously concluded that by extension,fmpa had to defend and indemnify the rail companies under the indemnification provision in the crossing agreement.kua and fmpa claim that the indemnification provision is unenforceable based on florida sovereign immunity law.they also raise several alternative arguments as to why they should not have to defend and indemnify the rail companies.for instance,kua and fmpa argue that the indemnification provision is unenforceable because the special requirements under florida law for indemnification in construction contracts have not been met.the provision also is unenforceable,they contend,based on florida law dealing with exculpatory,or adhesion,contracts.indeed,the indemnification provision is not applicable to the present case,kua and fmpa maintain,because the negligent actions of csx occurred in a location separate and apart from the railroad crossing.finally,they assert that,even if the provision is enforceable and applicable to the facts here,amtrak was not covered by the provision.
ii.discussion 
aha damages 
in addressing the plethora of issues raised on appeal,we turn first to those raised by aha.aha appeal focuses on several decisions made by the district court,including the decision to exclude aha damages evidence and to direct a verdict on the amount of damages the decision that transport of the combustion turbine was inherently dangerous as a matter of florida law the decision that florida comparative fault principles limited aha to recovering of its damages and the decision not to grant aha prejudgment interest on its damages.we will address each decision in turn.
evidentiary rulings 
the evidentiary rulings at issue occurred as the district court oversaw the damages trial at which aha,as subrogee of,sought to prove the damages incurred by as a result of the collision.prior to the collision,bought certain turbine equipment,such as the turbine engine,which it then customized by adding wiring assemblies,harnesses,and piping.it also built an enclosure for housing the turbine equipment.sold the customized equipment to ge,who then resold the equipment to kua for use at the plant.
so that rountree could transport the customized equipment to the plant,sorted the items of equipment into separate boxes,which were shipped at different times.box contained the combustion turbine and its enclosure.boxes contained other equipment,including air filters,turbine generator controls,a control house,and a ventilation module.only box was on the rountree hauler rig,and only box was damaged in the collision.as a result of the damage from the collision,sold the turbine engine as scrap to ge for.subsequently filed an insurance claim with aha,who paid out in proceeds to.
at the damages trial,aha theory of damages was predicated on the formula its personnel had used to adjust the insurance claim of after the collision.under this insurance valuation formula,aha did not measure the loss to by taking the value of the customized turbine equipment in box before the collision and subtracting the value of what was left of the equipment after the collision.rather,aha measured the loss to by taking the total value of all the customized turbine equipment contained in boxes before the collision and then subtracting the value of the equipment contained in boxes,equipment that went undamaged because it was shipped separately and thus was not on the rountree hauler rig.
to prove its damages under this formula,aha attempted to admit into evidence a list of invoice prices for the equipment contained in boxes,which it argued represented the salvage value of the turbine equipment not destroyed by the collision.the district court refused to admit this evidence.the court,moreover,prevented several witnesses from testifying about the way in which the loss to was calculated for the insurance valuation.the court excluded testimony from dianne furgerson,the claims adjuster for the collision,who would have testified about the proof of loss form submitted by.she also would have testified about the subrogation receipts that showed the amount of insurance proceeds paid to in settlement of its insurance claim.additionally,the court excluded testimony from carl shook,a project manager for,and dean summers,a corporate risk manager.they would have testified as to how calculated its loss under the insurance policy.
the district court excluded the aforementioned evidence under federal rule of evidence as irrelevant and under rule as confusing to the jury.the court excluded aha evidence because it rejected the insurer formula for calculating damages.in the district court view,aha was limited to proving the loss in value of the customized turbine equipment contained in box the combustion turbine and its enclosure,the only box involved in the collision.the court saw no basis for permitting aha to expand the evidence it presented to include proof as to the value of the undamaged equipment shipped separately in boxes.
the district court,however,did permit the introduction of evidence concerning the value of the combustion turbine engine because it was shipped in box.the court allowed into evidence the invoice for the original sale of the engine to for the court also allowed in evidence that sold the damaged engine for scrap to ge for.based on the invoice and scrap price,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law as to the amount of damages aha had proven,which the court calculated as 
in evaluating the district court decisions concerning the relevancy of certain evidence of damages,we reverse only if the court abused its discretion.pesaplastic,cincinnati milacron,cir.as to the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law on the amount of damages,our review is de novo,and we treat the evidence presented to the jury in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.willingham loughnan,cir.we turn now to the florida law that will guide us in assessing the aforementioned rulings by the district court.
in florida,t he objective in calculating the proper measure of damages is to place the plaintiff in the same financial position as that occupied before the property was damaged.ocean hughes,so d.a party whose chattel is harmed is entitled to the difference between the value before and after the damage.hillside van lines,matalon,so d,per curiam see also american equity ins.van ginhoven,so d.courts,however,must be careful to ensure that the party who incurred the loss is not unjustly enriched by the damages award.ocean,so d at.
applying these principles to this case,we rule that the district court was correct in its exclusion of aha damages evidence.the evidence that aha sought to introduce was meant to substantiate the damages figure arrived at by aha in adjusting the insurance claim of.it follows that,if the formula used by aha to adjust the claim was an improper measure of damages under florida law,the admission of evidence offered to substantiate the damages figure calculated under that formula would similarly be improper.because we conclude that aha insurance valuation formula constitutes an improper measure of damages,we likewise conclude that the district court correctly excluded evidence offered to substantiate that valuation.
as we have explained,aha insurance valuation formula was based on the value before the collision of all the customized turbine equipment contained in boxes,minus the value after the collision of the equipment contained in boxes,equipment that was shipped separately,was not on the rountree hauler,and was not involved in the collision.there is no authority under florida law for calculating damages in this manner.rather,florida law indicates that the basic measure of damages for loss to chattels is the difference between the value of the damaged property before and after the casualty.american equity ins.van ginhoven,so d at hillside,so d at.the focus thus is on the property actually involved in the casualty and the resulting loss in its value caused by any damage it sustained.
aha did not properly constrain its focus.instead of focusing narrowly on the loss in value to the combustion turbine and its enclosure in box,aha chose to measure its damages by incorporating the value of equipment contained in boxes.there could be no difference between the value before and after the damage with regard to such equipment,however,because it was not involved in the underlying casualty in the first place.hillside,so d at.consequently,aha damages formula,and the evidence it tried to introduce in support thereof,are inconsistent with florida law.
aha argues in rebuttal that the equipment contained in the boxes constituted one item of merchandise that had been disassembled into separate boxes for transport to the plant.aha points out that all of the customized equipment was sold to ge by as part of one sales contract.moreover,aha claims that the two contracting parties,in the purchase invoice and otherwise,treated the equipment as one lm turbine unit.in this manner,aha argues that the proper measure of damages is the value before the collision of the lm turbine unit boxes minus its value after the collision boxes.
we disagree.this is not a contracts action,and the terminology of the sales contract between and ge is not determinative with regard to third party tortfeasors like the rail companies or rountree.aha,moreover,can not avoid the fact that separate items of turbine equipment were contained in boxes,and that only a distinct set of those items was involved in the underlying casualty.the distinct set of items in box had an independent market value that readily could be ascertained,and so there was no good reason to complicate and confuse matters by including boxes in the damages calculation.
aha argument would carry more weight if the separate items of turbine equipment were so interdependent that the value of any one item could not be ascertained without reference to the others.that is,aha position would have merit if the value of the combustion turbine and the enclosure in box was so intertwined with the value of the other equipment in boxes that it could not be separately adduced.but that is not the case here.the record,for example,demonstrates that the value of the combustion turbine engine in box could be ascertained both before and after the accident through a purchase invoice and through testimony regarding the scrap sale of the damaged engine.as a result,we reject aha attempt to treat boxes as a single item of merchandise for damages purposes.
we also note that,even if we agreed with aha treatment of all boxes as a single item of merchandise,its theory of damages still would be fundamentally flawed.in calculating the market value of the turbine equipment in boxes before the collision,aha relied on the declared value of that equipment under its insurance policy with.the declared value of the boxes of equipment was,and this figure,in turn,was calculated in part by factoring in the price at which sold the customized equipment to ge.
the proper measure of market value is dependent upon the choice of the appropriate economic market which will achieve the objective of making the injured party whole,while avoiding any unjust enrichment.ocean,so d at.because aha insurance valuation relied in part on the price ge paid for the customized turbine equipment,aha damages figure contained a profit component inclusion of this component,however,would unjustly enrich,and hence aha.after the collision,customized a new combustion turbine and turbine enclosure for the plant and sold these replacement items to ge.thus was able to obtain its profit on the sale of the turbine and its enclosure.to allow aha to predicate its damages on a figure that includes such profits would permit the insurer to recover lost profits that were never lost in the first place.ocean,so d at quotations omitted 
furthermore,aha would be unjustly enriched even more than our analysis at first suggests because,even if the profit component were extracted from the declared value,the declared value still would not reflect the actual loss incurred by.indeed,dianne furgerson,the claims adjuster,stated in her proffered deposition testimony that the aha insurance policy was not geared towards compensating for the actual cash value of the equipment that was damaged,but was instead predicated on the invoice sales price,plus a markup thus,the insurance policy calculated the amount paid to in insurance proceeds not only by factoring in the purported value of the equipment based on the invoice sales price,which included a profit component,but also by including a increase to that amount.
the markup was not based on any actual costs substantiated by.the increase,in fact,was a generic,fixed percentage that aha had agreed to as part of the insurance coverage the inflated value attributed to the equipment as a result of the increase would lead,in turn,to the insurance formula overstating the losses incurred by when the equipment was damaged.as we have noted,florida law requires that courts ensure that the damages awarded for loss to chattel do not unjustly enrich the injured party.ocean,so d at.accordingly,we rule that an insured party whose property has been damaged can not force a tortfeasor to pay out in damages a negotiated figure between insurer and insured that reflects contract terms that inflate the value of the property.in sum,the contractual markup that was factored into the declared value of the equipment in the insurance policy skews aha damages theory,because,like the inclusion of the profit component,it raises the specter of unjust enrichment.
based on the foregoing analysis,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding aha damages evidence.aha evidence concerning the insurance valuation of the turbine equipment contained in boxes was irrelevant to a proper determination of actual damages,given that only the equipment in box was involved in the collision.such evidence would have confused the jury,who likely would have lost focus as to which equipment was actually on the rountree hauler.aha evidence regarding the insurance valuation of the damaged turbine equipment in box also was irrelevant because,by including a profit component and a generic markup,it did not reflect the loss that actually sustained.
it follows that the district court did not err in granting judgment as a matter of law in the amount of.the only relevant evidence concerning the value before and after the collision of the equipment in box was the invoice representing the price of the turbine engine sold to for,and the evidence concerning the scrap price of the damaged turbine sold to ge by for.aha failed to introduce any other witnesses or documentary evidence that demonstrated the costs incurred by in obtaining and customizing the other equipment in box.aha could have gathered this information and presented it at trial had it chosen to do so accordingly,the district court was correct to hold as a matter of law that aha had proven damages totaling.
the inherently dangerous work doctrine 
a.the inherent dangerousness issue 
having held as a matter of law that aha had proven damages totaling,the district court limited aha to recovering of its damages award.the court reduced aha damages based on its earlier ruling that transport of the combustion turbine was inherently dangerous as a matter of florida law.based on its ruling that transport of the combustion turbine was inherently dangerous,the court had held that,ge,and woko were vicariously liable for rountree negligent transport of the turbine.had not been held vicariously liable,rountree negligence would not have been imputed to,and hence to aha as subrogee of the imputation of rountree negligence to,and thus to aha,led the court to limit aha recovery to of the proven damages based on comparative fault principles.
on appeal,aha,as well as,ge,and rountree collectively,the appellants challenge the district court decision that transport of the combustion turbine constituted inherently dangerous work as a matter of florida law.we review de novo a ruling on a matter of law by the district court.willingham,at.we take the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.
under florida law,an owner,contractor,or employer is not liable for injury caused by an independent contractor negligence,unless the owner,contractor,or employer own active negligence caused or contributed to the injury.baxley dixie land timber,so d.an exception to this rule is the inherently dangerous work doctrine,which applies when the work to be performed by the independent contractor is inherently or intrinsically dangerous.florida power light price,so d,per curiam.an activity is inherently dangerous if the danger inheres in the performance of the work,and it is sufficient if there is a recognizable and substantial danger inherent in the work,even though a major hazard is not involved.id.the activity,moreover,must be such that in the ordinary course of events its performance would probably,and not merely possibly,cause injury if proper precautions were not taken.id.if the activity is found to be inherently dangerous,then the one engaged in or responsible for the performance of the work is said to be under a nondelegable duty to perform,or have others perform,the work in a reasonably safe and careful manner.baxley,so d at.
generally,it is a fact question for the jury whether a particular activity is inherently dangerous.doak green,so d,per curiam.the trial court nonetheless may rule that an activity is inherently dangerous as a matter of law if there is some statute or case law designating the activity as inherently dangerous,or if there is a sufficient record of undisputed facts upon which the decision can be based.id.indeed,florida courts often have held that particular activities are inherently dangerous as a matter of law.see,midyette madison,so d,holding that clearing of land by fire is inherently dangerous as a matter of law bialkowicz pan am.condominium,so d,holding that installation of support pilings is inherently dangerous as a matter of law.
applying these standards to the present case,we conclude that the district court had a sufficient basis for concluding that transport of the combustion turbine was inherently dangerous as a matter of law.the court extensive analysis points to several undisputed facts that warrant this conclusion.the district court noted that the combustion turbine itself was tremendous in size,constituting an,high,wide,and long piece of machinery.the vehicle used to transport the turbine itself weighed over pounds.the transport vehicle,in fact,was an,hauler consisting of a road tractor and a hauler rig that contained three separate cargo decks.the vehicle was over three times the length of an ordinary wheeler.as further evidence of the oversized nature of the turbine and the transport vehicle,the hauler rig had to be equipped with special hydraulic equipment to adjust to gradations in the road.
in addition to the unique dimensions and weight of the combustion turbine and the transport vehicle,the district court pointed to the quantum of regulations dealing with the transport of oversized items like the turbine as indicative of the inherent dangerousness involved.the court noted that florida strictly regulates the transportation of oversized items like the turbine,see florida statute,and that state law specifically addresses the moving of heavy equipment across railroad crossings.see.the court also pointed out that the florida department of transportation,the city of tampa,and polk county all required special permits before the turbine could be transported.
as further evidence of inherent dangerousness,the district court focused on the unique preparation and the special precautions that were taken in transporting the combustion turbine.for instance,ge and used a special transportation broker to arrange for the transport of the turbine on a vehicle.unique measures then had to be taken by rountree before it could transport the turbine for instance,it had to coordinate and use special signs,lights,and escort vehicles,all of which the permitting authorities mandated.a separate utility vehicle,moreover,had to clear signs,traffic lights,overhead wires,and other obstacles as the transport of the turbine took place.two florida highway patrol officers in marked vehicles also were present to facilitate the transport.
all of these factors,when taken together,provide ample justification for the district court conclusion on the inherent dangerousness issue.it is true that florida precedent shows that towing of a piece of equipment is not in itself inherently dangerous.see strickland,department of agric.consumer servs.of florida,so d,towing of tractor not inherently dangerous american auto,tehrani,so d,operation of wrecker truck not inherently dangerous.but the situation in the present case was drastically different from the average towing scenario,as evidenced by the extraordinary dimensions and weight of the combustion turbine and the transport vehicle.
furthermore,as the district court explained,transportation of an oversized item like the turbine is strictly regulated by florida law,and such regulation was one of the primary reasons the florida supreme court held that the clearing of land by fire is inherently dangerous.see midyette,so d at.finally,we point out that the use of special hydraulics on the hauler rig to raise or lower its height makes this case similar to the operation of a crane,which florida courts,on numerous occasions,have held is an inherently dangerous activity.see scott jobalia constr.halifax paving,so d,atlantic coast dev.napoleon steel contractors,so d.
b.the collateral negligence issue 
even if the district court properly concluded that transport of the turbine was inherently dangerous,the appellants argue that the court nevertheless erred in its vicarious liability determination because the damage in this case resulted from rountree collateral negligence.the appellants claim that,even when an owner,contractor,or employer has a nondelegable duty,such a party is not vicariously responsible for all torts committed by the independent contractor.security servs.ramada inn,so d,per curiam.they further contend that,based on the restatement second of torts,an owner,contractor,or employer can be held vicariously liable only if the independent contractor fails to take the special precautions that need to be taken as a result of the inherent dangerousness of the activity involved conversely,the appellants maintain that such parties can not be held vicariously liable for the independent contractor negligence that is collateral to the risks inherent in the activity,such as abnormal or unusual kinds of negligence on the part of the contractor,or negligence in the performance of operative details of the work which ordinarily may be expected to be carried out with proper care.restatement second of torts cmt.b see also security,so d at.
based on these principles,the appellants position is that,even if transport of the turbine constituted inherently dangerous work,evidence presented at the liability trial shows that rountree was collaterally negligent because its crew failed to take routine,precautions in attempting to transport the combustion turbine across the railroad crossing.they assert that the rountree crew committed ordinary negligence by choosing to disable the transport vehicle on the train tracks at the railroad crossing instead of moving the vehicle off the tracks first,even though the crew knew that an amtrak train was due to pass.the rountree crew did not fail to take special precautions related to transport of the oversized combustion turbine and transport vehicle,in the appellants view.rather,from their viewpoint,the crew acted with extreme recklessness,failing to take the precautions that any ordinary driver would take at a railroad crossing.under these circumstances,the appellants maintain,they should not be held vicariously liable for rountree negligent acts or omissions 
we reject the position of the appellants because,as the district court properly held,rountree failure to move the transport vehicle from the railroad crossing was a function of the unique dangers that arose in transporting an oversized piece of machinery like the combustion turbine.the basic characteristics of the massive transport vehicle are not in dispute.the vehicle had axles and articulations,or pivot points.it required two drivers,one at the front of the vehicle,and one at the back.the vehicle,moreover,was equipped with a special hydraulic system that could raise or lower the cargo beds to adjust to gradations in road terrain.if gradations in the terrain were too great,the cargo beds could then be raised further through shimming,the insertion of metal pieces into certain crevices in the vehicle.before the crew could shim the load,the vehicle had to be set down on pine blocks,resulting in only a few inches of clearance between the vehicle and the road surface.
the basic facts leading up to the collision also are not in dispute on the collision date,the transport vehicle arrived at the private road grade crossing in the late morning.the rountree crew first attempted to turn the transport vehicle left onto the crossing,but a utility pole prevented this maneuver.the rountree crew then turned the vehicle around and approached the railroad crossing from the opposite direction in order to make a turn.before proceeding forward over the railroad crossing,james garren,the project supervisor,and ralph shook,the rear driver of the transport vehicle,inspected the elevation of the crossing.to do so,garren and shook stood on opposite ends of the track.garren kneeled and how far the crest of the crossing extended up shook leg.garren and shook then used a tape measure to determine the distance from the ground to the point on shook leg to which the crest extended.they concluded that the vehicle would clear the crest of the crossing,if the vehicle was elevated to its maximum height using the hydraulic system.
after raising the height,the rountree crew attempted to maneuver the transport vehicle over the railroad crossing.the crew shortly realized,however,that even with the height of the vehicle fully extended by the hydraulic system,the cargo beds would not clear the crest of the crossing.consequently,the crew stopped the vehicle on the tracks,even though members of the crew had heard that an amtrak train was due to pass the railroad crossing by instead of backing the transport vehicle completely off the crossing,the crew disabled the vehicle on the tracks in order to implement the shimming procedure,which would raise the height of the vehicle enough to clear the crossing.the crew did so at the direction of garren,who believed that the vehicle could be removed from the tracks more quickly if the crew set down the vehicle on the tracks to shim the load than if they first attempted to maneuver it backwards off the crossing.garren feared that if the crew tried to back the vehicle completely off the crossing,it would jack knife and would get stuck there.the crew proceeded to shim the load with the transport vehicle on the tracks.after completing the shimming procedure,but before the vehicle had time to proceed forward over the crossing,an amtrak train arrived and the collision occurred.
at the liability trial,the dispute over whether rountree was negligent focused primarily on the decision to shim the load with the transport vehicle still on the tracks.the parties presented conflicting accounts of whether the transport vehicle could have been backed off the crossing in a quick and safe manner.additionally,the parties disputed whether the rountree crew followed a reasonable procedure in measuring the crest of the crossing before trying to proceed with the vehicle over the tracks.that is,they argued over whether the garren and shook acted unreasonably by the railroad crossing elevation instead of using a more scientific,precise method of measurement.
that the dispute concerned these particular acts or omissions of the rountree crew shows that,contrary to the appellants position,the present case is not about collateral negligence.this conclusion follows from the fact that the risk that the rountree crew would err over whether and how to maneuver backwards the enormous transport its axles and pivot exactly the type of dangerous risk inherent to the moving of oversized machinery in a,specialized transport vehicle.that a supervisor like garren might miscalculate whether the specialized vehicle would jack knife and get stuck is one of the dangers inherent to the operation of a vehicle hauling an piece of machinery.moreover,that garren and shook would measure the height of the crest improperly is one of the dangers that flows directly from utilization of a vehicle with a hydraulic unit for raising or lowering cargo beds in response to terrain elevation.we therefore agree with the district court that rountree negligence resulted from its failure to take the special precautions required for transporting an oversized combustion turbine in a complex,vehicle that was sensitive to changes in terrain gradation levels.the factual disputes in this case only reinforce this conclusion.
c.the vicariously liable parties 
the appellants raise one final argument.they contend that even if transport of the turbine was inherently dangerous,and even if rountree did not commit collateral negligence,should not be held vicariously liable for rountree negligent acts or omissions the appellants contend that rountree employer,woko,can be held vicariously liable for rountree negligence,but not,who hired woko but had no direct employment or contractual relationship with rountree.the issue here is whether a principal can be liable for the conduct of its contractor woko subcontractor rountree.we agree with the district court on this issue and conclude that,under the facts of this case,can be held vicariously liable for rountree negligence.
the parties do not dispute that,through its contract with ge,was responsible for transporting the combustion turbine to the plant.by contracting with ge,assumed the duty of providing for the safe transport of the turbine.as part of its contractual duties,arranged for the inherently dangerous activity of having the turbine transported in a vehicle.because transport of the turbine constituted inherently dangerous work,the duty of to provide for the safe transport of the turbine was nondelegable.see baxley,so d at stating that anyone engaged in or responsible for the inherently dangerous activity has a nondelegable duty.when a duty is nondelegable,responsibility,ultimate liability,for the proper performance of that undertaking may not be delegated.atlantic coast,so d at.thus,as the district court concluded,remained ultimately liable for the transport of the turbine,even though it had contracted with woko to arrange for the transportation.
comparative fault 
even if transport of the combustion turbine was inherently dangerous as a matter of law,aha argues that the district court nevertheless should not have limited its recovery to of its damages.as subrogee of,aha claims that,because was only vicariously liable for the collision,the district court erred in applying florida comparative fault principles,as enunciated in florida statute,to reduce the proven damages.aha contends that applies solely to parties who are directly negligent,and that a party who is only vicariously liable can not have fault apportioned to him under.this issue has not been directly addressed by the supreme court of florida.because this issue involves unsettled questions of state law that raise important public policy concerns,we have decided to certify the issue to florida highest court for resolution.
as previously noted,at the conclusion of aha presentation of evidence in the damages trial,kua and fmpa among others collectively,the appellees,orally moved for the court to enter judgment as a matter of law in favor of aha and against rountree and the rail companies in the amount of,which represented of.the district court granted the motion.the court ruled that the subrogee aha could recover only of the damages that it had proven were incurred by because rountree fault was to be apportioned to,and hence to aha,under florida statute.rountree fault was apportioned to the subrogee aha under because had been held vicariously liable for,and thus had been imputed with,rountree negligence under the inherently dangerous work doctrine.not only was legally obligated to pay damages owed by rountree to the collision victims,but also,through aha,it was to have its own damages for loss of the combustion turbine and of the enclosure reduced under in proportion to rountree negligence.upon reaching this conclusion regarding the application of,the district court,having ruled already that rountree liability to aha was limited to entered judgment against the rail companies jointly and severally for the remaining.
in discussing the district court conclusion,we turn first to florida statute,entitled comparative fault.the section states that any contributory fault chargeable to the claimant diminishes proportionally the amount awarded as economic damages for an injury attributable to the claimant contributory fault.stat.ann.west the section further provides that t he court shall enter judgment against each party liable on the basis of such party percentage of fault and not on the basis of the doctrine of joint and several liability.
aha primary assertion is that the district court improperly treated vicarious liability as synonymous with the word fault in,given that fault,in aha view,means direct negligence.to substantiate its position,aha points to florida cases that treat vicarious liability as a matter of status or relationship,not of fault.see nash wells fargo guard,so d,we hold that the named defendant can not rely on the vicarious liability of a nonparty to establish the nonparty fault.mercury motors express,smith,so d,an employer is vicariously liable for the negligent acts of employees committed within the scope of their employment even if the employer is without fault.this is based upon the public policy that victims should be compensated even though it means placing vicarious liability on an innocent employer.emphasis added crowell clay hyder trucking lines,so d,vicarious liability awards compensate for injuries without regard to fault.aha also notes that in this case,the district court specifically stated that is an innocent part y who i s vicariously liable for damages which are wholly the fault of rountree.
as a consequence of such case law,aha concludes that when florida statute states that damages are to be apportioned based on a party percentage of fault,it means based on a party direct negligence,not on a party status or relationship with another party.stat.ann.see also fabre marin,so d,overruled in part on other grounds,wells tallahassee mem l reg l med,so d we conclude that is unambiguous.by its clear terms,judgment should be entered against each party liable on the basis of that party percentage of fault.emphasis added.indeed,aha indicates that at least one florida appellate panel has interpreted fabre as equating fault under florida statute with direct negligence.see stores,mcdonald,so d,aff sub,merrill crossings assocs.mcdonald,so d stating that,in addressing,the fabre court equated a defendant fault with the amount of its negligence quotations omitted.the essence of aha contention,therefore,is both that florida law consistently has drawn a sharp distinction between vicarious liability and fault,and that this same distinction should be recognized in the application of florida statute,which refers only to fault and never specifically mentions vicarious liability.
additional arguments can be made in favor of aha position.aha claims that a vicariously liable party can not be said to have contributed to,or to have participated in,the accident at issue in a given torts case.but the fabre court stated that apportionment of damages under is between participants to the accident.fabre,so d at emphasis added.furthermore,one can argue that a vicariously liable party is not a joint or concurrent tortfeasor,given that such a party is being held liable solely for the conduct of another.some florida cases,however,have indicated that only applies to joint or concurrent tortfeasors.see ford motor,so d per curiam holding that,in a crashworthiness case between a car accident victim and an automobile manufacturer,the driver responsible for the initial collision can not have fault apportioned to him under because the driver and manufacturer are not joint or concurrent tortfeasors association for retarded,fletcher,so d,stating that,in an action between an injured party and an initial tortfeasor,a health care provider who aggravates the initial injury can not have fault apportioned to him under because the physician and initial tortfeasor are successive,rather than joint,tortfeasors.
in sum,aha assertion is that a party who is only vicariously liable can not have another fault apportioned to him under,which aha argues only applies to parties who are directly negligent,who actively participate in the accident at issue,or who constitute joint or concurrent tortfeasors.the subrogee aha therefore contends that it should be able to recover all of the damages that it had proven were incurred by without having rountree negligence apportioned to it under.this interpretation of would not harm the appellees,aha maintains,because they still could recover their damages from as a result of vicarious liability for rountree negligence.moreover,irrespective of the outcome here,aha points out that,should rountree seek to recover its own damages from the appellees,rountree still would be required to have its damages reduced under as a result of its direct negligence in causing the turbine collision.
the appellees raise several rebuttal arguments.they too focus on the precise wording of.the appellees note that under,any contributory fault that is chargeable to the claimant has the effect of diminishing his or her damages for an injury attributable to the claimant contributory fault.stat.ann.emphasis added see also cody kernaghan,so d,noting that the doctrine of contributory fault applies to reduce economic damages by the percentage of fault which can be attributed to the plaintiff.terms like chargeable and attributable,in the view of the appellees,indicate that the meaning of fault for purposes of goes beyond direct negligence.furthermore,b lists several situations where comparative fault does not apply,such as where liability is based upon an intentional tort,but the list does not include situations where liability is based upon vicarious liability.stat.ann.b.based on this statutory language,the appellees have a basis for arguing that the district court did not overreach by treating vicarious liability as within the ambit of the term fault found in.
in addition to arguing that their position synchronizes with the statutory language of,the appellees claim that their position,unlike that of aha,accords with baseline tort principles,as pronounced in restatement third of torts apportionment of liability.section states that t he negligence of another person is imputed to a plaintiff whenever the negligence of the other person would have been imputed had the plaintiff been a defendant.restatement third of torts apportionment of liability.in turn,comment b of the restatement section states that w hen a party would be responsible as a defendant for the negligence of a third person,the negligence of the third person is imputed to the party as a plaintiff.id.cmt.b.the appellees argue that,since the vicariously liable would be charged with rountree negligence if were the defendant,thus causing to bear legal responsibility for any damages owed by rountree to collision victims,it follows that rountree negligence should be charged to in this action where,through aha,is the plaintiff.
finally,the appellees turn to distinguishing the cases relied on by aha,including fabre,nash,and.they contend that fabre only held that in enacting,the florida legislature intended for all joint or concurrent tortfeasors who cause an accident to be included in the apportionment of fault for that accident,even those tortfeasors who are to the suit.fabre,so d at.fabre never indicated that fault under can only mean direct negligence,the appellees assert.similarly,they maintain that nash stands for the proposition that it is inappropriate for a named defendant to include a on the verdict form for apportionment of damages,if the is only vicariously liable for the named defendant negligence.nash,so d at.otherwise,the appellees note,the plaintiff recovery against the named defendant would be unfairly split between two named active tortfeasor and the vicariously liable though the liability of the two should be coextensive under basis principles of joint and several liability.the appellees argument is that the nash holding has nothing to do with whether a party to an action,vicariously liable for another negligence,can be imputed with the active tortfeasor negligence for purposes of reducing its own damages recovery.finally,the appellees point out that held that a intentional tortfeasor should not be included on the verdict form for purposes of apportioning fault under,so d at.they claim that is not relevant to the vicarious liability context because the case focuses exclusively on the interaction between intentional torts and comparative fault.
unfortunately,there is no easy method for resolving the conflicting interpretations of and of florida precedent provided by aha and the appellees.in our effort to resolve this conflict,we did locate two additional florida appellate decisions that deal with vicarious liability and comparative fault,but on close analysis,neither resolves the issue raised here.in brooks son,quiroz,the florida appellate court stated that when the named defendant liability for the accident was purely vicarious in nature it is obvious,contrary to the ruling below,that the comparative fault statute,section do es not apply.so d.brooks,however,held only that a vicariously liable party is entitled to a complete set off as to settlement amounts paid to the plaintiff by the active tortfeasor.id.the case was about the interaction between florida statutes and,a different subject than the one addressed in the present litigation.we therefore are hesitant to interpret broadly the language of the opinion concerning the interaction between vicarious liability and.
similarly,in suarez gonzalez,a case where the defendant was vicariously liable for another negligence,the florida appellate court stated that t his is not a situation where there were joint tortfeasors,so the comparative fault statute and fabre do not apply.so d.january.the case,however,was the of nash.the appellate court held that a active tortfeasor should not be included on the verdict form when a party defendant,who was vicariously liable for the negligence,already was included on that form.id.otherwise,like in nash,the plaintiff recovery against the named defendant would be unfairly split between two parties even though the liability of the two should be coextensive.as with brooks,we refrain from broadly analogizing suarez to the present case.it therefore is clear that existing florida case law does not resolve the question of how is to be interpreted with regard to vicarious liability.both sides in the present case have good arguments for their respective interpretations of,and the issue is one upon which reasonable persons can disagree.
having concluded that the comparative fault issue raised here involves an unanswered question of florida law that is not specifically addressed by controlling state precedent,we certify the following question of law to the supreme court of florida for instructions 
should a vicariously liable party have the negligence of the active tortfeasor apportioned to it under florida statute such that recovery of its own damages is reduced concomitantly 
if the florida supreme court decides to accept this certification,we note that the phrasing of the question is not meant to limit,in any way,how the court responds to the question or analyzes the state law issues involved therein 
prejudgment interest 
after ruling that aha could recover of its proven damages,the district court denied aha request for prejudgment interest on its damages award.aha argues that the court erred in this regard.we review the district court decision on whether to award prejudgment interest for abuse of discretion.insurance of north america ocean lynx,cir.
under florida law tort claims are generally excepted from the rule allowing prejudgment interest,primarily because tort damages are generally too speculative to liquidate before final judgment.lumbermens mut.cas.percefull,so d.florida law,moreover,does not permit a prejudgment interest award unless there is an ascertainable loss occurring at a specific time prior to the entry of the judgment.underhill fancy veal,padot,so d.
applying these principles to the present case,we hold that the district court acted within its discretion in not awarding prejudgment interest.as section of our opinion indicates,the amount of loss incurred by was unclear and was a matter of bitter dispute during the damages trial.there was no easily ascertainable,amount that aha could point to as a dispositive measure of loss.it follows the district court did not err in treating the damages incurred by as unascertainable and speculative before the time of final judgment,and thus in refusing to grant prejudgment interest to aha.
indemnification agreement between kua and ge 
we turn next to the appeal by kua,fmpa,and collectively,the indemnitee appellants of the district court denial of their motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether,under the indemnification provision in the purchasing agreement,ge had to reimburse the indemnitee appellants for the expenses they suffered in defending themselves.in denying their motions,the district court ruled that,as a matter of law,the attorney fees and costs the indemnitee appellants incurred were not within the scope of the indemnification agreement between kua and ge.
as we have noted,kua contracted with ge for purchase and delivery of the customized turbine equipment.the purchasing agreement between kua and ge included the following provision entitled indemnification 
t he contractor ge shall defend,indemnify,and hold harmless the owner kua and its officers,directors,commissioners,agents and employees,and the engineer and its partners from and against all liability,claims,damages,losses and expenses,including reasonable attorney fee s,resulting from injury to or death of persons including employees of owner,engineer and contractor or physical damage to or physical loss of property of third parties to the extent of and on account of any negligent act or omission of contractor in performing the work under the contract.
exh.a at gc emphasis added based on this language,the indemnitee appellants moved for summary judgment,arguing that ge had to reimburse them for attorney fees and costs incurred in successfully defending themselves against liability.
in rejecting their motion,the district court relied primarily on two florida cases,houdaille industries,edwards,so d,and sefc building mccloskey window cleaning,so d.the court found the present case factually indistinguishable from houdaille and sefc building,both of which state that the indemnitor does not have to indemnify the indemnitee unless the indemnitee is found to be without fault.see houdaille,so d at sefc,so d at.that is,both cases provide that,under florida law,one party has to indemnify another only if the latter liability is founded on the former wrongdoing,not on its own.sefc,so d at.the only time a party can be indemnified for its own wrongful acts is if the indemnity contract express es such an intent in clear and unequivocal terms.sefc,so d at.
based primarily on these cases,the district court denied the summary judgment motions and held as a matter of law that the indemnitee appellants could not obtain attorney fees and costs under the indemnification provision.the court noted that,if the indemnitee appellants had been held liable at trial,it would have been due to their own negligence,not that of ge.this is because,the district court maintained,it had been established that the indemnitee appellants could not be held vicariously liable for ge acts or omissions.based on houdaille and sefc building,the court concluded that none of the indemnitee appellants would have been entitled to indemnification had they been held liable for the claims brought against them since the indemnitee appellants would not have been entitled to indemnification from ge had they been held liable,the court decided that the indemnitee appellants were not entitled to recover attorney fees and costs in defending themselves against such liability.
we review de novo the district court decision concerning a motion for summary judgment,applying the same standard as the district court.mitchell usbi,cir.a district court may grant summary judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
the indemnitee appellants raise several arguments as to why the district court erred by failing to grant them reimbursement for attorney fees and costs.their best argument,however,is that the district court failed to consider florida cases like florida department of transportation southern bell telephone telegraph,so d,and jones construction zack,so d,which address indemnification agreements that specifically state that the indemnitor has to defend the indemnitee.the indemnitee appellants point out that the indemnification provision in the purchasing agreement states not only that ge shall indemnify and hold harmless kua and others,but also that ge shall defend these parties.exh.a at gc.the indemnitee appellants assert that the district court failed to consider the duty to defend created by the contractual language and the case law associated therewith.instead,the court primarily relied on houdaille and sefc building,cases that do not involve indemnity provisions containing a duty to defend.
florida precedent distinguishes between two duties in the contractual indemnification context the duty to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnitee,and the duty to defend the indemnitee.see southern bell,so d at noting that the duty to defend is entirely separate from the right to indemnification jones,so d at same.the duty to defend is triggered based on the nature of the claim alleged against the indemnitee,regardless of whether the party asserting the claim should win or lose upon a final determination of the suit.jones,so d at see also southern bell,so d at.the indemnitor must defend the indemnitee if the underlying facts contained in the complaint can be fairly read to support a claim covered by the indemnification provision.metropolitan dade county cbm indus.of minnesota,so d.if the lawsuit involves a covered claim and a claim which is not covered by the indemnity agreement,then the duty to defend extends to the entire lawsuit.metropolitan dade county florida aviation fueling,so d,per curiam.
the indemnitee appellants contend that the district court should have followed the methodology of cases like cbm industries and hence should have focused solely on whether any of the claims brought against the indemnitee appellants were covered by the indemnification provision.they argue that,under cases such as florida aviation,so long as one of the claims alleged was that the indemnitee appellants were vicariously liable for ge negligence,this was enough to trigger ge duty to defend them against all claims raised in the litigation.the district court,however,did not focus on whether such claims had been raised against the indemnitee appellants instead,the court focused on whether such claims would be successful,concluding that none of the three parties can be held vicariously or constructively liable for ge negligence.
had the indemnification provision in the purchasing agreement stated that ge had to defend the indemnitee appellants and went no further,we would agree with the indemnitee appellants argument.it is clear that the district court did not follow the methodology commonly employed by florida courts in the context,where the focus is on the claims raised against the indemnitee,not on the ultimate success of such claims.see cbm,so d at jones,so d at.nevertheless,we agree with the result reached by the district court because the plain language of the indemnification provision in the purchasing agreement trumps the rules that would otherwise apply in the context.
contract interpretation normally raises questions of law for the court to resolve.dec,raphael constr,so d.in interpreting an indemnity agreement,courts are to look to the logical meaning and intent of the contract.misener marine constr.southport marine,so d.in so doing,courts are to remember that w ords in an instrument should be given their natural or most commonly understood meaning.tropabest foods,florida dep t of,so d.
the indemnification provision here states that ge has to pay the damages,losses,and expenses including attorney fees of the indemnitee appellants only to the extent of and on account of any negligent act or omission of contractor ge in performing the work under the contract.exh.a at gc emphasis added.it does not provide,in a manner similar to some indemnity agreements,that ge must make such payments for damages,losses,or expenses that may arise out of a negligent act or omission of ge.cbm,so d at.rather,the wording here is much closer to the indemnity agreement at issue in westinghouse electric prudential insurance of america,the language of which limited the indemnitor payment of claims and expenses to situations where liability was imposed by law.so d.consequently,we conclude that the to the extent of and on account of language indicates that any payment of attorney fees or other expenses is limited to situations where ge itself has been found negligent.because the district court held as a matter of law that ge was free of direct negligence for the collision,ge is not required to reimburse the indemnitee appellants for their attorney fees or other expenses incurred in defending themselves.
in response to this interpretation of the indemnification provision,the indemnitee appellants argue that the phrase negligent act or omission in the provision means either direct negligent or vicarious liability.since ge was held vicariously liable for rountree transport of the turbine,the indemnitee appellants contend that any contractual condition placed on the payment of attorney fees or expenses has been met.we disagree with the indemnitee appellants argument because the word negligent contained in the indemnification provision can not be read to encompass vicarious liability without unnaturally expanding its meaning.
florida law provides that negligence occurs when a person,by some act or omission,fail s to use reasonable care.moransais heathman,so d.in contrast,vicarious liability involves t he imposition of liability on one person for the actionable conduct of another,based solely on a relationship between the two persons.blacks law dictionary ed.in other words,a person is held negligent based on his or her own failure to exercise reasonable care,but a person is held vicariously liable based on another failure to exercise reasonable care.it follows that the words negligent and vicarious liability are not interchangeable because,in terms of liability,the latter is a more expansive concept than the former.had the parties instead meant for both terms to apply to the provision,they could have chosen a word like liability instead of negligent.furthermore,even if the word negligent was ambiguous as to whether it included vicarious liability,i n construing an indemnity provision not given by one in the insurance business but given as an incident to a contract the indemnity provision must be construed strictly in favor of the indemnitor.westinghouse,so d at.any ambiguity in the word negligent thus should be construed in favor of ge to exclude vicarious liability from its scope.
in sum,the indemnification provision in the purchasing agreement placed upon ge both a duty to indemnify and hold harmless and a duty to defend.the district court failed to consider florida precedent that addresses the duty to defend,instead focusing solely on precedent that addresses the contractual duty to indemnify and hold harmless.the district court,however,reached the correct result because the plain language of the indemnification provision trumped the rules that otherwise would apply in the context.more specifically,the provision required that ge be held directly negligent for the collision before it could be required to reimburse the other parties for their attorney fees or other legal expenses incurred in defending themselves.because the district court concluded that,as a matter of law,ge was not negligent,the indemnitee appellants are not entitled to reimbursement for their attorney fees and costs.accordingly,we affirm on the indemnification issue because we can do so as long as the judgment entered is correct on any legal ground regardless of the grounds addressed,adopted,or rejected by the district court.ochran united states,cir quotations omitted.
indemnification agreement between kua and csx 
as previously mentioned,kua entered into the crossing agreement with csx to ensure that there would be vehicular and pedestrian access to the plant.under the crossing agreement,csx granted kua a license to construct,use,and maintain a private road grade crossing across csx railroad tracks.section of the crossing agreement,entitled risk,liability,indemnity,addresses kua duty to defend and indemnify csx in return for receiving the license.section states 
licensee kua,recognizing that railroad csx operations and any use of railroad property,tracks and involves increased risks,expressly assumes all risk of loss and damage to,and waives any right to ask or demand for,property of licensee,or any part thereof,at the crossing including loss of or interference with the use of service thereof,regardless of cause 
exh.a at.section further provides that kua assumes all liability for,and releases and agrees to defend,indemnify,protect and save railroad harmless from and against designated losses and casualties regardless of cause,even if occurring or resulting from the sole or joint fault,failure or negligence of railroad.id.at.in addition,the crossing agreement requires that kua not only defend and indemnify csx,but also any other company whose property at the crossing may be leased or operated by the undersigned railroad,as well as any parent,subsidiary or affiliated system companies of railroad.id.at.
based on the indemnification provision found in the crossing agreement,the rail companies moved for summary judgment and asked the district court to rule as a matter of law that kua had to indemnify them against all property loss or damage they incurred as a result of the collision.they also asked the court to rule that kua had to defend them against all claims for property damage or personal injury in the turbine litigation,and to rule that kua had to indemnify them against any liability incurred as a result of such claims.the court granted summary judgment in favor of csx but denied amtrak motion because material issues of fact remained in dispute.later,after the liability trial,the district court granted amtrak renewed motion for summary judgment,holding that kua had to defend and indemnify amtrak to the same extent that it had to defend and indemnify csx because the amtrak train constituted property that was operated by csx at the time of the collision.see id.at.
on appeal,kua and fmpa collectively,the utility appellants present several arguments as to why we should reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to the rail companies.the utility appellants first assertion is that the indemnity provision is void and unenforceable because,absent specific legislative authority,kua could not waive its sovereign immunity beyond what was authorized by florida statute they also contend that the indemnity provision is void and unenforceable under florida statute because its terms failed to meet the requirements for such provisions when contained in construction contracts.additionally,the utility appellants maintain that due to the indemnity provision,the crossing agreement constituted an exculpatory,or adhesion,contract and that,for this reason,there was a question of fact for the jury as to whether csx possessed a superior bargaining position in the execution of the crossing agreement.they argue,moreover,that the indemnity provision is inapplicable under the facts of this case because the negligent actions of csx occurred in a location separate and apart from the railroad crossing.finally,the utility appellants contend that the district court erred in ruling that amtrak was a beneficiary of the indemnity agreement between kua and csx.
we need not address all of the utility appellants arguments at this time.as we shall explain,the state sovereign immunity issue raised by the utility appellants has not been directly resolved by the supreme court of florida.the issue involves unsettled questions of state law that raise important public policy concerns,and so we have decided that,like the comparative fault issue raised in this case,it should be certified to florida highest court for resolution.since the florida supreme court decision on the state sovereign immunity issue might be dispositive of the crossing agreement dispute,we refrain from addressing the utility appellants other arguments challenging the indemnity provision until the florida supreme court has spoken.
under florida law,the baseline norm is that sovereign immunity applies to actions where the state is a party,but p rovision may be made by general law for bringing suit against the state as to all liabilities now existing or hereafter originating.florida const.art.x.only the florida legislature has authority to enact a general law that waives the state immunity.manatee county longboat key,so d.in the torts context,the florida legislature has authorized a limited waiver of state sovereign immunity through the enactment of florida statute,which provides in part that 
actions at law against the state or any of its agencies or subdivisions to recover damages in tort for money damages against the state or its agencies or subdivisions for injury or loss of property,personal injury,or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the agency or subdivision while acting within the scope of his office or employment under circumstances in which the state or such agency or subdivision,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant,in accordance with the general laws of this state,may be prosecuted subject to the limitations specified in this act 
stat.ann.west section further provides that state liability is limited to per claimant and per accident,unless the florida legislature enacts legislation to pay a particular claim in whole or in part.in contrast,the supreme court of florida has held the limitations imposed by do not apply in actions brought against the state for breach of contract.tobacco department of corrections,so d.
based on these sovereign immunity principles,the utility appellants argue that the indemnification agreement between kua and csx waived state sovereign immunity in tort beyond the limits imposed by the indemnification provision does not limit the amount kua has to pay out per claimant and per accident,as specified in.nor does the provision limit payment by kua to situations where the property loss or personal injury is caused by a negligent act or omission committed by one of its employees.see.
in contrast,the indemnity provision does require kua to defend and indemnify csx against all claims and liability for property damage or personal injury connected in any manner with the construction,reconstruction,maintenance,existence,use,condition,repair,change,relocation or subsequent removal of the crossing.exh.a at c.indeed,in the present case,the rail companies seek reimbursement even though kua was cleared of all negligence for the collision,and even though the rail companies never had to defend against a claim that they were vicariously liable for negligent misconduct by kua.thus,the utility appellants contend,the terms of the indemnification provision go far beyond what is authorized by florida statute.they maintain that,as a result,we should not give effect to the terms of the indemnification provision.see evanston ins.homestead,so d,per curiam a contract may not give validity to an illegal act,notwithstanding upon whom the hardship should fall.
there is case law that appears to support the utility appellants position.for instance,in evanston,a florida city bought an excess professional liability insurance policy that provided coverage to the city for tort claims that exceeded.if the insurance company settled a claim,the policy required the city to reimburse the company for the retained limit.the insurance company settled a medical malpractice claim against the city for and sought reimbursement of.the city refused,instead agreeing to reimburse the company only for,the maximum waiver of sovereign immunity allowed under.the insurance company brought suit,alleging that did not apply because the suit was for breach of contract.the florida court disagreed,holding that the insurance contract could not be used to circumvent the limits of.evanston,so d at.similarly,in seaboard air line railroad drainage district,the fifth circuit held that an unlimited indemnity agreement between a florida drainage district and a railroad was void as against public policy because the district could not be compelled to do through an indemnification contract what it could not be compelled to do in a torts damages suit,cir.
based on cases like,the argument goes,an indemnification agreement between a state agency and a private company,like the one between kua and csx,can not be used to circumvent the dictates of.that is,kua should not be compelled,based on an indemnification agreement,to pay out funds that it could not be compelled to pay out in a torts damages suit.this assertion is buttressed by another case,donisi trout,so d.in donisi,the state appellate court held that an indemnification agreement between a city and its employee was void in so far as it required the city to reimburse the employee in an amount that exceeded the limits imposed by.so d at.
the utility appellants also point to several opinions by the attorney general of the state of florida to solidify their position they argue that these opinions demonstrate that a state agency is prohibited from entering into an indemnity agreement if it fails to comply with the limits imposed by the agreement entered into between kua and the agency is otherwise authorized to do so by the florida legislature.for instance,in opinion,the florida attorney general concluded that no state law authorized a county to enter into an indemnification agreement that increased the limits of liability beyond what allows.op.att y april.similarly,in opinion,the attorney general concluded that the department of corrections did not have statutory authority to enter into an indemnity agreement with a private company that circumvented the limitations imposed by.op.att y march,see also.op.att y february,stating that no statute authorized the department of health and rehabilitative services to agree by contract to indemnify another governmental entity in a manner that altered the state immunity under.
in rebuttal to these arguments,the rail companies assert that the utility appellants can not rely on because it only governs torts actions.in provident management treasure island,the florida supreme court stated that applies only when the government entity is being sued in tort and when the damages flow from tortious conduct.so d.in contrast,the rail companies contend,the present case involves a suit for breach of contract,namely,the failure by kua to fulfill its contractual obligation to defend and indemnify the rail companies.breach of contract claims,the rail companies claim,are governed by the rule enunciated in.in,the florida supreme court stated that i n section the legislature has explicitly waived sovereign immunity in tort.there is no analogous waiver in contract.nonetheless,the legislature has,by general law,explicitly empowered various state agencies to enter into contracts.so d at.the court then went on to hold that where the state has entered into a contract fairly authorized by the powers granted by general law,sovereign immunity does not apply to the breach of contract action.id.
according to the rail companies,indicates that,as long as kua was fairly authorized by general law to enter into contracts like the crossing agreement,sovereign immunity does not protect kua from the breach of its contractual duty to defend and indemnify the rail companies.to show that kua was fairly authorized to enter into the crossing agreement,the rail companies point to several provisions of florida law the powers given municipalities under article viii,b of the florida constitution the municipal home rule powers act,florida statute the florida interlocal cooperation act,florida statute and the joint power act,florida statute.
the rail companies argument is buttressed by the fact that the cases that appear to support the utility appellants position can be distinguished.evanston,for instance,failed to address and failed to discuss how the latter decision might affect the sovereign immunity analysis contained therein.moreover,donisi was decided prior to,as was.furthermore,in contrast to such cases,the rail companies point to a florida case,jacksonville franco,where the court upheld an indemnification agreement between a city and a private railroad because the clear and unequivocal language of the contract put the city on notice of its contractual obligations.so d,quotations omitted.
the rail companies also contrast the fifth circuit decision in with seaboard air line railroad crisp,where the fifth circuit held that a georgia county could not assert a sovereign immunity defense when it had entered into a license with a private railroad under which the county assumed liability for damage occasioned to a railroad embankment,cir.the county had entered into the license as part of its efforts to build a hydroelectric dam.the fifth circuit distinguished the case from and concluded that,because operation of the dam was a business operation,the county should be treated like any other business that breaches a contract,thus rendering sovereign immunity inapplicable.id.similarly,the rail companies argue that operation of the plant by the utility appellants is itself a business operation,and so the utility appellants should be treated like any other business that breaches a contract.
in addition,the rail companies respond to the utility appellants citation to opinions of the florida attorney general.the rail companies argue that these opinions are misleading because the attorney general,in issuing his opinions,has applied a stricter standard than that provided for in.they maintain that the attorney general has erroneously failed to apply and has instead concluded that state agencies have no authority to enter into indemnification agreements that exceed the dictates of,unless a florida statute specifically indicates otherwise.in contrast,the rail companies contend that makes clear that an indemnification agreement between a state agency and private party is binding and enforceable as long as it is part and parcel of a contract that itself was fairly authorized by florida law.so d at.
finally,the rail companies argue that,even if does not apply and controls,the utility appellants did not violate by entering into the indemnification agreement the rail companies note that specifically provides that when state agencies contract with one another,s uch a contract must not contain any provision that requires one party to indemnify or insure the other party for the other party negligence or to assume any liability for the other party negligence.stat.ann.by negative implication,they assert,authorizes state agencies to agree by contract to defend and indemnify private parties as they so choose.in any event,the rail companies contend that the florida interlocal cooperation act,florida statute k exempts the utility appellants from the limitations of.
in reply to the arguments of the rail companies,the utility appellants argue that is irrelevant to the present case and that applies.they claim that there is a distinction between contracts in which a state agency offers to pay for goods or services,and indemnification contracts,where the agency agrees to assume the tort liability of a private party,the utility appellants maintain,was limited to situations where a state agency breaches a contract to pay for goods or services from a private party.furthermore,they assert that,even if does apply,kua was not fairly authorized under any florida statute to enter into the species of contract at issue here,namely,an indemnification contract in which it assumed the tort liability of a private party.so d at.in contrast,other state agencies explicitly have been given the authority to enter into indemnification agreements.see florida statute authorizing the department of environmental protection to enter into indemnification agreements to effectuate beach erosion control authorizing state agencies to enter into indemnification agreements with asbestos consultants.
upon reviewing all of these arguments,we have concluded that there is no clear answer,based on florida precedent,for resolving this sovereign immunity dispute and the important public policy concerns associated therewith.it is an unsettled question whether the indemnification agreement entered into between kua and csx is controlled by.it also is unsettled whether the agreement should be governed by the sovereign immunity rule for actions,as laid down in.indemnification agreements appear to occupy a grey area between two lines of florida precedent that address state sovereign immunity,one of which deals with torts actions,the other with actions.moreover,even if applies,it is unclear,under existing florida precedent,if kua loses its sovereign immunity protection only if it had statutory authority to enter into the particular species of contract at issue here,an indemnification contract,or if kua loses such protection as long as it had general statutory authority to contract with private parties.
concluding that the sovereign immunity issues raised in this case involve unanswered questions of florida law that are not specifically addressed by controlling state precedent,we certify the following three questions of law to the supreme court of florida for review 
given that kissimmee utility authority,a municipal agency under florida law,agreed by contract to indemnify a private party,is the agreement controlled by the restrictions on waiver of sovereign immunity found in florida statute 
is the indemnification agreement instead controlled by the rule for actions enunciated in tobacco.department of corrections,so d 
if applies,does a municipal agency like kissimmee utility authority lose the protection of sovereign immunity only if it has specific statutory authorization to enter into indemnification agreements,or is it sufficient that the agency more generally has statutory authorization to contract with private parties 
our phrasing of the certified questions is not meant to limit,in any way,how the florida supreme court responds to the questions or analyzes the state law issues involved therein,should the court decide to accept this certification.
iii.conclusion 
these consolidated appeals ensued after the district court issued its final judgment respecting a incident in which an amtrak passenger train collided with a hauler rig that was transporting a combustion turbine and turbine enclosure.on appeal,aha challenged several district court rulings that affected its damages award.with respect to aha arguments,we have ruled that the district court correctly restricted the evidence aha,as subrogee of,could introduce to prove the damages incurred by,and we have ruled that the court correctly directed a verdict as to the amount of damages aha had proven.we also have determined that the court properly held that transport of the combustion turbine was inherently dangerous as a matter of florida law,and that aha was not entitled to prejudgment interest.we have decided,however,to certify one of the issues raised by aha to the florida supreme court for review.the issue concerns the interrelationship between vicarious liability and comparative fault under florida statute.additionally,we have heard the appeals filed by kua,fmpa,and concerning the district court ruling that ge did not have to defend and indemnify them,and we have affirmed that ruling.finally,we have considered the appeals of kua and fmpa challenging the district court holding that they had to defend and indemnify csx and amtrak.because of the important issues of state law sovereign immunity raised by kua and fmpa,we have certified three questions to the florida supreme court for resolution.to assist in the consideration of all four questions that have been certified herein,we direct the clerk of the court to transmit this certificate,as well as the entire record and the briefs of the parties,to the florida supreme court.until such time as the florida supreme court responds to our certified questions,all further proceedings in these consolidated appeals are stayed.
affirmed in part and questions certified.
after the district court issued its order,kua filed an interlocutory appeal with our court.kua argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to csx because it was entitled to sovereign immunity under florida law.we held that we lacked jurisdiction to resolve an appeal based on issues of state law sovereign immunity because the matter was not final and because such issues were not entitled to interlocutory review.csx,kissimmee util,cir.
the parties initially appealed from the final judgment issued by the district court on june.fmpa,however,moved to dismiss and remand because the district court had failed to dispose of aha motion to alter or amend the judgment or for a new trial filed pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.as a consequence,we ordered that the appeal be held in abeyance pending the district court resolution of the rule motion.thereafter,the district court signed a memorandum order disposing of the rule motion,and on october the court issued an amended final judgment from which the parties now appeal.
ge,and rountree also seek review of the district court ruling that transport of the combustion turbine was inherently dangerous.
in its first order related to the indemnity issue,the district court ruled that kua had to defend and indemnify csx.in a later order,the court ruled that kua had to defend and indemnify amtrak.in neither of these orders did the court refer to rail companies originally sued only kua for contractual indemnity.fmpa subsequently filed a motion to be added as an additional defendant with regard to the indemnification claim brought by the rail companies against kua.fmpa requested that it be added as a defendant because,under its participation agreement with kua,fmpa was required to pay of any sums that kua paid out as a consequence of the turbine litigation.the district court granted fmpa motion,and after its joinder as a defendant,fmpa actively litigated and opposed the indemnity claims against kua in its own its amended final judgment,the district court stated that in its two summary judgment orders regarding the indemnity issue,it had ruled that both kua and fmpa had to defend and indemnify the rail companies.this is technically incorrect because only kua is mentioned in those orders.but when the summary judgment orders are read in conjunction with the court order concerning joinder of fmpa,and in conjunction with the terms of the participation agreement,the amended final judgment is reflective of the net effect of all these rulings,namely,that fmpa along with kua is required to defend and indemnify the rail companies.
both during the damages trial and on appeal,aha has referred to the value of the undamaged equipment in boxes as salvage value.the use of this terminology only sows confusion.the undamaged equipment in boxes was not salvaged from the scene of the collision because it was never present at the collision.the only salvage in this case was the equipment contained in box that was retrieved from the accident and that retained some value even after it was damaged.
aha never introduced invoices or other documentation showing the costs it incurred in obtaining and customizing the other equipment in box.
having ruled that aha had proven damages in the amount of,the court reduced the proven damages by to.this reduction in damages is discussed infra at sections.
we recognize that aha insurance valuation purported to subtract out profit component for the equipment in boxes.but aha has not explained how the profit figure was generated.even dean summers,the corporate risk manager,indicated in his proffered deposition that he was unsure about the figure q.in your letter here you say,i am still visiting with various individuals who may be able to shed more light on how profits are figured.who were you visiting in that.dean summers probably carl shook,probably rick stewart,other people at jacinto.and what did they tell you in terms of how much profit is in the main unit as opposed to the auxiliary.i not sure they really told me anything as far as profit.i do have a recollection of knowing what the profit was on the unit,whether it be as a whole or whether it be salvage value,except what was stated here.and i could tell you how that number was arrived at.that number was acceptable to us,as it was acceptable to american.well,i understand it may be acceptable to both of you,but my question is what is the basis for arriving at.i could tell.karcher objection.which number are you talking about.roper i was referring,and i think the witness was referring to the profit figure on the undamaged.karcher oh.by roper is that.yes,dep.at november,proffered at.it is therefore unclear whether aha employed a valuation methodology that reliably extricated all of profits with regard to boxes.in addition,and more importantly,there is no evidence that aha attempted to subtract out the profit component from its insurance valuation for the equipment contained in box,the box most central to this case.
aha seeks to justify its damages calculation,which includes a profit component,by relying on the actual loss rule under.section,however,is applicable only to common carriers under the interstate commerce act.aha has presented no evidence that any of the parties are subject to the act.even if aha was correct and applies,an exception to the actual loss rule exists where the shipper or manufacturer can replace a shipment at cost and suffers no loss of profit.philips consumer elecs.arrow carrier.because eventually fulfilled its contract with a replacement combustion turbine and turbine enclosure and thus did not lose its profit on the contract,the actual loss rule does not apply,and the proper measure of damages under the interstate commerce act would be the replacement cost of the damaged goods.oa
