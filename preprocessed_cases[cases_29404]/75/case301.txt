background 
factual background 
are truck drivers who operate commercial trucks to haul materials to and from mines and quarries.dillon resources,is a licensed staff leasing company who hires truck drivers and assigns them to work for trucking company clients.sunset ennis is an interstate trucking company based in waxahachie,texas.sunset logistics,based in fort worth,texas,is a logistical support company to other trucking companies,including sunset ennis,and engages in some trucking operations.
the relationship between the defendants 
dillon maintains staff leasing agreements with sunset logistics and sunset ennis collectively,the sunset companies.under the agreements terms,dillon and the trucking companies share responsibility for the truck drivers and consider themselves joint employers of the drivers.the sunset companies are responsible for the supervision of and liability for the drivers and for recruiting,qualifying,training,disciplining,and terminating drivers assigned to them.dillon reserves the right of direction and control over drivers assigned to the sunset companies.it is responsible primarily for the payment of wages and payroll taxes and retains the right to hire,fire,discipline,and reassign drivers.dillon is compensated by clients such as the sunset companies for recruiting and providing qualified drivers.
defendants trucking operations 
sunset logistics and sunset ennis are authorized by the department of transportation dot federal motor carrier safety administration as common carriers of property by motor vehicle in interstate or foreign commerce.sunset logistics,on its own behalf and on behalf of sunset ennis,solicited and received interstate work from its customers.
dillon hired plaintiffs as truck drivers and assigned them to drive commercial trucks for sunset logistics and sunset ennis the drivers transported construction materials within the state of texas.some drivers also transported aggregate,sand,gravel,and crushed rock materials used in construction across state lines into other states,such as oklahoma,and from other states into texas.truck drivers for sunset logistics and sunset ennis also transported construction materials for the sunset companies customer,txi.txi owns and operates aggregate plants in oklahoma and concrete plants in texas.txi orders aggregate from its oklahoma plants and ships them via rail from oklahoma to the dallas and celina rail terminals.txi hires trucking companies,like the sunset companies,to transport the aggregate from the rail terminals to its texas plants.
plaintiffs employment as drivers 
as drivers,plaintiffs must meet dot and federal motor carrier safety regulations fmcsr requirements prior to assuming their driving duties.plaintiffs must have a valid class a commercial drivers license and meet the driver qualification requirements of fmcsr parts and upon hire,plaintiffs are issued the fmcsr pocketbook,a compilation of relevant regulatory information.the drivers also participate in new hire safety orientation to review the fmcsr and the difference between interstate and intrastate hours of service regulations.after being hired,plaintiffs must record their hours of service and complete driver vehicle inspection reports pursuant to the fmcsr.
during the relevant time period,plaintiffs received their assignments from a dispatch service before the start of their shifts.the dispatch notified the drivers regarding the number of loads they had been assigned and the loads and delivery locations.no driver had a dedicated route.the assignments were based on various factors,including the driver available hours,whether the driver has sufficient available hours to complete the load assignment and still remain within regulatory requirements regarding maximum hours driven and customer requirements.based on these factors,the loads for each truck driver were distributed,any driver could be called upon at any time to make an interstate or intrastate trip.the drivers employment could be terminated if they refused an assignment.
procedural background 
in april,plaintiffs sued dillon,sunset logistics,and sunset ennis in texas state court for unpaid overtime under the flsa,a.defendants timely removed to the district court for the northern district of texas.
in june,plaintiffs filed a motion for notice to putative class members pursuant to b,the flsa collective action provision and a motion to toll the flsa statute of limitations pending the outcome of the motion.plaintiffs argued that defendants failed to pay overtime and that company policy encouraged working unpaid overtime by imposing financial,failure to pay bonuses or a flat rate when there was no drivers failed to complete all assigned deliveries on time.in july,the district court denied both motions.the district court agreed with defendants that plaintiffs affidavits only offered conclusory allegations that did not state personal knowledge of discrimination and did not demonstrate whether other putative class members wanted to opt in to the lawsuit.however,the district court declined to consider defendants remaining arguments.
in march,plaintiffs filed their first amended collective action petition.in april,defendants filed an answer in which they asserted,among other defenses,that plaintiffs claims were barred because the work they performed fell within the motor carrier act mca exemption to the flsa.
both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue of whether the mca exemption applied to defendants.in june,the district court concluded that the mca exemption applied to sunset logistics and sunset ennis,but that dillon had not provided sufficient evidence to prove its entitlement to the exemption.the district court also concluded that the drivers duties fell within the secretary of transportation secretary power,and therefore the exemption applied,but only to the period in which each driver was engaged or could have been called to engage in interstate commerce.accordingly,the district court held the motions in abeyance and ordered additional briefing regarding the mca exemption applicability to each plaintiff,including competent summary judgment evidence and whether dillon qualifies as a motor carrier 
after the supplemental briefing was completed,the court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs motion on july.the district court held that the mca exemption applied to dillon because it is a joint employer with the sunset companies,both of whom are subject to the exemption and defendants summary judgment evidence was sufficient to prove that the exemption applied to all plaintiffs.the district court also dismissed plaintiffs claims with prejudice.plaintiffs timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court.allen mcwane,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the record discloses that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.celotex catrett.the moving party has the burden of demonstrating that there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute.allen,at.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,drawing all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant favor.see id.citation omitted.
b.the flsa and the motor carrier act exemption 
the flsa requires employers to compensate employees engaged in commerce for all hours worked over forty each week at the rate of one and times their regular rate.a.the statute also specifically exempts certain employers employees from its overtime requirements.id.exemptions under the flsa are construed narrowly against the employer,and the employer bears the burden to establish a claimed exemption.barefoot dairymen,wl,at cir,per curiam citing levinson spector motor.
in this case,defendants assert the mca exemption,which states that the flsa overtime requirement shall not apply to any employee with respect to whom the secretary of transportation has power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of section of title of the mca.b.according to the department of labor dol regulations enforcing the flsa,the application of the mca exemption to an employee depends both on the class to which his employer belongs and on the class of work involved in the employee job.a.accordingly 
the power of the secretary of transportation to establish maximum hours and qualifications of service of employees,on which exemption depends,extends to those classes of employees and those only who are employed by carriers whose transportation of passengers or property by motor vehicle is subject to his jurisdiction under section of the motor carrier act codified at,and engage in activities of a character directly affecting the safety of operation of motor vehicles in the transportation on the public highways of passengers or property in interstate or foreign commerce within the meaning of the motor carrier act.
id.further,we have stated that t he secretary need only possess the power to regulate the employees at issue it need not actually exercise that power for the mca exemption to apply.barefoot,wl,at citing levinson,at.
application of the motor carrier exemption 
employed by carriers subject to the secretary power 
the first inquiry is whether plaintiffs are employed by carriers whose transportation of property by motor vehicle is subject to the secretary jurisdiction.a.to be subject to the secretary of transportation jurisdiction pursuant to the mca,a motor carrier must be engaged in interstate commerce 
although the mca defines interstate commerce as commerce between a place in a state and a place in another state,it has not been applied literally by the courts.in fact,we have defined it as the actual transport of goods across state lines or the intrastate transport of goods in the flow of interstate commerce.
siller l f distributors,wl,at cir per curiam citing merchant fast motor lines,icc,cir.
plaintiffs do not dispute that sunset ennis and sunset logistics,two trucking companies,are motor carriers subject to the secretary power.instead,they argue that dillon,a staff leasing agency,is not a motor carrier within the meaning of the mca.defendants assert that because the sunset companies are motor carriers and the sunset companies are joint employers with dillon,dillon is also a motor carrier within the meaning of the mca.
while fifth circuit precedent is limited on this issue,other courts have held that a staff leasing company who provides employees for a motor carrier and operates as a joint employer with the carrier meets the requirements of a.see,moore universal coordinators,cir holding that truck drivers were employees of both noncarrier truck driver leasing company and private motor carrier and therefore mca exemption extended to leasing company.the moore court analyzed the mca and the flsa,and determined that congress intended to regulate employees of carriers in the interest of safety.id.at.therefore,the secretary power had to extend to leased drivers and to the leasing company that employed them.id.at.
in a more recent case,the district court cited congressional safety concerns as the rationale for extending the exemption 
the mca exemption,as explained in moore,safeguards the secretary authority to regulate the qualifications and maximum hours of employees whose work affects the safety of operation of a motor carrier refusing to extend the mca exemption to the staffing agency defendants would therefore facilitate what congress sought to of the secretary regulatory authority.
tidd adecco usa,wl,at,citing moore,at.
applying moore and tidd,the evidence supports a finding that dillon,as joint employer with sunset logistics and sunset ennis,is a carrier subject to the secretary jurisdiction.dillon is a staff leasing company who provides drivers to sunset logistics and sunset ennis to fulfill interstate work orders from clients for compensation.our review of the record reflects the following evidence dillon hires and trains the drivers and is responsible for their payroll,the sunset companies are responsible for control of the drivers operations,and dillon is reimbursed for wages and benefits paid to the drivers and receives a fee when the drivers are assigned.these facts are similar to tidd,in which the staffing agency defendants were held as joint employers to fedex,a motor carrier,and,therefore,subject to the secretary jurisdiction.see tidd,wl,at.accordingly,we hold that the first requirement for jurisdiction under the,that plaintiffs work for carriers engaged in interstate met.see barefoot,wl,at.
engaged in activities that directly affect operational safety of motor vehicles in transport of property in interstate commerce 
the second part of the mca exemption inquiry is whether the plaintiffs engage in activities that directly affect the operational safety of motor vehicles in the transport of property in interstate commerce as defined by the mca.a.it is undisputed that plaintiffs,as truck drivers subject to dot requirements,are employed in positions that affect the operational safety of motor vehicles.see barefoot dairymen,aff,wl cir,per curiam truck drivers are engaged in activities of a character affecting safety that subject them to the power of the secretary if the drivers are required to complet e dot logs recording the time spent driving,pass dot written and driving tests,complet e various dot forms,and pass a dot physical drug test.
we therefore determine whether plaintiffs activities directly affected motor vehicle safety in the transport of property in interstate commerce.a.we have stated it is the character of the activities,rather than the proportion of the employee time or activities that determines the secretary jurisdiction to regulate employees under the mca and therefore determines whether the mca exemption of the flsa applies.barefoot,wl,at citing morris mccomb.
plaintiffs assert that the secretary jurisdiction only applies to transportation across state lines,and therefore that defendants must demonstrate that each driver personally transported property by motor vehicle across state lines.but the supreme court held in morris that the interstate commerce commission icc,the predecessor to the dot,had jurisdiction to regulate all of defendant carrier drivers,even though two of the drivers had not engaged in interstate trips during the relevant period,and that the drivers were not entitled to overtime under the flsa.morris,at.in that case,the carrier few interstate trips of all trips during the relevant period were distributed indiscriminately to all drivers.id.at.the supreme court noted that,in practical terms,the safety concerns facing a carrier who sent every driver on an interstate trip would be the same if the carrier sent only some or most of its drivers on interstate trips.see id.at.therefore,the icc had the power to regulate all of defendant drivers,and the than the that power was the test as to whether the employees were entitled to overtime pay under the flsa.id.at.see also barefoot,wl,at the secretary need only possess the power to regulate the employees at issue it need not actually exercise that power for the mca exemption to apply.citing levinson,at.
additionally,the flsa regulations promulgated by the dol and the dot notice of interpretation have clarified that if drivers can be reasonably expected to perform interstate transport,the mca exemption applies.the flsa regulations state that generally,if the employee job duties are such that he is or is likely to be called upon in the ordinary course of his work to perform,either regularly or from time to time,activities of a driver,he comes within the mca exemption in all workweeks when he is employed at such job.b.
this general rule assumes that the activities involved in the continuing duties of the jo
