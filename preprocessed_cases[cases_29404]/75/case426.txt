defendant,airline professionals association of the international brotherhood of teamsters,local union,union,appeals the injunction entered by the district court on behalf of plaintiff,abx air,abx.the union argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to issue an injunction because its members concerted refusal to bid for time did not constitute an impermissible strike in aid of a minor dispute.rather,it asserts that its members concerted action was in accord with the collective bargaining agreement cba and was not a strike action relating to the separate minor dispute over the cba rule.in its,abx contends that the district court erred by denying it monetary damages as a remedy for an illegal strike in aid of a minor dispute based on csx,marquar,cir.
we affirm the district court factual finding that this case involves a minor dispute over the rule and reverse its ruling that the concerted action of the crew members constituted a strike.
background 
abx,also known as airborne express,is a major air freight carrier.in june,abx and the union entered into a new cba.under article of the agreement,crew members voluntarily bid for times,which are scheduled flights that have not been assigned as part of a crew member monthly schedule,are open because of an employee absence or an assignment change,or have not been bid upon.time is awarded to eligible senior crew members first.if any flights remain,the company assigns junior crew members who are compensated at a higher rate of pay,a practice called.
the union and abx had a number of unresolved grievances regarding the interpretation of the old and new cbas.in particular,they disagreed on how to interpret the new rule,a provision requiring a minimum of three days off for crew members with any scheduled.both parties agreed to submit this minor dispute for arbitration in october 
in august,the union executive board members decided that they would not bid on time until the union disputes and grievances with the company were resolved.the executive board announced its decision at a subsequent membership meeting,and a number of attendees stated that they too would not bid for.following this,a memorandum from the executive board president and the union telephone hotlines focused on the rule dispute and the decision by the board and members to not bid on time until their problems with abx were resolved.all hotlines urged members to remain percent united.in response to a letter from abx stating that the union concerted refusal to bid on time was illegal,one hotline stated that your union leadership is not asking you to exercise any illegal job action.another hotline stated that each of us needs to prepare for the long haul should management continue down the road they have chosen with regard to scheduling.
in september,no union member bid on time,and of the open lines available in october,only bids were submitted.some of those who bid on october flights stated they were harassed by other union members.abx claims the union action cost it more than for the additional required.though it had won prior bids for christmas season charter contracts,abx did not compete for a million contract in based on staffing concerns raised by the ban.
abx filed a complaint alleging that the union and its members boycotted bidding and that this concerted action constituted an illegal strike in aid of a minor dispute in violation of.it also asserted that this concerted action violated the union mandatory duty under,first to exert every reasonable effort to resolve its dispute with abx over the proper interpretation of the rule.abx requested injunctive,declaratory,and monetary remedies.
the district court rejected abx initial request for a preliminary injunction,holding that abx had not shown that the concerted ban on had caused an interruption in its operations.in considering article of the cba,it stated by declining to bid for overtime but accepting it when assigned,defendant members may exert influence without interrupting plaintiff operations and,thus,without engaging in a strike.therefore,without an interruption in operations,the court ruled that the union members action was not a strike,and it had no jurisdiction to issue an injunction.upon an interlocutory appeal,this court ruled that the injunction request was moot because the bidding ban had ceased,but remanded the case for further consideration of the declaratory and monetary relief issues.see abx air,airline prof l ass of the int l of teamsters,local,wl cir.
at the subsequent trial,the court considered the question of whether the actions of the union and its members constituted an interruption of operations at abx and thus an illegal strike.in its findings of fact,the court found that the union conceived of and promoted the ban on,and that its members concerted action was in aid of the minor dispute over the rule,which was subject to arbitration.in defining strike,the court relied on of the national labor relations act nlra,which states that the term strike includes a concerted interruption of operations by employees.as a question of first impression and in the absence of authority to the contrary,the court concluded that the definition of strike encompasses concerted activity by employees,promoted and directed by their union,pending resolution of a minor dispute,that disrupts the employer operations and causes a loss of business or profit with the intention of exerting pressure upon the employer to change its interpretation of the existing collective bargaining agreement.on this basis,the court held that the union activities violated and,first,and thus it had jurisdiction to enjoin the union from threatened future action.in addition,the court denied abx prayer for money damages based on csx,marquar,cir.
the union appeals the district court ruling on declaratory and injunctive relief,and abx its denial of monetary damages 
ii.standard of review 
the district court factual findings must be upheld unless they are clearly erroneous.taylor and gaskin,citing.a.as a matter of law,this court reviews de novo the district court statutory construction of the railway labor act rla regarding the scope of its subject matter jurisdiction.see united states brown,cir.
iii.discussion 
under,all rla provisions under et apply to air carriers engaged in interstate and foreign commerce and their employees,except which is replaced by.section,first sets forth two core duties applicable in all disputes between carriers and their employees.see consolidated rail railway labor executives ass n,d hereinafter conrail marquar,at citing chicago ry.united transp.union,d.first,both parties shall exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay,rules,and working conditions.marquar,at citation omitted.second,both parties shall settle all disputes,whether arising out of the application of agreements or otherwise,in order to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier growing out of any dispute.brotherhood of trainmen chicago river,d hereinafter chicago river citation omitted.
because there is no equivalent of the national railroad adjustment board for the airline industry,requires every carrier and its employees to establish an adjustment board by agreement.see conrail,at.if the parties fail to settle disputes growing out of grievances,or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay,rules,or working conditions through negotiation,one or both of the parties may petition the adjustment board to resolve it.see also conrail,at.
under the rla,the supreme court distinguishes between major and minor disputes between carriers and employees regarding their cbas.see conrail,at.acknowledging the first recognition of this distinction under elgin,joliet ry.burley.major disputes involve disagreements over the creation of contractual rights during bargaining for a cba or to change the terms of an existing agreement.see marquar,at.under,seventh and,the parties must exhaust a lengthy bargaining and mediation process.see id.both are obligated to maintain the status quo during the required process,and the co
