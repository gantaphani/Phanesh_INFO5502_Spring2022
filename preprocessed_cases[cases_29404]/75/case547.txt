ford hired frevert as an employee in february as a material control supervisor.six months later,frevert became a rail dock supervisor.throughout his employment,frevert worked at ford kansas city assembly plant in claycomo,missouri the plant.he was a salaried manager in the material planning and logistics organization mp l.
on august,frevert anonymously called ford and gave a detailed description of the events and employees who had engaged in activities that frevert believed were in violation of company policy.he gave the personnel relations representative the fake name don to preserve his anonymity.frevert reported that another employee,came to work drunk,left early,took long lunches,intimidated employees,gave other employees preferential treatment,retaliated against employees who crossed her,and was in a sexual relationship with another manager.
in his deposition,frevert admitted that he did not believe that did anything that was illegal or that violated the law.additionally,frevert did not report to or work near her or on the same shift.he never personally witnessed any of the incidents that he reported to the hotline instead,he merely reported information provided by other employees.
after the call,the hotline personnel forwarded frevert information to the plant for an investigation by the plant human resources department this department was to report its findings back to personnel relations in dearborn.lori strohl conducted the investigation without knowing who made the call.she spoke with supervisor and learned that had permission to work a flexible schedule.supervisor also denied observing arriving to work drunk or engaging in bullying or other inappropriate behavior.alleged sexual relationship with a manager involved an individual who no longer worked for ford.strohl also found no evidence that had abused her authority.strohl reported her findings to personnel relations in dearborn.

frevert was advised to contact nicole berri,the personnel relations representative in dearborn who was responsible for all of ford assembly plants in the united states.he contacted berri in early october and identified himself as don.he identified david frevert as among those who could provide information about actions.berri forwarded the list of witnesses that frevert had reported to her to strohl.strohl interviewed all of the witnesses,including frevert.strohl instructed frevert and the others not to reveal the topics or information discussed.divulging the contents of such interviews would violate ford policies.
during frevert interview with strohl,frevert reported all of the incidents that he had described during the hotline calls.because it seemed like frevert had a lot of information about other employees within the mp l organization regarding their performance,strohl asked him if he was the spokesperson for mp frevert responded in the affirmative,stating that he was more boisterous.
strohl investigation confirmed some of inappropriate comments and actions.on october,she prepared a proposal for disciplinary action and recommended that be terminated in the best interest of the company.she forwarded the proposal to dearborn.strohl investigation into and alleged pay practice violations revealed no pay practice irregularities.
despite strohl directive against discussing the topic of the interviews with other employees,rumors and discussions regarding the investigation of got back to,who then complained to strohl.provided strohl with emails to support her claim that employees were discussing the investigation.
strohl forwarded the emails to berri and also informed berri of her conversation with berri decided to personally on claim.berri requested that emails of four individuals be,and.according to berri,she chose these individuals based on the content of the emails provided and the amount of information that they provided to strohl about 
berri and paul plant salaried personnel with frevert on november.berri questioned frevert about several emails that she believed violated various ford policies.several of the emails,addressed to frevert wife,had suggestive language,somewhat vulgar pictures,and jokes.berri believed that the emails violated ford computer use policies and sexual harassment policies.berri also questioned frevert about emails that he had forwarded to his home email account and to fellow employee,frevert had grouped all of the emails on his computer and sent them under the heading just in case.when berri asked frevert the purpose of the emails,he said that he was afraid that he was in danger of being fired in retaliation for his whistleblowing and wanted access to them to defend himself.berri believed that these emails violated ford policy against the forwarding of proprietary,confidential,or secret company information to a personal email account.
additionally,berri noticed an email sent by another supervisor,mark cecchini,that frevert had altered by inserting profanity.frevert had forwarded cecchini email to berri considered this email to violate a company policy prohibiting the altering and forwarding of emails without the original sender permission.finally,berri cited an email in which,according to berri,frevert joked about employees not coming to work yet being paid.berri informed frevert that she regarded his conduct as violating ford policies,including those regarding computer and email use and the secrecy of company information.berri told frevert that he could be disciplined for his conduct and could possibly be terminated.
in may,frevert had excellent ratings on his performance reviews and had received a monetary award for good performance.frevert received no discipline for any misconduct until ford investigation into his emails 
after completing the investigation,berri recommended that frevert and be terminated and that and be suspended.berri also approved strohl recommendation that ford terminate berri superiors endorsed her decisions.ford terminated frevert on december.he was told that he was being terminated because of the contents of his emails and that those emails constituted inappropriate use of company computers and behavior unbecoming of a member of management.no ford official told frevert that making the hotline calls or otherwise participating in the investigation into conduct caused or contributed to his termination.

following removal,ford moved for summary judgment,arguing that frevert did not qualify as a whistleblower under missouri public policy exception to the employment doctrine and that,even if he did qualify,ford had provided uncontroverted evidence of its legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for frevert termination.the district court granted ford motion for summary judgment.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,frevert argues that the district court misapplied eighth circuit precedent and missouri law in disregarding an affidavit that frevert filed in opposition to ford motion for summary judgment.according to frevert,the district court ignored evidence in the record and misconstrued missouri law requirements for proving wrongful discharge.specifically,frevert contends that the district court wrongly concluded that he never reported illegal activity to his superiors and that his whistleblowing was not the cause of his firing.
in response,ford asserts that the district court correctly determined that frevert failed to establish a claim for wrongful termination under missouri very narrow exception to the employment doctrine because he failed to allege that he reported any conduct that would violate a statute,rule,or regulation and public policy sufficient to bring him within the asserted whistleblower protection.according to ford,frevert complaint,interrogatory responses,and sworn testimony only support the conclusion that he reported alleged violations of ford own internal policies,which is insufficient to state a claim under missouri law.in the alternative,ford argues that even if frevert could state a claim,it provided legitimate,reasons for terminating frevert based on frevert multiple violations of ford policies.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,viewing the record and drawing all fair inferences from it in a light most favorable to frevert.mack dillon,cir per curiam.in a diversity action such as this,we are required to apply missouri law.lafarge,discovery group,cir.
the employment doctrine is missouri law.margiotta christian hosp.ne,wl,at en banc.in the absence of an employment contract with a definitive statement of duration of employment,an employment at will is created.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.an employer may terminate an employee for any reason or for no reason.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.as a matter of law,the discharged employee has no cause of action for wrongful discharge.fleshner pepose vision,en banc.
the doctrine has limitations,as missouri recognizes the exception to the rule.margiotta,wl,at.but this public policy exception,otherwise known as the wrongful discharge doctrine,is very narrowly drawn.id.at.missouri courts have articulated this narrow doctrine as follows 
where an employer has discharged an employee because that employee refused to violate the law or any well established and clear mandate of public policy as expressed in the constitution,statutes and regulations promulgated pursuant to statute,or because the employee reported to his superiors or to public authorities serious misconduct that constitutes violations of the law and of such well established and clearly mandated public policy,the employee has a cause of action in tort for damages for wrongful discharge.
fleshner,at internal quotations,alteration,and citation omitted emphasis added.a wrongful discharge action must be based on a constitutional provision,a statute,a regulation based on a statute or a rule promulgated by a governmental body.margiotta,wl,at.in the absence of such explicit authority,the wrongful discharge action fails as a matter of law.id.
where a plaintiff claims that he was wrongfully discharged for reporting violations of law or public policy to his superiors,commonly referred to as whistleblowing,the plaintiff must show that he reported to superiors or to public authorities serious misconduct that constitutes a violation of the law and of well established and clearly mandated public policy.id.internal quotations,alteration,and citation omitted.the plaintiff 
mere citation of a constitutional or statutory provision in a pleading is not by itself sufficient to state a cause of action for retaliatory discharge,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the public policy mandated by the cited provision is violated by the discharge.generally,there is no whistleblowing protection for an employee who merely disagrees personally with an employer policy.
id.internal quotations,alteration,and citations omitted t o sustain this type of claim,the petition must specify the legal provision violated by the employer,and it must affirmatively appear from the face of the petition that the legal provision in question involves a clear mandate of public policy.misischia john mercy med,quoting adolphsen hallmark cards.where plaintiff fail s to identify any specific statute,constitutional provision or regulation that was violated,a trial court does not err in dismissing the plaintiff claim.see also porter reardon mach.
for example,v ague reference to theft and misuse of the employer own property are insufficient to state a claim under the narrow public policy exception.link corp,holding that where plaintiff alleged that he was terminated for reporting the misuses and thefts of company telephone services by three managers,the misuse and theft of merchandise by an assistant manager,and the misuse and theft of food merchandise by a merchandise manager,plaintiff complaint failed to state a claim because it did not implicate any statute,regulation or constitutional provision and did not allege that he was disciplined for reporting either to his supervisor or to a public agency violations of a well established and clear public policy that places a positive duty upon the employer.
similarly,where a plaintiff failed to plead any specific criminal violations and instead pleaded generally that the employer was violating federal safety regulations without specify ing the regulations,the plaintiff petition was correctly dismissed as t here was no way,in view of the lack of specificity of the petition,to determine whether the violations amounted to serious misconduct endangering the safety of passengers or employees of the flight department or otherwise involved a clear mandate of public policy.adolphsen,at.when the defendant actions are within a category not generally considered actionable such as discharge of an employee,the specific facts on which liability is based must be pleaded with particularity.see also sivigliano harrah kansas city,holding that the trial court correctly dismissed the plaintiff petition because n o legal provision,let alone a clear mandate of public policy,affirmatively appear s from the face of the plaintiff petition.
here,frevert acknowledges that the accusations against involved solely violations of company policy.seeking to distinguish his case,he asserts that his report about and pay practice violations constitute a report of theft,which is a crime.we must look to frevert petition to see whether he specified the legal provision allegedly violated and whether such legal provision involves a clear mandate of public policy.frevert complaint provides,in relevant part 
on august,the plaintiff made an anonymous phone call to the defendant hotline and proceeded to provide a detailed description of the events and employees who had engaged in activities that the plaintiff believed were in violation of company policy.in making this call,the plaintiff identified himself as don.
the defendant,through its agents,servants and employees,assured the plaintiff of the confidentiality of his report and further assured the plaintiff that a full investigation of the claimed company violations would commence immediately.
that the defendant,instead of focusing its attention on the alleged violations of company policy as reported by the plaintiff,commenced an investigation of the plaintiff along with one or more additional employees for the sole purpose of determining the identity of the hotline caller.
emphasis added.
nowhere in frevert complaint does he allege that and committed pay practice violations in fact,he does not even mention the september,phone call that he made to the hotline containing these allegations against and.a review of frevert answers to interrogatories,however,reveals that he mentioned the september,phone call regarding and.in interrogatories,frevert was asked to
