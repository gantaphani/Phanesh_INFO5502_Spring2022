plaintiff and appellant mitch tanen tanen bought a travel certificate from defendant and respondent southwest airlines southwest in february.he attempted to redeem it months later,after its stated expiration date.when southwest refused to honor the travel certificate,tanen sued,asserting that the expiration date violated civil code section,which makes it unlawful to sell a gift certificate that contains an expiration date.southwest demurred,contending that tanen claims were preempted by the federal airline deregulation act ada.the trial court agreed and sustained the demurrer.
we affirm.for a claim to be preempted by the ada,two things must be true the claim must relate to airline rates,routes or services and the claim must derive from the enactment or enforcement of state law.here,both prongs of this test are met.first,tanen claims relate to services because they concern southwest sale of gift certificates that can be used to purchase airline travel.second,his claims derive from state law because it is on a california statute,civil code section,that tanen bases his claim that the expiration date on the face of the gift certificate is unenforceable.we thus agree with the trial court that tanen claims are preempted by the ada.
factual and procedural history 
tanen filed the present action against southwest on may.he filed a first amended class action complaint complaint on june.the complaint alleged that southwest sells travel certificates,which are redeemable for airline tickets drink certificates,which are redeemable for alcoholic beverages on southwest flights and vacation certificates,which are redeemable for southwest vacation packages.tanen purchased a travel certificate on february,by submitting a completed swa gift certificate order form order form and credit card information.the order form stated,in relevant part,that a ll gift certificates expire one year from the date of issue and will not be extended unless prohibited by law.tanen subsequently received a travel certificate,which stated that it expired on.it also stated that t he certificate must be redeemed and travel must be completed by the expiration date shown on the face of the gift certificate and the v alidity period will not be extended.
the complaint alleged that under civil code section,it is unlawful for any person or entity to sell a gift certificate to a purchaser containing an expiration date.any gift certificate sold after january,shall be redeemable in cash for its cash value,or subject to replacement with a new gift certificate at no cost to the purchaser or holder.accordingly,the complaint asserted that the expiration of the southwest travel,drink,and vacation certificates gave rise to the following causes of action violation of civil code section violation of business and professions code section prohibiting unfair,unlawful,and deceptive trade practices violation of civil code section consumer legal remedies act breach of written contract conversion fraud,deceit,misrepresentation and declaratory relief.it sought compensatory damages,restitution,disgorgement,injunctive relief,punitive damages,and attorney fees.
southwest demurred.it contended that all of tanen claims were preempted by the ada,which preempts any state law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route or service of an air carrier.further,it asserted that many of tanen causes of action were not properly pled,section does not provide for a private right of action,and the vacation and drink certificate claims were not properly before the court.
concurrently with its demurrer,southwest filed a motion to strike all references to and all causes of action relating to vacation and drink certificates.southwest asserted that tanen could not challenge the expiration of vacation certificates because they do not expire.further,he could not adequately plead causes of action as to vacation or drink certificates because he did not purchase either.finally,because he never purchased vacation or drink certificates,tanen did not have standing to raise claims relating to their issuance,nor did he have claims typical of the putative class.
the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend on march.its order stated as follows 
the federal airline deregulation act ada explicitly preempted any state law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route or service of an air carrier.b.congress intended that carriers should not be burdened with conflicting state laws and policies that would have adverse economic consequences on the goal of increasing competition among carriers.power stds,fed.ex,th.
in its application of the ada,the supreme court has twice emphasized the broad scope of the preemption provision.the morales court held that state enforcement actions having a connection with,or reference to,airline rates,routes,or services are preempted by the ada.morales trans world airlines.
in american airlines,wolens,the supreme court addressed ada preemption regarding an airline frequent flyer program.the court held that plaintiffs claims were clearly related to airline rates and services,and thus,the claims were preempted.id.at.the wolens court affirmed morales broad reading of the preemption doctrine,carving out a narrow exception for breach of contract claims that involve a plaintiff seeking to enforce the actual terms of his contract with the airline.
after these two cases,when determining whether a claim is preempted by the ada,courts employ a analysis whether the subject of the claim has a connection with or reference to airline rates,routes,or services,and if so,whether the subject of the claim involves the enforcement by the state of a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law.if both questions are answered in the affirmative,then the ada preempts the claim.osband united airlines.
plaintiff claim that gift certificates relating to the purchase of flights have only a peripheral effect on price is problematic.while the vacation and drink certificates may not directly relate to airline rates,routes,or services,it seems that the travel certificates do.like wolens,which dealt with frequent flyer credit cards,travel certificates that are used like cash to purchase flights are related to an airline rates and services.the travel certificates in question are at the heart of what the ada sought to preempt.
plaintiff breach of contract claim alleges that the travel certificate states that a ll gift certificates expire one year from the date of issue and will not be extended unless prohibited by law.plaintiff notes that california civil code prohibits gift certificates with expiration dates.on april,plaintiff provided notice to defendant that defendant honor the travel certificate despite the passage of one year from the time of purchase.defendant failed to do so and plaintiff alleges breach of contract.
under preemption,defendant argues that no such legal prohibition existed because state law is inapplicable.as defendant notes,plaintiff challenge to the contract is not based on southwest failure to abide by the terms of the contract,but rather,an attempt to use state law to invalidate the contract.
the thrust of plaintiff contract argument is that laws of various states were incorporated into the travel certificate by virtue of the language of unless prohibited by law.because plaintiff breach of contract claim rests on the idea that expiration of the travel certificate violates state laws,it is inconsistent with the ada and congress intent to remove airlines from the conflicting demands of state regulation.wolens,u.at.accordingly,all claims concerning travel certificates,including a breach of contract claim,are preempted as a matter of law and leave to amend to attempt to state any claim regarding travel certificates would be futile.
next,because plaintiff has not alleged that he purchased drink or vacation certificates,he has suffered no damages from their issuance and thus lacks standing to bring his claims.additionally,plaintiff lack of standing forecloses his unfair competition law claim in light of proposition.because plaintiff lacks standing to assert the claims in the first amended complaint that arise from drink and vacation certificates,the court makes no ruling at this time as to application of ada preemption to claims arising from those certificates or as to any other challenges to plaintiff claims regarding those certificates apart from standing.
the court sustained the demurrer with days leave to amend,with amendment limited solely to an attempt to state causes of action pertaining to drink and vacation certificates.
tanen did not file an amended complaint,and on may,the trial court dismissed the action.tanen timely appealed.
standard of review 
we independently review the ruling on a demurrer and determine de novo whether the pleading alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action.we assume the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations,facts that reasonably can be inferred from those expressly pleaded,and matters of which judicial notice has been taken.we affirm the judgment if it is correct on any ground stated in the demurrer,regardless of the trial court stated reasons.las lomas land,llc city of los angeles th.
discussion 
i.the preemption provision of the airline deregulation acta.
in,congress enacted the ada,which largely deregulated domestic air transport.to ensure that the states would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own morales trans world airlines,supra,morales,the ada included an express preemption clause that read in relevant part n o state shall enact or enforce any law,rule,regulation,standard,or other provision having the force and effect of law relating to rates,routes,or services of any air carrier american airlines wolens,supra,wolens,quoting.a.
congress reenacted title of the united states code in.when it did so,it revised the ada preemption clause to read a state may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier b.congress intended the revision to make no substantive change.wolens,supra,at,fn.
the united states supreme court has twice addressed the scope of the ada preemption clause.in morales,supra,the court considered whether the ada preempted air travel industry enforcement guidelines guidelines adopted by state attorneys general that contain ed detailed standards governing the content and format of airline advertising,the awarding of premiums to regular customers frequent flyers,and the payment of compensation to passengers who voluntarily yield their seats on overbooked flights.id.at.these guidelines purported not to create any new laws or regulations,but instead claimed to explain in detail how existing state laws apply to air fare advertising and frequent flyer programs.ibid.
the court concluded that the guidelines were preempted by the ada.it explained that the ordinary meaning of relating to is a broad one to stand in some relation to have bearing or concern to pertain refer to bring into association with or connection with,black law dictionary ed and the words thus express a broad purpose.morales,supra,at.accordingly,s tate enforcement actions having a connection with or reference to airline rates,routes,or services are under.a.morales,supra,at.
applying this standard,the court concluded that the guidelines quite obviously related to fares.morales,supra,at.it explained section,governing print advertisements of fares,requires clear and conspicuous disclosure defined as the lesser of the size of the largest typeface in the ad or type of restrictions section imposes similar,though somewhat less onerous,restrictions on broadcast advertisements of fares and requires billboard fare ads to state clearly and conspicuously substantial restrictions apply if there are any material restrictions on the fares availability section requires that the advertised fare include all taxes and surcharges fares,under,must be disclosed at least as prominently as the fare when the fare is only available on round trips and prohibits use of the words sale,discount,or reduced unless the advertised fare is available only for a limited time and is substantially below the usual price for the same fare with the same restrictions.id.at.the court held that o ne can not avoid the conclusion that these aspects of the guidelines relate to airline rates.in its terms,every one of the guidelines enumerated above bears a reference to airfares.citation.and,collectively,the guidelines establish binding requirements as to how tickets may be marketed if they are to be sold at given prices.id.at.moreover,beyond the guidelines express reference to fares,it is clear as an economic matter that state restrictions on fare advertising have the forbidden significant effect upon fares because a dvertising serves to inform the public of the prices of products and services,and thus performs an indispensable role in the allocation of resources.id.at.thus,the court held the fare advertising provisions of the guidelines were preempted by the ada.id.at.
the supreme court again considered the scope of the ada preemption clause in wolens,supra.wolens was an appeal from two consolidated state court class action suits.plaintiffs in both actions participated in american airlines frequent flyer program,aadvantage.plaintiffs asserted that modifications to the aadvantage program devalued mileage credits.they conceded that american had the right to change its program terms and conditions prospectively,but they asserted that the retroactive application of,devaluing credits previously the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act consumer fraud act and constituted a breach of contract.id.at.
the court held that,under morales,plaintiffs complaints plainly stated claims relating to air carrier rates,routes,or services.wolens,supra,at.it explained plaintiffs claims relate to rates,american charges in the form of mileage credits for free tickets and upgrades,and to services,access to flights and upgrades unlimited by retrospectively applied capacity controls and blackout dates.ibid.the court noted,however,that the ada preemption clause contains other words in need of interpretation,specifically,the words enact or enforce any law in the instruction n o state shall enact or enforce any law relating to air carrier rates,routes,or services.a.ibid.accordingly,the court considered whether the plaintiffs claims were based on laws relating to air carrier rates,routes,or services within the meaning of the ada.id.at,italics added.
the court held that plaintiffs consumer fraud act claims were preempted by the ada it explained t he consumer fraud act serves as a means to guide and police the marketing practices of the airlines the act does not simply give effect to bargains offered by the airlines and accepted by airline customers.in light of the full text of the preemption clause,and of the ada purpose to leave largely to the airlines themselves,and not at all to states,the selection and design of marketing mechanisms appropriate to the furnishing of air transportation services,we conclude that a preempts plaintiffs claims under the consumer fraud act.wolens,supra,at.
the court reached a different result with regard to plaintiffs breach of contract claims.it said we do not read the ada preemption clause to shelter airlines from suits alleging no violation of obligations,but seeking recovery solely for the airline alleged breach of its own,undertakings.as persuasively argued by the united states,terms and conditions airlines offer and passengers accept are privately ordered obligations and thus do not amount to a state enact ment or enforce ment of any law,rule,regulation,standard,or other provision having the force and effect of law within the meaning of a.fn.omitted citation.a remedy confined to a contract terms simply holds parties to their this instance,to business judgments an airline made public about its rates and services.fn.omitted.wolens,supra,at.
since wolens,the supreme court has not again opined on the preemptive scope of the ada.however,in rowe new hampshire motor transport,rowe,it considered the scope of the preemption clause of the federal aviation administration authorization act,which contained the following preemption clause modeled on the ada a state may not enact or enforce a law related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.the court held that this clause preempted two provisions of maine law that regulated the delivery of tobacco to customers within the state.id.at.it noted that in morales,it had described congress goal in enacting the ada as helping assure transportation rates,routes,and services that reflect maximum reliance on competitive market forces,thereby stimulating efficiency,innovation,and low prices,as well as variety and quality.rowe,supra,at.thus,morales had held that s tate enforcement actions having a connection with,or reference to carrier rates,routes,or services are citation that such may occur even if a state law effect on rates,routes or services is only indirect citation that,in respect to,it makes no difference whether a state law is consistent or inconsistent with federal regulation citation and that occurs at least where state laws have a significant impact related to congress deregulatory and objectives citation.rowe,supra,at.morales further said that federal law might not state laws that affect fares in only a tenuous,remote,or peripheral manner.rowe,supra,at.however,the court noted,morales did not say where,or how,it would be appropriate to draw the line,for the state law before it did not present a borderline question.rowe,supra,at.
the court held that,under morales,the maine tobacco law was preempted by the ada because it has a significant and adverse impact in respect to the federal act ability to achieve its objectives.rowe,supra,at.it explained the solicitor general and the carrier associations claim and maine does not deny that the law will require carriers to offer a system of services that the market does not now provide and which the carriers would prefer not to offer.and even were that not so,the law would freeze into place services that carriers might prefer to discontinue in the future.the maine law thereby produces the very effect that the federal law sought to avoid,namely,a state direct substitution of its own governmental commands for competitive market forces in determining to a significant degree the services that motor carriers will provide.id.at.
the court concluded the provision requires the carrier to check each shipment for certain markings and to compare it against the maine attorney general list of proscribed shippers.and it thereby directly regulates a significant aspect of the motor carrier package pickup and delivery service.in this way it creates the kind of regulation that the federal act t o interpret the federal law to permit these,and similar,state requirements could easily lead to a patchwork of state laws,rules,and regulations.that state regulatory patchwork is inconsistent with congress major legislative effort to leave such decisions,where federally unregulated,to the competitive marketplace.rowe,supra,at.
ii.tanen claims relate to airline rates,routes,or services 
taken together,morales,wolens,and rowe stand for the proposition that for a claim to be preempted by the ada,two things must be true the claim must derive from the enactment or enforcement of state law,and the claim must relate to airline rates,routes,or services,either by expressly referring to them or by having a significant economic effect upon them.all world professional travel services,american airlines,d.we thus consider in this section whether tanen claims relate to airline rates,routes,or services in the next section,we consider whether tanen claims derive from the enactment or enforcement of state law.
there appears to be no real disagreement between the parties that tanen claims do not relate to rates or routes.they do not agree,however,as to whether the claims relate to services.southwest claims that tanen claims relate to services namely,its sale of gift certificates that can be used to purchase travel nationwide.tanen disagrees,urging that state laws regulating expiration dates of gift certificates are,at best,only tangentially related to a rate,route or service of an air carrier.for the following reasons,southwest is correct.
as many courts have noted,the federal circuit courts have not devised a uniform test for determining whether a state law action is related to an airline rates,routes,or services.see aquino asiana airlines,th.to the contrary,t he courts of appeals have taken directly conflicting positions on this question of statutory interpretation.northwest airlines,duncan dissent from denial of petition for writ of certiorari see also taj mahal travel,delta airlines,cir,in the absence of definitive guidance from the supreme court,the courts of appeals have struggled with the relationship between the ada preemption clause and state tort claims.the rulings have not been consistent.
at least three circuits have held that services generally represent a or anticipated provision of labor from one party to another elements of the air carrier service bargain include items such as ticketing,boarding procedures,provision of food and drink,and baggage handling,in addition to the transportation itself.these matters are all appurtenant and necessarily included with the contract of carriage between the passenger or shipper and the airline,hodges delta airlines,cir,travel all over the world,kingdom of saudi arabia cir,branche airtran airways,cir.applying this standard,these circuits have concluded that the ada does not preempt a variety of tort claims,including claims for personal injury,defamation,and retaliatory discharge,because enforcement of such tort duties normally will not have the forbidden significant effect on airlines services.hodges,supra,at passenger personal injury claim was not preempted congress intended to prevent the states from regressing on economic deregulation by applying their own laws or rules concerning services,but explicitly preserved airlines duty to respond to tort actions for physical injury or property damage travel all over the world,supra,at defamation claims asserted against airline by travel agency were not preempted these statements,although they refer to travel agency services,certainly do not refer to airline rates,routes,or fact,these statements do not refer to airline at all.moreover,the statements themselves are not services provided by airline within the meaning of the ada.branche,supra,at adopting fifth circuit more expansiv e definition of service held plaintiff retaliatory discharge claim not preempted by ada.
two other circuits have taken a somewhat different approach.in charas trans world airlines,cir,the ninth circuit said that in enacting the ada,congress intended to preempt only state laws and lawsuits that would adversely affect the economic deregulation of the airlines and the forces of competition within the airline industry.id.at.however,n othing in the act itself,or its legislative history,indicates that congress had a clear and manifest purpose to displace state tort law in actions that do not affect deregulation in more than a peripheral manner.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded as follows w hen congress enacted federal economic deregulation of the airlines,it intended to insulate the industry from possible state economic regulation as well.it intended to encourage the forces of competition.it did not intend to immunize the airlines from liability for personal injuries caused by their tortious conduct.like rates and routes,congress used service in a in the public utility,the provision of air transportation to and from various markets at various times.in that context,service does not refer to the pushing of beverage carts,keeping the aisles clear of stumbling blocks,the safe handling and storage of luggage,assistance to passengers in need,or like functions.id.at see also taj mahal travel,delta airlines,supra,at,defamation claims brought by a travel agency against an airline held not preempted by the ada w e do not find it conceptually helpful to distinguish operation or maintenance of aircraf
