in,the general assembly amended the act in response to s ubstantial,recurring deficits in the operations of public transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the regional transportation authority and periodic cash shortages that had occurred and which could bring about a loss of public transportation services throughout the metropolitan region.ilcs b i west.the amendment provided for additional state financial assistance and created metra ilcs west and pace ilcs west and established boards of directors for these new entities.the amendment also changed the composition of and selection process for the rta board.currently,there are directors of the rta board,chosen as follows 
a four directors appointed by the mayor of the city of chicago,with the advice and consent of the city council of the city of chicago,and a fifth director who shall be the chairman of the chicago transit authority.each such director shall reside in the city of chicago except the chairman of the chicago transit authority may live outside the city of chicago.

the metra board has seven directors.the appointments are made by the mayor of chicago one appointment,suburban cook county commissioners from districts three appointments,du page county chairman one appointment,and chairmen of the other collar county boards two appointments.ilcs west.the pace board has directors.appointment authority is allocated to the suburban cook county commissioners from districts six appointments and to each of the chairmen of the collar county boards five appointments.each pace board member must be a chief executive officer of a municipality within one of six regions specified by the statute.the chairman of the pace board is chosen by a majority of the chairmen of the collar county boards and members of the cook county board elected from districts.ilcs west.
plaintiff stroger is president of the cook county board of commissioners and represents the fourth district of cook county.plaintiff scavella is a registered voter residing in calumet city in the fourth district.in count i of their complaint,plaintiffs alleged that,because the act removes the power to appoint directors from the cook county board chief executive officer and places it in the legislative members of that board,the appointment provisions of the act relating to cook county violate the separation of powers doctrine contained in article ii,section,of the constitution.const,art.ii.in count ii of the complaint,plaintiffs alleged that the transfer of appointment power from the cook county board president to certain legislative members of that board constituted an unconstitutional change in the form of cook county government without a referendum,in violation of article vii,section f,of the constitution.const,art.vii,f.count iii of the complaint alleged that the appointment provisions of the act violate the one person,one vote guarantee of the constitution.const,art.i,art.iii,because commissioners elected from cook county districts where the majority of residents reside inside chicago which is the case in the fourth district are precluded from voting to appoint directors to the rta board.thus,according to plaintiffs,only cook county board members from districts,and may vote for directors of the rta board.plaintiffs alleged that this effectively disenfranchised scavella and approximately other voters,giving them no voice in the appointment of directors to the rta board.
the circuit court granted defendants motion to dismiss.the appellate court did not address plaintiffs constitutional arguments,instead finding that the circuit court dismissal of the complaint was premature.the court noted that section h of the act specifically requires that appointments be made on the one person,one vote basis and that plaintiffs had alleged in their complaint that the directors are not in fact so appointed.the court found it unclear whether plaintiffs had failed to state a cause of action.the court noted that,at oral argument,plaintiffs counsel had argued that the appointment scheme had become inequitable since when cook county board members began to be elected from districts.the court noted that this issue was not addressed in the circuit court and perhaps merits discussion.therefore,the appellate court remanded the cause to the circuit court for a hearing on the allegations of plaintiffs complaint.d at.
standard of review 
when the legal sufficiency of a complaint is challenged by a section motion to dismiss,all facts in the complaint are taken as true and a reviewing court must determine whether the allegations of the complaint,construed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,are sufficient to establish a cause of action upon which relief may be granted.connick suzuki motor.the question to be determined is whether sufficient facts are contained in the pleadings which,if established,may entitle the plaintiff to relief.urbaitis commonwealth edison.the appropriate standard of review is de novo.neade portes.
ii.constitutional principle of one person,one vote 
despite the appellate court failure to address their constitutional arguments,the parties argue,and we agree,that the record is sufficient to permit this court to determine the constitutionality of the challenged provisions of the act.
legislation challenged in this court benefits from a presumption of constitutionality.citation.courts examining the constitutional validity of a statute will ordinarily apply the rational basis test.citation.under this test,a statute will be upheld if it bears a rational relationship to a legitimate legislative purpose and is neither arbitrary nor discriminatory.citation.
where challenged legislation implicates a fundamental constitutional right,however,such as the right to vote,the presumption of constitutionality is lessened and a far more demanding scrutiny is required.citation.when the means used by a legislature to achieve a legislative goal impinge upon a fundamental right,the court will examine the statute under the strict scrutiny standard.citation.under a standard of strict scrutiny,the court must conclude that the means employed by the legislature to achieve a stated goal were necessary to advance a compelling state interest.citation.in addition,the statute must be narrowly tailored,that is,the legislature must use the least restrictive means consistent with the attainment of the legislative goal.citations.tully edgar.

the constitutional principle of one person,one vote derives from two articles of the illinois constitution of.article i,section,provides that n o person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws.const,art.i.article iii,section,states that a ll elections shall be free and equal.const,art.iii.as this court has stated 
the principle of the,doctrine,as exemplified by reynolds sims,d,and the decisions stemming from it,is that when a public office must be filled by election,whether because of a constitutional mandate or a legislative enactment,the method used shall be reasonably designed to achieve the objective that the vote of any citizen is approximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen in the state,d.from this it follows that when the determinative vote is to be cast by electoral districts these must be as nearly of equal population as is practicable,d.eastern canty.
defendants argue that the one person,one vote principle applies only to elected officials.they rely on eastern,in which this court rejected an argument that the one person,one vote principle applied to a sanitary district board whose directors were appointed,noting that the united states supreme court had never held that appointed offices must be selected on the one person,one vote principle.rather,the supreme court had recognized the constitutionality of filling offices by appointment,rather than election,in such decisions as sailors board of education,d,and fortson morris,d.eastern,at.accordingly,this court concluded that no constitutional requirement exists that an appointed governing body of a district be so constituted that a majority of its members represent the more populous regions comprising the district.eastern,at.
in sailors,michigan electors challenged the method of selecting members of the county school board.voters elected members of the local school boards,but the county school board was chosen by delegates from the local school boards.each local board received one vote in the selection of the county board,regardless of population or wealth.plaintiffs argued that this method of selection violated the principle of one person,one vote.sailors,at.at,d at.the supreme court concluded that no constitutional reason existed why state or local officers of a nonlegislative character may not be chosen by appointment,rather than through election.the court noted that while the michigan county school boards performed important functions,they were primarily administrative in nature and,therefore,were not legislative in the classical sense.sailors,at.at,d at.
in fortson,the supreme court rejected an equal protection challenge to a provision of the georgia constitution providing that if no gubernatorial candidate received a majority of votes at a general election,the georgia legislature was to select the governor by majority vote from the two candidates receiving the highest number of popular votes.the court noted that the method chosen by georgia had been employed both before and since the revolutionary war.fortson,at.at,d at.
plaintiffs argue that this court applied the one person,one vote principle to an appointed body in fumarolo chicago board of education.in that case,the plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the chicago school reform act,which decentralized the chicago school system by creating local school councils that were responsible for each grammar school and high school.each council was comprised of the principal of the school and elected members.the elected members were to consist of six parents of children currently enrolled at the school two community residents residing within the school attendance center and two teachers employed at the school served by the council.each local school council elected one member to sit on a subdistrict council.the statute set forth voter eligibility requirements for participation in local school council elections.only parents of students enrolled at the school served by the local school council could vote for the parent members of the council only school staff could vote for the teacher members and only community residents residing within the school attendance center could vote for the community members of the local school council.however,with respect to community residents to be elected to the local school council of a multiarea school,the statute provided that only the parents of students enrolled at that multiarea school,the principal and the school staff could vote for the community residents to be elected to the local school council for that multiarea school.accordingly,community residents who lived in a multiarea attendance center and who did not have children enrolled at the school could not vote for any local school council members.in addition,community residents in single district attendance centers could vote for only two members of the local school council,while parents with children enrolled in the school could vote for six members.fumarolo,at.
the plaintiffs in fumarolo advanced an equal protection argument,asserting that the statute voter eligibility requirements violated the one person,one vote principle.we concluded that the local school councils were essential units of ed
