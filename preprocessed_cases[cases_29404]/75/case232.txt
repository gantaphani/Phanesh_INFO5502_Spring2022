opinion of the court 
this matter comes on appeal from an order of the district court dated and entered on october,barring airways,airways or the company from using an outside contractor to perform maintenance overhauls called,mandated by the federal aviation administration faa,on the company narrow body airbus aircraft.the district court concluded that the dispute between airways and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers the iam over whether such subcontracting was permissible constituted a major dispute under the railway labor act,et rla for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the dispute is a minor one under the rla,and therefore the district court lacked jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction.
background 
factual background 
the iam is an unincorporated labor organization that is the certified collective bargaining representative of airways mechanics and related personnel.district lodge is the iam negotiating arm.for more than years,the iam and airways have been parties to collective bargaining agreements governing airways mechanics and related employees.on august,airways filed for chapter bankruptcy and implemented measures to reduce its operating costs.these measures included renegotiating the terms of its collective bargaining agreements,rejecting certain aircraft leases,rejecting real property leases,reducing wages and benefits for its management and employees,and rejecting or renegotiating other agreements with its lessors,vendors,and suppliers.
the requirement 
faa guidelines require airways to perform on its narrow body airbus aircraft every five years.are the most extensive type of scheduled maintenance checks,requiring a detailed inspection of the aircraft and repair of any discrepancies on the airframe,components,and engines.us airways first on an aircraft it acquired in became due on october.us airways had nine other due by the end of and seven others are due in september.as of january,will be required on an ongoing basis.
us airways emerged from bankruptcy on march.it claims that until that time it could not properly arrange for the ten that were due in.at some point before october,airways told the iam that it may need to hire a vendor to perform the because it lacked the necessary equipment and facilities to perform them itself.on october,airways confirmed this need with the iam with regard to its first ten,but it said it would work with the iam to identify means by which the remaining could be performed in house.
the collective bargaining agreement cba 
a.the scope clause article b 
article b of the cba defines the scope of the work to be performed by employees 
the company agrees that the following described work,wherever performed,is recognized as coming within the jurisdiction of the iam,and is covered by this agreement all work involved in dismantling,overhauling,repairing,fabricating,assembling,welding,and erecting all parts of airplanes,airplane engines,avionics equipment,electrical system,heating system,hydraulic system,and machine tool work in connection therewith 
the duties of aircraft cleaning,lavatory servicing,potable water servicing,receipt and dispatch,ancillary duties associated with receipt and dispatch,and operation of ground power units may be performed by employees covered by this agreement other employees and vendors as described in article paragraphs j and n at those where such covered employees are not staffed.aircraft towing may b performed by employees not covered by this agreement at those where such covered employees are not staffed.it is not the intent of this paragraph to have and related employees perform such work on shifts where covered employees are staffed except as provided for elsewhere in this agreement.it is the company intent,however,to utilize all its equipment and facilities in performing work in its own organization.in the event that a situation should develop whereby the equipment and facility limitations are not available or sufficient to perform such work,the company will confer with the union in an effort to reach an understanding with respect to how the problem is to be resolved.receipt and dispatch,including the ancillary duties associated with receipt and dispatch,of commuter aircraft may be accomplished by employees not covered by the mechanic and related agreement.
ja appellees br.at the parties do not dispute that the scope language encompasses airframe heavy maintenance hmv work,which is the type of work an requires.
there are two addenda to the cba the letter of clarification the first clarification and clarification of article b the second clarification.
b.the first clarification 
the first clarification states that section b of said article is recognized by both parties as prohibiting the farming out of the types of work specified in said section b.ja.
c.the second clarification 
the second clarification states that 
relative to the scope clause,it is agreed that,within the limits hereinafter specified,the following listed exceptions to the coverage of article shall not be deemed in violation thereof 
g types of work customarily contracted out,such as parts and material which the company could not be expected to manufacture,such as engine and airframe parts,castings,cowlings,seats,wheels and other items which are commonly manufactured as standard items for the trade by vendors.work subcontracted out to a vendor will be of the type that can not be manufactured or repaired by existing or facilities of the company.
i due to lack of facilities,the company may subcontract the major overhaul of aircraft engines during the life of this agreement.
ja.the iam notes that neither hmv nor other maintenance work on aircraft airframes is mentioned in the list of subcontracting exceptions.the parties agree that hmv work is not the type of work that customarily has been contracted out.
bargaining history 
the iam presents to the court past conduct on the part of airways regarding the subcontracting of hmv work on its boeing fleet.specifically,the iam notes that during negotiations in for a successor agreement a major dispute,airways sought to obtain the right to subcontract of its boeing fleet,claiming that it lacked the facilities to perform the work.the iam rejected airways proposal,and thus,airways did not achieve the right to subcontract the.
the parties practice 
us airways never has subcontracted hmv work in its relationship with the iam.rather,employees always have performed such work,regardless of the model of the aircraft.the iam claims that the company acquired a hangar in tampa,florida,where it could have performed the,although it voluntarily closed the facility in november.
the dunsford arbitration 
us airways presents evidence of an arbitration between it and the iam in before the system board of system board which professor john dunsford decided the dunsford arbitration.the issue before the system board was whether airways could outsource engine overhaul work because it lacked the facilities to perform the work in house.professor dunsford decided that it could,noting that the iam had not met its burden of showing that there were facilities to do the work in house.while the parties agree that this award has become part of the cba,they dispute its meaning.us airways claims that professor dunsford relied on the second sentence of section g of the second clarification in holding that even though the engine overhaul work customarily had not been contracted out,airways could do so in that case because it lacked the facilities to do the work in house.in contrast,the iam believes that professor dunsford relied solely on section i,which creates a specific exception for aircraft engine overhauling where there is a lack of facilities.
procedural background 
on august,the iam notified airways that use of an outside vendor for the would violate the scope of the cba and would create a major dispute.us airways countered on august,that because the parties differed as to the interpretation of the cba regarding whether could be subcontracted,the dispute was a minor one.thus,airways attempted to submit the dispute to the system board,but the iam refused to arbitrate the dispute.
on october,the iam moved in the district court for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring airways from using an outside vendor for the the iam argued that the cba required airways to use iam employees for its and that use of an outside vendor constituted a major dispute,requiring maintenance of the status quo.
after oral argument,the district court held on october,that the dispute was a major one and it preliminarily enjoined airways from using an outside vendor for the.it held that airways arguments under the cba were obviously insubstantial and that it was attempting to remake or amend the cba prohibition against hmv subcontracting.ja.
us airways filed a notice of appeal and a motion for stay pending appeal.after a hearing,the district court denied airways request for a stay,but it modified its injunction to permit airways to complete work on one partially disassembled aircraft.on october,airways moved in this court for an emergency stay pending appeal,which a motion panel denied on november,though at the same time it expedited the appeal.on january,we heard oral argument on airways appeal.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
jurisdiction over the appeal of a preliminary injunction is proper pursuant to a.we exercise plenary review over the question of whether the dispute is a major or minor one.see general comm.of adjustment csx,cir csx.we review factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard.see shire barr labs,cir.
iii.discussion 
major minor.the guidelines 
the railway labor act is the product of a joint effort by labor and management representatives to channel labor disputes into constructive resolution procedures as a means of avoiding interruptions to commerce and preventing strikes.csx,at.the two types of disputes that can arise under the rla are major disputes and minor disputes.in consolidated rail railway labor executives ass n,d conrail,the supreme court explained that the formal demarcation between major and minor disputes does not turn on a determination of the importance of the issue presented or the likelihood that it would prompt the exercise of economic.id.at.at.rather,the difference between the two types of disputes is that major disputes seek to create contractual rights,while minor disputes seek to enforce them.see id.at.at holding that the inclusion of drug testing as part of railroad physical examinations arguably was justified by implied terms of collective bargaining agreement,and therefore dispute was minor see also elgin,ry.burley.
major disputes relate to the formation of collective bargaining agreements or efforts to secure them.they arise in the absence of such an agreement or where a party seeks to change the terms of one,and therefore the issue is not whether an existing agreement controls the controversy.major disputes look to the acquisition of rights for the future,not to the assertion of rights claimed to have vested in the past.see conrail,at.at.as the supreme court stated in conrail,
i n the event of a major dispute,the rla requires the parties to undergo a lengthy process of bargaining and mediation until they have exhausted those procedures,the parties are obligated to maintain the status quo,and the employer may not implement the contested change in rates of pay,rules,or working conditions.the district courts have jurisdiction to enjoin a violation of the status quo pending completion of the required procedures,without the customary showing of irreparable injury.
in contrast,minor disputes arise out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of existing collective bargaining agreements.see id.at.at.the dispute relates either to the meaning or proper application of a particular provision with reference to a specific situation or to an omitted case.id.where an employer asserts a contractual right to take the contested action,the ensuing dispute is a minor one if the action arguably is justified by the implied or express terms of the parties collective bargaining agreement.where,by contrast,the employer claimed justification for the action is frivolous or obviously insubstantial,the dispute is a major one.see id.at.at see also csx,at noting that the court may not consider the merits of the underlying dispute its role is limited to determining whether the dispute can be characterized as involving the proper application or meaning of a contract provision.
a minor dispute is subject to a compulsory and binding arbitration before an adjustment board established by the employer and the unions representing the employees.that board,in this case the system board,has exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute.there is no general statutory obligation that the employer maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator decision.see conrail,at.at.thus,in a minor dispute,e ach side can act on its interpretation of the existing agreements until the arbitration panel rules otherwise.csx,at citations omitted.
the instant dispute 
we hold that the instant dispute is a minor one because both parties have asserted rights existing under the cba,the dispute turns on the proper interpretation or application of the cba,and airways argument is neither frivolous nor obviously insubstantial.
both parties assert rights under the cba 
both parties contend that the terms of the existing cba either establish or refute the presence of the right to subcontract.the iam contends that the dispute can be resolved by reference to the following the scope clause article b which includes hmv work the first clarification which prohibits the farming out of work included in the scope clause the second clarification which does not contain an exception for hmv work and airways past practice of performing all hmv work in house.
in airways view,the dispute can be resolved by reference to the following the scope clause article b which includes hmv work the facilities and equipment clause of article b which contains a meet and confer obligation when the company lacks adequate equipment or facilities to perform the work the second clarification,section g,second sentence which states that airways may contract out work for which it lacks the skills,equipment or facilities to perform the work in house the dunsford award upholding right to subcontract engine overhaul work when in house facilities are lacking the past practice of subcontracting aircraft maintenance work when in house equipment or facilities are lacking and the absence of any past practice of performing airbus.
thus,both parties contend that terms of the cba,as interpreted through custom and past experience,determine the result in this case.
us airways argument is neither frivolous nor obviously insubstantial 
as described below,we hold that the district court erred in finding airways position to be frivolous and obviously insubstantial.
us airways section g argument 
section g of the second clarification reads as follows 
g types of work customarily contracted out,such as parts and material which the company could not be expected to manufacture,such as engine and airframe parts,castings,cowlings,seats,wheels and other items which are commonly manufactured as standard items for the trade by vendors.work subcontracted out to a vendor will be of the type that can not be manufactured or repaired by existing or facilities of the company.
ja.us airways argues that the second sentence of section g,read alone,supports its position that any work may be contracted out to a vendor when the company lacks the skills,equipment or facilities to perform the work in house.in concluding that this sentence can only be read as a clarification of the first sentence,ja,the district court impermissibly interpreted the cba as airways correctly explains,the district court analysis went beyond determining whether the cba resolved the dispute instead,it performed the task of the arbitrator in determining the proper construction of section g.of course,under airways view,the district court action was impermissible even if it correctly interpreted the cba.
us airways dunsford award argument 
us airways argues that the dunsford award is indicative that the second sentence of section g is free standing.it claims that professor dunsford concluded that engine overhaul work customarily was not contracted out,but nonetheless airways could contract it out because it did not have the facilities and equipment needed to perform the work in house.thus,airways argues that the second sentence of section g gives it authority to contract out where it lacks the facilities and equipment to perform them in house,even though this is not the type of work customarily contracted out.us airways also counters the iam s argument that the dunsford award was based solely on section i and not on section g,by stating that a lthough the iam has argued that the dunsford award was based on section i of the second clarification,which applies only to engine maintenance,that could not have been the basis for the decision because section i refers only to lack of facilities,and not lack of equipment or skills.appellant br.at.
us airways equipment and facilities clause argument 
us airways also argues that the district court failed to acknowledge the equipment and facilities clause of article b,which states that i n the event that a situation should develop whereby the equipment and facility limitations are not available or sufficient to perform such work,the company will confer with the union in an effort to reach an understanding with respect to how the problem is to be resolved.ja.us airways argues that this clause creates at least an implied right to subcontract where the company does not have adequate equipment or facilities.us airways further argues that under the dunsford award,this clause applies whenever work is covered by the agreement hmv work,and not where the work is subject to an express exception under the second clarification,such as section g.as such,it concludes that even if the second sentence of section g applied only to work customarily contracted out,the equipment and facilities clause of article b creates an independent basis for the company right to subcontract.appellant br.at.
based on these arguments,we hold that airways has met its relatively light burden,see conrail,at.at citation omitted,of asserting rights under the cba that are neither frivolous nor obviously insubstantial.but we do not go further and state a view as to whether we ultimately agree with airways or the iam as it is not our responsibility to make such a determination.rather,we leave the merits of the parties arguments to the system board,and merely will lift the preliminary injunction because there is no requirement that the status quo be maintained in this minor dispute.
iv.conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,the order of the district court dated and entered on october,will be reversed and this matter will be remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
this case turns on whether the dispute between airways,us airways or the company and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers the iam is characterized as major or minor for purposes of the railway labor act,et rla.the majority holds that it is a minor one because both parties have asserted rights existing under the collective bargaining agreement,the dispute turns on the proper interpretation or application of the cba,and airways argument is neither frivolous nor obviously insubstantial.supra at.i agree with the majority that the parties dispute is resolved by application of the cba and the interpretation of its terms.where i part company with my colleagues is in their conclusion that airways position is not frivolous.i agree,instead,with the district court that,u nder the guise of a claimed dispute about meaning of language in the cba,us airways is attempting to remake or amend the most elemental and consequential provisions of the cba.because i believe that airways has not presented a construction of the contract that even arguably supports its position,i respectfully dissent.
a genuine dispute over the meaning or proper application of a particular provision in the parties collective bargaining agreement is minor,and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the system board of adjustment.consol.rail ry.labor executives ass conrail,d quoting elgin,ry.burley.a major dispute,on the other hand,arises where there is no such agreement or where it is sought to change the terms of one.conrail,at.quoting burley,at.emphasis added.the rla prescribes a lengthy process of bargaining and mediation for major disputes,during which time the parties are obligated to maintain the status quo.conrail,at.the district courts have jurisdiction to enjoin a violation of the status quo pending completion of the required procedures,without the customary showing of irreparable injury.id.at.
the supreme court in conrail explicitly recognized that any capable advocate can massage an attempt to change the terms of an agreement into a question of contract interpretation,and that deferring to every such argument as a matter of course would undermine the basic structure of the rla 
t here is a danger in leaving the characterization of the dispute solely in the hands of one party.in a situation in which the party asserting a contractual basis for its claim is insincere in doing so,or its position is founded upon insubstantial grounds,the result of honoring that party characterization would be to undercut the prohibitions of,seventh,and of the act against unilateral imposition of new contractual terms.in such circumstances,protection of the proper functioning of the statutory scheme requires the court to substitute its characterization for that of the claimant.
conrail,at.quoting norfolk portsmouth belt line of trainmen,cir under conrail,a dispute is minor only where the parties positions are arguably justified by the terms of their agreement 
where an employer asserts a contractual right to take the contested action,the ensuing dispute is minor if the action is arguably justified by the terms of the parties agreement.where,in contrast,the employer claims are frivolous or obviously insubstantial,the dispute is a major one.
conrail,at.
in holding that the dispute between the parties is minor rather than major,the majority concludes that the district court impermissibly interpreted the cba.supra at.of course,the district court had no choice but to interpret the cba in order to determine whether it arguably justifies airways position.see conrail,at.see also.transp,at discussing the sources to be considered when interpreting a cba to determine whether a party position is arguably justified.a court interpretation is impermissible under conrail only if it elects among multiple,constructions of the terms of the agreement.by stating that the district court impermissibly interpreted the cba,the majority,it seems to me,only invites the question is airways position grounded on a construction of the parties agreement 
the majority does not really answer this question,but rather repeats airways argument that the second sentence of section g,read alone,supports its position that any work may be contracted out to a vendor when the company lacks the skills,equipment or facilities to perform the work in house.supra at compare appellant br.at.yet two critical issues remain whether the second sentence of section g,read alone,arguably supports airways position,and whether that sentence can arguably be read alone 
i believe that both issues must be resolved in the negative.us airways interpretation of the second sentence of section g hinges on a logical fallacy.that sentence states work subcontracted out to a vendor will be of the type that can not be manufactured or repaired by existing or facilities of the company.from this,airways argues can not be repaired using existing equipment and facilities therefore,are work that can be subcontracted out.yet this argument is a classic non sequitur.it is as if airways had argued all precedential opinions of the third circuit will be of the type published in the federal reporter rutland railway brotherhood of locomotive engineers,cir,is published in the federal reporter therefore,rutland is a precedent
