the question presented is whether the location of a bus stop may constitute a dangerous condition of public property,within the meaning of government code sections and where,in order to reach the stop,bus patrons must cross a busy thoroughfare at an uncontrolled intersection.assuming all other elements of an action under section are proven,we conclude it may no rule of law precludes imposition of liability on this basis.we therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeal,which affirmed a judgment on jury verdict for plaintiff darlene bonanno,who was injured while attempting to cross an arterial street to reach a bus stop maintained by defendant central contra costa transit authority cccta.
factual and procedural background 
the facts are drawn in large part from the opinion of the court of appeal.
cccta began providing bus services to contra costa county county residents in,taking over routes from the costa transit district.at that time,a bus stop consisting simply of a route sign placed in compacted gravel was located on the north side of pacheco boulevard pacheco near the intersection of pacheco and denormandie way denormandie,in an unincorporated area of the county near the city of martinez.in the early,residents in the neighborhood of that intersection made it known to county officials that they were having difficulty crossing pacheco to get to and from the bus stop in response,the county painted a crosswalk at the intersection.other than bus patrons,few pedestrians used the crosswalk.
despite the crosswalk,pedestrians still had difficulty finding adequate gaps in traffic during the morning commute.morning commute traffic on pacheco was heavy,drivers were relatively inattentive,and the speed limit was often disregarded.in february,kimberly chittock was struck by a car while crossing pacheco midblock to get to the denormandie bus stop.the chittock family filed a claim against cccta complaining about the location of the denormandie bus stop cccta denied the claim.in the ensuing lawsuit,cccta took a deposition in which the chittocks traffic expert testified it was unsafe for pedestrians to cross pacheco at denormandie,and the bus stop should have been moved one block west to the intersection at morello avenue morello,which although it had a stop sign should have been controlled with traffic signals.
one year after chittock accident,early in,students complained to cccta that it was too dangerous to cross pacheco at morello to get to the denormandie bus stop.in july,the county installed traffic signal lights,equipped with pedestrian push buttons,at the pacheco and morello intersection.cccta did not,however,move its bus stop from denormandie to morello.
although pedestrians could now cross pacheco safely at morello,the route to the denormandie bus stop along the north shoulder of pacheco was unnecessarily hazardous.the shoulder was relatively narrow,and the gravel and dirt adjacent to the paved portion could be muddy.additionally,the area was often occupied by large parked trucks,and in one portion the drainage swale had eroded to within five and a half feet of the edge line.in another area of the north shoulder,pedestrians had to walk in the roadway for several feet.plaintiff traffic engineering expert opined that pedestrians trying to get to the denormandie bus stop during the morning commute faced unnecessary hazards wherever they crossed,because of the unsafe conditions on the north shoulder of pacheco and the difficulty of finding safe gaps in traffic to cross pacheco without a signal.as a matter of bus patron safety,the denormandie bus stop should have been moved one block west to morello.
plaintiff bonanno lives with members of her family on robinsdale road,south of pacheco.at the time of the accident,she relied on public transportation,including a cccta bus she took to her job cleaning rooms at the motel in walnut creek.on november,around,walking to the bus stop at denormandie,bonanno attempted to cross pacheco at the denormandie intersection.she waited on the curb for some minutes for a break in traffic,but a car passed every few seconds.finally,eastbound motorist jennifer kimberly stopped at the crosswalk to let bonanno cross.after further waiting,a westbound motorist stopped as well.
jeremy mclain was driving eastbound on pacheco on his way to work.he was having difficulty seeing out of his windshield with the bright morning sun ahead.as bonanno stepped out into the crosswalk and walked in front of kimberly car,mclain kimberly car which he had not seen,causing it to lurch forward and hit bonanno,who was seriously injured.
because the county owns the along pacheco,cccta had to obtain the county permission to move a bus stop or install a new stop.before plaintiff accident,cccta had never requested addition of a stop at morello.after the accident,cccta representative met with the county traffic engineer and requested a stop be added at morello.the engineer and the county board of supervisors approved the request,and the stop was added.
bonanno sued cccta,the county,mclain,and kaiser foundation hospitals and related entities,where she had been treated after the accident.eventually,all defendants except cccta settled,and in bonanno tried her case against cccta alone.the jury returned its verdict in her favor,expressly finding that the bus stop was a dangerous condition of public property.the jury found mclain percent responsible,kaiser hospital percent responsible,and the county and cccta each percent responsible.the trial court entered judgment for bonanno and against cccta,on bonanno cause of action for a dangerous condition of public property,in the amounts of in economic damages reflecting credits for prior settlements and in noneconomic damages percent of the total noneconomic damage award.
the court of appeal affirmed,holding that the location of the denormandie stop created a dangerous condition in that it beckoned pedestrian bus patrons to cross,and compelled cars to stop,at the feeder crosswalk without attendant traffic lights or signals.we granted review on cccta petition,limiting review to the question whether the location of a bus stop may constitute a dangerous condition of public property under government code section because bus patrons will be enticed to cross a dangerous crosswalk to reach the bus stop.
under section,a public entity such as cccta is liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the plaintiff establishes that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the injury,that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous condition,that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred,and that b t he public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition under section a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition.at this stage of the proceedings,the only element at issue is the existence of a dangerous condition of the property.
our decision here,we emphasize,does not concern the question whether the crosswalk at denormandie was in fact an unsafe pedestrian route for crossing pacheco,or even the broader question whether painted crosswalks at uncontrolled intersections are more dangerous than those at intersections.as the county,which controlled the intersection,settled with plaintiff before trial,our decision does not in any respect address the liability of a city or county for maintenance of an unsafe crosswalk.to be sure,plaintiff introduced the jury apparently found the denormandie crossing was more dangerous than that at morello,in order to establish that cccta should have moved its bus stop to morello.but the sufficiency of that evidence is not before this court.our order limiting review,quoted earlier in this opinion,assumes the existence of a dangerous crosswalk,posing only the question whether a bus stop may be deemed dangerous because bus users,to reach the stop,must cross at that dangerous crosswalk.
nor are we primarily concerned here with the sufficiency of evidence to show that cccta controlled the location of its bus stop,although part of the plaintiff burden in an action under section is,of course,to show that the public entity owned or controlled the property subject to the dangerous condition.see,subd.c.cccta devotes only one paragraph of its briefing to this issue,noting that the process of installing a bus stop on county property involves consultation between cccta and the county,with the county enjoying a veto power over any proposal for a new stop on its property.but that cccta needed the county permission to place a stop at morello does not preclude,as a matter of law,cccta potential liability for risks arising from the stop location,as the record contains no evidence cccta had asked for such permission and been refused,or had any reason to assume permission would be denied.see warden city of los angeles cal d,city,which never applied to coast guard for more effective warning buoys on sewer outfall pipe,could not avoid liability for pipe latent danger on the ground the coast guard controlled aids to navigation shea city of san bernardino cal d,city had duty to request that railroad commission correct a defective grade crossing on city street.in fact,when,after plaintiff accident,cccta asked that a bus stop be added at morello,the county approved the request 
a dangerous condition,as defined in section,is a condition of property that creates a substantial risk of injury when such property or adjacent property is used with due care in a reasonably foreseeable manner,subd.a.a california law revision commission comment accompanying the statute enactment expands on the relationship between public property and adjacent property with regard to dangerous conditions adjacent property as used in the definition of dangerous condition refers to the area that is exposed to the risk created by a dangerous condition of the public property a public entity may be liable only for dangerous conditions of its own property.but its own property may be considered dangerous if it creates a substantial risk of injury to adjacent property or to persons on adjacent property and its own property may be considered dangerous if a condition on the adjacent property exposes those using the public property to a substantial risk of injury.cal.law revision com,reprinted at west ann.ed.foll.
the existence of a dangerous condition is ordinarily a question of here by the jury express finding that the bus stop was a dangerous condition of cccta it can be decided as a matter of law if reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d.the statutory language neither precludes nor expressly endorses plaintiff theory that the bus stop was dangerous because accessing it required crossing a dangerous intersection.the law revision commission comment,however,does endorse that theory the denormandie bus stop may properly be considered dangerous under section in that,in the words of the law revision commission,a condition on the adjacent property the crosswalk at an uncontrolled intersection exposes those using the public property the bus stop to a substantial risk of injury.cal.law revision com,reprinted at west ann,supra,foll.because the official comments of the california law revision commission are declarative of the intent not only of the draftsman of the code but also of the legislators who subsequently enacted it people williams cal d,the comments are persuasive,albeit not conclusive,evidence of that intent conservatorship of wendland cal th,d.we must determine,therefore,whether some indication of legislative intent beyond the statutory language and law revision commission comment,or some other principle established in the california cases,negates the jury finding as a matter of law.after examining the relevant case law,we find no such contrary principle of law.
most obviously,a dangerous condition exists when public property is physically damaged,deteriorated,or defective in such a way as to foreseeably endanger those using the property itself.van alstyne et,cal.government tort liability practice ed dangerous condition of public property,see,mathews state of california ex rel.of transportation d.street intersection with malfunctioning traffic signals de la rosa city of san bernardino d.stop sign obscured by roadside plantings.but public property has also been considered to be in a dangerous condition because of the design or location of the improvement,the interrelationship of its structural or natural features,or the presence of latent hazards associated with its normal use.van alstyne,supra,italics added.
that the location of a public improvement or,more broadly,its relationship to its surroundings,may create dangers to users is by no means a novel idea.in warden city of los angeles,supra,cal d,the public property at issue was a sewage outfall pipe in santa monica bay.though,as far as our decision reveals,the pipe was not damaged,deteriorated or defective in any way,this court agreed its location,near the water surface in an area frequented by ships,constituted a dangerous condition indeed the record is clear that the city placed the pipe near the surface although it could have submerged it for safety purposes,as was done with other installations.this created the dangerous condition which invokes liability under section,subdivision a.id.at.
more specifically,the courts of appeal have,consistent with the law revision commission comment,recognized that hazards present on adjoining property may create a dangerous condition of public property when users of the public property are necessarily exposed to those risks.thus,in holmes city of oakland d.holmes,the plaintiff child was hit by a santa fe railroad train running on a along a city street.the plaintiff alleged the street was in a dangerous condition because of the tracks running along it,which children from the nearby grammar school had to cross on their way home from school.id.at.the appellate court held that even if the city did not control the operation of trains on the,the complaint alleged a cause of action for maintenance of public property in a dangerous condition,under section,because a condition on the adjacent exposes those using the public property to a substantial risk of injury.id.at.see id.at.quoting and relying on cal.law revision com.com.to.the dangerous condition,in other words,was the adjacency of the street and the railroad.
branzel city of concord d.branzel contains an extensive treatment of the question.a father was electrocuted when his son model airplane escaped the son grasp as he was flying it in the city designated model airplane park chasing after it,the father caught the plane guide wire just as it came in contact with uninsulated electrical lines across the street from the park.id.at.the defendant city contended that,as a matter of law,there was no dangerous or defective condition of its property the park.the appellate court rejected that claim,holding the jury could find it foreseeable that users of the model airplane field would sometimes lose control of their planes and,in trying to recover them,would be exposed to the danger of the electrical lines.while the city did not maintain or control the power lines,it did maintain the flying field in a location so close to them that in the light of the known use of the field the involvement of the field with the lines could be reasonably anticipated.it seems to us that the condition of the field can be considered dangerous because the condition of the adjacent power lines exposed those using the field to a substantial risk of injury.id.at.see also jordan city of long beach d.jordan defective pavement with protruding water pipe on private property adjoining public sidewalk was dangerous condition of sidewalk because it exposed sidewalk users to substantial risk of injury dudum city of san mateo d,location of stop sign was dangerous condition because it caused sign to be obscured by tree on adjacent private property marsh city of sacramento d,sidewalk,not defective in itself,nonetheless could constitute dangerous condition by virtue of the demolition of an adjacent building,which left an at sidewalk edge bauman san francisco d,bauman playground area for small children constituted dangerous condition of public property because of proximity to field used for hard baseball.
we therefore reject cccta contention that it can not be liable for an injury occurring on property the street it neither owned nor controlled.cccta owned and controlled its own bus stop,and a condition of that property,its physical situation,caused users of the bus stop to be at risk from the immediately adjacent property,just as the model airplane flyers were at risk from the adjacent power lines in branzel,supra,d.users of the city street were at risk from the adjacent railroad in holmes,supra,d.those walking on the public sidewalk were at risk from the defective pavement and protruding pipe on adjacent private property in jordan,supra,d.and children using the play area were at risk from the adjacent baseball games in bauman,supra,d,
nor is it determinative that bonanno injury occurred on adjacent county property as she approached the bus stop,rather than while she was awaiting the bus at the stop itself.in the circumstances,that bonanno was injured trying to access cccta property makes her no less a user of it.if a cccta bus stop could be reached only by jumping across an adjacent ditch,cccta would logically bear the same liability to a patron who fell into the ditch attempting to reach the stop as to one who fell while waiting at the stop.several court of appeal decisions applying section and its statutory predecessor have,like the present case,involved injuries to users of public property that occurred on adjacent private property.see jordan,supra,d at.pavement defect located about inches from public property holmes,supra,d at.finding no precedential support for the proposition that the injury must occur on the public property in order for liability to attach branzel,supra,d at.decedent electrocuted across the street from city park.
cccta cites seaber hotel del coronado th,d,involving an alleged dangerous condition of private property,as establishing that a landowner has no duty to remedy or warn of hazards on adjacent property not under the landowner control.in seaber,the plaintiffs sued a hotel for the death of a pedestrian who,on leaving the hotel,was struck by an automobile in a marked crosswalk adjacent to the hotel property.the reviewing court held that the hotel,lacking control over the crosswalk on a public street,should not bear the burden of warning pedestrians of the risks posed by its use.id.at,d.but even assuming public entity liability under section is coextensive with private liability for maintaining property in an unsafe condition,a premise cccta does not establish,we agree with the court of appeal that the feasibility of moving or removing a bus option not available to the hotel owners in the present case from seaber.in this sense,as the court of appeal observed,the case at bar is closer to those involving mobile places of business,such as schwartz helms bakery limited cal d,bakery truck,than it is to seaber while the street vendor can not control traffic on the street around him he can,to a degree,control his own movements,the places where he will do business and,thus,the avenues of approach to it.citations.seaber,supra,at,d.similarly,the existence of the bus stop and sign attracted patrons,beckoning them to cross and,while cccta could not control traffic,it did control the location of the bus stop the solution was to move or eliminate the bus stop,a remedy that imposed no undue burden on cccta.
nor does the fact plaintiff injury was immediately caused by a third party negligent or illegal act here,mclain negligent driving render the present case novel.no shortage exists of cases recognizing a dangerous condition of public property in some characteristic of the property that exposed its users to increased danger from third party negligence or criminality.in baldwin state of california cal d,the asserted dangerous condition was the absence of a lane at a busy intersection,which allegedly contributed to the plaintiff automobile accident.we held of course the fact that any negligence by the state would not have resulted in injury to the plaintiff without the additional negligence of the driver who struck him from the rear is no defense to plaintiff claim against the state.id.at,fn.again,in ducey argo sales cal d,ducey,considering the absence of a median barrier that allegedly would have prevented the injuries that occurred when an vehicle crossed a highway median and collided with the plaintiffs vehicle,we observed that the state gains no immunity from liability simply because,in a particular case,the dangerous condition of its property combines with a third party negligent conduct to inflict injury.
we elaborated on these principles in two cases involving criminal assaults committed on public property.in peterson san francisco community college dist.cal d,peterson,we held that the plaintiff,assaulted while using a public parking lot,properly alleged a dangerous condition of public property by her claim that thick and untrimmed trees and foliage around the lot permitted the assailant to perpetrate his crime id.at.we explained that while third party conduct by itself,unrelated to the condition of the property id.at,does not come within section,the public entity may,under some circumstances,be liable under that statute if it maintains its property in a manner that fails to protect against harmful criminal conduct on its property.peterson,supra,at.
more recently,in zelig county of los angeles,supra,cal th,d,zelig,we rejected the plaintiffs claim that the county failure to police its courthouse in such a way as to prevent the decedent shooting by her former husband constituted a dangerous condition of property under sections and.we distinguished cases such as peterson,supra,cal d,and ducey,supra,cal d,as involving a public entity duty to alter the physical condition of the property to provide a safeguard against the danger presented by third parties.zelig,supra,at,d.the zelig plaintiffs,in contrast,were unable to point to the manner in which the physical condition of the property should have been altered to prevent the shooting id.at,d.thus,the risk of injury was not increased or intensified by the condition of the property id.at,d.
two points applicable to this case are,therefore,well established first,that the location of public property,by virtue of which users are subjected to hazards on adjacent property,may constitute a dangerous condition under sections and second,that a physical condition of the public property that increases the risk of injury from third party conduct may be a dangerous condition under the statutes.thus,neither factor provides legal grounds to hold the location of cccta bus stop can not be a dangerous condition.nonetheless,the facts of this case prompt fears,articulated in an amici curiae brief from a group of transit districts and other public entities,that by affirming the court of appeal we will subject mass transit agencies and other public property owners to broad and unpredictable liability for conditions,including criminal activity,in the neighborhoods surrounding public facilities.thus,the amici curiae group asks,rhetorically w ill public entities be required to analyze the placement of entrances on civic buildings to ensure they are positioned nearest a lighted,and purportedly safer,intersection must entrances to parking garages,playgrounds,swimming pools,schoolyards,restrooms and other facilities be relocated away from busy streets must public agencies avoid offering services in high crime neighborhoods likewise concerned that such wholesale liability for conditions on nearby property not be imposed,contrary to legislative intent,on public entities,we emphasize the limits of our holding in this case.
first,we have addressed in this case only one element of liability under section,the existence of a dangerous condition of public property.indeed,we have focused almost exclusively on one aspect of that element,the dangerousness that may arise from the property location or physical situation.we have not addressed the requirement of a substantial as distinguished from a minor,trivial or insignificant risk of injury,subd.a or,except in broad terms,the necessity of proving the public entity ownership or control of the dangerous property,subd.c.either of these requirements may pose an insuperable burden to a plaintiff claiming the location of public property rendered it dangerous.as to other elements,a plaintiff seeking to prove liability under section must show,in addition,that the dangerous condition proximately caused his or her injury that the condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the type of injury that was actually incurred and that the public entity either created the dangerous condition through a negligent or wrongful act or omission of its employee,or had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition sufficiently in advance of the accident as to have had time to remedy it.we reiterate,moreover,the limitation we stated in zelig public liability lies under section only when a feature of the public property has increased or intensified the danger to users from third party conduct.zelig,supra,cal th at,d.thus,the mere fact that users of a government facility bear some risk of being injured in an automobile accident,criminally assaulted,or otherwise injured by a third party on their way to or from the facility does not lead to government liability under section.
nor does our proposed holding subject public entities to broad liability for the placement of entrances to public facilities or any other aspects of their design that might affect the safety of the facilities users.even assuming a public entity had notice that a condition on property adjacent to its facility entrance made access from that point particularly dangerous to users,a plaintiff suing on this ground would have to overcome the general statutory immunity public entities enjoy from liability for injuries arising from discretionary choices regarding a facility plan or design.other statutory immunities,such as those for injuries caused by the natural condition of unimproved public property,injuries caused by the condition of an unpaved trail or recreational access road,and injuries arising out of a hazardous recreational activity,may also apply to certain claims that public property is in a dangerous condition because of its location.unless barred by statute,the public entity defendant may also claim any other defense available to a private defendant,such as comparative fault,subd.b.
finally,our holding does not suggest public agencies must,to avoid liability for crimes committed against their facilities users,refrain from offering services in neighborhoods.liability under section is limited by section,which provides,inter alia,that a public entity creation or maintenance of a dangerous condition does not render the entity liable if the act or omission creating the danger,or the measures taken to protect against it,were reasonable.the reasonableness of such act or omission is judged by weighing the probability and gravity of potential foreseeable injury against the practicality and cost of acting so as not to create,or to better protect against,the risk of injury.in its official comment to section,the law revision commission explained that u nlike private enterprise,a public entity often can not weigh the advantage of engaging in an activity against the cost and decide not to engage in it.government can not go out of the business of governing.cal.law revision com,reprinted at west ann,supra,foll.under section,therefore,the reasonableness of a public entity creation or maintenance of a dangerous condition of its property must be balanced against the costs and benefits of alternative means of providing the public service,not against the alternative of discontinuing the public service.even assuming,therefore,that a transit agency bus or train stop were deemed in a dangerous condition because of criminal activity in the surrounding neighborhood which,again,would require that the location or other characteristics of the stop increased the danger to transit users or,as here,in a location dangerous to access,the transit agency would not be liable for third party injuries to transit users if the only practical alternative to maintaining the stop at the dangerous site was discontinuing service to the neighborhood.
conclusion 
the jury in this case expressly found the denormandie bus stop to be a dangerous condition of cccta property.neither that the danger to users of the bus stop arose out of conditions on adjacent property,nor that the injury was caused in part by third party conduct,renders that finding incorrect as a matter of law.liability of public entities is set by statute,not common law,and we are confident that upholding the jury verdict here will not expand the potential liability of transit districts and other public entities beyond that already recognized by statute.any contraction in the scope of such liability must come from the legislature.
disposition 
the judgment of the court of appeal is affirmed.
the majority opinion affirms a judgment in favor of plaintiff darlene bonanno,who was injured while using a marked crosswalk on a busy street to get to a bus stop maintained by defendant central contra costa transit authority cccta.cccta neither owned nor controlled the street or the crosswalk where the injury occurred.nonetheless,the majority concludes that cccta was properly found liable because its bus stop location constituted a dangerous condition of property that caused bus patrons to be at risk from the immediately adjacent street and crosswalk.
i dissent because the majority holding disregards firmly established law that a property owner is not liable for injuries caused when a person is hit by a vehicle while crossing an adjacent public street to go to or from the property when the owner has no right of control over the street or the vehicles thereon.seaber hotel del coronado th,d private hotel owner not liable for the death of a hotel patron who was struck on an adjacent highway while using a marked pedestrian crosswalk that had been installed at the hotel request nevarez thriftimart,d.private store owner not liable for injuries suffered by a child who was struck by a car as he ran from the store parking lot carnival,which had featured a and free ice cream,to his home across the street avey county of santa clara d.even where city and county defendants had notice that children waiting at a school bus stop would sometimes run over an adjacent highway,as well as defendants own parallel street next to the highway,to go to and from a store across from the bus stop for treats,defendants were not liable when a child engaging in such activity was hit and killed on the highway.
the authorities the majority relies on for its extraordinary location as a dangerous condition theory of liability are inapposite.none of them involved property deemed to be defective or in a dangerous condition because of adjacency to a busy public street,warden city of los angeles cal d,city sewer pipe constituted a dangerous condition because of its location just under water surface jordan city of long beach d.city sidewalk could be a dangerous condition because of adjacent defective pavement on private property with protruding water pipe holmes city of oakland d.dangerous condition of city property could be found where exposed and unguarded railroad tracks located on a city street were in close proximity to a school branzel city of concord d.city model airplane field presented a dangerous condition because of its adjacency to power lines dudum city of san mateo d,stop sign obscured by tree on adjacent private property could be a dangerous condition marsh city of sacramento d,sidewalk properly found dangerous due to at its edge caused by demolition of adjacent building bauman san francisco d,playground was dangerous due to its proximity to baseball field.those decisions had no occasion to consider the principle that the public entity liability statutes were not enacted for the purpose of protecting those who come upon city streets,but only those who sustain injuries by reason of a dangerous or defective condition.perry city of santa monica d,decided in the context of the public liability act of.
moreover,the majority holding results in an anomaly that is obvious and troubling.section of the government code provides that a condition is not a dangerous condition within the meaning of this chapter merely because of the failure to provide regulatory traffic control signals,stop signs,yield signs,or speed restriction signs,as described by the vehicle code therefore,even though crosswalks lacking traffic control signals or stop signs could not be deemed dangerous conditions for purposes of the california tort claims act,the majority finds that the properties adjacent to those crosswalks may be considered dangerous or defective where persons are injured while using those crosswalks to get to and from the properties.
i disagree.if a plaintiff injured while using a crosswalk on a busy street is unable,as a matter of law,to pursue a direct theory of recovery against the public entity that maintained control over that particular street and crosswalk,it follows that the plaintiff should not be permitted to pursue and prevail on an indirect theory of recovery against the adjacent landowner whose property merely served as the plaintiff destination.in my view,owners and occupiers of property should not be made to ensure the safety of all persons who encounter nearby hazards in reaching their property 
the majority purports to limit its unsupported expansion of the dangerous condition concept by suggesting that liability of a defendant would depend upon the feasibility of moving or removing its service or business elsewhere from the dangerous location.i find such reasoning illogical and prone to results that are inconsistent and unfair as between similarly situated plaintiffs and defendants.
consider the following hypothetical.a public entity owns a building,with two spaces for rent,located directly adjacent to a crosswalk on a busy street.one of the building renters is subject to a lease the other rents on a basis.like the situation here,there are no traffic lights or stop signs at the crosswalk,and the building location therefore presents a dangerous condition.three,b,and step into the crosswalk to get to the building a seeks to visit the lessee b seeks to visit the other renter,and c has a meeting with the building owner on the premises.although cars stop to allow a,b,and c to cross the street,an inattentive driver crashes into one of the stopped cars and causes injuries to a,b,and under the majority rule,the public entity owner would escape liability because it could not feasibly have moved its building.the renter likely would be subject to liability because terminating the tenancy and relocating appears to have been feasible.the lessee might or might not be subject to liability,depending upon a jury assessment of feasibility.thus,even though all three defendants appear equally at fault in terms of attracting visitors to the same dangerous condition,their will not be held similarly accountable for their conduct nor will the three plaintiffs be similarly situated when pursuing recovery for their injuries.
finally,the majority suggests that the ramifications of its holding are further limited because public entity liability under section is not coextensive with private liability for maintaining property in an unsafe condition.see,ante,d at,at.i am not so sure.because the intent of the california tort claims act is not to expand the rights of plaintiffs in suits against governmental entities,but to confine potential governmental liability to rigidly delineated circumstances see generally pt.d government tort liability,caldwell montoya cal th,d,the majority holding would appear to enlarge private liability for dangerous conditions as well.
today decision significantly broadens the concept of what may properly constitute a dangerous condition of public property giving rise to liability under section.like justice brown,i am deeply concerned that the majority rule will deplete the already scarce resources of public entities and their taxpayers,for,as was the situation here,a public entity remains on the hook for percent of a plaintiff economic damages even though it is adjudged to be only percent at fault.and though the majority purports to suggest otherwise,its rule may well directly subject owners and occupiers of private property,especially smaller businesses that rent but can not afford to own,to uncertain and disproportional liability as well.for all of the foregoing reasons,i dissent.
reading the majority opinion is painful,like watching a traffic accident in slow motion,because the majority misguided effort to compensate the victim of this accident will,quite foreseeably,victimize everyone else who is dependent on public transit.
the california tort claims act provides that a public entity is not liable for an injury e xcept as otherwise provided by statute.certain statutes do provide expressly for public entity liability in circumstances that are somewhat parallel to the potential liability of private individuals and entities but,as past cases have explained,t he intent of the tort claims act is not to expand the rights of plaintiffs in suits against governmental entities,but to confine potential governmental liability to rigidly delineated circumstances brown poway unified school dist.cal th,d.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d,zelig.
in california,then,governmental immunity is the rule,and liability is the exception.trinkle california state lottery th,d amylou county of riverside th,d thompson city of lake elsinore th,d.the dangerous condition of public property exception to the general rule of governmental immunity is set forth in government code section.that section provides in pertinent part that a public entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the plaintiff establishes that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the injury,that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous condition,that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred,and that b the public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition under section a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition.ibid.
zelig,supra,cal th,d,demonstrates just how rigidly government code section delineates the circumstances that confine a public entity liability for a dangerous condition of its property.in zelig,the plaintiffs were the minor children of a woman who was shot to death by her former husband in a los angeles county courthouse where she was awaiting a hearing regarding spousal and child support.on several occasions prior to the killing,the decedent had informed a bailiff that she was afraid her former husband might attack or kill her in the courthouse,and she had also previously provided the bailiff and a judge in the family court with copies of letters in which he threatened to kill her.zelig,at,d.the plaintiffs sued the county on the ground,among others,that it maintained the courthouse in a dangerous condition because it did not have metal detectors or other safety measures to prevent the introduction of firearms.id.at,d.we reversed the judgment of the court appeal and remanded the matter to that court with directions to affirm the judgment entered by the trial court in favor of the defendants.id.at,d.
in zelig,we emphasized that liability is imposed only when there is some defect in the property itself and a causal connection is established between the defect and the injury.in many cases,courts have rejected the claim that an injury caused by the criminal activity of a third person was attributable to a dangerous condition of the property within the meaning of government code section,because the claims lacked an adequate showing that the property itself was in a defective condition.zelig,supra,cal th at,d.in zelig,we concluded,the risk of injury was not increased or intensified by the condition of the property,and the necessary causal connection between the condition of the property and the crime was not present.indeed,the risk of injury to the victim at the hands of her was at least as great outside the courthouse.id.at,d.in any event,we noted,plaintiffs are unable to point to any defective aspect of the purely physical condition of the property.id.at,d.
in this case,plaintiff dangerous condition of public property claim suffers from the same defects that defeated the claim in zelig.that is,plaintiff is unable to point to any defective aspect of the purely physical condition of the bus stop.zelig,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,the risk of injury was not increased or intensified by the condition of the bus stop,and the necessary causal connection between the condition of the bus stop and the negligent driver failure to stop at the crosswalk was not shown.id.at,d.
contra costa county county painted the crosswalk for the safety of pedestrians crossing the street in order to reach the bus stop.on this tragic occasion,the crosswalk actually functioned as it was intended to,that is,cars coming from both directions stopped for plaintiff,ante,d at,at.plaintiff was injured,not because of any defective aspect of the purely physical condition of public property owned or controlled by the county the street or central contra costa transit authority cccta the bus stop,but because another motorist one of the stopped cars,causing it to lurch forward and hit plaintiff.the accident occurred because the driver was having difficulty seeing out of his windshield with the bright morning sun ahead.ibid.just as the risk of injury to the victim in zelig at the hands of her was at least as great outside the courthouse zelig,supra,cal th at,d,the tragic accident in this case might,so far as the evidence shows,just as well have happened at any other crosswalk along that stretch of road,or even at the intersection a block farther along.indeed,the fact that the accident occurred at a crosswalk,rather than a stop light,was itself quite accidental.as the majority observes,m orning commute traffic on pacheco was heavy,drivers were relatively inattentive,and the speed limit was often disregarded,ante,d at,at.much the same could be said of most suburban arterials.moving the bus stop one block to the intersection would not have changed those conditions.then why should the bus company be held responsible for the negligence of the driver government can not guarantee that roadways will not be used by defective cars or careless drivers.ducey argo sales cal d,conc.dis.opn.of clark.
in the course of holding that the location of a bus stop may constitute a dangerous condition of public property within the meaning of government code section,the majority asserts t hat the location of a public improvement or,more broadly,its relationship to its surroundings,may create dangers to users is by no means a novel idea,ante,at,at.in support of this assertion,the majority cites a single decision of this city of los angeles cal d,warden,ante,at,at.warden,however,is easily distinguished.
in warden,a plaintiff who suffered personal injuries and property damage resulting from a collision of his sailboat with a submerged sewer pipe in santa monica bay sued the city of los angeles for maintaining the pipe in a dangerous condition.the sewer pipe was one of four constructed and maintained in the bay by the city as outfalls for the city hyperion sewage treatment plant.three of the pipes were buried under the seabed,but the pipe involved in the accident protruded into bay waters and was only feet below the surface at low tide.long after this pipe was constructed,but well before the accident,small boat traffic in the vicinity increased significantly because a nearby marina began operations.nevertheless,and despite the fact that three small boats had struck this pipe several years earlier,it was marked only by two unlighted buoys and it had no sounding device.the city did not deny the pipe posed a hazard or that it was aware of the danger created thereby.warden,supra,cal d at.however,the city contended it had met its responsibilities when it merely asked a representative of the coast guard as to current coast guard thinking on the marking of the pipe and the advisability of adding lights or whistles to the existing buoys.id.at,fn.omitted.this court rejected that argument,holding the city was at fault for having failed to make any affirmative request to the coast guard for authorization to place lights or audible signals on the buoys marking the pipe.ibid.
warden is simply inapposite.it might be apposite if,for example,plaintiff had injured herself by striking her head on a low cccta bus sign while walking on a city sidewalk.however,that is not what happened here.
even assuming arguendo that the location of a bus stop may constitute a dangerous condition of public property within the meaning of government code section,the location of this bus stop may have increased the number of persons using the crosswalk,but it did not increase or intensify the risk that pedestrians using the crosswalk would be hit by negligent drivers.as the amici curiae brief filed by the san mateo county transit district and more than other public entities observed,nothing about the bus stop made it dangerous to use the crosswalk.rather,the crosswalk was equally safe or dangerous no matter where the bus stop was located moving the bus stop,of course,would do nothing to remedy any danger in using the crosswalk in sum,the bus stop merely presented a reason to use the crosswalk it did not create or increase any danger there.
moreover,as the san mateo county transit district amici curiae brief observed,whether an injured person can sue for damages for injuries allegedly caused by a dangerous condition of public property does not and should not depend on his or her destination.conversely,whether a public entity property was an injured person destination should not determine its liability.recovery for injuries sustained by persons otherwise similarly to the identical not turn on where they are going next.
the reason trial lawyers seek to expand the tort liability of public agencies is clear taxpayers will foot the bill,and taxpayers are assumed to have deep pockets.this case is a perfect example.although cccta was found to be only percent at fault for this accident,under the doctrine of joint and several liability,judgment was entered against cccta for over million in economic damages,ante,d at,at.however,the pockets of taxpayers are not bottomless.they never were,and they certainly are not now.the awarded to plaintiff as damages for an accident for which cccta was not at fault,cccta,inevitably,must make up by cutting service or raising fares.
the majority indifference to this,to the real world consequences of its expansive doctrine of public tort liability,is all the more inexcusable now because transit agencies,like other state and local agencies,are in crisis.california,as anyone who has glanced at a newspaper recently knows,faces a budget deficit that may be as high as billion.see,martinez,the programmed disintegration of the golden era in the golden state,times.even using the legislative analyst more conservative estimate of billion,that is each for every man,woman and child in california.put another way,it is more than a third of the billion the state will spend on all general fund schools,community colleges,prisons,courts,parks,healthcare for kids and the elderly poor and all the rest.editorial,counting to billion the stakes behind an unimaginable number,sacramento bee.
this crisis,of course,affects public transit agencies as well.take the bay area transit agencies,for example bart has already had to slash its raise fares and introduce parking make up a million budget deficit for the current fiscal year,which ends june.and while financial analysts see ridership and sales tax rebounding in the coming fiscal year,the recovery will be slow and bart will still face big budget at million next year and million over the next years.cabanatuan,bart dip in ridership may force higher fares,chronicle.faced with a million budget shortfall,the san francisco municipal transportation agency commission voted wednesday to increase most
