this case presents the novel question of when an order promulgating a regulation of the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa has been issued for the purposes of calculating the period in which a petition for review must be filed.we hold that an order has not been issued until it has been filed with the office of the federal register and thus made available for public inspection.although we conclude that the petition for review in this case was timely under the rule,for the reasons recounted below,we lack jurisdiction and thus transfer the petition to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the circuit under.
background 
public citizen,the center for auto safety,the trauma foundation,andrew mcguire,jane kelly,and ralf hotchkiss collectively petitioners seek review of nhtsa december order december final rule or final rule adopting amendments to federal motor vehicle safety standard,standard.in order to provide some context for the issues presented by petitioners,we briefly explain the history and purpose of standard.see federal motor vehicle safety standards occupant crash protection appendix of the air bag provisions in standard,may,may interim rule or interim rule.
in,congress enacted the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of the act,stat,in order to reduce traffic accidents and deaths and injuries resulting from traffic accidents.the act directed the secretary of transportation the secretary or his delegate to issue appropriate federal motor vehicle safety standards,stat,and the secretary has delegated this authority to the administrator of nhtsa,see a see also freightliner myrick,d.
standard was initially promulgated in and required manufacturers to install manual lap belts in all new motor vehicles.see initial federal motor vehicle safety standards.in,congress included a provision in the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act the istea that directed nhtsa to amend standard to require that all passenger cars and light trucks provide automatic occupant protection by means of air bags.b.however,the istea did not specify an air bag system design that manufacturers were required to use,and left the design and testing procedures to nhtsa discretion.nhtsa developed detailed testing criteria,including specific testing procedures,particular test dummies to be used in testing,injury criteria,and performance limits.until march,manufacturers had to meet the injury criteria limits in standard for equipped vehicles in barrier crashes at speeds of up to miles per hour mph,using both a belted percentile adult male dummy and an unbelted one.at.
in an effort to address the growing incidence of induced injuries nhtsa adopted,at the prompting of congress,a series of rules governing occupant safety,including the transportation equity act for the century which prompted the december final rule at issue here.congress enacted after several congressional hearings during which many witnesses and members of congress expressed concern that,under the standard,manufacturers were required to design air bags to protect adult passengers who chose not to wear seat belts,which necessarily,albeit unintentionally,increased the risk of air bag injuries to infants and children,at.tea directed the secretary to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to improve occupant protection for occupants of different sizes,belted and unbelted,under standard,while minimizing the risk to infants,children,and other occupants from injuries and deaths caused by air bags,by means that include advanced air bags.a.thus gave the secretary broad discretion to accomplish the distinct goals of improv ing occupant protection for occupants of different sizes,belted and unbelted while minimizing the risk to infants,children,and other occupants from injuries and deaths caused by air bags.id 
pursuant to,nhtsa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to modify standard on september,which proposed a broad range of possible changes,including a mph barrier crash test and a mph offset deformable barrier crash test for percentile adult females.federal motor vehicle safety standards occupant crash protection.after receiving comments from interested parties,see department of transportation docket,nhtsa issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking in november,proposing two alternative unbelted test procedures and contemplating a mph speed for the unbelted barrier crash test for the initial period,and increasing the test speed to mph at a later date.federal motor vehicle safety standards occupant crash protection.
on may,nhtsa published its may interim rule,adding a wide variety of new requirements,test procedures,and injury criteria,using an assortment of new dummies.at.ultimately deciding to resolve the uncertainty associated with the challenge of simultaneously achieving the twin goals of in favor of minimizing risk,nhtsa decided to reduce the maximum speed in the rigid barrier crash test for unbelted percentile adult males and percentile female dummies to mph for the first and second periods issuing that part of the rule as an interim final rule and planning a effort to obtain additional data.at.it promised to issue a final decision regarding the maximum test speed after giving notice and seeking public comment and kept the docket for this rule change open for that purpose.at.
petitioners public citizen and the center for auto safety filed a joint petition for reconsideration in june asserting that the may interim rule not only does not improve occupant protection for all occupants but even decreases protection for some occupants.june,petition for reconsideration,available at.cfm docket number.among other requests,public citizen and the center for auto safety suggested that nhtsa impose the mph requirement on passenger cars and reserve the mph test for light trucks,vans,and suvs.at 
on december,nhtsa published the december final rule,granting portions of the petitions for reconsideration and revising the regulations in certain respects,but denying those portions of the petitions that urged nhtsa to change the maximum unbelted barrier crash test speed back to mph.at.thus,the mph maximum speed requirement for unbelted dummies in barrier crash tests remained unchanged in the first and second periods.it is this december final rule that petitioners challenge in their petition for review 
jurisdiction 
as a preliminary matter,we must determine whether the petition was timely filed in this circuit within the period for seeking judicial review.
a person adversely affected by an order prescribing a motor vehicle safety standard under this chapter may apply for review of the order by filing a petition for review in the court of appeals of the united states for the circuit in which the person resides or has its principal place of business.the petition must be filed not later than days after the order is issued.
because the period for seeking judicial review does not commence until an order is issued,the heart of our inquiry centers on what is meant by issued.
the federal register indicates that the december final rule was issued on december,but was filed on december.at,and published in the federal register on december,id.at.the petition was filed february.therefore,the petition was timely filed if the date the final order was issued is the date of publication in the federal register or the date the final order was filed,but not if it is the date on which the federal register indicates the final rule was issued.
petitioners contend that the deadline began to run on december,the date that the final rule was published in the federal register and released in the department of transportation rulemaking docket docket,as they had no notice of the final rule before that date and thus argue that their right to seek review could not have been affected by a rule of which they were unaware.the secretary,relying on nhtsa rulemaking procedures,argues that the period for judicial review does not begin to run on the publication date rather it runs from the date that the regulation is issued by the agency.rulemaking procedures.on the basis of this regulation,the secretary contends that the petition for review,filed on february,was filed days after the period had lapsed.
it is that nhtsa interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to substantial deference.see martin occupational safety health review comm n,d lyng payne,d.indeed,the secretary argument is not wholly meritless.in amending its procedural regulations regarding judicial review of various chapters of title of the united states code,nhtsa responded to concerns of several commenters and clarified that t he agency deems a decision in response to a petition for reconsideration to be final for judicial review purposes on the date that it is issued.at.although nhtsa acknowledged that a petitioner is presumed to have notice of the agency action when it is published in the federal register,citing,fed.crop ins.merrill,it stated that the language of each of these statutes,a b indicates that the time period for judicial review does not begin to run on the publication date rather it runs from the date that the regulation,standard,or decision on reconsideration is issued or prescribed by the agency.id.thus,nhtsa clearly does not equate issued with published.
however,nhtsa rulemaking regulations,subpart b,do not describe or define what date is to be listed as the issued date for regulations.indeed,in this case,it is not clear what,if any,event took place on december.although nhtsa has indicated that it does not equate issued with publication in the federal register,it has not defined the term or expressed any indication of what the term issued means.significantly,its regulations do not require the agency to inform interested parties or give notice to the public on the date that a regulation is issued.although states that w henever the administrator determines that a petition for reconsideration should be granted or denied,he prepares a notice of the grant or denial of a petition for reconsideration,for issuance to the petitioner,and issues it to the petitioner,the regulations do not specify the timing or manner in which the notice must be issued.thus,without any indication of what event takes place when a regulation is issued,and without any explanation of the timing or manner in which notification is to be achieved,nhtsa can adversely affect the amount of time that a person has to file a petition for judicial review.
although we afford nhtsa considerable discretion to specify when an order has been issued,see skelly oil phillips petroleum,united states,cir interpretation of terms relating to its own procedures are similarly entitled to some deference,especially where there is no compelling precedent or reason tending to support an opposite view,nhtsa should not have the power to manipulate the jurisdiction of the federal courts.manufactured hous.ass n,cisneros,cir see also pub.citizen nuclear regulatory comm n,although an agency has considerable latitude in determining the event that triggers commencement of the judicial review period,it must do so reasonably.internal citations omitted.
indeed,while we ordinarily defer to an agency interpretation of its own regulations we need not accord any deference to an unreasonable construction that does not conform with the wording and purpose of the regulation.see lal ins,cir blattner sons,sec y of labor,mine safety health,cir mem l rehab.hosp.sec y of health human,cir see also morris commodity futures trading comm n,cir where the question to be decided involved matters of particular expertise of the agency,the deferential standard should be applied.but judicial deference is not necessarily warranted where courts have experience in the area and are fully competent to decide the issue.here,nhtsa has stated that one purpose of establishing procedures for public participation in its rulemaking processes is to inform the public of the procedures following in response to rulemaking petitions.because nhtsa interpretation of issued fails to provide for or require any form of notice before the time period for seeking judicial review commences,its interpretation is clearly at odds with its goal of inform ing the public of the procedures that must be followed to obtain judicial review.accordingly,we conclude that nhtsa interpretation is unreasonable and is not entitled to any deference.
in the absence of a reasonable definition of issued by nhtsa,we remain cognizant of its stated purpose of informing the public and turn to analogous precedent for guidance.although we have not defined issued,we have derived reasonable definitions of similar terms by considering the ordinary meaning of the word s.envtl.def.ctr.brennen,cir noting that,as defined by both black law dictionary and webster ninth new collegiate dictionary,the ordinary meaning of the word promulgate is to publish or to announce officially see also.manufactured hous.ass n,at noting the random house unabridged dictionary definition of issue as to put out deliver for use,sale put into circulation and to mint,print,or publish for sale of distribution,the court held that the verb issue clearly refers to an act of public announcement and not to the act of arriving at a private decision within the agency.according to black law dictionary,the verb issue is defined as t o send out or distribute officially.black law dictionary ed.webster defines issue as t o distribute or circulate officially.webster ii new riverside university dictionary.the ordinary meaning of issue therefore contemplates some form of public notice.
further,in resolving questions of timeliness in similar contexts,we have held that the public must be notified of regulations affecting the right of interested parties to seek judicial review before those rights may be implicated.see newell sec,cir holding that an sec regulation had given certain meaning to the term entry date,such that all public orders were available for public inspection on the entry date,and noting that this regulation had specifically addressed the aggrieved party need to have both adequate notice and sufficient time to prepare its petition brennen,at explaining that the public generally does not know of agency actions and therefore can not be expected to begin preparing an attack on them prior to such knowledge.
therefore,in keeping with the ordinary meaning of issue,our case law,and nhtsa own stated purpose in promulgating procedures for public participation in its processes,we hold that a regulation issued under is issued on the date that the regulation is made available for public inspection.although nhtsa represented in its brief to this court that it had filed the december final rule on december,it failed to document or explain this filing,and yet the federal register indicates a filing date of december.see.at fr doc.filed am.because the published filing date is presumed correct it appears that the first time the december final rule was made available for public inspection was december,at accordingly,the petition for review was timely filed on february,two days before the expiration of the deadline under 
the secretary urges that,even if the petition for review was timely filed,this court nonetheless lacks jurisdiction to consider petitioners claims because the petitioners who may properly file a petition for review in this court filed well after the deadline under.the secretary notes that only public citizen and the center for auto safety petitioned for reconsideration of the may interim rule and that they have their principal places of business in washington.the four other trauma foundation,andrew mcguire,jane kelly,and ralf not file a petition for reconsideration of the may interim rule,and filed their petition for review,along with public citizen and the center for auto safety,with this court on february.these petitioners the california petitioners reside in or have their principal place of business in california.because nhtsa regulations provide that the filing of a timely petition for reconsideration of any rule issued under this part postpones the expiration of the statutory period in which to seek judicial review of that rule only as to the petitioner,and not as to other interested persons,the secretary contends th
