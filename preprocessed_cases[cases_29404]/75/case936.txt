this case illustrates the basic maxim that statutory text binds federal agencies.ocean transportation intermediaries help arrange shipping for companies.federal law requires ocean transportation intermediaries to obtain licenses from the federal maritime commission.on occasion,ocean transportation intermediaries will use are not themselves ocean transportation assist them in some of their myriad activities,such as packing or trucking services.in the order at issue here,the federal maritime commission required agents of ocean transportation intermediaries to obtain licenses.the commission decision requiring agent licensing may or may not be wise policy.but the fundamental problem,as federal maritime commissioner dye explained in her persuasive dissenting opinion,is that the commission does not possess statutory authority to require agents of ocean transportation intermediaries who are not themselves ocean transportation intermediaries to obtain licenses.we therefore grant landstar petition for review,vacate the commission declaratory order,and remand to the commission.
under the shipping act of,et,the federal maritime commission regulates ocean shipping between the united states and foreign countries.section of the act mandates that all ocean transportation intermediaries be licensed by the commission 
a person in the united states may not act as an ocean transportation intermediary unless the person holds an ocean transportation intermediary license issued by the federal maritime commission.the commission shall issue a license to a person that the commission determines to be qualified by experience and character to act as an ocean transportation intermediary.

ocean transportation intermediaries are defined as either ocean freight forwarders offs or common carriers nvoccs.id.both offs and nvoccs are intermediaries between i shippers,who seek to export cargo,and ii ocean carriers,who physically carry the cargo on their vessels.see nlrb int l longshoremen ass n,d nvoccs customs brokers forwarders ass of,ncbfaa united states,offs.
an ocean freight forwarder is a person that dispatches shipments from the united states via a common carrier and books or otherwise arranges space for those shipments on behalf of shippers,and processes the documentation or performs related activities incident to those shipments.in practice,that typically means that the off secures cargo space with a shipping line books the cargo,coordinates the movement of cargo to shipside,arranges for the payment of ocean freight charges,and provides other accessorial services such as arranging insurance,trucking,and warehousing.ncbfaa,at.offs receive compensation from both the shipper and the carrier.id.
a common carrier,meanwhile,is a common carrier that does not operate the vessels by which the ocean transportation is provided and is a shipper in its relationship with a common carrier.see also id.although nvoccs usually do not own or operate vessels to actually carry the cargo,they lease facilities and services from other them the common carrier s responsible for transportation of the cargo from origin to destination.see ncbfaa,at.most nvoccs consolidate small parcels from multiple shippers bound for the same destination and arrange for them to be shipped as a single,large,sealed container under one bill of lading.see id.upon arrival,nvoccs arrange for the container to be broken down and for each parcel to be distributed to each customer.thus,unlike an off,the nvocc issues its own bill of lading to each shipper,and the common carrier issues a bill of lading to each nvocc.see fireman fund am.ins.puerto rican forwarding,cir.unlike offs,nvoccs receive compensation only from the shipper.see ncbfaa,at.
under of the act,all persons or entities acting as ocean transportation intermediaries must obtain licenses from the federal maritime commission.thus,all persons or entities acting as offs must obtain off licenses,and all persons or entities acting as nvoccs must obtain nvocc licenses.
in recent decades,the ocean transportation intermediary industry has expanded and modernized.offs and nvoccs have increasingly forged agency arrangements with certain third parties to enhance their operational efficiencies.for example,nvoccs rely on agents such as warehouses,truckers,container lessors,steamships,and in foreign countries where it may be difficult to hire employees or open branch offices.
petitioner landstar is a licensed nvocc.in january,landstar requested an opinion letter from the federal maritime commission general counsel on the lawfulness of using unlicensed agents to assist with certain aspects of its ocean transportation intermediary services.the general counsel responded that a licensed nvocc could lawfully use unlicensed agents to perform nvocc services.as agents,acting on behalf of landstar,they would not be subject to the licensing requirements of section of the shipping act because they would not be holding out in their own right to provide nvocc services.letter from fmc general counsel to landstar,joint appendix.
in august,team ocean services,an ocean transportation intermediary licensed as both an off and nvocc,petitioned the commission for a declaratory order that would reaffirm the conclusions of the fmc general counsel.team ocean requested that the commission dispel any regulatory uncertainty so it could move forward with plans to incorporate unlicensed off and nvocc services on its its business model.in the team ocean proceeding,landstar the petitioner in this case filed comments advancing the position that agents providing nvocc services are not subject to the licensing requirement of.
in a decision,the commission ruled that the use of unlicensed agents was unlawful because an agent that provides ocean transportation intermediary services act s as an ocean transportation intermediary within the meaning of and is therefore subject to the licensing requirement.in re lawfulness of unlicensed persons acting as agents for licensed ocean transportation for declaratory order,at,fed.comm,order.the commission did not rely on the text of the shipping act.the commission instead relied on the remedial purposes of the act,which the commission said were to address complaints concerning nvocc practices by protecting the shipping public from unqualified or unscrupulous service providers.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the commission concluded that sanctioning the use of unlicensed agents would undermine the spirit and basic policy behind and render the statute absurd.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in dissent,commissioner dye primarily argued that the text of of the shipping act does not permit licensing of agents who only provide nvocc services on behalf of a licensed nvocc principal.commissioner dye explained that an agent working on behalf of a disclosed,licensed nvocc does not act as an ocean transportation intermediary because by definition it does not operate as an nvocc or common carrier since such nvocc agents would be acting on behalf of a licensed principal without holding out and without assuming responsibility,section of the shipping act would not require them to obtain separate oti licenses.id.at,dye,commissioner,dissenting.recognizing that many licensed nvoccs currently use unlicensed agents for different aspects of their businesses,she warned that the policy adopted by the majority would stifle this business innovation.id.at.commissioner dye thus favored issuing a declaratory order stating that licensed nvoccs may use unlicensed agents as long as the agent does not hold out to provide ocean transportation intermediary services in its own right.
landstar petitions for review of the commission declaratory order to the extent it applies to nvoccs and their use of agents to provide nvocc services.landstar argues that the commission order contravenes the text of the statute.chevron usa,natural res.def.council,d.
