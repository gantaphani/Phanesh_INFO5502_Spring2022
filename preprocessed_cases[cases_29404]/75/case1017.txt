in the amendments to the clean air act congress directed the environmental protection agency to regulate emissions of what the agency calls mobile source air is,toxic chemicals emitted by motor vehicles.section l of the amended clean air act requires the administrator first to complete a study assessing the need for,and feasibility of,controlling emissions of toxic air pollutants associated with motor vehicles and motor vehicle fuels,l,and then to promulgate regulations based on that study,id.l.the regulations are to contain standards 
which the administrator determines reflect the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable through the application of technology which will be available,taking into consideration the standards established under subsection a of this section,the availability and costs of the technology,and noise,energy,and safety factors,and lead time.
id.in march epa released the regulations,control of emissions of hazardous air pollutants from mobile sources.march,the final rule.here we review challenges brought by the sierra club and several other environmental groups by the states of new york and connecticut,also seeking greater stringency and by the international truck corporation,seeking removal of diesel particulate matter and diesel exhaust organic gases in sum,diesel exhaust from the epa list of toxics.finding most of the claims of the first two sets of petitioners ill founded,and international truck claim unripe,we uphold all aspects of the rule,save agency unexplained rejection of proposals to require diagnostics for very heavy vehicles.
before delving into the environmental and state petitioners attacks on specific features of the rule,we begin by addressing three general statutory issues.the environmental petitioners say that the whole rule violated the statutory mandate because it was not based on a study meeting the requirements of l.petitioners acknowledge that the epa did conduct a study several studies,in fact,and that the agency used information gleaned from those studies in the rulemaking.but they claim that the studies were inadequate.as we understand the claim,petitioners do not ask us to grade the study against the substantive standards of l,but rather to find that its alleged inadequacies doom the final rule.
but we do not read the statute as making the validity of the rule depend on that of the study.in the first place,petitioners do not propose a method of review for determining whether a rule was or was not based on a study,nor does any seem immediately apparent moreover,the statute does say that the rule must be based exclusively on the study.more importantly,for purposes of assessing the epa rule,the requirement that the rule be based on the study bears no plausible relationship to the criteria that obviously govern the of l,quoted above.the study subsection,l,directs the administrator only to evaluate the need for and feasibility of means and measures for controlling mobile air toxics.to the extent that a feasibility analysis in the study involves the same considerations as l,it adds nothing to the extent that it involves something else,we do not think it can override l explicit requirements.thus,the agency failure to have studied feasibility per se would not affect the validity of the rule.
the state petitioners attacks on epa exposure modeling similarly fail to undermine the rule.epa acknowledges that its modeling can be improved,updated and refined,but petitioners have identified no portion of the final rule in which the agency specifically relied on the exposure modeling for justification,and have pointed to any decision that would have turned out differently but for the modeling flaws.
finally,petitioners point out that l is,so that the agency must consider future advances in pollution control capability.see,husqvarna ab epa.this is not disputed,but does take petitioners far.the statute also intends the agency to consider many factors other than pure technological capability,such as costs,lead time,safety,noise and energy.and its language does not resolve how the administrator should weigh all these factors in the process of finding the greatest emission reduction achievable.petitioners offer no construction of the statute contradicting the agency overall approach,and thus present no occasion for us to attempt any final analysis of the statutory meaning.the sole possible exception to this is a short passage in the environmental petitioners brief attacking the agency observation that the program imposed by the agency and discussed below at negligible cost is the most stringent program that we can justify in the near term.final rule.at emphasis added see environmental petitioners initial brief at.petitioners imply that the agency regarded more than negligible cost as automatically disqualifying a standard under l,but the reference plainly does express that idea.petitioners also quote to us a fragment from national lime ass epa,purportedly to show that we have previously ruled that achievability means capable of being met.but that snippet merely pointed out that achievability can not mean something stronger than capable of being met the rest of the discussion is not on point.thus,there is no real issue before us on the degree to which the statute constrains consideration of cost.compare the very severe constraints that we found under the feasibility standard of the occupational safety and health act.united steelworkers marshall.except for certain explicit statutory questions,therefore,our review will be under the familiar apa standard of arbitrary and capricious.
we now turn to petitioners attacks on specific elements or omissions of the final rule.
fuel controls 
epa concluded that in light of the drastic regulatory requirements that it was already imposing on the automobile and fuel industries through prior rulemakings,namely tier,control of air pollution from new motor vehicles tier motor vehicle emission standards,and,control of air pollution from new motor vehicles vehicle and engine standards,it should for the time being limit regulation of motor vehicle fuel to an provision,also called the toxic performance requirement tpr.this provision prevents a refinery or importer from increasing the toxicity of its fuel emissions over a baseline level determined by its emissions performance from.final rule.at.many refiners have voluntarily overcomplied with existing regulations,finding it economically advantageous to strip their fuel of more toxic chemicals than necessary,evidently because the market value of the extracted chemicals in certain regions more than covers the extra removal costs.final rule.at.absent the regulation,backsliding would presumably occur if the chemicals market prices fell.the rule measures backsliding by reference to the agency complex model,which calculates the expected toxicity of emissions as a function of the concentrations of five toxic chemicals in the formaldehyde butadiene acetaldehyde and polycyclic organic matter.thus the standard aggregates chemicals a refiner could,for example,offset an increase in benzene with a decrease in acetaldehyde.
the environmental petitioners challenge both the agency allowance of aggregation and its failure to impose emissions caps rather than merely preventing backsliding.as to aggregation,they stress that l requires that the regulations shall,at a minimum,apply to emissions of benzene and formaldehyde.l.the rule,of course,does apply to benzene and formaldehyde,as well as to the three other chemicals,so it achieves literal compliance with the statute.nor does the agency interpretation appear unreasonable on the facts.we can imagine a case where it would not make sense merely to include benzene or formaldehyde in a basket of toxics.for example,it might be shown that the complex model weights chemicals incorrectly in light of their adverse health effects,or that differences among the chemicals,in terms of the relation between health effects and achievable controls,called for some sort of weighting adjustment or even ranking.but no such claim is made.thus we see neither statutory violation nor capriciousness in the agency decision
