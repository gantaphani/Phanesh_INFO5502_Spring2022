the district court severed ventress case from that of pilot jack crawford and severed hacs as a defendant.on march,the court denied ventress motion to transfer venue back to the central district of california,holding that the doctrine of the law of the case prevented it from reconsidering an issue decided and affirmed on appeal by this court.

arbitration award 
ventress contends that the district court erred in granting hacs motion to confirm and denying ventress motion to vacate the arbitration award because the arbitrator was biased against him and failed to follow the law.on de novo review,coutee barrington capital group,cir,we affirm.
the hawaii supreme court has noted that b ecause of the legislative policy to encourage arbitration and thereby discourage litigation,judicial review of an arbitration award is confined to the strictest possible limits.gadd kelley,haw quoting mars constructors,tropical enters,haw.a court may therefore vacate an arbitration award only for the limited reasons specified by statute.see id.one such reason is e vident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral arbitrator.a a.evident partiality may exist where there is actual bias on the part of the arbitrator,or where undisclosed facts demonstrate a reasonable impression of partiality.see daiichi real estate lichter,haw.the burden of proving facts which would establish a reasonable impression of partiality rests squarely on the party challenging the award.id.at quoting sheet metal workers int l ass local union kinney air conditioning,cir.
hawaii law also allows a court to vacate an arbitration award if a n arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator powers.a.an arbitrator does not exceed the arbitrator powers by misunderstanding or incorrectly applying the law.see tatibouet ellsworth,haw.vacatur may be proper,however,where the parties provide proof that the arbitrators intentionally and plainly disregarded the relevant substantive law.id.at.
ventress argues that the arbitrator was biased against him because he had previously filed a motion to disqualify the arbitrator and because he is african american.ventress claims that the arbitrator is a trustee for the office of hawaiian affairs,which ventress believes demonstrates an ideology of rational nationalism is a graduate of the kamehameha school,which offers preference to native hawaiian applicants and from which hacs owner also graduated and belongs to the mormon church,which ventress claims had a reputation of racial bias against blacks.these affiliations,he asserts,establish evident partiality by the arbitrator.the district court,however,correctly concluded that ventress has offered only bald allegations of partiality without any,much less persuasive,evidence to support these claims.
in the absence of evidence of actual bias,the filing and denial of a motion to disqualify an arbitrator in one arbitration does not establish bias in a subsequent arbitration.moreover,the arbitrator supposed affiliations,and ventress unsupported assertions about their ideologies,do not establish bias.nor does the fact that the arbitrator and hacs owner graduated from the same school,apparently some thirteen years apart,establish bias or a conflict of interest.
ventress also argues that the arbitrator allowed hacs to serve procedurally improper subpoenas,permitted hacs to submit an untimely supplement to its final arbitration argument,and denied ventress an alleged right to be represented by a.as the district court correctly noted,however,even assuming that the arbitrator erred in applying the law,ventress has not shown that he intentionally and plainly disregarded the law.we therefore affirm confirmation of the arbitration award and denial of the motion to vacate it.
motion to transfer venue 
ventress argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to transfer venue from the district of hawaii to the central district of california because he thinks racial and residential factors make california a better venue for him.these are the same arguments that ventress made in ventress i,where we held that the district court decision to transfer venue was not an abuse of discretion.at.the district court correctly concluded that it could not reconsider that question.see city of harbor div.santa monica baykeeper,cir.
motion to amend 
ventress also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to amend the complaint to substitute hawaii claims for california claims and add a federal claim.we review for abuse of discretion the district court denial of a motion to amend a complaint.chappel lab.of america,cir.a district court acts within its discretion to deny leave to amend when amendment would be futile,when it would cause undue prejudice to the defendant,or when it is sought in bad faith.id.at.
we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion.as to the claims,it concluded that,because venue was transferred under a,the substantive law of the transferor.see muldoon tropitone furniture,cir.it also noted that ventress and crawford chose to bring only california claims,argued strenuously that california interests were paramount,waited nearly a a substantive motion was pending against their attempting to amend it,and did not show that the law of the two states was different on the merits.as to the federal claim,the wpp provides no private right of action,williams united airlines,cir,and ventress provided no evidence that he had exhausted the prescribed administrative remedies.we therefore hold that there was no error in the denial of the motion to amend.
federal preemption 
finally,ventress contends that the district court erred in granting jal motion for judgment on the pleadings on the basis of complete federal preemption.ventress argues that the ada,as amended by the wpp,does not preempt his claim under the state whistle blower protection statute,california labor code b and his claim for wrongful termination in violation of the publi
