ronald hylla appeals from the district court decision granting transportation communications international union tciu motion to dismiss or,alternatively,for summary judgment.hylla appeal calls on us to consider the scope of protection offered to elected union officers under title i of the reporting and disclosure act lmrda.the district court concluded that the protection offered by title i only extends to expression or speech that is related to the general union membership as a whole.because the district court found that hylla speech was not so related,it granted tciu motion to dismiss on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
background 
on november,hylla filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of minnesota asserting that tciu had removed him from his elected position of senior vice general chairman of system board of adjustment.according to hylla,tciu had done so because he exercised his right to engage in free speech,to meet and assemble freely with other members,and to express his views relative to the business of tciu and system board of adjustment hylla asserted,inter alia,that tciu conduct was a violation of title i of the lmrda.
hylla complaint was terse.aside from mentioning that tciu had removed him from his position,it did not divulge the facts that gave rise to his claim.instead,the case relevant factual background was initially revealed in the memorandum of law in support of tciu motion to dismiss or,alternatively,for summary judgment.hylla responded to this motion and provided his own version of the facts.as the district court noted,however,t he parties do not dispute the basic underlying facts as summarized by the magistrate judge and set forth in the transcript of the internal union hearing.those facts may be summarized as follows.
tciu is a labor union that represents employees in the railroad industry.it has a governance structure,the second tier of which consists of intermediate bodies known as system boards.in may of,hylla was elected senior vice general chairman of system board of adjustment system board.as senior vice chairman of the system board,hylla reported directly to the system board general chairman,larry swanson.
the events that precipitated this case occurred on november.it was on that day that hylla left a note in swanson office inquiring why swanson was monitoring his workplace attendance.in response,swanson told hylla that he had instructed kelly gilbertson,an administrative employee in the system board office,to keep attendance records of everybody so that he could know when people are in the office and when they not.hylla was skeptical of this explanation and complained that he was being singled out.thereafter,the two exchanged some additional remarks,with hylla eventually telling swanson,well,fuck you.upset,swanson replied that hylla had gone too far and that this would not be the end of the matter.swanson thereafter exited the office and went to the lunchroom to make a personal phone call.
when swanson returned to the office,he observed that gilbertson was standing in front of her office door visibly upset.swanson asked gilbertson what happened gilbertson responded that she had just been threatened by hylla.according to gilbertson,hylla had walked into her office,thrown a stack of papers on her desk,and said watch your back.gilbertson interpreted hylla remark as a threat,especially in light of hylla unpleasant demeanor.thereafter,swanson confronted hylla about gilbertson allegations,to which hylla offered no response.
troubled by hylla conduct,swanson contacted robert scardelletti,the international president of tciu,to discuss what had occurred.pursuant to this discussion,on november,swanson instructed hylla that he was not to return to the system board office until he was otherwise informed.thereafter,in a letter dated november,scardelletti informed hylla that he was being charged with conduct unbecoming of an officer,insubordination,and dereliction of duty,all in violation of tciu constitution.these charges arose from the two incidents that occurred on november,as well as previous incidents that occurred in august and december of.hylla was suspended pending a hearing on the charges.
hylla hearing occurred on january,and featured testimony from several witnesses,including hylla,swanson,and gilbertson.following the hearing,the tciu hearing officer recommended that hylla be found guilty of all but one of the charges against him.as a consequence,the hearing officer further recommended that hylla be removed from office and declared permanently ineligible to hold any tciu office in the future.scardelletti adopted the hearing officer recommendations and thereafter informed the district chairpersons of his decision.scardelletti made clear that his decision was based on the two incidents that occurred on november,hylla use of profane language towards swanson,and hylla perceived threat towards gilbertson.
hylla appealed scardelletti decision to the tciu executive counsel,which sustained the decision.thereafter,having exhausted his intraunion remedies,hylla brought suit in the district court,claiming,inter alia,that tciu decision to remove him from office violated his free speech rights under title i of the lmrda.after tciu responded with a motion to dismiss or,alternatively,for summary judgment,the district court ruled in tciu favor.according to the court,because the conduct for which hylla was removed from office was not protected by the lmrda,it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over hylla action.hylla now appeals.
ii.discussion 
in granting tciu motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the district court concluded that hylla conduct did not concern the general interests of the union membership and therefore was not protected speech under title i of the lmrda.on appeal,hylla contends that the district court decision was erroneous because title i protection is not strictly limited to speech relating to the general interests of the union membership.alternatively,hylla contends that even if title i protection is so limited,his conduct was sufficiently related to the general interests of tciu so as to fall within the scope of title i protections.each of these arguments will be considered in turn.
standard of review 
w hen the district court decision to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is based on the complaint alone,or on the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record,our review is limited to determining whether the district court application of the law is correct and,if the decision is based on undisputed facts,whether those facts are indeed undisputed.osborn united states,cir quoting williamson tucker,cir.if the court relied,however,on its own determination of disputed factual issues,the appellate court must then review those findings under the clearly erroneous standard.id.
in this case,the district court did not resolve any factual disputes in determining that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.although hylla argued that profane language was common at the system board,this contention had no bearing on whether his remark to swanson was protected by the lmrda,and therefore,was not relevant in determining whether subject matter jurisdiction existed.similarly,although hylla believed that his conduct towards gilbertson was,this too had no bearing on whether the conduct was protected by title i of the lmrda,and in turn,had no bearing on whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over hylla action.thus,because no material factual issues were decided,the district court decision is reviewed de novo.
b.the lmrda 
hylla claims arise under a of the lmrda.this section,titled freedom of speech and assembly,provides 
every member of any labor organization shall have the right to meet and assemble freely with other members and to express any views,arguments,or opinions and to express at meetings of the labor organization his views,upon candidates in an election of the labor organization or upon any business properly before the meeting,subject to the organization established and reasonable rules pertaining to the conduct of meetings provided,that nothing herein shall be construed to impair the right of a labor organization to adopt and enforce reasonable rules as to the responsibility of every member toward the organization as an institution and to his refraining from conduct that would interfere with its performance of its legal or contractual obligations.
section,in turn,provides a private right of action for violations of a.section reads in relevant part any person whose rights secured by the provisions of this subchapter have been infringed by any violation of this subchapter may bring a civil action in a district court of the united states for such relief including injunctions as may be appropriate.
the scope of a protection 
although on its face a claims are limited to union members,the supreme court has recognized that in some instances union members who hold elected pursue claims pertaining to their status as an officer under a.sheet metal workers int l ass lynn,d.specifically,the court has reasoned that w hether interference with title i rights gives rise to a cause of action under must be judged by reference to the lmrda basic objective to ensure that unions are democratically governed,and responsive to the will of the union membership as expressed in open,periodic elections.id.at.quotation,alteration omitted.in lynn,this basic objective cut in favor of recognizing a cause of action,because 
s eeing lynn removed from his post just five days after he led the fight to defeat yet another dues increase proposal,other members of the union may well have concluded that one challenged the union hierarchy,if at all,at one peril.this is precisely what congress sought to prevent when it passed the lmrda.it recognized that democracy would be assured only if union members are free to discuss union policies and criticize the leadership without fear of reprisal.
id.at.footnote,quotation omitted.
the court also observed that lynn himself,who was also a union member,paid a price for the exercise of his membership rights when he was discharged from his elected position as a business representative of the union in retaliation for his outspoken speech against a dues increase.id.at.both the rights of other union members to elect lynn as their business representative and lynn free speech rights as a union member to campaign against the dues increase were chilled by the decision of the union president to discharge lynn.the court considered both sets of rights in the balancing analysis to determine whether lynn discharge was so undemocratic as to violate lynn a rights.the circumstances in lynn may be contrasted with finnegan leu,d,where there was no countervailing democratic interest to weigh against the decision of a newly elected union officer to replace previously appointed union officials with his own staff.in lynn,however,the court determined that on balance,a was violated when lynn was discharged.
here,hylla was an elected official,suggesting some similarity to lynn.but,hylla discharge was not as a result of his representing the democratic will of the union membership.rather,it was the result of his speech and conduct in protest of what he perceived to be a personal affront against him.we must therefore decide whether hylla discharge under such circumstances chilled or threatened any union democratic values protected by a.
in analyzing this question,we draw some guidance by analogy from the supreme court observation that a was patterned after the first amendment.reed united transp.union,d however,as the court observed,the rights under a are subject to reasonable union rules that may restrict such rights,and thus,a is not strictly parallel with the first amendment even though a was patterned after it.united steelworkers sadlowski,d asserting congress modeled title i of the lmrda after the bill of rights,and the legislators intended a to restate a principal first amendment right to speak one mind without fear of reprisal.
in the first amendment context,when deciding whether a public employee speech is protected,t he threshold question is whether the employee speech may be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern wingate gage county sch,cir quoting connick myers,d.
w hen a public employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern,but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest,absent the most unusual circumstances,a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee behavior.
connick,at.however,when a government employee speaks as a citizen that is,outside the scope of matters of public concern,the first amendment offers protection if the speech survives the pickering balancing test mcgee pub.water supply,dist,cir referring to pickering bd.of,d.
similar criteria must be applied in the lmrda context as well.namely,instead of the first amendment inquiry that asks whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern,the threshold inquiry in the lmrda context is whether the speech at issue may be fairly characterized as a matter of union concern.and like in the first amendment context,speech that involves entirely personal interests is not,absent the most unusual circumstances,a matter of union concern.see,maceira pagan,cir asserting,i n drawing the fine line between insubordination and freedom of speech in removal from union position cases,we must balance plaintiffs interest in free speech and expression against whatever legitimate union concerns may warrant limitations upon those activities citation omitted.
as such,we agree with the district court that a protection is limited to speech that relates to the general interests of the union membership at large.in addition to a relation to the first amendment,our disposition of this issue is bolstered by the supreme court observation in lynn that title i of the lmrda was founded on congress desire to protect the democratic governance of unions.because a union democratic governance will not be undermined by speech that is entirely personal,it is appropriate that no cause of action would arise for such expression.thus,as this court has previously recognized,a protects labor organization members reasonable rights of assembly and speech relating to their labor organization marshall local union,brewers maltsters and labor dep ts,cir emphasis added.it does not,however,go beyond what would be provided for under the first amendment,to protect speech that is of an entirely personal interest.
in arguing that a protection is not so limited,hylla chiefly relies on salzhandler caputo,cir.salzhandler involved a case in which the plaintiff,who was an elected financial secretary of a union,accused union officers of embezzlement and distributed a flier to the union membership describing the officers as thieves,scabs,robbers,scabby bosses,bums,pimps,and jailbirds.id.at.in response to this conduct,which the union leadership contended was libelous,the plaintiff was removed from his position and prohibited from participating in the affairs of the union for five years.the plaintiff sued,asserting that his conduct was protected under title i of the lmrda.the second circuit agreed.id.at.
to the extent that hylla argues that salzhandler stands for the notion that a protects speech that is not a matter of union concern,he is mistaken.the speech in salzhandler was clearly related to the general interests of the union.namely,it involved allegations that union funds were being misappropriated,a matter about which the general union membership would no doubt have an interest.
hylla reliance on turner air transport lodge of international association of machinists and aerospace workers,cir,stachan weber,cir,and williams united steel workers of america,d,is similarly misplaced.the conduct that gave rise to the a claims in each of these cases did not involve matters of an entirely personal nature,but instead,concerned matters that implicated the interests of the union as a whole.specifically,turner in
