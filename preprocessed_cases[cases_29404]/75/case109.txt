having considered the arguments de novo,we affirm the judgment of the district court for substantially the reasons stated in its decision and order.the county claims arise under new york law,and new york law therefore provides the elements of,and defenses to,those causes of action.see ferri ackerman,d w hen state law creates a cause of action,the state is free to define the defenses to that claim,including the defense of immunity,unless,of course,the state rule is in conflict with federal law.
as the district court explained,new york general rule is that public expenditures made in the performance of governmental functions are not recoverable.county of erie,wl,at quoting koch,at.in koch,new york city,after a hour citywide blackout caused by con edison negligence,attempted to recover from the company costs incurred for wages,salaries,overtime and other benefits of police,fire,sanitation and hospital personnel from whom services in addition to those which would normally have been rendered were required in consequence of the blackout.koch,at.the court of appeals rejected the city claim as contrary to the general rule regarding public expenditures,citing cases holding similarly in the context of a nuclear accident,an oil spill,and the dumping of a large quantity of tires.id.the general rule is grounded in considerations of public policy,and we perceive nothing in the different and somewhat closer relationship between con edison and plaintiffs in this case which would warrant departure from that rule.id.at.
other courts have found that the doctrine is rooted in a recognition that the cost of public services for protection from fire or safety hazards is to be borne by the public as a whole,not assessed against the tortfeasor whose negligence creates the need for the service.see county of erie,wl,at quoting city of flagstaff atchison,topeka and santa fe ry,cir.for example,in district of columbia air florida,the municipal authorities for the district of columbia sued air florida airlines for the cost of responding to a plane that crashed into a bridge over the potomac river.citing koch and related cases,the air florida court rejected the city claim for reimbursement for emergency services,noting 
where emergency services are provided by the government and the costs are spread by taxes,the tortfeasor does not anticipate a demand for reimbursement.although settled expectations must sometimes be disregarded when new tort doctrines are needed to remedy an inequitable allocation of risks and costs,where a generally fair system for spreading the costs of accidents is already in effect as it is here through assessing taxpayers the expense of emergency services we do not find the argument for judicial adjustment of liabilities to be compelling.
we are especially reluctant to reallocate risks where a governmental entity is the injured party.it is critically important to recognize that the government decision to provide services is a legislative policy determination.it is not the place of the courts to modify such decisions.furthermore,it is within the power of the government to protect itself from extraordinary emergency expenses by passing statutes or regulations that permit recovery from negligent parties.
like the district court,we conclude that,absent an exception,the free public services doctrine plainly bars the county claims to recover public expenditures.some of the county arguments amount to an assertion that the doctrine lacks strong support in new york law and has been weakened by subsequent related developments,but these arguments are unavailing most notably because the new york court of appeals has not suggested that the doctrine no longer applies.see bank of amoco oil,cir in making the determination of what new york law provides,we of course will afford the greatest weight to the decisions of the new york court of appeals.
moreover,neither of the county arguments on this point is persuasive.first,the county contends that various cases arising from the terrorist attacks on september,have expanded the duty of an airline to pay for consequences of a crash far greater in scope than the lives of the passengers and crew killed in a crash or the value of the airplane.appellants reply at see also,in re,d.these cases are irrelevant.the scope of the defendants duties is not at issue.the only question presented is whether the free public services doctrine bars the county recovery,and the county has not pointed to any aspect of the september decisions that bears on that issue.
second,we disagree with the county assertion that new york has implicitly abandoned the free public services doctrine by allowing individual officers to recover for personal injuries sustained in the line of duty contrary to the fireman rule,which previously barred that type of suit though the free public services doctrine and fireman rule are similar in some respects,the cases cited by the
