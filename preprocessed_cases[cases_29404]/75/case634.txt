environmental law 
the panel affirmed the district court summary judgment in favor of federal and local transit agencies and officials appellees on claims under the national environmental policy act brought by japanese village,llc and westin bonaventure hotel alleging that appellees environmental impact analysis for a new underground light rail line project in downtown los angeles was inadequate.
japanese village and bonaventure own real property near the rail line project.
as a preliminary matter,the panel declined to take judicial notice of three documents on the los angeles metropolitan transportation authority website because the documents were already in the appellate record.the panel also declined to consider japanese village argument,that the mitigation monitoring and reporting program was not properly attached to the federal record of decision,because japanese village failed to present the argument to the district court.
the panel rejected japanese village challenges to the adequacy of the mitigation plan included with the final environmental impact statement issued in january.specifically,the panel held that appellees analyzed and adopted additional mitigation measures for noises and vibration in japanese village after the release of the final environmental impact statement,and the failure to see the need for these mitigation measures at the time the impact statement was released in january did not violate nepa.the panel further held that regardless of whether temporary relocation was considered a mitigation measure or a source of harm,appellees did not violate nepa as long as they took a hard look at each alternative and discussed the extent to which adverse effects could be avoided.the panel also held that appellees did not violate nepa by not specifically requiring isolated slab track technology to mitigate operational noise and vibration from trains passing below japanese village.the panel also held that appellees plan to mitigate potential building subsidence due to tunneling under japanese village was not arbitrary and capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise in violation of law.finally,the panel concluded that appellees analysis of parking impacts was sufficient to pass muster under nepa.
addressing bonaventure hotel arguments,the panel held that appellees were not arbitrary or capricious in finding that tunnel boring machine construction was not a feasible alternative as a tunneling method for the lower flower portion of the project.the panel also rejected bonaventure challenges to the sufficiency of the project impact and mitigation analysis in the final environmental impact statement.finally,the panel held that no supplemental environmental impact statement was required,and rejected bonaventure claim that appellees were required to prepare a supplemental statement because los angeles metro applied for noise ordinance variances to accommodate nighttime construction on lower flower after the issuance of the final environmental impact statement.
whyte,district judge 
appellants japanese village,llc and today iv,dba westin bonaventure hotel bonaventure appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees on appellants claims under the national environmental policy act,nepa.appellants argue that appellees environmental impact analysis for a new underground light rail line project in downtown los angeles was inadequate.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
metro plans to construct the regional connector transit corridor project the project,a light rail extension line in downtown los angeles,with federal funding from the federal transit administration.the project is intended to meet increased demand for public transit and improve transit service in the region by connecting the light rail gold line to the blue and expo lines.the route for the extension line begins at and flower streets and travels north on flower street to street.it then continues east on street to central avenue,where it turns north to intersect the gold line at and alameda streets as shown below

draft environmental impact statement 
in the instant case,the fta published a draft environmental impact statement for public comment in september.metro had initially identified two build alternatives for the project a light rail primarily operating above ground the emphasis alternative and a light rail that was primarily underground the underground emphasis alternative during the deis drafting process,appellees established a little tokyo working group,made up of leaders of the little tokyo community council and metro staff,to discuss the impact of the project on the community.the little tokyo community had concerns about the negative construction and operation impacts of both the emphasis alternative and the underground emphasis alternative.to address these concerns,the little tokyo working group collaborated on the development of the fully underground alternative,which metro staff recommended in the deis.after the period for public comment on the deis,metro board of directors voted to designate the fully underground alternative as the locally preferred alternative.
supplemental environmental assessment 
appellees continued to refine the locally preferred alternative and addressed the impact of the refinements in a supplemental environmental sections of the deis sea released in july.the refinements included reductions in the use of cut and cover construction for tunnel excavation,replaced by the use of tunnel boring machine or tbm excavation.
cut and cover construction entails excavating down from the ground surface using temporary excavation support to stabilize the ground before excavation begins.temporary concrete decking is placed over the cut to allow traffic to pass above during construction once the tunnel is complete,the excavated trench area is backfilled and the temporary decking is replaced by permanent surface.a machine is a horizontal drill that is used to excavate circular tunnel sections.compared to the cut and cover method,tunnel boring is far less disruptive to surface traffic and adjacent land uses.
the project refinements addressed in the sea extended the use of tbm south along flower street from street to street.the project route was also realigned to eliminate the use of cut and cover construction on street in little tokyo in favor of closed face tbm construction.the new route required metro to purchase an easement for tunneling below the japanese village shopping center and office complex.the period for public comment on the sea closed on september.
final environmental impact statement and record of decision 
on january,appellees issued a final environmental impact statement and included responses to the public comments on the sea.appellees then accepted additional public comment on the feis and conducted a series of meetings with community stakeholders between february and april.these efforts resulted in metro staff recommending that the use of tbm be extended even farther south along flower street from street to street,budget permitting.metro also conducted additional analysis of the extent to which mitigation measures could reduce noise and vibration in japanese village.in advance of the meeting to approve the project,metro staff recommended that the board adopt additional mitigation measures for japanese village.
on april,the metro board adopted the staff recommendations and voted to approve the project.the fta issued its record of decision approving federal funding for the project on june.the rod includes a mitigation monitoring and report plan mmrp as attachment 
district court decision,final supplemental environmental impact statement,and supplemental record of decision 
japanese village,bonaventure,and a third plaintiff filed complaints challenging appellees nepa compliance in january.the parties brought for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees on all claims except for one claim on which bonaventure prevailed.japanese village and bonaventure timely appealed several aspects of the district court summary judgment ruling in favor of appellees.
in december,during the pendency of these appeals,appellees published a final supplemental environmental impact statement fseis and supplemental record of decision.appellees prepared the fseis because the district court had entered an injunction in connection with the one claim on which bonaventure prevailed,requiring fta and metro to adequately analyze the tunneling alternatives on lower flower before beginning cut and cover construction in that area in addition to the analysis required by the district court,the fseis included discussion of tbm on lower flower and expressly adopted the additional mitigation measures for japanese village.

iii.japanese village claims 
japanese village argues that the fta failed to comply with nepa procedural requirements for creating a record of decision because the rod in this case incorporates mitigation measures by reference.more significantly,japanese village argues that the feis does not include adequate analysis and mitigation discussion of noise and vibration impacts,operational noise and vibration impacts subsidence risk and parking impacts.we address these arguments in turn.
judicial notice of material on metro website 
as a preliminary matter,japanese village requests that we take judicial notice of three documents on metro website a copy of the federal rod in this case attachment a mitigation monitoring and reporting program or mmrp and a web page containing links to these two documents.japanese village offers these documents to show that appellees official mmrp on the website matches one of the several versions of the mmrps in the appellate record.appellees argue that judicial notice is unnecessary because the fta region ix administrator submitted a declaration identifying the correct versions of the rod and its attachments in the existing record.the declarant confirmed that these documents are the same ones on metro website.
judicial notice might ordinarily be appropriate for the documents on metro website because the documents were made publicly available by government entities and neither party disputes the authenticity of the web site or the accuracy of the information displayed therein.national educ.ass n,cir.citing fed.evid.the parties at least agree that the website contains the official copies of the rod and its attachments.in this case,however,it appears that the court need not rely on the metro website because the documents for which japanese village seeks judicial notice are already in the appellate record.accordingly,we decline to take judicial notice of the three documents on metro website.
adequacy of the record of decision assembly 
an rod must s tate whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the alternative selected have been adopted,and if not,why they were not.a monitoring and enforcement program shall be adopted and summarized where applicable for any mitigation.c.japanese village argues that the rod in this case fails to summarize appellees monitoring and enforcement program as required,apparently because the rod references an attachment a mitigation monitoring and reporting program,but the mmrp is not directly attached to the rod.rather,there is a gap in the page numbering before the mmrp appears in the administrative record,and,as noted above,the mmrp is in a separate electronic file from the rod on metro website.
appellees argue that japanese village waived any argument that the fta improperly assembled the rod because japanese village failed to present this argument to the district court.absent exceptional circumstances,we generally will not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal,although we have discretion to do so.baccei united states,cir.the court may exercise this discretion to prevent a miscarriage of justice when a change in law raises a new issue while an appeal is pending and when the issue is purely one of law.id.japanese village acknowledges in reply that it did not raise the issue of an rod assembly defect with the district court.moreover,japanese village does not argue that any exceptional circumstances require us to consider its assembly defect arguments.accordingly,we decline to consider japanese village argument that the mmrp was not properly attached to the rod.
adequacy of environmental impact statement 
japanese village challenges the adequacy of the mitigation plan included with the feis that issued in january.an eis,which chronologically precedes an rod,must include a discussion of possible steps to mitigate environmental harm.the supreme court has described the mitigation requirement as follows 
o ne important ingredient of an eis is the discussion of steps that can be taken to mitigate adverse environmental consequences.the requirement that an eis contain a detailed discussion of possible mitigation measures flows both from the language of the act and,more expressly,from ceq implementing regulations.implicit in nepa demand that an agency prepare a detailed statement on any adverse environmental effects which can not be avoided should the proposal be implemented,c ii,is an understanding that the eis will discuss the extent to which adverse effects can be avoided.
robertson methow valley citizens council,citation omitted.as the supreme court and ninth circuit have acknowledged,nepa does not mandate particular results,but simply prescribes the necessary process.id.at explaining that i f the adverse environmental effects of the proposed action are adequately identified and evaluated,the agency is not constrained by nepa from deciding that other values outweigh the environmental costs conner burford,cir.clarifying that nepa does not require that mitigation measures completely compensate for the adverse environmental effects.
japanese village takes issue with four aspects of appellees mitigation plan,described below.
noise and vibration 
japanese village first argues that appellees have not adequately addressed noise and vibration from construction of tunnels under the japanese village property.as described above,the feis was issued in january.the feis noted that during operation of the machine,certain portions of japanese village could sometimes experience vibration gbv of vdb and noise gbn of approximately dba japanese village businesses fall into a category of land use for which the federal annoyance criteria for infrequent vibration and noise are vdb and dba,respectively.id.thus,the feis recognized that without some mitigation,construction could cause significant impact to japanese village.the feis described several mitigation measures,numbered with the prefix nv,that could reduce noise and vibration at various construction locations.the measures include proper maintenance and operation of equipment and use of a resilient mat for delivery trains,among others.the feis also provided that metro shall monitor gbn and gbv levels in the in the sic building adjacent to tbm activity during its operation in that area and that d uring the few days the tbm will be operating in this area,should gbn or gbv measurements exceed fta annoyance criteria for impacts during construction,metro shall offer to temporarily relocate affected residents.
during the comment period for the feis,japanese village told metro that the proposed noise and vibration mitigation measures described in the feis were inadequate.specifically,japanese village argued that particular mitigation measures adopted for other construction locations,including,and,should also apply to japanese village.
between the time the feis was issued and the time metro approved the project on april,metro conducted additional analysis,and its experts estimated the extent to which additional mitigation measures could reduce noise and vibration in japanese village.in advance of the meeting to approve the project,metro recommended that additional mitigation measures be adopted for japanese village,including maintaining machinery speed of delivery trains resilient mat conveyor resiliently supported fasteners and traffic management.ultimately,metro approved the project on april,and the fta issued its rod,including the mmrp described above,in june.
on appeal,japanese village argues that metro ignored the advice of its experts because metro did not actually vote to approve the additional mitigation measures.japanese village also argues that as a matter of law,relocation can not be used as a mitigation measure.
whether metro adopted mitigation measures 
relying primarily on a transcript of metro april,board meeting,japanese village argues that metro board voted to defer all mitigation measures rather than adopt the additional measures its expert had recommended.we find japanese village argument unpersuasive despite the lack of clarity in the april,transcript,which contains several references to unintelligible comments.nevertheless,the transcript indicates that the board voted to approve item a through d as amended.the board meeting minutes clarify that item d referred to utilizing additional noise and vibration mitigation measures,and,defined above at japanese village.moreover,attachment b to the rod,summary of comments and responses to comments on the final eis,explicitly states mitigation measures,nv,and specifically apply to the japanese village plaza.japanese village correctly points out that a may,summary of the results of the board april,action omits reference to the fact that measures and apply to japanese village.however,appellees explain that this was simply a drafting error.
if there were any doubt that metro formally adopted the proposed mitigation measures,those doubts were resolved on december,when the fta and metro issued a final supplemental environmental impact statement.while the primary goal of the fseis was to further analyze use of a machine along lower flower street as ordered by the district court,the fseis also corrects the earlier drafting error and explicitly specifies that mitigation measures,and apply to japanese village.japanese village argument that metro has not adopted the corrected mitigation plan from is unpersuasive because,as explained above,the most reasonable reading of the record indicates that metro adopted the relevant mitigation measures even in.
we also find unpersuasive japanese village argument that appellees failed adequately to analyze the effectiveness of proposed mitigation alternatives.the march,expert study that japanese village asserts was overlooked by appellees estimates the reduction in noise and vibration that proposed mitigation measures would provide.
in sum,we find that appellees analyzed and adopted additional mitigation measures for noise and vibration in japanese village after the release of the feis,and appellees documented these measures in the june rod.we conclude that the failure to see the need for these mitigation measures at the time the feis was released in january,as evidenced by the fact that these measures were analyzed and adopted later,did not violate nepa.
whether relocation is a permissible mitigation measure 
notwithstanding the fact that metro adopted measures to mitigate noise and vibration,the parties appear to agree that noise and vibration may at least temporarily exceed federal standards in parts of japanese village.thus,it is quite possible that appellees planned mitigation step of assisting residents and businesses with temporary relocation will be necessary.japanese village argues that relocation does not constitute mitigation as a matter of law.
japanese village and appellees both rely on the text of the relevant nepa regulation,which states 
mitigation includes 
a avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action.
b minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation.
c rectifying the impact by repairing,rehabilitating,or restoring the affected environment.
d reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action.
e compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments.
japanese village argues that this list is exclusive and that since relocation does not appear in,it is not a valid mitigation measure.appellees argue that relocation could fall under subdivision e of the regulation because relocation provid es substitute environments for displaced residents.moreover,appellees argue,the regulation merely defines what mitigation includes.appellees argue that the regulation permits mitigation measures that are not specifically enumerated in the text.
the cases cited by japanese village do not directly address whether relocation is a valid mitigation measure under or nepa generally.for example,in re katrina canal breaches consolidated litigation,wl,at,merely noted in dicta that one of the goals of a project was to avoid and minimize relocations and other impacts to local residents and businesses to the maximum extent practicable.as japanese village notes,friends of airport faa,cir.dealt with the relocation of airplanes,not people.limerick ecology action,nuclear regulatory commission,cir,also cited by japanese village,simply noted that agencies should consider socioeconomic impacts of federal projects,including the impact of relocation.finally,the district court in monarch chemical works,exon,supp,ruled that a project required an eis in part because of the environmental consequences of the relocation of an entire community.none of these cases addresses the definition of mitigation.
japanese village also argues that in cases in which relocation is necessary,the government must comply with the uniform relocation assistance and real property acquisition policies act of the relocation act,et.japanese village correctly points out that courts have enjoined federal projects that fail to comply with the relocation act.in a notice of errata filed after japanese village filed its reply brief,however,japanese village acknowledges that the eis in the instant case actually does consider the relocation act.for example,a page of the mitigation monitoring and reporting program indicates that metro shall provide relocation assistance and compensation as required by the uniform relocation assistance and real property acquisition policies act of.japanese village does not claim that appellees have violated the relocation act,so any argument that the project could be enjoined on that basis does not apply.
ultimately,we need not decide whether relocation can ever be a valid mitigation measure under nepa because nepa does not require that mitigation measures completely compensate for the adverse environmental effects.conner,at.the supreme court example in robertson is instructive 
i t would not have violated nepa if the forest service,after complying with the act procedural prerequisites,had decided that the benefits to be derived from downhill skiing at sandy butte justified the issuance of a special use permit,notwithstanding the loss of percent,percent,or even percent of the mule deer herd.
robertson,at.in the instant case,regardless of whether relocation is considered a mitigation measure or a source of harm,appellees would not have violated nepa as long as they took a hard look at each alternative and discussed the extent to which adverse effects can be avoided.not only did appellees examine various noise and vibration mitigation measures,appellees also went beyond nepa procedural requirements and committed to implementing the mitigation measures that japanese village requested.
operational noise and vibration 
japanese village next argues that appellees violated nepa by not specifically requiring isolated slab track technology ist to mitigate operational noise and vibration from trains passing below japanese village.for category land uses such as the offices at japanese village plaza,federal vibration and noise guidelines for frequent events such as a single train passing beneath are vdb and dba respectively the vibration and noise guidelines for occasional events such as two trains passing at once are vdb and dba.id.in a march report,appellees engineers found that without mitigation,operational noise but not vibration could exceed these levels.
to address operational noise and vibration,in the january feis,appellees mitigation plan included the following measures 
in the vicinity of the hikari lofts and nakamura tetsujiro building,metro shall conduct engineering studies during final design to verify initial estimates of gbn and shall implement high compliance resilient fasteners,floating slab trackbed,or other appropriate measures as needed to eliminate impacts and to reduce gbn below fta annoyance criteria.
in the vicinity of the offices at jvp and the broad art foundation museum,currently under construction,metro shall conduct engineering studies during final design to verify initial estimates of gbn and shall implement high compliance resilient fasteners or other appropriate measures as needed to eliminate impacts and reduce gbn below fta annoyance criteria.
at the time of the feis,appellees did not expect that ist would be necessary.
as with the noise and vibration analysis,however,an engineering report issued after the feis suggested that without ist,the noise levels at japanese village plaza would exceed federal limits.japanese village argues that it was an abuse of discretion for the fta to ignore the most recent and reasoned reports from its experts and allow the use of mitigation means other than ist without an appropriate explanation.
japanese village argument is unpersuasive for two reasons.first,an agency need not supplement an eis every time new information comes to light after the eis is finalized.marsh,at.in this case,the january feis accounted for the possibility that other appropriate measures could be taken as needed to eliminate impacts and reduce gbn below fta annoyance criteria.second,as with the mitigation measures japanese village requested to reduce noise and vibration,appellees specifically adopted ist for japanese village when the metro board approved the project on april.the meeting minutes reflect in the vicinity of the japanese village plaza metro shall use resiliently supported fasteners,isolated slab track technology,or other appropriate measures as needed to eliminate impacts and to reduce gbn below fta annoyance criteria.attachment b to the rod states mitigation measures,nv,and specifically apply to the japanese village plaza.moreover,the december,final supplemental environmental impact statement explicitly states that mitigation measure,which includes ist,applies to japanese village.accordingly,to the extent that japanese village complains about a lack of implementation of ist as opposed to a lack of discussion in the feis,japanese village argument is now moot.
subsidence 
japanese village argues that appellees plan to mitigate potential building subsidence due to tunneling under japanese village is not sufficiently detailed.specifically,japanese village argues that the feis should have explicitly required that a inch settlement in any building would trigger the use of compensation grouting.
an eis must discuss mitigation measures,with sufficient detail to ensure that environmental consequences have been fairly evaluated.fork band council of shoshone of dep t of the interior,cir.per curiam citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.in south fork band,we found an eis inadequate where it stated that f easibility and success of mitigation would depend on conditions and details of the mitigation plan,but the eis omitted any discussion of whether the anticipated harms could be avoided by any of the listed mitigation measures.id.japanese village argues that appellees mmrp improperly defers analysis in favor of future studies and investigation.
in the instant case,the mmrp includes three pages of measures designed to combat building subsidence.one of the measures included in the mmrp states,in relevant part 
while engineering designs are being finalized,but before any construction,a survey of structures within the anticipated zone of construction influence shall be conducted in order to establish baseline conditions.if assessments indicate the necessity to proactively protect nearby structures,additional support for the structures by underpinning or other ground improvement techniques shall be required prior to the underground construction.metro shall require the construction contractor to limit movement to less than acceptable threshold values for vertical,horizontal,and angular deformation as a performance standard.these acceptable threshold values shall be established such that the risk of damage to buildings and utilities will be negligible to very slight.for buildings,these threshold values will be based on the relationship of building damage to angular distortion and horizontal strain consistent with boscardin and cording and qualitative factors including but not limited to the type of structure and its existing condition.additional data and survey information shall be gathered during final design for each building and utility main to enable assessment of the tolerance of potentially affected structures and utilities.
another mitigation measure in the mmrp states 
ground improvement such as grouting or other methods shall be required to fill voids where appropriate and offset potential settlement when excess material has been removed during excavation.the criteria for implementing grouting or ground improvement measures shall be based on the analysis described in mitigation measure 
these mitigation measures are not specific to japanese village,and japanese village argues that the lack of specificity does not allow for adequate evaluation of the measures impact.
while,at first glance,these mitigation measures seem to lack detail,the manner in which appellees worked to develop the measures shows that appellees sufficiently considered the effectiveness of each proposal.after the feis was issued but before the rod was signed,metro asked an expert to assess the potential effects of underground construction on existing japanese village buildings.the expert concluded that without mitigation,three buildings in japanese village were anticipated to have moderate to very severe damage due to subsidence.the expert recommended that as soon as buildings show a settlement value approaching inches,compensation grouting would be activated under the building in order to counteract tunneling settlement developing under it.the expert opined 
with the successful implementation of compensation grouting,the settlement under these buildings could be controlled to acceptable levels.at the present level of analysis,which is empirical settlement will have to be limited to inches for negligible damage,or in.for slight damage,which by definition in practice nonstructural and cosmetically repairable.
this expert study,issued on april,was part of the administrative record when appellees issued their rod in on june.unlike the eis rejected in south fork band,appellees proposed mitigation measures,when viewed in light of the analysis provided by appellees expert,are sufficient to allow for an evaluation of effectiveness.thus,we agree with the district court that appellees analysis satisfies the purpose of nepa,to ensure that agencies carefully consider information about significant environmental impacts.plains res.council,surface transp,cir.
our conclusion is also consistent with that of a recent case cited in japanese village notice of supplemental authority.in protect our communities foundation jewell,cir,we approved an eis that included,among other things,an adaptive management plan that provide d flexibility in responding to environmental impacts through a regime of continued monitoring and inspection.while a mere promise to develop mitigation measures in the future might not pass muster,the use of such a continuous monitoring system may complement other mitigation measures,and help to refine and improve the implementation of those measures as the project progresses.id.
for the reasons set forth above,we conclude that appellees plan to mitigate subsidence was not arbitrary and capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise in violation of the law.
finally,japanese village argues that appellees failed to adequately consider the increased demand that the new little tokyo transit station will place on japanese village existing parking structure.because the new transit station will not provide additional parking and will be located only feet from japanese village parking structure,japanese village worries that the parking used by its employees and customers will be overrun by rail commuters.while japanese village acknowledges that appellees conducted parking studies,it argues that appellees analysis of the impact on japanese village parking structure as opposed to other and parking was insufficient.
appellees rely on several portions of the record to support their argument that appellees parking analysis was adequate.for example,appellees point out that they created a transportation analysis study,which included extensive discussion about the impact on parking.appellees also cite the station planning toolkit,attached as appendix j to the feis,which notes that additional parking spaces are expected in little tokyo as part of a new development.the portion of appellees analysis that seems most directly responsive to japanese village concern about parking is in a paragraph in chapter of the feis 
typically,parking lots are considered transitional land uses that could be developed by the owners for higher and better uses.several other parking lots and structures are located in the vicinity.loss of the current parking lot may cause an inconvenience for users but it would not represent a significant impact.parking demand in the area would be partially offset by the increased public transit access provided by the proposed project.however,little tokyo residents and business owners have indicated that parking spaces are important community resources and that the loss of this parking could negatively impact the adjacent small businesses and the janm located across the street.the community is concerned that this could,in turn,affect the economic stability and ultimately the character of the community.therefore,prior to construction of the alternative,metro would conduct an annual parking capacity study of the little tokyo area during construction to determine if there is sufficient parking availability without these parcels.metro would also make a portion of the mangrove property available for valet parking to offset the parking loss.this change would not be a significant impact with respect to displacements.
another portion of the feis notes the p ermanent displacement of approximately parking spaces due to the project,approximately of which are in little tokyo.among other things,appellees argue that because surface parking is a transitional land use,parking availability may decline even in the absence of the project.
there are no nepa thresholds for determining the significance of parking impacts,and japanese village has not cited any cases in which a court has found an eis inadequate for failure to consider increased demand on an existing parking structure.the two district court cases on which japanese village relies arguably support appellees position that their analysis was adequate.japanese village criticizes appellees for philosophiz ing that improved transit service may reduce the need for parking.however,in california coastal commission department of the navy,supp,cal,which japanese village cites,the court noted that increased public transportation in the downtown areas may reduce demand for parking.moreover,the court found the navy parking analysis sufficient even though the navy found that the parking impact of the project at issue may be unmitigable.id.in crenshaw subway coalition los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority,no.cv fmo jcx,wl,at cal,the court affirmed an agency determination,based on a parking survey,that a light rail project will not result in a significant impact because the combination of both on and parking provides enough total parking spaces to meet the demand in the area.here,as noted above,metro plans to conduct an annual parking capacity study of the little tokyo area during construction to determine if there is sufficient parking availability.
the only appellate case that we have found analyzing a parking problem even somewhat similar to the one at issue here,chelsea neighborhood associations postal service,cir,held that an eis was inadequate in part because it failed to discuss where residents and employees of a planned development would park.as explained above,however,appellees in the instant case provided at least some analysis of the project parking impacts and likely mitigating factors.
we conclude that appellees analysis of parking impacts is sufficient to pass muster under nepa.nepa imposes no substantive requirement that mitigation measures actually be taken robertson,at.appellees estimated the number of parking spaces that could be lost in little tokyo due to the project,but they also estimated the number of spaces that they expect the area to gain from other development.appellees discussed how increased use of public transit would at least partially offset the need for additional parking.appellees also discussed possible mitigation measures the record indicates that appellees took the requisite hard look at the parking impacts of the proposed project before it was approved.
iv.bonaventure claims 
bonaventure argues that appellees failed to analyze tbm construction as a reasonable alternative tunneling method for the lower flower portion of the project in the feis failed to adequately analyze certain impacts and impermissibly deferred certain mitigation analyses in the feis and failed to prepare a supplemental eis to analyze nighttime construction.we address these arguments in turn.
analysis of tbm on lower flower 
the existence of a viable but unexamined alternative renders an environmental impact statement inadequate.friends of yosemite valley kempthorne,cir.quoting alaska wilderness recreation tourism ass morrison,cir.an agency must look at every reasonable alternative,but an agency need not discuss alternatives similar to alternatives actually considered,or alternatives which are infeasible,ineffective,or inconsistent with the basic policy objectives for the management of the area,alaska envtl.ctr.kempthorne,cir.quoting headwaters,bureau of land,cir.for alternatives that are eliminated from detailed study,agencies must briefly discuss the reasons for their having been eliminated.a 
feasibility determination in the feis 
appellees addressed tbm in the feis,adopting the construction technique for some parts of the project but rejecting it as infeasible south of street because of three impediments the pocket track requirement,the requirement to preserve the option of building a and flower street station in the future,and the presence of tiebacks.t echnical determinations of the agency,reflecting the application of its specialized expertise,merit particular deference see protect our,at finding that agency reasonably excluded alternative after determining it would present significant feasibility issues see also westlands water dist.dep t of interior,cir.finding that agency has discretion to reject alternatives deemed ineffective for accomplishing project goals.
despite the assessment in the feis,bonaventure argues that tbm was a viable alternative on lower flower because the three impediments identified by appellees had been eliminated before issuance of the feis.the record,however,does not show that the requirement to preserve the option of building another station in the future had been eliminated or that the issue of tiebacks had been resolved by the time appellees issued the feis.therefore,we find no basis for concluding that appellees were arbitrary or capricious in finding that tbm was not feasible on lower flower.
pocket track requirement 
a pocket track is a third track with connecting switches for train storage and passing located between two main tracks and is used to enable quick recovery of the transit system when a train has to be taken out of service.crossover tracks allow trains traveling in either direction on either track to move to the other track and continue traveling in the same direction without stopping and can be used to allow trains to bypass a stalled train or turn back in the opposite direction.neither a pocket track nor a crossover track can be constructed using tbm.
bonaventure argues that tbm became feasible for lower flower once the pocket track requirement south of street was eliminated from the project in.appellees contend that although the pocket track requirement was eliminated,it was replaced with a crossover track requirement,which would similarly preclude use of tbm.
although the record before us is somewhat ambiguous,it seems that neither a pocket track nor a crossover track was a project requirement for lower flower by the time appellees issued the feis.the deis and sea contemplate a pocket track in the area of lower flower.but metro april draft tunnel study states that the pocket track requirement was eliminated in december because c rossovers in the underground alignment would mitigate service delays and a pocket or storage tracks could be used in adjacent project locations the feis itself states that a pocket track,which could also serve as a crossover,would be located beneath flower street between and streets,but also suggests that crossovers and pocket tracks may not be needed at all of the listed locations and that the flower street pocket track is being considered for relocation as a refinement to the locally preferred alternative.
assuming that the pocket crossover track requirement had been eliminated or relocated,appellees may well have violated nepa if they had relied solely on pocket track incompatibility to find tbm infeasible on lower flower.an agency must look at every reasonable alternative,with the range dictated by the nature and scope of the proposed action.alaska wilderness recreation,at emphasis added quoting idaho conservation league mumma,cir.we need not decide that question,however,because appellees rejected the tbm as infeasible on lower flower for two other reasons namely,the existence of tiebacks in the area and the project requirement to preserve the option of a future street station.
street station 
bonaventure argues that tbm became feasible in october when the street station was dropped from the project plan.this argument ignores that the project still required preservation of the option to build a future street station.the future station option rather than the station itself is metro stated reason for rejecting the tbm alternative in the feis using tunnel boring machine construction would also create some challenges on the ability of not precluding a and flower station as the alignment would be changed from a box structure to separate bored tunnels.
bonaventure suggests that the project requirement for a future station option was not adopted until april,and was therefore not a legitimate reason to reject tbm as infeasible in january.the april,metro board meeting minutes cited by bonaventure list preserv ing the opportunity to install a future station north of and flower streets as an approved amendment to the locally preferred alternative,but the minutes do not actually show when the amendment was approved.the january feis itself states that the design of the locally preferred alternative would not preclude a station at and flower streets from being built as a possible future,separate project.therefore,the record does not establish that the requirement to preserve a future station option had been eliminated from the project before the feis was issued.
tiebacks are temporary stabilization systems made out of steel that were typically left in place after basement construction in the area.in the deis,appellees note that such obstructions would potentially be problematic for tbm excavation on flower street due to the shallow depths of the tunnels,which is partly why cut and cover construction is planned for this area.in the feis,appellees stated that use of tbm south of street would not be practicable due to the need to remove ahead of the tunnel boring machine.
bonaventure only evidence that appellees did not consider tiebacks to be an issue is metro april,draft tunnel study,which the feis and examines a option that metro developed in response to public comment on the feis.the profile of the alternative examined in the draft tunnel study is such that it is assumed to be below all of the existing tiebacks based on available information,but metro notes that the low alignment option would generate additional impacts and require other project changes.
there is no evidence to show that appellees believed that the tiebacks impediment on lower flower could be overcome by changing the alignment of the tunnel along lower flower.in fact,when metro studied the issue in,it concluded that it was not possible to miss the tiebacks with a profile change because the lower flower tunnel segment was not long enough to permit a tunnel profile with the tunnel grades required to get down under the tiebacks.we affirm the district court finding that bonaventure has made no showing of that appellees were arbitrary and capricious in rejecting the use of tbm on lower flower in the feis.
effect of feasibility admission 
after the feis was published,metro accepted public comment and continued to examine options for extending the use of tbm on flower south of street.during a series of community stakeholder meetings in march,metro discussed the possibility of extending the use of tbm by deepening the vertical alignment to avoid the street piling system foundation resulting in lowering the street station,and continu ing the tbm configuration from street to just south of street,assuming no or minimum encountered.in a draft tunnel study dated april,metro stated that it had determined that it was potentially possible to extend the tbm tunneling to street,subject to economic feasibility,and had presented the option to metro board in march.on april,metro board adopted its staff recommendation to extend the use of tbm to street,if it could be done within the project budget.
we agree with the district court that appellees admission of feasibility does not establish that the feis was procedurally deficient t he role of a court in reviewing the sufficiency of an agency consideration of environmental factors is limited by the time at which the decision was made.vermont yankee nuclear power nat.res.def.council.bonaventure argues that vermont yankee is distinguishable because it involved a party seeking to reopen agency proceedings that had been closed for over a year,while in this case,appellees admitted the feasibility of the alternative before the fta issued its record of decision we are cognizant,however,that a dministrative consideration of evidence always creates a gap between the time the record is closed and the time the administrative decision is promulgated,and if litigants could demand further analysis each time some new circumstance has arisen,some new trend has been observed,or some new fact discovered,there would be little hope that the administrative process could ever be consummated in an order that would not be subject to reopening.id.at quoting interstate commerce comm jersey city,see also envtl.def.fund,hoffman,cir.n ot every addition to the eis made in response to comments is such as to require a formal supplement to the eis which must be processed in the same fashion as a new eis for to do so would make the nepa review process be one without end.
the touchstone for courts reviewing challenges to an eis under nepa is whether an eis selection and discussion of alternatives fosters informed and informed public participation.westlands,at quoting california block,cir.in this case,the process seems to have worked.appellees were not required to accept public comments after publishing the feis.see b agency may request comments on a final environmental impact statement emphasis added.yet appellees engaged in continued dialogue with stakeholders and refined the project in response to community concerns.a finding that appellees were arbitrary and capricious in determining that tbm was infeasible based solely on appellees subsequent admission that they were wrong is unlikely to foster informed and public participation rather it is likely to discourage agencies from responding to public comments in the future.see,block,at noting that i f an agency must file a supplemental draft eis every time any modifications occur,agencies as a practical matter may become hostile to modifying the alternatives to be responsive to earlier public comment.
to the extent bonaventure argues that appellees eventual admission of feasibility establishes that appellees should have known tbm was technically feasible on lower flower all along,the argument is a substantive one and therefore beyond the scope of our review.city of dep t of,cir.as noted by the district court,bonaventure may have preferred that appellees reach a different conclusion in the feis,but that preference does not establish that appellees were arbitrary or capricious in determining that the alternative was not feasible.
adequacy of analysis of project impacts and mitigation 
bonaventure also challenges the sufficiency of the impact analysis in the feis.nepa does not mandate particular results,but simply describes the necessary process that an agency must follow in issuing an eis.westlands,at quoting robertson,at.a court must avoid passing judgment on the substance of an agency decision.its focus must be on ensuring that agencies took a hard look at the environmental consequences of their decisions.id.quoting robertson,at.mitigation of environmental impacts must be discussed in sufficient detail to ensure that environmental consequences have been fairly evaluated,at quoting robertson,at.an eis,however,need not contain a complete mitigation plan that is actually formulated and adopted.id.quoting robertson,at.
grade separation impact analysis 
bonaventure is concerned about the impact of grade separation between the concrete decking which will cover the trench created by cut and cover construction and existing sidewalk and driveway elevations.bonaventure argues that appellees acknowledged the possibility of grade separation in the feis,but then failed to quantify the possible extent or analyze the impacts it may have on freeway and garage access.the district court found that the feis satisfied nepa hard look requirement.we affirm.
the feis states that decking may be either flush with the existing street surface,or raised above the street surface with americans with disabilities act ada compliant ramps to allow continued vehicle and pedestrian access.the feis also responds to public comments about the impacts of grade separation 
any decking configurations would require construction of ramps and accesses as well as modifications to vehicular access points to the garages and driveway along flower street 
any decking configurations would be designed to safely accommodate the undercarriage and overhead clearances of vehicles using the driveways,garages,and loading docks 
access to and from the bus stop,shuttle area,and pedestrian crossing would be accommodated in any decking configuration.
nepa regulations require only brief discussion of other than significant issues.b impacts shall be discussed in proportion to their significance.as in a finding of no significant impact,there should be only enough discussion to show why more study is not warranted.id.because appellees explained that any decking configuration would be designed to avoid significant impacts,we are satisfied that no further discussion is warranted.see protect our,at finding nepa hard look requirement satisfied where agency provided less analysis of noise effects in the eis as compared to other more significant or unmitigable environmental impacts because agency concluded that noise effects could be effectively reduced.
bonaventure claims that grade separation may result in severe traffic congestion.although the feis includes extensive traffic impact analysis,the analysis does not touch on grade separation.we find this to be consistent with appellees treatment of grade separation as not likely to cause significant impacts the traffic impact analysis need only contain a reasonably thorough discussion of the significant aspects of the probable environmental consequences,at emphasis added.bonaventure cites no evidence that grade separation will result in significant traffic impacts we have no reason to conclude,therefore,that appellees were required to take a harder look at the issue.
bonaventure also objects that appellees violated nepa by improperly deferring the choice of decking configurations and indicating that environmental factors would not be considered in making the choice decking configurations will be determined during the final design phase of the project,based on cost,schedule,and construction activity phasing considerations.having determined that there would not be significant environmental impacts from grade separation,appellees did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in deferring the configuration decision or selecting the listed decision criteria in the feis.moreover,we note that by the time the project was approved,it included a design refinement stating that south of street,construction decking shall be no higher than inches,if feasible,above the existing grade,and flush with existing curb on the east and west side of flower street with a maximum cross gradient of.
emergency vehicle access impact analysis 
bonaventure is also concerned about the impact of construction on emergency vehicle access to adjacent properties,including the westin bonaventure hotel.bonaventure argues that the analysis of such impacts in the feis is conclusory and does not explain how the impacts would be mitigated.at fir
