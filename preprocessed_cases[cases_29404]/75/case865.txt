this appeal arises from a dispute between a rail carrier and a warehouseman regarding liability for demurrage,penalties assessed for the undue detention of rail cars.norfolk southern railway company sued brampton enterprises,llc savannah for demurrage accrued over the six month period from march to august.savannah denied liability for the demurrage charges and,despite being named as consignee on the bills of lading,maintained it was not a party to the shipping contracts.norfolk southern asserts that as the named consignee savannah became a party to the contracts by accepting the shipments.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of savannah holding that a freight can not,without notice,be made a consignee by the unilateral action of a third party.we affirm.
brampton enterprises operates a warehouse business under the trade name savannah savannah.as a warehouseman,savannah receives freight at its facility,unloads it from the containers in which it arrives,reloads it into appropriate containers for export,and forwards it to various ports according to instructions received from the freight forwarder.savannah has no ownership interest in the freight it handles and is not a party to the transportation contracts.the freight forwarding companies make transportation arrangements without input from or notice to savannah.
in late galaxy forwarding galaxy began sending freight to savannah facility via railcar delivered by norfolk southern railway company norfolk.according to savannah owner william billy groves,galaxy was aware of savannah operational capacity and controlled the amount of freight it received.galaxy merely informed savannah when shipments were en route and provided it with instructions regarding the export of the shipment.galaxy was the only freight forwarder to send savannah freight via rail and arranged transportation for all the freight shipments at issue.these freight shipments originated from various domestic shippers and were being exported to overseas recipients by galaxy.savannah had no knowledge of the origins or final destinations of the freight it handled.
norfolk transported the rail freight to savannah pursuant to bills of received from galaxy.before rail cars were delivered,norfolk would notify savannah that rail cars from certain shippers had arrived and were ready for delivery.once savannah approved the delivery,norfolk would perform a switch by removing any empty rail cars and replacing them with new rail cars to unload.norfolk would perform only one switch per day delivering as many as five cars at a time.
beginning in march,galaxy began sending rail freight to savannah at such a volume that demurrage began to accrue.pursuant to norfolk tariff,a customer is allowed two days to unload freight without incurring demurrage.at the end of each month,a customer total demurrage days are netted against total credits.credits are calculated by multiplying the number of rail cars delivered during a particular month by two,which accounts for the two free days all customers are given to unload delivered rail cars.if total demurrage exceeds total credits,those days are charged at the daily rate published in norfolk tariff.
the right to assess detention or demurrage charges against parties to a transportation contract for delay in releasing transportation equipment is well established at common law.motor carriers term such a delay as detention while rail carriers refer to it as demurrage.prior to rail transport,demurrage was recognized in maritime law as the amount to be paid for delay in loading,unloading,or sailing beyond the time specified.unlike maritime law,a railroad carrier can collect demurrage even if the shipping contract contains no provision to that effect.in the railroad setting,demurrage charges serve a twofold purpose one is to secure compensation for the use of the car and of the track which it occupies.the other is to promote car efficiency by providing a deterrent against undue detention.turner,dennis lowry lumber chicago,milwaukee paul ry.as such,demurrage charges are properly assessed even if the cause for the delay is beyond the party control,unless the carrier itself is responsible for the delay.
while demurrage remains a matter of contract,railroads are now required by federal statute to assess demurrage charges subject to oversight by the surface transportation board.norfolk seeks demurrage charges against savannah pursuant to the interstate commerce commission termination act iccta,requiring rail carriers to compute demurrage charges,and establish rules related to those charges.norfolk publishes the applicable demurrage rules and charges in freight tariff ns,which states in relevant part that d emurrage charges will be assessed against the at origin or at destination who will be responsible for payment.tariff ns,item footnotes added.thus,norfolk is required by the iccta and the terms of its own tariff to assess demurrage charges against the shipment consignee for any delay in unloading the rail cars at their destination.
savannah was a named consignee on the bills of lading for the freight shipments at issue.however,many of these bills of lading also named an ultimate consignee and printed copies of the electronic bill of lading data submitted by norfolk did not actually contain the word consignee.savannah maintains that it did not consent to being named on the bills of lading and was never informed that any bill of lading identified it as a consignee.the record indicates that neither galaxy,norfolk,nor any other entity provided savannah with the bills of lading for the freight it handled.thus,savannah was a named consignee on the bills of lading without notice of,or consent to,such designation.
in addition to the freight at issue in this appeal,norfolk routinely delivered freight to savannah facility pursuant to bills of lading where savannah was not the named consignee.the instant dispute arose when norfolk began invoicing savannah for demurrage on all shipments delivered to savannah facility irrespective of whether savannah was the named consignee.savannah refused to pay and in late norfolk sued for demurrage on all shipments,without regard for who was named as consignee.after savannah moved for summary judgment,norfolk amended its complaint,to exclude demurrage for freight shipments where savannah was not named as consignee.this amendment had the effect of reducing norfolk demand from to.
in early savannah moved for summary judgment on all claims arguing that it was not liable for demurrage because norfolk could only recover demurrage against a consignee or a party to the transportation contract.savannah stated that the issue before the court is whether another unilateral act of identifying savannah as the consignee without its knowledge or permission is sufficient to make it a consignee and therefore liable for demurrage.norfolk moved for partial summary judgment as to the issue of savannah liability for demurrage.norfolk argued that savannah was liable for demurrage because savannah was identified as consignee on the bills of lading at issue,savannah accepted delivery of the rail cars and the freight,and savannah did not notify norfolk of its agent status.
the district court granted savannah motion for summary judgment and denied norfolk motion for partial summary judgment,holding that savannah was not liable for demurrage.the court stated that a bill of lading is essentially a contract and savannah could not be made a party to that contract without its knowledge or consent.in sum,the court held that savannah can not be made a consignee by the unilateral action of a third party,particularly where savannah was not given notice of the unilateral designation in the bills of lading.norfolk appeals the district court denial of its motion for partial summary judgment and grant of summary judgment to savannah.

demurrage liability 
we begin our analysis by examining the basis for the district court decision,and in doing so,review several fundamental principles of law that define demurrage liability.first,demurrage is considered part of the transportation charge and under the tariff system is imposed as a matter of law.however,b efore such assessments such as detention charges can be imposed on a party there must be some legal foundation for such liability outside the mere fact of handling the goods shipped.middle atl.conference united states,panel in evans prods.interstate commerce comm n,the seventh circuit held that l iability for freight charges may be imposed only against a consignor,consignee,or owner of the property,or others by statute,contract,or prevailing custom,cir citations omitted see also pac.transp.matson navigation,the obligation to pay demurrage arises either out of contract,statute or prevailing custom middle.at liability for demurrage must be founded either on contract,statute or prevailing custom.norfolk has not offered any evidence of prevailing industry custom or applicable statute that would hold to a shipping contract liable for demurrage.furthermore,it is undisputed that savannah is neither consignor nor owner of the freight.thus,savannah is liable for demurrage only if it were the consignee or contractually assumed responsibility for the charges.
a freight handler such as savannah is free to contractually assume liability for demurrage charges and this is sometimes done through average demurrage agreements to promote their own business and in some instances to obtain the benefits of lower detention costs for the benefit of their customers.middle.at.however,in the instant case,there is no evidence to suggest that savannah independently contracted with either norfolk or galaxy regarding demurrage charges.this leaves us only with the question of savannah consignee status to determine demurrage liability.
as mentioned previously,the bill of lading is the basic transportation contract between the and the carrier.thus,as an original party to the shipping contract,a consignor is clearly liable for demurrage.however,a consignee liability is,and arises by operation of law when the consignee accepts delivery of the goods consol.rail.liquor control.see also pittsburgh fink.the weight of authority seems to be that the consignee is prima facie liable for the payment of the freight charges when he accepts the goods from the carrier.by accepting delivery of a shipment,the consignee conduct assumes a significance by virtue of the transportation contract,which identifies the parties and assigns responsibility for particular charges.the contract implied from the acceptance of a shipment extends no further than the conditions upon which its delivery is made dependant.unless the bill of lading provides to the contrary,the consignor remains primarily liable for the freight charges and pursuant to the carrier tariff,the consignee becomes liable for demurrage charges at the freight destination.thus,only an original party to the rail transportation contract,or a consignee by virtue of acceptance of the goods,may be liable for demurrage.as a district court in our circuit put it,all the reported opinions agree that only a party to the rail transportation contract may be liable for demurrage.csx,city of pensacola,see also union pac.ametek,cir holding demurrage could not be assessed against a warehouse that was not a consignee or other party to the transportation contract matson.at the obligation to pay demurrage arises out of the contractual relationship and may only be imputed to parties to the contract middle.finding a carrier proposed tariff unlawful to the extent that it attempted to impose liability for demurrage charges on to the transportation contract missouri,ry.of texas capital compress,holding a cotton compress company not liable to carrier for demurrage because t he findings of fact fail to show any contractual relation between them in reference to the shipment of the cotton.
there are exceptions to a consignee demurrage liability.a consignee may avoid demurrage liability by notifying the carrier of its agency status prior to accepting delivery of the shipment.the law is well settled that an agent for a disclosed principal is not liable to a third person for acts within the scope of agency.middle.at see also whitney wyman.where the principal is disclosed,and the agent is known to be acting as such,the latter can not be made personally liable unless he agreed to be so.the iccta recognizes the common law rule of agency and provides in relevant part 
when the shipper or consignor instructs the rail carrier transporting the property to deliver it to a consignee that is an agent only,not having beneficial title to the property,the consignee is liable for rates billed at the time of delivery for which the consignee is otherwise liable,but not for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if the consignee gives written notice to the delivering carrier before delivery of the property 
a of the agency and absence of beneficial title and 
b of the name and address of the beneficial owner of the property if it is reconsigned or diverted to a place other than the place specified in the original bill of lading.
a.thus,an can avoid demurrage liability by notifying the carrier of its agency status and providing the carrier with the name and address of the shipment beneficial owner prior to accepting delivery.
thus far our analysis has surveyed the undisputed aspects of demurrage liability.the parties agree that an entity must be a party to the transportation contract to be liable for demurrage charges,that a consignee becomes a party to the transportation contract upon accepting the freight consigned to it,and that a consignee may avoid demurrage liability by disclosing its agency status prior to accepting delivery of the shipment.we now turn to the key question of whether savannah was a consignee in the context of this case.
b.a consignee by any other name 
the issue before the court is whether savannah was a consignee of the freight delivered by norfolk.norfolk contends that savannah was a consignee because it was identified as such on the bills of lading and accepted delivery of the shipments.savannah argues that it can not be made a consignee merely because a third party unilaterally listed it as such without its knowledge or consent.both the seventh and third circuits have addressed this issue in cases involving similar fact patterns.see illinois cent.south tec dev.warehouse,cir csx transp.novolog bucks county,cir,cert.denied,d.the seventh and third circuits reached differing conclusions on this issue resulting in a conflict of authority among the two circuits.see south tec,at novolog,at.
in south tec,the seventh circuit reasoned that the preliminary issue was whether the defendant warehouseman was a consignee.although the case was remanded to the district court for determination of the warehouseman status,the seventh circuit stated that being listed by third parties as a consignee on some bills of lading is not alone enough to make a warehouseman a legal consignee liable for demurrage charges south tec,at.
like south tec,the defendant in novolog,who was named as consignee without its authorization,argued that the shipper or carrier un
