the federal aviation administration faa issued an aircraft mechanic certificate to barry cornish.see pt,subp.cornish submitted a urine specimen for the random drug testing required of employees of regulated air carriers.see a a pt,app.i,iii e,v.the testing laboratory found the specimen adulterated.the faa administrator treated the adulteration as equivalent to refusing to be tested and revoked cornish mechanic certificate.see b a b authorizing revocation for refusing to submit to a drug test.cornish appealed the revocation order to the national transportation safety board ntsb.during the administrative appeal proceedings,cornish learned that the adulteration finding was based upon department of transportation dot and department of health and human services hhs memoranda issued to laboratories and medical review officers the adulteration memoranda.
cornish then commenced this action in the district court against the faa administrator,the secretary of transportation,and the secretary of health and human services.cornish claims that the adulteration memoranda are invalid because they were adopted without formal rulemaking procedures,that the memoranda are arbitrary and capricious agency actions,and that revocation of his certificate based on invalid memoranda deprived him of his right to due process.the administrative appeal proceedings were stayed pending this lawsuit.
concluding that the dot memorandum was an agency order reviewable by a court of appeals under,the district court transferred the entire action to this court under cornish does not appeal the district court transfer order.instead,he recasts all his claims as a petition for review under.we dismiss the secretary of health and human services because gives us no jurisdiction to review actions of that agency we dismiss the petition for review of actions of the faa and dot respondents because cornish has not exhausted his available administrative remedies.
background 
the nitrite ion is the active ingredient in a widely available product designed to conceal the presence of drugs in a urine specimen.as the practice of nitrite adulteration spread,laboratories certified to conduct employee testing began to reject specimens that contained high nitrite concentrations.because nitrite is found in normal urine at low concentrations,it is important to define an abnormally high concentration.hhs is responsible for promulgating guidelines for mandatory drug testing of federal employees.see exec.order,d,reprinted in note.dot through the faa is responsible for mandatory drug testing of the employees of private air carriers.in,the faa classified a dulteration of a urine sample as a refusal to submit to a drug test.see.the two agencies then undertook to develop a scientifically sound policy for laboratories to follow in analyzing whether a urine specimen is adulterated.
on september,hhs issued program document pd to laboratories.pd stated that a urine specimen should be considered adulterated if analysis reveals a nitrite concentration equal to or greater than micrograms per milliliter Î¼g ml.that same day,dot issued a memorandum the dot memorandum notifying medical review officers mros,the doctors responsible for reporting drug test results to employers,that the recommendations in pd would apply to drug testing,and advising mros to classify a laboratory finding of adulteration as a refusal to test when reporting test results.on july,hhs issued pd,the third memorandum challenged by cornish.pd provided laboratories further guidance for adulteration testing.
in november,cornish submitted a urine specimen that was found by the testing laboratory to contain a nitrite ion concentration of ml.the laboratory advised cornish employer that the specimen was adulterated,and the employer notified the faa as required by law.the faa treated the specimen as a refusal to test and revoked cornish mechanic certificate.the revocation order advised cornish of the adulteration finding but did not cite the adulteration memoranda.cornish appealed to the ntsb.the ntsb administrative law judge initially rejected cornish challenge to the emergency nature of the revocation order.see e.during that stage of the administrative proceeding,cornish learned that the faa relies in part upon the dot memorandum to support the revocation order he then commenced this facial attack on the validity of the adulteration memoranda and obtained a stay of the ntsb administrative appeal pending resolution of this lawsuit.
ii.discussion 
cornish argues that the dot memorandum is facially invalid,without regard to its impact upon his pending administrative appeal of the faa revocation order.cornish argues the dot memorandum was a substantive rule and therefore was invalidly issued without notice and comment rulemaking.respondents reply that it was an interpretive agency action to which rulemaking procedures did not apply.in addition to defending this agency action on the merits,respondents raise three threshold cornish lacks standing to challenge the adulteration memoranda,that his challenge is untimely,and that he failed to exhaust available administrative remedies.
some cases have considered the question whether agency actions were substantive or interpretive rules.see am.min.cong.mine safety health,dep t of labor kast metals,cir.but the issue must be raised in a proper procedural setting.the person attacking an agency action must have standing to seek judicial review,which includes the requirement that he or she suffered injury in fact.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.here,cornish was not even arguably injured by the dot memorandum until the faa relied upon it as a basis for revoking his mechanic certificate.that is the standing question.in addition,a party must seek timely judicial review of an agency action.here,a provides that a petition for judicial review of an order by the secretary of transportation must be filed not later than days after the order is issued,unless there are reasonable grounds for delay.cornish filed this action in the district court long after dot issued the adulteration memorandum.that is the timeliness issue.
cornish argues the revocation order provides the requisite injury in fact.he argues that his delay was reasonable because his challenge did not ripen until the faa relied upon the memorandum in the ntsb appeal process.compare hudson faa,petition for review was timely because faa policy statement was not ripe for review when initially issued.thus,although cornish has attempted to frame this lawsuit as a facial challenge to the adulteration memoranda,independent of his appeal of the certificate revocation order,his reply to respondents standing and timeliness defenses demonstrate that the two proceedings are inextricably intertwined.absent the revocation order,cornish lacks the injury in fact necessary for article iii standing.likewise,the revocation appeal proceedings provide the basis for his timeliness argument.in other words,cornish real complaint is with the adulteration memoranda as applied in his revocation proceeding.and that exposes the fatal flaw in this challenge the adulteration memoranda as applied,cornish must first exhaust the administrative remedies congress has provided to those injured by a certificate revocation order.
the general rule is that statutory administrative remedies must be exhausted before an aggrieved party seeks relief from the federal courts.exhaustion is required because it serves the twin purposes of protecting administrative agency authority and promoting judicial efficiency.mccarthy,d.when the faa administrator revokes an aircraft mechanic certificate,the mechanic may appeal to the ntsb,which may amend,modify,or reverse the order.d.this administrative appeal remedy was available to cornish indeed,his appeal to the ntsb is in progress before an ntsb administrative law judge.if the alj affirms the revocation order,cornish may appeal to the full ntsb,which may affirm or reverse the alj,remand,or enter its own order as the board may deem necessary.see.if the ntsb ultimately upholds the administrator revocation order,cornish may seek judicial review of the ntsb order under.see f,se
