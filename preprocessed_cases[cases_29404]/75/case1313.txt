jones brothers dirt paving contractors contract with the texas department of transportation provides that,prior to terminating or removing a disadvantaged business enterprise dbe subcontractor from a project,jones had to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the business opportunity program bop office in austin that the dbe was unwilling or unable to perform.we decide the appropriate standard for reviewing the bop decision under the contract satisfaction clause.we also decide whether section of the texas transportation code,which establishes administrative remedies for contract disputes with txdot,provides the exclusive remedy for jones claims for breach of contract and declaratory relief.
we conclude that the administrative law judge correctly reviewed the bop decision for whether it was based on partiality,fraud,misconduct,or gross error.therefore,the court of appeals erroneously instructed the trial court to remand the administrative claim to the alj to review the bop decision under a different standard.furthermore,we conclude that the transportation code provides the exclusive remedy for jones claims against txdot.thus,the court of appeals incorrectly remanded claims to the trial court for jones to replead facts showing waiver of sovereign immunity.at.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment remanding jones claims to the trial court for repleading,dismiss those claims for lack of jurisdiction,and remand the remaining claim to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
jones contracted with txdot to reconstruct miles of fm in presidio county.because federal funds partly supported the project,the contract required jones to subcontract at least ten percent of the work to a dbe.also,because of this funding,the federal government required jones contract with txdot to have a provision requiring jones to obtain approval from txdot bop before terminating a dbe that jones hired for a project 
prior to terminating or removing a dbe subcontractor named in the commitment,the contractor must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the business opportunity program office in austin the originally designated dbe was not able or willing to perform any substitutions of dbes shall be subject to approval by the business opportunity program office in austin.
the contract authorized jones to determine what work the dbe that jones chose would perform.jones contracted percent of the work to ak concrete,a dbe.however,jones and txdot soon became concerned that ak concrete was unqualified,and its substandard work had to be corrected as the project progressed.jones formally notified ak concrete that its work was unsatisfactory,and then attempted to terminate ak concrete from the project.jones also notified the bop that it wanted to replace ak concrete with another dbe subcontractor.
the bop,a txdot subdivision charged with administering the dbe programs,requested that jones provide documents to demonstrate that ak concrete was unable or unwilling to perform.after reviewing the documentation jones provided,and after interviewing jones and ak concrete,the bop concluded that,although ak concrete work was substandard and had to be corrected,there was no evidence that the problems had delayed the project.therefore,the bop denied jones request to replace ak concrete.
eventually,txdot discharged ak concrete for attempting to bribe a txdot inspector.but by that time,jones could no longer secure a substitute subcontractor and thus completed the work itself.because of this,jones finished the job late,and txdot assessed in liquidated damages against jones for failing to meet the contract deadline.
jones then initiated administrative proceedings under the transportation code to recover about in additional costs,which included a refund of the in liquidated damages that txdot assessed against jones.see.transp.code.txdot contract claims committee denied jones claim.next,jones requested a contested case hearing in the state office of administrative hearings.see.transp.code b.gov t code,b.the alj determined that jones was not liable to txdot for the liquidated damages,but she denied jones claims for the additional costs related to jones finishing ak concrete work.the alj determined that the bop decision denying jones request to terminate its dbe was reasonable and was not based on partiality,fraud,misconduct,or gross error.txdot adopted the alj proposed decision to reimburse jones the liquidated damages and deny additional damages.
jones sought substantial evidence review of txdot decision in the trial court.see.transp.code d.gov t code.in that suit,jones also raised original claims for breach of contract,declaratory judgment,and attorney fees.txdot answered and asserted sovereign immunity against jones original claims.without issuing findings of fact or conclusions of law,the trial court affirmed the part of txdot order reimbursing the liquidated damages,but it reversed the part of the order denying additional damages.the trial court then rendered judgment for jones for in damages,which included the in liquidated damages,plus interest and attorney fees.
the court of appeals reversed the trial court judgment.first,the court of appeals remanded the administrative claim to the trial court with instructions to remand to the alj to review the bop decision denying jones request to terminate ak concrete under a different standard of review.at.second,the court of appeals concluded that the trial court erred because it did not rule on txdot plea to the jurisdiction and,instead,impliedly overruled it when it rendered the final judgment.the court of appeals noted that,because jones petition failed to allege facts showing a waiver of txdot sovereign immunity for the breach of contract and declaratory judgment claims,jones should have an opportunity to amend.at.therefore,the court of appeals remanded these claims to the trial court to allow jones an opportunity to replead waiver by conduct as an exception to txdot sovereign immunity.at.because the court of appeals did not affirm jones recovery under any grounds,it did not decide if jones could recover attorney fees.at.both parties petitioned this court for review.
ii.administrative review 
jones contract claim against the administrative proceeding and in the trial to recover,among other things,the costs jones allegedly incurred because the bop did not approve its request to replace the dbe.in the trial court,jones claimed that the alj committed an error of law,because she applied the wrong standard when she reviewed the bop decision to deny jones request to terminate the dbe.jones asserts that the alj should have reviewed the bop decision under a reasonableness standard,because that standard applies when reviewing a decision under a satisfaction contract.see black lake pipe line union constr,overruled in part on other grounds,sterner marathon oil.on the other hand,txdot asserts that the alj properly reviewed the bop decision under the partiality,fraud,misconduct,or gross error standard,because that standard applies when reviewing an referee decision.see city of san antonio mckenzie constr.
the court of appeals agreed with jones,reversed the trial court judgment,and remanded the case to the trial court.the court of appeals determined that,because the bop is a txdot subdivision,the satisfaction clause was effectively subject to txdot sole determination.at.relying on black lake,the court of appeals concluded that the alj committed an error of law when it reviewed jones contract claim,because the proper review standard is reasonableness rather than partiality,fraud,misconduct,or gross error.at.thus,the court of appeals instructed the trial court to remand to the alj to decide whether the bop decision to deny jones request to terminate ak concrete was unreasonable.at.
