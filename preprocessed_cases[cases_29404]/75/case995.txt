public citizen and other public interest groups collectively public citizen or petitioners seek review of a final rule of the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa or the agency revising existing hours of service hos regulations limiting the hours of driving and work of commercial motor vehicle operators.for the reasons more fully set out below,we agree with petitioners that the rulemaking was arbitrary and capricious,because the fmcsa failed to take account of a statutory limit on its authority.we therefore grant the petition for review and vacate the rule.
regulatory background 
for years,federal regulators have limited the hours of service that truckers,as well as other operators of various vehicles in the transportation industry,can work and operate their motorized conveyances.the fmcsa,created by statute in,is the agency charged with promulgating hos rules regulating drivers of commercial motor vehicles.when congress created the fmcsa,it provided as follows 
in carrying out its duties,the fmcsa shall consider the assignment and maintenance of safety as its highest priority,recognizing the clear intent,encouragement,and dedication of congress to the furtherance of the highest degree of safety in motor carrier transportation.
before congress created the fmcsa,the federal highway administration fha was responsible for such rules.
in,congress ordered the fha to revise the existing commercial motor vehicle hos rules.specifically,it provided that the fha 
shall issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking dealing with a variety of issues pertaining to commercial motor vehicle safety including hours of continuous sleep after hours of driving,loading,and unloading operations,automated and recording devices,rest and recovery cycles,fatigue and stress in longer combination vehicles,fitness for duty,and other appropriate regulatory and enforcement countermeasures for reducing incidents and increasing driver alertness.
note.the fha never issued the required notice of rulemaking,and so it fell to the fmcsa to do the job.
in may,the fmcsa,in a formal notice published in the federal register,proposed a new set of commercial motor vehicle hos rules.npr.though the rules regulate all commercial motor vehicles,the petition before us addresses the impact of the rule on truck drivers.the fmcsa promulgated those rules pursuant to,among other statutes,and,which are part of the motor carrier act of and the motor carrier safety act of.section provides,in relevant part 
a minimum safety standards at a minimum,the hos regulations shall ensure that 
commercial motor vehicles are maintained,equipped,loaded,and operated safely 
the responsibilities imposed on operators of commercial motor vehicles do not impair their ability to operate the vehicles safely 
the physical condition of operators of commercial motor vehicles is adequate to enable them to operate the vehicles safely and 
the operation of commercial motor vehicles does not have a deleterious effect on the physical condition of the operators.
section d provides 
before prescribing or revising any hos requirement,the fmcsa shall consider the costs and benefits of the requirement.
the npr proposed to revise the existing hos commercial motor vehicle regulations,which had been in place with some revisions since.the old rules had placed limits on the number of hours truckers could drive daily without time,and the number of hours truckers could work weekly during seven or eight consecutive days and still drive,with some exceptions not relevant here.see superseded.these were limits on the time drivers could work and still drive so far as the rules went,drivers who worked more than the daily or weekly limits could still work as long as they did not drive.the daily limits prohibited truckers from driving more than ten hours without taking eight hours of time or from driving after fifteen hours on duty without taking eight hours of time.id.a.drivers,however,could take periodic breaks during the day,thus extending the on duty period beyond fifteen hours.the rules also permitted drivers to obtain the necessary eight nominally consecutive hours sleep by resting in a sleeper berth,an enclosed compartment in the cargo space of a truck with space for drivers to sleep.drivers could obtain their rest in sleeper berths in two separate periods totaling eight hours,each of which was at least two hours long.id.g.that meant that a truck driver could satisfy regulatory requirements,for example,by driving six hours,resting for five in his attached,driving another four,and resting another three hours.the parties refer to this feature of the old rules as the exception.the weekly driving limits prohibited driving after having been on duty for sixty hours in seven consecutive days,or seventy hours in eight consecutive days.id.b.to enforce these requirements,the old rules required drivers to maintain log books recording their hours and duty status,and subjected drivers to roadside inspections of the books.id.
b.the proposed rule 
the fmcsa proposed a significant revision to these rules in the npr.it based these revisions on some general scientific conclusions regarding the consequences of sleep deprivation among commercial motor vehicle operators.it noted that research showed that people are much more alert and have better reaction times when they are on regular,circadian schedules,as humans are programmed to function best when they go to sleep and wake up around the same time every day.at.these effects place nighttime drivers in a physiologically vulnerable position,the agency concluded,because they must sleep during the day,when their bodies are least receptive to sleep,and work during the night,when they are physiologically and cognitively least able.that vulnerability of drivers,in turn,creates a substantial risk of substandard and potentially unsafe driving performance on the part of drivers unless they obtain regular and sufficient restorative sleep.id.at.to avoid these problems,the agency concluded that drivers should get,at a minimum,eight consecutive hours of uninterrupted sleep every day.id.
accordingly,the agency proposed several revisions to the existing hos commercial motor vehicle driver regulations.for truckers,the agency proposed to limit daily and driving time to twelve hours,with two additional hours off sometime during the workday,providing for a maximum workday of fourteen hours.id.at.separate rules applied to other categories of commercial motor vehicle drivers.the npr proposed requiring drivers to get ten consecutive hours of time after a workday,putting drivers on a cycle,assuming they maximized work time and minimized time.id.
there were at least three justifications for the increase in mandatory time and the decrease in permissible time.the first was the need to increase the old rules work cycle to a hour cycle the old rules had permitted an cycle by requiring only eight hours of time after ten hours of driving.the change to a hour maximum cycle,the agency reasoned,better approximated circadian rhythms.the second was the need to allow enough time for drivers to get sufficient continuous sleep.the old rules,by requiring only eight hours of time,concluded the agency,had not allowed drivers to obtain seven or eight hours sleep,because drivers had to spend much of this time on daily personal tasks,such as commuting,eating meals,running personal errands,and having a family and social life.id.at.the last justification was the agency conclusion that the risk of a driver crashing increases markedly after the hour of any duty time during the work shift,which justified limiting daily and driving time to twelve hours.id.at.
the agency also proposed to modify the old rules exception.citing research showing that was less restorative than continuous sleep,the agency proposed to eliminate the exception for solo drivers.id.at.that would mean that solo drivers could no longer accumulate the required amount of time by splitting their time in a sleeper berth.the agency proposed to retain the exception for team drivers,but increased the minimum period from two to five hours.id.at.the proposal,in addition,no longer allowed drivers to extend their period by taking periodic breaks during the day and instead provided for a mandatory period of two hours.it counted any additional break time against drivers total time.
the rule proffered in the npr also would have required drivers to take a mandatory weekend of to hours each week,covering two consecutive periods from to id.at,tbl.this additional recovery period was necessary,according to the agency,to compensate for sleep debts drivers accrue during each weeks work.id.at.in addition,the weekend would ensure that drivers have an opportunity to sleep during two nighttime periods each week circadianoptimal times and prevent drivers from having to work five consecutive night shifts.id.at.
finally,the proposed rule would have required truckers to use electronic onboard recorders eobrs instead of logbooks to monitor their adherence to the new regulatory requirements.id.at.those recorders would automatically monitor the date,driving distance per day,on and time,start time,and would have a continuous time scale.see id.at.drivers would not be permitted to edit the recorded figures.the agency proposed requiring such recorders because it determined that falsification of logbooks,the only form of compliance monitoring mandated by the old rules,was widespread.id.at.
c.the final rule 
the eventual rule,promulgated in april,was still a significant revision to the old rules,but differed markedly from the npr.see.the new rule prohibited truckers from driving without ten hours of time after fourteen hours of starting work and limited daily driving time during that work period to eleven hours.id.at.as compared to the old rules,those limits increased the required time from eight to ten hours,decreased the total permissible workday from fifteen to fourteen hours,but increased the total maximum daily possible driving from ten to eleven hours.the new rules also eliminated a loophole in the old rules.as discussed,the old rules had allowed drivers to extend the duty period by taking breaks throughout the day,allowing them to drive after having been at work much more than fifteen hours.by prohibiting driving fourteen hours after starting work,rather than after fourteen hours on duty,the new rules eliminated this loophole and prohibited driving after fourteen hours of work,including breaks.unlike the rule proposed in the npr,however,the final rule did not require a mandatory break during the day.
this regulatory framework set drivers schedules at a daily cycle for those who drove the maximum number of hours eleven and then took the minimum possible number of hours ten.drivers who worked both by driving and other tasks the maximum possible time fourteen hours,however,had a daily cycle if they maximized working hours and minimized time ten hours.following the research cited in the npr,the agency recognized a general agreement on the concept of a cycle,the body natural circadian rhythms.id.at.the agency,however,justified not requiring all drivers to operate on a cycle by saying that such a rule would unduly disrupt the trucking industry,though it conceded that such a rule would be ideal from a scientific viewpoint.id.still,the agency noted that its framework move d toward a cycle while minimizing the costs of making the rule inflexible.id.
the agency also considered,and rejected,the npr proposed mandatory weekend at the end of each work week,although it retained the old rules prohibition of driving after more than sixty hours of time during a period,and after more than seventy hours of time during an period.id.at.the mandatory weekend requirement,the agency implied,would create havoc on the already overcrowded highways in the daylight hours,by restricting nighttime driving.id.at.instead of a mandatory weekend,the agency allowed a restart provision.id.at.this provision permitted drivers to restart their work week after taking consecutive hours,meaning that they could work a new seven or consecutive driving period that comported with the weekly maximum hour limits.the agency justified the restart provision by arguing that hours was enough to allow drivers to obtain seven or eight hours of uninterrupted sleep on each of two consecutive days,thereby allowing them to obtain adequate restorative sleep and freeing them to start driving anew as part of a sixty or work week.id.at.
as compared to the old rules,the restart provision increased the number of hours truckers could work per week.the old rules had capped the number of hours a trucker could drive after working each week at sixty or seventy for eight days regardless of whether a trucker got hours consecutive rest during the week.the new rules,by contrast,allowed drivers to work more hours if they took hours off before the close of the weekly limits.a driver could work hours over seven days,for example,by working rotations seven days a week,assuming the driver took consecutive hours off after driving the maximum hours and took the minimum forty hours off over the first four calendar days.
the final rule also revised the npr proposed restructuring of the exception.the npr had proposed eliminating that exception for solo drivers but retaining it,in modified form,for team drivers.the agency ultimately decided that this was unwise.it decided to allow drivers to obtain the required ten hours rest in exactly two chunks,one of which was at least two hours long in contrast to the minimum the npr recommendation would have required for team drivers.g.the npr rule would have instead required that solo drivers take ten continuous hours off duty,whether spent in a sleeper berth or not.
in retaining the exception for solo drivers,the agency reasoned that the proximity and convenience of the berths for truckers reduced the importance of having a longer rest period for drivers who sleep in berths.at.a longer period,the agency worried,would be unduly inflexible,as it would require a driver who sleeps for seven hours in a berth to refrain from working another three hours.id.the final rule noted,too,that ninety percent of truckers currently use sleeper berths,and that their use is firmly entrenched in the practice,culture,and equipment of the trucking industry.id.the agency also cited a lack of evidence that retaining the exception was a safety hazard,and concluded that the existing studies that purported to show that dividing sleep in berths was dangerous were actually inconclusive.id.at.
the agency altered the proposed rule on yet another point.the npr had proposed requiring truckers to install eobrs to monitor compliance with the rules in the final rule the fmcsa decided not to do so at this time,but instead to continue relying on logbooks.id.at.the agency reasoned that there was insufficient evidence regarding the costs and benefits of requiring eobrs.id.the agency also was concerned that it would be difficult to standardize eobrs and that they would be expensive.id.finally,the agency cited concerns that the recorders would be unduly intrusive.id.
this petition for review followed.
petitioners claim that the final rule is arbitrary and capricious in several respects.we review the adequacy of the agency reasoning under the familiar standard of motor vehicle manufacturers association state farm mutual automobile insurance,d.that requires us to ensure that the agency made a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.id.at.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we agree with petitioners that the rule is arbitrary and capricious because the agency failed to consider the impact of the rules on the health of drivers,a factor the agency must consider under its organic statute.because the agency has wholly failed to comply with this specific statutory requirement,this single objection from petitioners is sufficient to establish an decision requiring vacatur of the rule.
several of petitioners other objections also raise troubling concerns about the decisionmaking process.we do not,however,enter final judgment on those,as we are vacating and remanding the matter in any case and the agency will be free in its further proceedings to consider the other objections anew in light of this opinion and its own responses to the driver health requirement.
driver health 
we hold that the final rule is arbitrary and capricious because the agency neglected to consider a statutorily mandated factor the impact of the rule on the health of drivers.in promulgating regulations on commercial motor vehicle safety,and hos regulations are undoubtedly on that exact subject,the fmcsa is required a t a minimum to ensure that the operation of commercial motor vehicles does not have a deleterious effect on the physical condition of the operators.a.as the supreme court stated in state farm,an agency rule normally is arbitrary and capricious if it entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem before it.at.at.a statutorily mandated factor,by definition,is an important aspect of any issue before an administrative agency,as it is for congress in the first instance to define the appropriate scope of an agency mission.when congress says a factor is mandatory,that expresses its judgment that such a factor is important.in accordance with this principle,we have held that the complete absen c e of any discussion of a statutorily mandated factor leaves us with no alternative but to conclude that the agency failed to take account of this statutory limit on its authority,making the agency reasoning arbitrary and capricious.united mine workers dole.
the fmcsa points to nothing in the agency extensive deliberations establishing that it considered the statutorily mandated factor of drivers health in the slightest.instead,the agency states that t he statute does not require the agency to protect driver health to the exclusion of other considerations such as the costs and benefits of the proposed regulation.fmcsa br.at.but neither petitioners nor the court suggests that the statute requires the agency to protect driver health to the exclusion of those factors,only that the agency must consider it.so far as the record reveals,it did not.
the fmcsa only effort to show that it did consider driver health is to point out that it considered the effect of driver health on vehicle safety and to argue that consideration of the health of drivers therefore permeated the entire rulemaking process.fmcsa br.at.but the statute requires the agency to consider the impact of the rule on the physical condition of the operators,not simply the impact of driver health on commercial motor vehicle safety.a.under the statute,vehicle safety is a distinct factor the agency must consider,so considering the effect of driver health on safety can not be equal to considering the impact on the physical condition of the operators.id.a.it is one thing to consider whether an overworked driver is likely to drive less safely and therefore cause accidents.whether overwork and sleep deprivation have deleterious effects on the physical health of the driver is quite another.this is not to suggest that the two factors are unrelated healthy drivers presumably cause fewer accidents and conversely drivers who have fewer accidents suffer fewer injuries.however,the relatedness of the concept discussed to the statutorily mandated factor that the agency does not discuss does not relieve the agency of the duty of compliance with the congressional instruction.
it may be the case,for example,that driving for extended periods of time and sleep deprivation cause drivers back problems,or harm drivers immune systems.the agency may of course think that these and other effects on drivers are not problematic or are outweighed by other considerations,like cost,but if so it was incumbent on it to say so in the rule and to explain why.its failure to do so,standing alone,requires us to vacate the entire rule as arbitrary and capricious,as the agency failure to consider this factor,to borrow a phrase from the agency brief,permeated the entire rulemaking process.
b.other concerns with the rule 
as we said above,we will not render final decision on petitioners other objections to the rule,as the failure of the agency to consider the statutorily mandated factor is dispositive and especially because the agency handling of the other factors may be different after reconsideration in light of whatever decisions it may reach with respect to the effect of the rule on driver health on remand.we nonetheless note,for a sense of completeness,the troubling nature of these other facets of the rulemaking.
increase in maximum driving time from ten to eleven hours 
petitioners challenge the rationality of the agency decision to increase the maximum permissible daily driving time from ten to eleven hours.this challenge illustrates the relatedness of the entire rulemaking to the statutorily mandated factor upon which we are turning our decision.while the challenge to the increase in driving time is distinct,and theoretically could be the basis of the granting of a petition for review by itself,it is also a factor that the agency may wish to consider anew in weighing the effects of the rulemaking on the physical condition of drivers.
in any event,petitioners challenge raises very real concerns.the old hos regulations,as we have discussed,had prohibited truckers from driving more than ten hours without taking eight hours off during the day and had limited truckers time to fifteen hours on duty without taking eight hours of time.while the final rule increased the minimum amount of time from eight to ten hours,and decreased permissible time from fifteen to fourteen hours,it increased the maximum permissible daily driving time from ten to eleven hours.
the agency had essentially two justifications for increasing maximum daily driving time.it said that the increase was justified by the decrease in overall daily tour of duty from fifteen to fourteen hours.at.it also said that the increase in mandatory time from eight to ten hours justified the increase in daily driving time in light of the analysis it had conducted.id.at.
we have our doubts about whether these two justifications are legally sufficient.the agency freely concedes that studies show that performance begins to degrade after the hour on duty and increases geometrically during the and hours on duty.id.despite this finding,the agency cited absolutely no studies in support of its notion that the decrease in daily tour of duty from fifteen to fourteen hours will compensate for these conceded and documented ill effects from the increase.
the agency did refer generally to studies,but that generalized reference is of doubtful legal sufficiency.the agency in particular stated that it relie d upon studies to select a consecutive sic period,a tour of duty,and a maximum of hours of driving and noted that an annotated literature review of those studies is in the rulemaking docket.id.at.but the agency never stated which particular studies in fact justify the increase,much less how they do so.unlike the discussion in the rule,the agency brief before this court does cite several studies with particularity but those citations can not save the rule.the expertise of the agency,not its lawyers,must be brought to bear on this issue in the first instance.see sec chenery.
moreover,although the agency is correct that it decreased the maximum daily time,the agency also,as discussed above,increased the maximum weekly time for those drivers maximizing weekly driving time and who take advantage of the restart provision.even assuming that the agency had adequately documented the beneficial effects from the decreased daily tour of duty,the effects from the increased weekly driving hours may offset any decrease in fatigue flowing from the fact that drivers have shorter tours of duty.for these two reasons,it is unlikely that we would find the agency first explanation legally sufficient.
the agency second justification is also dubious.that explanation relies on the analysis it conducted.the analysis purports to show that the benefits from the rule outweigh its costs,given that the agency increased as compared to the old hos regulations mandatory daily time from eight to ten hours.but this analysis assumes,dubiously,that time spent driving is equally fatiguing as time spent resting that is,that a dri
