the grand canyon trust petitions for review of the decision of the federal aviation administration faa approving the federal actions necessary to allow the city of george,utah,to construct a replacement airport near zion national park.the trust challenges the adequacy of the faa environmental assessment under c of the national environmental policy act of nepa,c,and the faa conclusion that there would be no significant environmental impacts from the project necessitating preparation of an environmental impact statement under nepa.focusing on the noise impacts on the park,the trust principally contends that the faa failed adequately to consider the cumulative impact on the natural quiet of the park and instead addressed only the incremental impact of the replacement airport.we grant the petition.
in,the faa began working with the city of george,utah,to determine the feasibility of continuing use of the existing airport as compared to development of a new airport at a new site.a growing retirement community and projected demand was outstripping the capacity of the existing airport,which could not be expanded due to geographic constraints.three sites in addition to a alternative were examined.in response to comments on a draft environmental assessment,the faa conducted a supplemental noise analysis on the potential noise impacts of the replacement airport on zion national park the park.the park is located approximately miles northeast of george and the preferred replacement airport alternative.
the faa concluded that the noise impacts on the park from the replacement airport would be negligible and insignificant.on january,the faa approved the final environmental assessment,concluding that an environmental impact statement was unnecessary,and issued the record of decision,setting forth actions,determinations,and approvals that will allow george to construct the replacement airport.it is the determination underlying this record of decision,that the proposed action will not significantly affect the environment of the park,that the trust challenges.
the essential disagreement between the parties is whether the faa was required in its environmental assessment to address more than the incremental impact of the replacement airport as compared to the existing airport.nepa requires federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement eis for every major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.an environmental assessment ea is made for the purpose of determining whether an eis is required.see.if any significant environmental impacts might result from the proposed agency action then an eis must be prepared before agency action is taken.sierra club peterson,peterson.

the trust does not dispute that the faa properly defined the relevant environmental concern of noise impacts from aircraft on the park.rather,the trust contends that the faa can not be said to have taken a hard look at the problem when it considered only the incremental impacts of the replacement airport and not the total noise impact that will result from the relocated airport.the trust notes that the ea does not address the cumulative impact in light of other air flights over the park,air tours in or near the park,and reasonably foreseeable future aircraft activity and airport expansions that will contribute to the cumulative noise impact on the park.indeed,the ea statement on cumulative impact is,in full there are no known factors that could result in cumulative impacts as a result of the proposed george replacement airport.further,the trust notes,the faa supplemental noise analysis disregards cumulative impacts.the faa responds that it adequately considered the cumulative impact when it compared noise impacts associated with the replacement airport with the alternative of continued use of the existing airport.it rejects the trust position that it was required in an ea to compare the project to an environmental baseline of natural quiet and to consider the total impact of aircraft noise on the park.
the issue dividing the parties is settled by regulations promulgated by the council on environmental quality ceq to implement nepa and by case law applying those regulations.the ceq regulations,which are entitled to substantial deference,impose a duty on all federal agencies.marsh oregon natural res.council,d citations omitted see also citizens against burlington,busey.the ceq regulations define each term within nepa requirement of an eis for every major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.the term significantly is defined as those actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts.significance exists if it is reasonable to anticipate a cumulatively significant impact on the environment.b.cumulative impact,in turn,is defined as 
the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency federal or or person undertakes such other actions.cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.
although federal agencies have discretion to decide whether a proposed action is significant enough to warrant preparation of an eis,the court owes no deference to the faa interpretation of nepa or the ceq regulations because nepa is addressed to all federal agencies and congress did not entrust administration of nepa to the faa alone.citizens against surface transportation board,see amfac resorts,llc united states dep of interior,cia.
the courts,in reviewing whether a federal agency has acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding no significant environmental impact,have given effect to the plain language of the regulations.while the factual settings differ in some respects from the instant case,the consistent position in the case law is that,depending on the environmental concern at issue,the agency ea must give a realistic evaluation of the total impacts and can not isolate a proposed project,viewing it in a vacuum.for example,in coalition on sensible transportation dole,dole,this court stated that the ceq regulations on cumulative impact provide a distinct meaning to the concept separate and apart from the notion of improper segmentation of agency action.id.at.noting that the regulatory definition of cumulative impact specifies that the incremental impact of the action at issue must be considered when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions,id.quoting,the court observed that,consistent with the regulation and purpose of nepa,i t makes sense to consider the incremental impact of a project for possible cumulative effects by incorporating the effects of other projects into the background data base of the project at issue.id.at.the point,the court stated,was to provide in the ea sufficient information to alert interested members of the public to any arguable cumulative impacts involving other projects.id.at.further,the court concluded that insofar as kleppe sierra club,d,may bear on an agency duty to consider impacts in a context that realistically includes other pending projects,the agency fully complied by planning on the basis of ultimate completion of the related projects.id.citing kleppe,at.at.similarly,the court in peterson,without regard to any particular nepa regulation,reversed a finding of no significant impact and a decision to issue certain oil and gas leases in national forests without preparing an eis,remanding the case because the agency had failed,as nepa requires,to fully assess the possible environmental consequences of activities which have the potential for disturbing the environment.at.nrdc hodel,is to the same effect.there,the agency had failed to consider the cumulative impact,as defined in the ceq regulations,of simultaneous development in the region on species,particularly whales and salmon,that migrate through the different planning areas when it considered only the effect on those species within the planning area rather than the interregional effects.id.at.other circuits take a similar approach in applying the regulations.see,fritiofson alexander,cir,rev on other grounds,sabine river auth.dep t of the interior,cir.although the faa would distinguish hanly kleindienst,cir,on which the trust relies,on the ground that it preceded the regulations,the court was addressing the requirements of nepa,and the faa can point to nothing in the regulations that would suggest the court erred in holding that nepa requires review of a proposed action in light of 
the cumulative harm that results from the action contribution to existing adverse conditions or uses in the area e ven a slight increase in adverse conditions that form an existing environmental milieu may sometimes threaten harm that is significant.one more factory may represent the straw that breaks the back of the environmental camel.
the faa,in finding that the george replacement airport would have no significant impact on the environment of the park,concluded that there is little discernable increased noise intrusion to the park from the proposed replacement airport as compared to the existing airport,and that the increase in noise levels that would result from the development of a replacement airport is negligible because aircraft traffic will increase even if the replacement airport is not constructed.the faa analysis appears principally in a supplemental noise analysis attached to the ea,and proceeds on the basis of a comparison of the noise impacts from predicted air traffic at the existing airport and predicted air traffic at the larger replacement airport.at the existing airport,the faa predicted that flight activity would increase due to normal traffic growth from flights in to flights in more than departures and arrivals every day,and to in more than departures and arrivals each day.at the replacement airport,traffic would increase to flights in more than departures and arrivals every day,and to flights in more than departures and arrivals each day.comparing the predicted noise impact on the park from the existing and replacement airports,the faa found that noise level dnl would increase due to the implementation of the replacement airport over the use of the existing airport by no more than in and dba in,which the faa characterized as extremely low increases.the faa concluded that there will be little difference associated with the replacement airport,as compared with the existing airport,in the based on the dnl metric.
the faa also examined in the supplemental noise analysis the peak hour equivalent noise level leq based on a threshold of dba,when aircraft would be clearly audible and noticeable in the park.the faa assumed that typical background noise levels in the park would be dba during quiet times and locations and in the low dba in less quiet times and locations.based on its own data and on research sponsored by the national park service nps,the faa found that only one flight path from the replacement airport would present noise greater than dba for more than one minute an hour in,which represented only a increase over the predicted traffic at the existing airport.in,three of eleven flight paths from the replacement airport would present noise greater than dba for more than one minute per hour,a change of no more than from the predicted traffic at the existing airport.using a lower noise annoyance threshold of dba,the faa predicted that no flight path would have noise above dba for more than minutes per hour in and minutes each hour in.based on this data,the faa found that while to of park visitors would experience moderate to extreme annoyance due to aircraft noise from the existing george airport,the number would only increase to to with the replacement airport using the dba threshold.using a dba threshold,the faa interpreted the data to mean that between and of park visitors would be annoyed by aircraft noise from the existing airport,compared to to of visitors who would be annoyed by aircraft from the replacement airport,with a increase from to of park visitors experiencing moderate to extreme annoyance from the aircraft noise on the loudest flight path.the faa concluded that there will be little difference in noise between the existing and replacement airport.
in a section of the ea entitled impacts to natural quiet of the park,the faa did acknowledge the existence of overflights that pass over the park.noting that nps had completed ambient noise monitoring in zion national park,the faa stated that the results showed that the background or ambient noise levels vary,but are often in the low dba.finding that the typical peak or maximum noise levels from aircraft from either the existing or proposed george airport sites ranged from to dba when passing directly overhead,the faa concluded that,because these aircraft are at or near cruise altitude,or in the case of jets are above feet,the peak or maximum noise levels will remain the same for either airport site.while recognizing that these overflights constitute noise events that are higher than background natural quiet during periods when ambient noise levels are low,the faa focused on the incremental impact,stating that it was important to illustrate that the development of the george replacement airport has little effect on the overall aircraft noise levels in the park.the faa referred to the overflights following established flight paths near or over the that are not associated with george airport in concluding that the replacement airport has very little contribution to the cumulative number of aircraft over flights over zion national park.the faa observed that george airport contributed only flights using instrument flight rules over zion,a number that was expected to increase to in at the existing airport and at the replacement airport,and to in at the existing airport and at the replacement airport.the faa then found that the replacement airport would add only six additional flights using instrument flight rules per day in and only two additional such flights in.in addition,the faa predicted that less than four aircraft per day would fly over zion using routes,a number the faa predicted would remain the same for either the existing or the replacement site.the faa concluded that the existing george airport would contribute only of all existing flights using instrument flight rules over or near the park,and that the increased flights from the replacement airport would represent only approximately of the total aircraft flights using instrument flight rules over or near the park.
the faa noise analysis in the ea,including the supplemental noise analysis,may,in fact,be a splendid incremental analysis,but it fails to address what is crucial if the ea is to serve its function.while,as the faa stresses,the ea is not intended to be a lengthy document,see a,it must at a minimum address the considerations relevant to determining whether an eis is required.nepa regulations require that an agency consider cumulative impacts and the faa ea fails to address the total noise impact that will result from the replacement airport.indeed,the faa own nepa policy calls for consideration of cumulative impact,parroting the language of the nepa regulations to include proposed projects and past,present,a
