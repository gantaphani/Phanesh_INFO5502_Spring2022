this case arose from the failure of progressive express insurance company progressive to pay personal injury protection pip benefits to its insured,cathy menendez,after she was injured in an automobile accident in june.because progressive did not pay the benefits,the insured sued for overdue benefits.she was successful in her claim in the trial court,which eventually entered a judgment in her favor.on appeal,the third district court of appeal reversed the judgment on multiple grounds,including the insured failure to comply with a statute enacted after the date of the automobile accident referred to as the statutory presuit provision that placed additional requirements on an injured person seeking to recover pip benefits before filing suit.see progressive express ins.menendez,so d dca.
in holding that the statutory presuit notice provision could be applied retroactively to the insured claim because it was merely procedural and did not unconstitutionally alter any existing rights,the decision of the third district expressly and directly conflicts with the decisions of this court in state farm mutual automobile insurance laforet,so d,and young altenhaus,so d,and the decisions of the first district court of appeal in walker cash register auto insurance of leon county,so d dca,and stolzer magic tilt trailer,so d dca.because we conclude that the amendment creating the statutory presuit notice provisions constitutes a substantive change to the statute,we hold that it can not be retroactively applied to insurance policies issued before the effective date of the amendment and quash the decision of the third district in menendez.
facts and procedural history 
as set forth in the district court opinion 
on june,cathy menendez menendez was injured in an automobile accident while traveling to work.menendez was covered by a policy issued by progressive affording personal injury protection pip benefits with effective dates of april,to october.in addition,menendez was eligible for workers compensation benefits,and her employer paid for nine weeks of her lost income.while most of menendez medical bills were paid through workers compensation,progressive paid a total of to four different medical care providers.
menendez,so d at.
after having settled the claims arising out of the automobile accident with the other motorist,menendez paid from that settlement to satisfy a lien filed by menendez employer.in december,her attorney began to pursue a pip benefits claim on behalf of menendez.after a series of letters to and from progressive,almost a year later on november,menendez and her hereinafter referred to as the insureds filed suit against progressive for overdue benefits.
the litigation in the trial court,which spanned a period of several years,eventually focused not on whether progressive owed the benefits,but on whether the statutory presuit notice was required.the trial court ultimately concluded that the statute was not applicable to the insureds claim.further,the court ruled that even if the statute applied,presuit notice was not required because progressive effectively denied petitioners claim.id.at.a partial summary judgment was granted in favor of the insureds and a stipulated final judgment was entered in the full amount due and owing to the insureds.
progressive appealed the summary judgment ruling to the third district court of appeal.the issues on appeal also revolved around the statutory presuit notice requirement.the third district found against the insureds on each issue raised.specifically pertinent to the primary issue in this case,the third district rejected the insureds assertion that the presuit notice requirements of the statute impaired the obligation of contracts in violation of article i,section,of the florida constitution.menendez,so d at accordingly,the third district reversed the summary judgment entered in favor of the insureds,leaving as the only issue to be litigated whether progressive letters constituted a denial of the claim,which would obviate the need to comply with the presuit notice provisions.see a.stat.
the dispositive issue before this court is whether section,florida statutes,can be applied retroactively to an insurance policy issued prior to the enactment of the statute.in our analysis,we look at the date the insurance policy was issued and not the date that the suit was filed or the accident occurred,because the statute in effect at the time an insurance contract is executed governs substantive issues arising in connection with that contract.hassen state farm mut.auto.ins,so d,see also lumbermens mut.cas.ceballos,so d,dca holding that a liability policy is governed by the law in effect at the time the policy is issued,not the law in effect at the time a claim arises hausler state farm mut.auto.ins,so d,dca holding that the date of the accident does not determine the law that is applicable to a dispute.
the crux of the statutory presuit notice provision is the requirement of filing a notice of intent to litigate,originally located in subsection a and now contained in subsection a.the subsection states 
as a condition precedent to filing any action for an overdue claim for benefits under paragraph b,the insurer must be provided with written notice of an intent to initiate litigation provided,however,that,except with regard to a claim or amended claim or judgment for interest only which was not paid or was incorrectly calculated,such notice is not required for an overdue claim that the insurer has denied or reduced,nor is such notice required if the insurer has been provided documentation or information at the insurer request pursuant to subsection.such notice may not be sent until the claim is overdue,including any additional time the insurer has to pay the claim pursuant to paragraph b.
in order to resolve the issue of retroactive application of the statutory presuit notice provision,we first explore the broader statutory scheme of florida motor vehicle law.next,we discuss the standard applicable to determining whether a statute should be applied retroactively.we then apply this standard and hold that the third district improperly concluded that the statutory presuit notice provision could apply retroactively to the existing policy and claim for benefits in this case.
florida motor vehicle law was enacted by the legislature in.in allstate insurance holy cross hospital,so d,we explained in detail the history and purpose of the statute 
the law is a comprehensive statutory scheme,the purpose of which is to provide for medical,surgical,funeral,and disability insurance benefits without regard to fault,and to require motor vehicle insurance securing such benefits.stat.accord united auto.ins.rodriguez,so d,stating that the intent of the law is to provide a minimum level of insurance benefits without regard to fault.the law mandates security that can be established by alternative means,one of which is pip insurance.see.stat.
the required personal injury protection provision,or the pip statute,is codified at section and is an integral part of the statutory scheme.flores allstate ins,so d.the statute requires motor vehicle insurance policies issued in florida to provide pip benefits for bodily injury arising out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of a motor vehicle.stat.accord blish atlanta cas,so d.the pip statute is unique,in that it abolished a traditional right by limiting the recovery available to car accident victims and in exchange,required pip insurance that was recoverable without regard to fault.state farm mut.auto.ins.nichols,so d.although recovery is restricted under this statutory scheme,this court has held that the pip statute is a reasonable alternative to common law tort principles in that it provides swift and virtually automatic payment so that the injured insured may get on with his life without undue financial interruption.id.quoting ivey allstate ins,so d.
this last observation is significant because any impediment to the right of the insured to recover in a swift and virtually automatic way has the potential for interfering with the pip scheme goal of being a reasonable alternative to common law tort
