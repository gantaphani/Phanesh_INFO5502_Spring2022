ronald fenney,an employee of the dakota,minnesota eastern railroad company dakota,requested a disability accommodation from dakota.dakota refused.after fenney sued under the americans with disabilities act of ada and the minnesota human rights act mhra,the district court granted dakota motion for summary judgment.fenney appealed the district court order.we reverse.
in,while working as an engineer for another railroad,fenney was involved in a tragic accident.the mishap severed his thumb and most of his middle finger on his right hand.the accident also damaged the radius bone in his right arm.several operations made the problem worse.fenney now has limited use of his right hand and arm.
fenney began his employment with dakota in.until the present set of events,he worked as an locomotive engineer for dakota.an engineer performs the same duties as a regular engineer,but can be called at any time to report to work.in between shifts,engineers are guaranteed at least an rest period.dakota notifies these engineers telephonically when they must report for their next shift.dakota contract with its union requires that dakota notify the engineers at least one and hours before they are to arrive at work.
until,several of dakota employees received a call that was earlier than the minimum one and hours required employees who needed this advance or long call were noted on daily crew calling sheets.these crew sheets also noted the additional amount of time these employees required.fenney usually received his call two and to three hours ahead of his shift.according to fenney,this additional time allowed him to bathe,dress,shave,prepare a meal,and drive himself to work on time.
in,the railroad hired new management.robert wessler,the new superintendent of transportation,instituted a uniform advance calling time for all employees.after the new policy was issued,fenney no longer received a long call.fenney claims that he requested the additional call time on numerous occasions after dakota instituted the uniform call policy.wessler admitted that fenney asked him for the accommodation several times.fenney also made a written requests to his union and to vernon colbert,dakota new transportation officer.fenney union also made a written request to dakota dakota responded that it would only accommodate fenney request if he could show written documentation that dakota previous management had guaranteed the advance call.
when dakota refused his requested accommodation,fenney asked that dakota assign him to another position with regular hours,rather than risk losing his employment however,because he lacked seniority,the only position for which fenney could qualify was the position of weekend conductor.conductors have work hours,but receive less pay than engineers.in addition,weekend conductors only work four days a week,while engineers work up to seven days a week.
after demoting himself,fenney filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.following an investigation,the eeoc issued fenney a letter.fenney next filed this action,alleging intentional discrimination and a failure to accommodate under the ada and mhra.dakota then filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted.fenney appealed 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.spangler federal home loan bank,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence,viewed in a light most favorable to the party,shows no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we determine materiality from the substantive law governing the claim.anderson liberty lobby,d.disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the lawsuit according to applicable substantive law are material.id.a material fact dispute is genuine if the evidence is sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the party.id.at.
the ada mandates that companies like dakota provide reasonable accommodations to the known physical limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an employee,unless it can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship.b a.to obtain relief under the ada,fenney must show that he has a disability within the meaning of the ada,is a qualified individual under the ada,and suffered an adverse employment action as a result of the disability.duty proppants,cir.
in order to evaluate fenney claim,however,we first must clarify the burdens of production and burdens of persuasion in ada cases.the burden of proof depends on the type of claim that is alleged.if a party alleges a claim of discriminatory disparate treatment,then the traditional framework of mcdonnell douglas will apply.see,stanback best diversified products,cir kiel select artificials,cir en banc.the plaintiff must initially establish each element of the prima facie case.kiel,at.the employer must then rebut the presumption of discrimination by articulating a legitimate,reason for the adverse employment action.id.at.if the employer does this,then the burden of production shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the employer reason is pretextual.id.
however,if a party makes a reasonable accommodation claim,then we apply a modified analysis,benson northwest airlines,cir see also dropinski douglas county,cir fjellestad pizza hut of america,cir montgomery john deere,cir lay,concurring noting that mcdonnell douglas should not apply in an ada reasonable accommodation claim mole buckhorn rubber,cir lay,dissenting same mason frank,cir applying the same analysis under the rehabilitation act of.under benson,a plaintiff at all times retains the burden of persuading the trier of fact that he has been the victim of illegal discrimination due to his disability.at citations omitted.thus,he must first make a facial showing that he has an ada disability and that he has suffered adverse employment action.then he must make a facial showing that he is a qualified individual.
to be a qualified individual within the meaning of the ada,an employee must possess the requisite skill,education,experience,and training for h is position,and be able to perform the essential job functions,with or without reasonable accommodation.heaser toro,cir.although the plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of proving that he is a qualified individual,if the employer disputes that the employee can perform the essential functions of the job,then the burden shifts to the employer to put on some evidence of those essential functions.benson,at.this only makes sense because much of the information which determines those essential functions lies uniquely with the employer.id.
further,if the employee can not perform the essential functions of the job without an accommodation,he must only make a facial showing that a reasonable accommodation is possible id.at emphasis added.the burden of production then shifts to the employer to show that it is unable to accommodate the employee.fjellestad,at.if the employer can show that the employee can not perform the essential functions of the job even with reasonable accommodation,then the employee must rebut that showing with evidence of his individual capabilities.benson,at citations omitted.at that point,the employee burden merges with his ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that he has suffered unlawful discrimination.id.citations omitted.
fenney original pleadings alleged a claim and a disparate treatment claim.see dakota addendum,at.from the pleadings,however,it is clear that fenney has abandoned his disparate treatment claim on appeal in his briefs he makes no arguments to support it thus,we analyze fenney claim under the benson reasonable accommodation framework.applying these principles,we conclude that summary judgment is inappropriate.
disability 
as a threshold matter,fenney must produce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he has a disability within the meaning of the ada.krauel iowa methodist med,cir the threshold requirement for coverage under the ada is that the plaintiff be a qualified individual with a disability.the ada provides several definitions for disability.the ada disability definition that is most germane to fenney describes a disability as a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual.a emphasis added.fenney has a physical impairment he is missing his thumb as well as half of his middle finger on his dominant hand and has a damaged right arm.see j i.the parties,therefore,focus on whether fenney impairment substantially limits him in the major life activity of caring for himself 
the ada does not define either the term major life activities or the term substantially limits.the supreme court has noted that t here are two potential sources of guidance for interpreting these ada terms first are the regulations interpreting the rehabilitation act of and second are the eeoc regulations interpreting the ada.toyota motor,kentucky,williams,d.regulations interpreting the rehabilitation act of receive a high degree of persuasive authority is virtually without question.id.at.noting that congress provided that nothing shall be construed to apply a lesser standard than the regulations issued by federal agencies pursuant to the rehabilitation act of.in contrast,the amount of deference given eeoc regulations is still an open question id.the persuasive authority of the eeoc regulations is less clear w e have no occasion to decide what level of deference,if any,they are due.
fortunately,the regulations interpreting the rehabilitation act provide a list of examples of major life activities,which includes walking,seeing,hearing and,as relevant here,caring for oneself.j ii see also toyota,at.cooper olin,winchester,cir.thus,fenney physical impairment does limit one of his major life for himself.
as a result,the critical issue in fenney case is whether that limitation is substantial.unfortunately,the rehabilitation act regulations do not define the term substantially limits.in an attempt to fill this gap,the eeoc has endeavored to define the term.according to the eeoc,a person is substantially limited if,compared to the average person in the general population,she can not perform or is s ignificantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which she can perform a particular major life activity j cooper,at relying on the eeoc definition.previously,an application of the eeoc standard would have completed our analysis.
however,the supreme court has recently addressed the question of what a plaintiff must demonstrate in order to establish a substantial limitation of a major life activity.see toyota,at.in toyota,the court considered whether a plaintiff syndrome substantially limited the specific major life activity of performing manual tasks.the court concluded that to be substantially limited in performing manual tasks,an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people daily lives.id.at.emphasis added.
there are at least two ways to interpret toyota holding.one way is to the eeoc toyota analysis is limited to ada cases that deal with the substantial limitation of the specific major life activity of performing manual tasks.at least one of our sister circuits has so assumed.see rakity dillon companies,cir assuming without discussing that toyota holding was limited to the major life activity of performing manual tasks.if we were to accept this interpretation,we would then apply the eeoc definition.j.we decline to do so.
another way to interpret toyota is to dakota has that toyota analysis applies no matter the specific class of major life activity one is claiming the rest of our sister circuits,who have addressed this issue,agree.mack great dane trailers,cir we see no basis for confining toyota analysis to only those cases involving the specific life activity of performing manual tasks.eeoc united parcel service,cir toyota requires that the impairment must prevent or severely restrict use compared with how unimpaired individuals normally would in daily life.see also mulholland pharmacia upjohn,case,available at,cir applying the toyota analysis to the major life activity of learning waldrip general electric,cir,available at wl,at for the specific life activity of eating t he effects of an impairment must be severe to qualify as a disability under the ada.this interpretation results in a higher threshold for the statute than some had believed it contained.dvorak mostardi platt,cir.
we agree with this interpretation.a close examination of toyota demonstrates that the court defined terms of the substantially in the phrase substantially limited and major in the phrase major life activities.toyota,at.the court defined substantially to be considerable or to a large degree.id.citations omitted.thus,it concluded that substantial limitations of impairments clearly preclude impairments that interfere in only a minor way id.it then defined major as important and reasoned that major life activities are ones that are of central importance.id.these terms are not just ones involved in the major life activity of performing manual tasks,but are ones which are necessary in every a determination.we therefore conclude that fenney must demonstrate that his impairment prevents or severely restricts his ability to care for himself compared with how unimpaired individuals normally care for themselves in daily life.
fenney contends that he has adduced sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment.specifically,fenney has submitted a letter from his doctor,ariel birnbaum,which was specific to his impairment and which stated that 
because of the missing right thumb,fenney requires more time during the winter to do changes sic in regards to his clothing.the lack of his right thumb makes it difficult for him to do certain types of grasping motions which would delay him in terms of being able to change his clothes in cold weather.
at.fenney also states in his deposition that it takes him twice as long as an average person to perform his taking care of himself,shaving,preparing a meal,dressing,and going to the restroom.such testimony must be accepted as true at the summary judgment stage.booth hvass,cir.
dakota offered no evidence to contradict fenney evidence.instead,dakota argues that when one subtracts fenney call time from his commute and arrival time,it leaves him too little time to care for himself this,dakota reasons,conclusively demonstrates that fenney impairment can not prevent or severely restrict him from caring for himself.however,dakota bases its estimates of fenney schedule upon its assumptions of his daily routine.as a result,dakota argument only works if the facts are interpreted in its favor.however,on summary judgment the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.spangler,at.moreover,on summary judgment we are not to weigh evidence or decide facts,but rather to determine whether there are issues for trial.johnson enron,cir thus,we accept fenney testimony as true and can not accept dakota assumptions as fact.
in conclusion,fenney has proffered evidence that his impairment severely restricted his ability to care for himself compared with how an unimpaired individual would normally care for himself or herself in daily life.admittedly,this evidence is thin.however,viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to fenney,it a reasonable inference from which an issue of material fact can be drawn.see snow ridgeview medical,cir.dakota has provided no evidence to conclude otherwise.thus,the district court was incorrect when it determined that as a matter of law fenney is not substantially limited in the major life activity of caring for himself.
adverse action 
in order to overcome his initial burden of establishing a prima facie case,fenney must also demonstrate that he suffered an adverse employment action.see foster arthur andersen,llp,cir an adverse employment action is one that causes a material change in the terms or conditions of employment.brown lester cox med,cir citations omitted.to be adverse,the action need not always involve termination or even a decrease in benefits or pay.phillips collings,cir.however,not
