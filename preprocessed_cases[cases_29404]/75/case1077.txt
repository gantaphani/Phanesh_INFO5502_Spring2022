a patent carries a statutory presumption of validity,so ussc had the burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that the inventors of the wheelchair system placed their invention in public use more than one year before filing the patent application.bernhardt,at.the inventors,james ditch and freridoun razavi,applied for a patent on december,and later assigned their patent to american seating to commercialize the product.ditch was the director of maintenance for the long beach transit authority when,in,he and bus retrofitter razavi invented the wheelchair restraint system with the goal of better and more efficiently serving long beach wheelchair bound customers while reducing the maintenance problems associated with an earlier generation of wheelchair restraints.as they improved the invention,on several occasions ditch and razavi placed evolving prototypes in an bus for the purpose of soliciting feedback from friends and colleagues who to varying degrees assisted in the invention development.
contrary to ussc argument,the fact that the inventors revealed the prototype to a select group of individuals without a written confidentiality agreement is not dispositive.when access to an invention is clearly limited and controlled by the inventor,depending upon the relationships of the observers and the inventor,an understanding of confidentiality can be implied.id.at moleculon research cbs.in this case,the jury was entitled to conclude that ditch,razavi,and the limited number of people permitted to view the restraint system prototype shared a general understanding of confidentiality.ditch demonstrated the prototype on an bus,solicited feedback,and removed the invention to store under his control.there was no evidence that the prototype was placed in service before december,and no evidence that an unrestricted number of people unconnected with the development of the invention observed the invention in use.the district court properly confirmed the jury verdict that the patent is not invalid for public use.
