plaintiff appellant scott wolfe wolfe appeals the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of defendant appellee bnsf railway company bnsf on wolfe claims under montana code annotated mca.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
wolfe is a longtime employee of bnsf.in december,wolfe worked in shelby,montana,as a track inspector for the first time.before then,he worked primarily as a foreman and a machine operator at bnsf.bnsf mechanic robert flesche provided wolfe with a truck,which can be driven along rails.flesche had previously complained about the truck poor condition to bnsf.flesche stated that nobody wanted to be assigned that truck,certainly nobody like d it for a h i rail truck.flesche said e verything was just more difficult with that truck i t was a rough riding truck,very rough riding.flesche had told the railroad,it was a bad truck,and that it sure was not suited for track inspection.nevertheless,flesche gave wolfe the truck because it was the only one available.
flesche quickly showed wolfe how to use the attachments on the truck.the attachments were four heavy mechanical assemblies,two in front and two in back,that were supposed to drop the truck wheels onto the rail and lock them in place,keeping the truck on the rails like a standard railroad car.flesche also showed wolfe a little about the truck limits compliance system hlcs.the hlcs is a gps system that identifies where vehicles are on the tracks,interfaces with bnsf computer system,and ensures that employees stay within their railroad track authorities the boundaries of the areas to which they have been assigned.wolfe previously had attended mandatory training on using the hlcs.at that training,managers read material on the hlcs to the employees,but there was no demonstration on how to work the system.flesche concluded after observing wolfe that wolfe had not ever been trained on using the hlcs.
on the morning of december,wolfe requested track authority from the dispatcher,james trotchie,to go east on a particular stretch of track.trotchie misheard wolfe request for permission to go east and,assuming that he wanted to go west,verbally approved wolfe request while assigning him track authority in the hlcs to go west.wolfe proceeded to go east on the rails in his truck.
approximately four miles from where wolfe began to travel on the rails,wolfe encountered a freight train head on.wolfe jumped off the truck before it was hit by the train.the truck was damaged,but wolfe was not physically injured.
wolfe is a member of the brotherhood of maintenance of way employes union the union.the union has a collective bargaining agreement cba with bnsf.under rule of the cba,an employee who has worked days or more,such as wolfe,will not be disciplined or dismissed until after a fair and impartial investigation has been held.bnsf conducted two formal investigations of wolfe accident pursuant to rule to determine whether wolfe failed to activate the hlcs on his truck and whether wolfe failed to operate within the limits of his track authority at the time of the accident.after the investigations,bnsf determined that wolfe committed the alleged misconduct.wolfe received a day suspension for his failure to activate the hlcs and was dismissed for his failure to have main track authority.
wolfe challenged his dismissal.on wolfe behalf,the union referred the grievance to the national railroad adjustment board the adjustment board.the adjustment board was created under the railway labor act to resolve disputes between carriers and their employees.the adjustment board determined that bnsf proved that wolfe failed to engage his hlcs and violated his track authority,affirmed wolfe day suspension for the hlcs violation as reasonable,and reduced wolfe dismissal to a suspension because it found that dismissal was too severe a penalty for the track authority violation.the adjustment board ordered that wolfe be reinstated with his seniority unimpaired,but decided that he was not entitled to backpay.
wolfe filed a complaint in montana state court asserting claims under mca,which governs the liability of railways for negligent mismanagement.bnsf removed the claims to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.wolfe amended complaint states two claims under mca that bnsf mismanagement and the negligence of its employees caused the train collision and that bnsf mismanaged the subsequent investigation and disciplinary proceedings.
bnsf filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that wolfe claims were preempted by the railway labor act.the district court granted the motion.the district court found that wolfe claims were preempted because t he facts surrounding wolfe claim s appear to be inextricably intertwined with the grievance procedures controlled by the cba.on appeal,wolfe concedes that his claim challenging the bnsf investigation and disciplinary proceedings,which were governed by the cba,is preempted,but contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on wolfe claim against bnsf concerning the alleged negligent mismanagement that resulted in the collision.

discussion 
preemption under the railway labor act rla 
t o promote stability in relations,the rla requires arbitration for two classes of disputes concerning rates of pay,rules or working conditions.hawaiian airlines,norris,internal quotation marks and citations omitted the first class major disputes concerns the formation or negotiation of collective bargaining agreements.id.the second class minor disputes concerns controversies over the meaning of an existing collective bargaining agreement in a particular fact situation.id.at quoting of trainmen chi.river.the parties agree that the only way wolfe claim is preempted is if the conflict over the collision constitutes a minor dispute.bnsf bears the burden of proof on its preemption defense.jimeno mobil oil,cir.
before the supreme court decision in norris,this circuit considered the scope of minor disputes under the rla to be quite expansive.espinal,at.but norris substantially narrowed the scope of rla preemption.id.in norris,the supreme court observed that a claim is preempted by the rla only when the state claim involve s duties and rights created or defined by a cba and is therefore dependent on the interpretation of a cba.at.in contrast,a cause of action is not by the rla if it involves rights and obligations that exist independent of the cba.id.at.
applying the norris framework,we conclude that wolfe state claim concerning the collision is not preempted.
