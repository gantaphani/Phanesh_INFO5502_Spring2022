this case requires us to decide whether a federal district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether passenger stage corporation drivers are employees or independent contractors under california law.specifically,we must consider whether such a decision by the district court would hinder,frustrate,interfere with,or obstruct the regulatory authority exercised by the california public utilities commission over passenger stage corporations,as prohibited by california public utilities code.we hold that it would not.
background 
the public utilities commission puc or commission is a state administrative agency created by the california constitution to regulate public utilities.cal.const.art.xii.the california public utilities code protects the jurisdiction of the puc by limiting judicial review of commission decisions and policies 
no court of this state,except the supreme court and the court of appeal shall have jurisdiction to review,reverse,correct,or annul any order or decision of the commission or to suspend or delay the execution or operation thereof,or to enjoin,restrain,or interfere with the commission in the performance of its official duties 
other provisions of the public utilities code,however,make clear that public utilities are also subject to california law generally.chapter of the public utilities act,entitled violations,lays out a variety of remedies available if a public utility violates the law.a number of public enforcement remedies are enumerated,but the sole private remedy in chapter is found in 
any public utility which does,causes to be done,or permits any act,matter,or thing prohibited or declared unlawful,or which omits to do any act,matter,or thing required to be done,either by the constitution,any law of this state,or any order or decision of the commission,shall be liable to the persons or corporations affected thereby for all loss,damages,or injury caused thereby or resulting therefrom an action to recover for such loss,damage,or injury may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction by any corporation or person.
cal.pub.the issue we must address is the tension between this statutory remedies provision and the jurisdictional limitation set out in.
the public utilities code also specifically grants the puc the power to regulate common carriers,including passenger stage corporations pscs,which include every corporation or person engaged as a common carrier,for compensation,in the ownership,control,operation or management of any passenger stage over any public highway in this state between fixed termini or over a regular route.cal.pub.c,a,a.in general order a,the puc promulgated rules governing the operations of pscs.section of that order provides 
driver status.every driver of a vehicle shall be the certificate holder or under the complete supervision,direction and control of the operating carrier and shall be 
a.an employee of the certificate holder or,
b.an employee of a or,
c.an independent who holds carrier authority and is operating as a.
other provisions regulate the vehicles used by pscs,inspection and records requirements,tariffs and timetables,and drug and alcohol testing of drivers.general order a.
defendant appellee supershuttle international,provides airport shuttle service.in california,supershuttle licenses its operations to subsidiary city licensees which hold psc certificates thus,supershuttle is considered a psc subject to puc regulation.prior to,supershuttle classified its california drivers as employees.supershuttle then decided to shift to a unit franchise model,in which the supershuttle city licensees hire drivers as independent contractor franchisees,pursuant to a unit franchise agreement,or allow their franchisees to hire additional drivers.
plaintiffs appellants are current or former franchisee shuttle van drivers for supershuttle in various parts of california.the filed a putative class action in alameda county superior court,alleging that plaintiffs were misclassified as independent contractors,when,in truth,they were employees under california law.plaintiffs alleged that they had consequently been deprived of the full protections provided to employees under the california labor code,including overtime and minimum wages,reimbursement of business expenses and deductions wrongfully taken from wages,and meal period pay.in support of their allegations,plaintiffs asserted that supershuttle treats its drivers like employees in many respects,such as requiring drivers to work within designated geographical areas,charge set fares,and obey detailed standards regarding their appearance and behavior while working.defendants removed the action to federal court pursuant to the class action fairness act.d,
the district court granted supershuttle motion to dismiss plaintiffs state law claims holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.kairy supershuttle int l,d.the court applied the test laid out by the california supreme court in san diego gas electric superior court covalt,cal,designed to resolve conflicts between actions brought against a public utility under public utilities code and the provision in.the district court first decided that the puc had the authority to formulate policy regarding the classification of psc drivers.kairy,d at.it then concluded that the puc had actually exercised that authority by promulgating general order a and through its decision interpreting that order,in re prime time shuttle int l,cpuc,wl,prime time.kairy,d at.finally,the district court concluded that to allow plaintiffs action to go forward would interfere with the puc exercise of its regulatory authority over the classification of psc drivers.id.at.based on this analysis,the district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to consequently,it dismissed plaintiffs state law claims.id.at.

iii.discussion 
in a case requiring a federal court to apply california law,the court must apply the law as it believes the california supreme court would apply it.gravquick trimble navigation int l,cir.in the absence of a controlling california supreme court decision,the panel must predict how the california supreme court would decide the issue,using intermediate appellate court decisions,statutes,and decisions from other jurisdictions as interpretive aids.id.
the california supreme court has on a number of occasions addressed the tension between public utilities code and the public and private remedies provided for in chapter of that code,and has consistently applied a test to resolve any conflict.see,covalt,at involving claims for damages and injunctive relief against an electric utility based on nuisance and personal injury causes of action hartwell superior court,cal concerning claims for damages and injunctive relief brought against water utilities people ex rel.orloff pac.bell,cal considering claims against communications utilities by county district attorneys for violations of the california business and professions code.
the california supreme court first laid out the applicable test in covalt,noting in particular the primacy of section and that the relief provided for in correspondingly must be construed as limited to those situations in which an award of damages would not hinder or frustrate the commission declared supervisory and regulatory policies.covalt,at quoting waters pac,cal.to determine whether an action was barred by,the court asked whether the puc had the authority to adopt a regulatory policy on the subject matter of the litigation whether the puc had exercised that authority and whether action in the case before the court would hinder or interfere with the puc exercise of regulatory authority.id.at see also hartwell,at.
plaintiffs allege that supershuttle violated the california labor code and that their suit falls within the broad language of public utilities code,which permits private suits against public utilities for violations of any law of this state.accordingly,we must apply the covalt test to resolve the potential conflict between the puc statutory jurisdiction over pscs,protected from judicial interference by,and the instant suit between a psc and its drivers.we conclude that under the covalt test plaintiffs are not precluded from pursuing their suit in the district court because a decision by that court would not hinder or interfere with the puc exercise of regulatory authority over the relationship.
puc authority to regulate 
the first step in the covalt inquiry requires us to decide if the puc has the authority to adopt a regulatory policy on the subject matter of this litigation,the relationship between pscs and their drivers.we conclude that it does.the discussion of the puc powers in covalt is instructive the california supreme court explained there that the commission has duties,functions,and powers,and that the california constitution confers broad authority on the commission to regulate utilities.covalt,at.the public utilities code authorizes the puc to do all things which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction.id.moreover,the puc is permitted to require every utility to do any other act which the health or safety of its employees,passengers,customers,or the public may demand.cal.pub.the puc broad powers to protect public health and safety apply with full force in the context of its regulation of pscs.those powers give the commission authority to regulate the types of drivers,whether employees or independent contractors,that an airport shuttle service is permitted to use,because the closeness of the relationship between a company and its drivers could potentially implicate public safety.
moreover,the puc itself has asserted that it has the authority to determine what type of relationship a psc may maintain with its drivers,stating in an administrative decision,if we find a failure to provide good service,that finding might lead us to consider adopting rules to restrict psc reliance on nonemployee drivers,if such reliance is demonstrated to be the main source of prime time service problems.prime time,wl,at emphasis added see also puc amicus br.at the commission contends it could prohibit from operating shuttle vans on grounds of service or safety to the public emphasis added.such warnings suggest that the puc considers it well within its jurisdiction to limit the classes of drivers available to pscs if safety concerns so demand.therefore,both the general regulatory powers granted to the puc and the puc own interpretation of its jurisdictional authority in a decision concerning pscs indicate that the district court was correct in concluding that the puc has the authority to regulate the type of relationship between airport shuttle services and their drivers.
puc exercise of its authority to regulate 
the second part of the covalt inquiry requires this court to ask whether the puc has exercised its authority to regulate the relationship.the district court below concluded that the puc had actually exercised such authority,relying on general order a and the puc decision in prime time.kairy,d at.as noted above,general order a permits pscs to use either employee drivers or independent contractor drivers,as long as the psc maintains complete supervision,direction and control over those drivers.in prime time,the puc reiterated that it had no institutional preference for employee or drivers and that the complete supervision requirement in could be compatible with an independent contractor relationship.prime time,wl,at.
in response,plaintiffs argue that general order a and prime time do not represent an actual exercise of puc authority over the specific question of driver classification,because they do not require a psc to use any particular sort of driver and so do not alter what would be the default rule absent any puc action.they emphasize that both general order a and prime time express agnosticism towards whether a psc chooses to use employees or independent contractors,leaving the choice to each psc.see prime time,wl,at we do not regulate a psc preference for employee or nonemployee drivers.as a result,plaintiffs argue,the puc has declined to exercise its power to control or limit the types of drivers a psc can use.
supershuttle relies on a california court of appeal decision addressing a related question.in sarale pacific gas electric,d,the court of appeal considered a claim by private individuals against pacific gas electric company pg e based on an increase in the amount that the company was trimming off walnut trees owned by the plaintiffs near power lines.id.at.the plaintiffs sought,among other relief,a declaration that pg e was not authorized to trim further than the minimum trim distance specified in a puc general order.id.at.the plaintiffs argued that the second part of the covalt test was not satisfied because the puc had specifically declined to exercise its authority to regulate excessive trimming,the subject matter of the litigation,and had merely regulated minimum trimming requirements.id.at.the court rejected this argument,stating 
for purposes of applying the covalt test,it does not matter whether we characterize the commission actions broadly,as addressing the management of vegetation near power lines,or narrowly,as addressing minimum tree trimming clearances.what matters is that the commission has exercised its authority to adopt a regulatory policy relating to tree trimming around power lines regardless of how that policy may be characterized.
id.alteration in original.supershuttle contends that under sarale,the second covalt inquiry would be satisfied here if the puc adopted a policy merely related to the relationship between pscs and their drivers,even if it did not specifically limit the types of drivers that could be used or how those drivers should be classified accordingly,that the puc has acted to regulate the requisite degree of supervision that must exist in the relationship.
plaintiffs dispute this analogy,arguing that a policy merely relating to the relationship is far too broad to constitute an exercise of authority over determinations whether particular drivers are employees or independent contractors.more important,the puc itself asserts in its amicus brief that it has not exercised authority over the employment classification of shuttle van drivers.puc amicus br.at.the puc was well aware of the decision in sarale,and had,in fact,actively asserted during that litigation its position that the commission had exercised authority over the matter at issue.nonetheless,the puc has maintained in this case that the district court determination that the puc had exercised its authority over the underlying plaintiffs claim was based on a misreading of the prime time decision and was contrary to fact.we recognize that a resolution of this issue presents a close question.because we conclude that plaintiffs claim would not frustrate or hinder any existing policy of the puc and,thus,can proceed under part three of covalt,it is unnecessary for us to decide the question whether general order a represents an exercise of puc authority over the instant matter.
hindrance to puc policy 
the final prong of the covalt test is whether judicial action would hinder or interfere with the puc exercise of regulatory authority over the relationship.under normal circumstances,a district court would determine whether the supershuttle drivers were de facto employees pursuant to california law by applying a test.see borello sons,dep t of indus.relations,cal explaining that while the principal test of an employment relationship is the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired,the control test can not be applied in isolation narayan egl,cir detailing the many factors the california supreme court has enumerated that indicate an employment relationship,which must all be assessed and weighed together.the central quest
