appellant florida east coast railway company fec seeks reversal of the district court final judgment denying declaratory and injunctive relief against appellee city of west palm beach west palm beach or the city.fec sought a determination from the district court that the interstate commerce commission termination act iccta,et and supp,the city application of zoning and occupational license ordinances against the operations of rinker materials corporation rinker on property leased from fec.we hold that the application of the ordinances does not constitute regulation of rail transportation,b,and therefore,is not by the iccta.
jurisdiction 
the district court had federal question jurisdiction over the complaint seeking declaratory relief pursuant to a and.appellate jurisdiction is under.
fec owns acres of property on street street yard in west palm beach,in an area otherwise zoned by the city as a high density residential district.situated on this property are an office building,warehouses,five switching tracks,and two tracks.although fec had used the street yard for various intermodal operations for several years,the company ceased those operations in because of diminishing business activity and cost of systems enhancements along with marginal revenue per unit.
at the time fec altered the nature of operations at the street yard,rinker was fec largest customer.rinker is in the business of supplying building material including aggregate,the primary feedstock for cement.rinker aggregate originates in quarries in county.for years rinker had engaged fec to transport the aggregate by rail to rinker plants throughout florida,including one on street in west palm beach.
in march of,fec and rinker began discussing the possibility of a property exchange,whereby fec would exchange its street yard for rinker street plant.rinker recognized,however,that the street yard was not properly zoned for its proposed aggregate distribution business.michael bagley,head of real estate at fec,suggested that p rior to approaching the city,it may be wise to get rinker established on a small scale,under lease arrangement to set precedent for continued use and expansion as an aggregate terminal.fec and rinker therefore negotiated a lease agreement and a trackage agreement whereby fec would lease to rinker acres of the street yard including the office building and a side track.additionally,fec would no longer transport aggregate for rinker to rinker plants throughout florida instead,fec rail services for rinker would be limited to the transportation of the aggregate from the quarries to the street yard.operations under the new agreement commenced in january of.
once the aggregate entered the leased portion of the street yard,fec involvement ended.on the property leased from fec,rinker situated its aggregate distribution business,as evidenced by signs initially posted in the street yard that read csr palm distribution.sometime between february,and march,the signs were replaced with ones reading fec distribution terminal.rinker hired a company to undertake the unloading of the aggregate but provided certain necessary equipment for the aggregate distribution,including a scale and a loader bucket scale,or backhoe.then,rinker employees loaded trucks,which were owned or hired by rinker,and dispatched them to other rinker plants or to external customers.rinker employees coordinated the distribution network from the office building leased from fec,including receiving requests for aggregate from rinker plants and communicating with the aggregate truck drivers.finally,rinker was responsible for payment of its expenses on electricity,water,landscape maintenance,and telephone service.
on february,west palm beach issued cease and desist orders to fec and rinker for operating a business that did not conform to the city zoning ordinance.fec and rinker also received notice of violations of section of the city ordinances for unlawfully operating a business without an occupational license.after a hearing in march of,a special magistrate found fec and rinker in violation of the zoning and occupational license ordinances,and therefore ordered both companies to cease and desist or face fines of per day.fec then filed its complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that west palm beach actions were by the iccta,and therefore,the city could not impose its zoning and occupational license requirements on rinker operations.west palm beach filed a counterclaim against fec and a claim against rinker,seeking a declaratory judgment that the application of its local regulations was not by federal law.

the ordinances at issue in this case are entitled to this presumption of validity under the supremacy clause.although the federal government through the iccta has legislated in an area where there has been a history of significant federal presence,locke,at,west palm beach is not legislating in that field of historic federal dominance.rather,in contrast to the situation highlighted by the court in locke,west palm beach is acting under the traditionally local police power of zoning and health and safety regulation.the supreme court has long recognized the authority of local governments to establish guidelines for the use of property through such zoning ordinances.see generally village of belle terre boraas,d village of euclid ambler realty.as we reiterated more recently,m unicipalities may zone land to pursue any number of legitimate objectives related to the health,safety,morals,or general welfare of the community.manufactured hous.ass n,at quoting scurlock city of lynn haven,cir.because the alleged encroachment upon federal jurisdiction here does not occur by the municipality legislating in a field of historic federal presence,but through the exercise of its inherently local powers,t he principles of federalism and respect for state sovereignty that underlie the court reluctance to find,cipollone liggett group,d blackmun,concurring,place a considerable burden on appellant.de buono med.clinical servs.fund,d.

express limitations of iccta 
the key provision of the iccta,as it relates to this case,is as follows 
b the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board over 
transportation by rail carriers,and the remedies provided in this part with respect to rates,classifications,rules including car service,interchange,and other operating rules,practices,routes,services,and facilities of such carriers and 
the construction,acquisition,operation,abandonment,or discontinuance of spur,industrial,team,switching,or side tracks,or facilities,even if the tracks are located,or intended to be located,entirely in one state,
is exclusive.except as otherwise provided in this part,the remedies provided under this part with respect to regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under federal or state law.
b.although this subsection on its surface seems to provide for broad,the text contains limitations on the reach of local legislation such as west palm beach zoning and occupational license ordinances.
first,the state law which is to be is not defined.when congress has sought to underscore its intent that the provision be expansively applied,it has used broad language in defining the state law that would be,for example,by stating that such law included all state action having the effect of law.mcclendon,at.quoting erisa c,c.second,the provision limits to state law.b emphasis added.in the context of railroad regulation,congress has specifically identified when municipal law should be superseded by federal statute.see,a a rail carrier,corporation,or person participating in that approved or exempted transaction is exempt from the antitrust laws and from all other law,including state and municipal law.see also norfolk western ry.am.train dispatchers ass n,d discussing coverage of a,formerly a,based on clear,broad,and unqualified language employed.by circumscribing the effect of the iccta to certain federal and state laws,congress did not clearly include municipal laws such as west palm beach zoning ordinances within the plain reach of federal.c ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bank germain,d citations omitted.see also gutierrez ada,d unanimous opinion.nevertheless,some municipal laws that would have the effect of burdensome state law may be under the iccta,but because municipal law is not expressly,its effects must be closely examined.
the iccta provision does not preclude the application of all other law.a with regard to mergers and acquisitions,railroad companies exempt from antitrust laws and from all other law,including state and municipal law.rather,express applies only to state laws with respect to regulation of rail transportation.b emphasis added.this necessarily means something qualitatively different from laws with respect to rail transportation.see bennett spear,d relying on cardinal principle of statutory construction that courts must give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.citations omitted.in this manner,congress narrowly tailored the iccta provision to displace only regulation,those state laws that may reasonably be said to have the effect of manag ing or govern ing rail transportation,black law dictionary ed,while permitting the continued application of laws having a more remote or incidental effect on rail transportation.see cal.div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham constr,d the prevailing wage statute alters the incentives,but does not dictate the choices,facing erisa plans.in this regard,it is no different from myriad state laws in areas traditionally subject to local regulation,which congress could not possibly have intended to eliminate.quoting state conf.of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d.see also lorillard tobacco reilly,d majority opinion finding express where there is no question about an indirect relationship between the regulations and cigarette advertising because the regulations expressly target cigarette advertising constr.trades council associated builders contractors,d we have held consistently that the nlra was intended to supplant state labor regulation,not all legitimate state activity that affects labor.emphasis in original.
in light of the above understanding of the statutory provision in the iccta,existing zoning ordinances of general applicability,which are enforced against a private entity leasing property from a railroad for transportation purposes,are not sufficiently linked to rules governing the operation of the railroad so as to constitute laws with respect to regulation of rail transportation.lorillard,at.at majority opinion there is a critical distinction,however,between generally applicable zoning regulations and regulations targeting cigarette advertising.see also id.at.both parties agree that the city does not impose its generally applicable zoning ordinances against fec,thereby preventing fec from operating in the otherwise residential neighborhood city of auburn united states,cir finding local environmental regulation applied against railroad to be by iccta,cert.denied,d soo line city of minneapolis,d,finding city process of requiring railroad to obtain demolition permits by iccta.we are not called upon to decide whether federal law would constrain the city exercise of its police power to limit fec operations should it engage in an aggregate distribution business in exactly the same manner as rinker.it is clear,however,that in no way does federal under the iccta mandate that municipalities allow any private entity to operate in a residentially zoned area simply because the entity is under a lease from the railroad.the language of the iccta provision in no way suggests that local regulation was to be so thoroughly disabled.
definition of transportation 
because the iccta defines transportation to include facilit ies related to the movement of property by rail,regardless of ownership or an agreement concerning use,a supp fec urges that whether the activities that take place at the street yard are performed by fec or some other entity should have no bearing on our analysis.as a preliminary matter,we note that the statute ignores ownership or agreement concerning use solely with respect to any facility,instrumentality,or equipment of any kind related to the movement of property.id.in contrast,the statute imposes no such limitation on services related to the movement of property.b emphasis added.therefore,to the extent that the language relied upon by fec prevents us from interpreting the scope of the provision based on whether fec or rinker controls the property at the street yard,the statutory definition of transportation does not prohibit our relying upon such a distinction when evaluating the services performed at the property.
our review of the record indicates that we are,indeed,evaluating services performed at the property.when the aggregate reached the street yard,it was unloaded,stockpiled on the ground,organized by type and grade,and reloaded onto trucks owned or hired by rinker.rinker employees then weighed and dispatched the trucks to various destinations.these activities fall under the services provision of the statutory definition of transportation,as rinker activities involved the receipt,storage,handling,and interchange of property.thus,the statutory language indicates that ownership or control of the property is a factor that we may consider in determining whether rinker activities are rail transportation,and in ultimately deciding whether federal law the city zoning regulations in this case.
in addition to the statutory language,an analysis of the phrase regardless of ownership or an agreement concerning use in its historical context also supports the conclusion that the provision can not bear the broad interpretation urged by fec.the phrase originated in language found in the hepburn act of,which amended significantly the interstate commerce act of ica.the hepburn act amended the definition of transportation to include cars and other vehicles and all instrumentalities and facilities of shipment or carriage,irrespective of ownership or of any contract,express or implied,for the use thereof ch,stat.emphasis added.this language was not amended until,when congress reworded the definition to include such facilities related to the movement of property,regardless of ownership or an agreement concerning use.ch,stat.as the legislative history indicates,however,these changes were adopted for clarity and consistency,at,reprinted in,and therefore,did not alter the meaning of the original phrase.congress again ratified this understanding when adopting the same definition of transportation in the iccta.see iccta,stat.we thus consider the language and history of the provision adopted by congress in the hepburn act to ascertain congressional intent behind the scope of the phrase regardless of ownership or agreement concerning use.see lorillard,at.at majority opinion we are aided in our interpretation by considering the predecessor provision and the circumstances in which the current language was adopted.
the evil of discrimination was the principal thing aimed at in the passage of the interstate commerce act.louisville united states.citations omitted.see also george pierce wells,fargo.icc baltimore.in particular,congress sought to eliminate the preferential rates given by railroad companies to certain shippers by declaring such discrimination unlawful and requiring railroads to publish their tariffs.ica,ch,stat.the publication of tariffs prohibited railroads from the blatantly discriminatory practice of charging different rates to two similarly situated shippers through secret agreements favoring certain customers.clyde atchison,the evolution of the interstate commerce act,geo.in,the elkins act provided the icc with enhanced powers to promote compliance with the interstate commerce act provisions and to impose greater penalties for behaviors facilitating the unequal treatment of shippers.see elkins act,ch,stat.see also atchison,supra,at.
notwithstanding these initial attempts to ensure equal access to railroad facilities for all shippers,discrimination persisted in the railroad industry primarily because of a continuing lack of transparency in rate formulation.on the one hand,a private car company could charge a shipper unlimited rates for the use of a private vehicle such as a refrigeration car,and the shipper would have no recourse against such unregulated and unpredictable charges,as the private car line was not operated by the railroad and thereby not subject to provisions of the interstate commerce act.on the other hand,in lieu of their earlier pricing policies,certain railroad companies began offering discounts on tariffs in exchange for the use of private cars,individual railroad switches,and other rail equipment owned by economically powerful shippers or private car companies.such discounts were in excess of the true market value of the equipment temporarily used by the railroad.by thus leasing their equipment to the railroads or smaller shippers at inordinate rates that were not subject to public notice,these groups often received transportation services at prices below the levels of the published tariffs.such favoritism resurrected the discriminatory treatment of smaller shippers.see generally sharfman,the interstate commerce commission a study in administrative law and procedure the economic regulation of business and industry a legislative history of regulatory agencies bernard schwartz,ed hereinafter economic regulation statement of esch.the situation regarding this discrimination was summed up thus by one contemporaneous commentator the shippers were beyond the commission control the lines,as such,were not embraced within the commission jurisdiction and there was serious question as to whether the special services rendered in connection with the use of private cars were subject to its regulation.sharfman,supra,at.
legislators referred to these continuing evils of discrimination throughout the hearings and debates as the basis for expanding the definition of transportation.see,economic regulation,at statement of la follette cong.rec.statement of townsend cong.rec.statements of tillman and lodge cong.rec.statements of dolliver,mccumber and kittredge.that such a view was commonly held among members of congress is evidenced by its explication in the committee reports of each chamber.see economic regulation,at,report of tillman economic regulation,at,house report.
the interstate commerce commission icc,as the agency responsible for oversight of the railroad industry pursuant to the interstate commerce act,was well aware of the discrimination perpetrated by backdoor dealings between railroad companies and large shippers or private car lines.see sharfman,supra,at citing icc annual reports of,and.when proposing to congress the legislation that would become the hepburn act,and particularly the expanded statutory definition of transportation,the interstate commerce commission noted the following 
it will be seen that the changes proposed in the first section of the interstate commerce act are designated a to somewhat increase the jurisdiction of the law as to the carriers subject to its provisions and b to bring within the scope of the law certain charges and practices which are not now subject to regulation,or respecting which there is dispute as to the power of the commission the second purpose is sought to be accomplished by enlarging the definition of the term transportation,so as to include the charges for various services,such as refrigeration and the like,which are now claimed to be beyond our authority w e do recommend that these private car charges should be put on the same basis as all other freight charges.they should be published and maintained the same as the transportation charge,and be subject to the same supervision and control in brief,the proposed measure amends certain sections of the act to regulate commerce and is confined to such recommendations as are deemed necessary to effect its intended purpose,and thereby furnish adequate protection against excessive and discriminating charges.
united states.quoting icc proposed bill and explanations before senate commerce committee.the revised definition of transportation adopted by congress in the hepburn act of,including the language irrespective of ownership or of any contract,express or implied,for the use thereof,was the exact language proposed by the icc to provide it with the powers described above.see id.at.
the revised definition of transportation successfully addressed the hidden charges imposed on shippers by private car lines and larger shippers,thus furthering the original goal of the interstate commerce act to eliminate discrimination in the railroad services provided to shippers.as described by one commentator,
the amended statute defined transportation as to embrace cars,vehicles,and all other instrumentalities of shipment or carriage,irrespective of ownership or contract,and all services rendered in connection with the property endowing the icc with regulatory power over private cars and incidental services it was the instrumentalities and services of rail carriage which had been brought under the icc full sway and it was through the control of these instrumentalities and services that the use of private cars and the operation of lines were encompassed by the icc jurisdiction.the icc powers spring from the carriers utilization of equipment.
sharfman,supra,at,emphasis added.that the addition of the phrase regarding ownership and contractual arrangements to the definition of transportation was intended to cover discrimination also seems to be the understanding of the icc in the years shortly after the hepburn act went into effect.
under the law as construed by the courts,car lines and others engaged in leasing cars to shippers are not common carriers and thus do not come under direct control by the icc.when a car,regardless of ownership,is being moved in interstate commerce by a common carrier subject to the act,there is no doubt of our power to control the carrier operation of the car so that there shall result no undue preference to any shipper.
in the matter of private cars,emphasis added.thus,even after the definition of transportation had been amended under the hepburn act to include equipment not owned by the railroads,the icc recognized that its jurisdiction,while expanded,was still limited to those activities that served the railroads in fulfilling their tasks as common carriers,or that affected the general public through concerns of possible discrimination.see also growers marketing pere marquette,in the matter of contracts of express companies for free transportation of their men and material over railroads.
given this statutory history,we reject fec reading of the phrase regardless of ownership or agreement concerning use found in the iccta definition of transportation.congress employed this language specifically to grant the icc jurisdiction over those facilities that,while not owned by the railroad companies,were nevertheless used in interstate commerce for the benefit of either the shipping public or the railroad companies themselves.furthermore,even where the railroads owned the property in question,congress explicitly intended that the leasing cost of equipment that constitutes transportation would be incorporated into the railroads published tariffs so as to protect the public from the invidious discrimination characteristic of the era before the hepburn act.in this regard,the supreme court consistently has recognized the focus of the icc jurisdiction to be the protection of the general public rather than individual private entities.see,ret.bd.duquesne warehouse.merchants warehouse united states.united states union stock yard transit.
in this case,rinker use of the property at the street yard and the activities there performed by rinker serve no public function and provide no valuable service to fec rather,the arrangement between fec and rinker merely facilitates rinker operation of a private distribution facility on premises.furthermore,record evidence,such as rinker being the sole fec customer to use the street yard,rinker taking responsibility for its utility expenses on the property,and a sign on the property reading csr palm distribution,indicates that rinker operation served a purely private function.as stated by the district court,rinker effectively ran a rinker operation on fec property.d at.the factual findings supporting the district court conclusion are not clearly erroneous.we also find that the district court properly applied the law to these facts in concluding that rinker activities at the street yard were not rail transportation.contrary to fec suggestion,therefore,the iccta of state regulation of rail transportation does not preclude a determination that certain actions taken by west palm beach,which might or might not be if taken against fec,do not violate the supremacy clause when applied against rinker in its operations on fec property 
history and purpose of the iccta 
our conclusion as to the meaning of the iccta provision is bolstered by the history and purpose of the iccta itself.the statutory changes brought about by the iccta reflect the focus of legislative attention on removing direct economic regulation by the states,as opposed to the incidental effects that inhere in the exercise of traditionally local police powers such as zoning.the statute expressly authorized regulation of certain railroad activities to be undertaken concurrently by the federal and state governments,while still other regulation would be the exclusive province of state law.for example,former section of title provided that e xcept as otherwise provided in this subtitle,the remedies provided under this subtitle are in addition to remedies existing under another law or at common law.emphasis added.concurrent authority was also contemplated for much intrastate railroad activity.see,b d.federal law also recognized exclusive state authority over the construction,acquisition,operation,abandonment,or discontinuance of spur,industrial,team,switching,or side tracks if the tracks are located,or intended to be located,entirely in one state b.see also b acknowledging regulatory role of states over railroads.the iccta removed the authority of the states to regulate those railroad activities that had previously been subject to state regulation or to concurrent regulation,providing instead for federal uniformity in the regulation of rail transport.see supp 
when identifying the principles of national rail transportation policy under the iccta,congress deleted the previous statutory reference to cooperat ion with the states on transportation matters to assure that intrastate regulatory jurisdiction is exercised in accordance with the standards established in this subtitle.compare with supp.this deletion emphasizes the focus of the iccta on removing direct state regulation of railroads previously permitted for intrastate rail transport.the principles of national rail transportation policy,as continued from the previous statute,further reveal a general deregulatory focus,see supp,but the regulation sought to be minimize d is at the federal not local level.supp.one house report emphasized the balance sought to be achieved between the rights of states in the exercise of their police powers and the need for exclusivity in the federal scheme of economic regulation any other construction would undermine the uniformity of federal standards and risk the balkanization and subversion of the federal scheme of minimal regulation for this intrinsically interstate form of transportation,at,reprinted in.one senate report noted the following 
n othing in this bill should be construed to authorize states to regulate railroads in areas where federal regulation has been repealed by this bill the hundreds of rail carriers that comprise the railroad industry rely on a nationally uniform system of economic regulation.subjecting rail carriers to regulatory requirements that vary among the states would greatly undermine the industry ability to provide the seamless service that is essential to its shippers and would waken the industry efficiency and competitive viability 
at emphasis added.finally,the report describing the bill as it appeared in its final form after conference committee stated as follows 
the conference provision of b retains this general rule of increased exclusivity for federal remedies,while clarifying that the exclusivity is limited to remedies with respect to rail state and federal law generally.for example,criminal statutes governing antitrust matters not by this act,and laws defining such criminal offenses as bribery and extortion,remain fully applicable unless specifically displaced,because they do not generally collide with the scheme of economic regulation and deregulation of rail transportation.
conf,at,reprinted in,emphases added.allowing localities to enforce their ordinances with the possible incidental effects such laws may have on railroads would not result in the feared balkanization of the railroad industry as companies sought to comply with those laws.unlike direct regulation of railroads,which is not the case with the west palm beach zoning ordinance,and which was the focus of the statutory changes to the iccta,the zoning ordinances with which rinker must comply,do not burden fec with the patchwork of regulation that motivated the passage of the iccta.cipollone,at.recognizing existence of diverse state and local regulations as catalyst for passing federal legislation.while perhaps not optimal
