congress established a distinct regulatory framework for collective bargaining between federal agencies and their employees under the federal service relations statute.within this statutory framework,the federal service impasses panel fsip,impasses panel,or panel serves as a forum of last resort in the speedy resolution of disputes between a federal agency and the exclusive representatives of its employees after negotiations have failed.council of prison locals brewer.therefore,decisions of the fsip generally are not subject to direct judicial review.id.at.a federal district court may exercise jurisdiction to review a panel order only in exceptional circumstances as defined by leedom kyne,d,and its progeny.brewer,at.

background 
a.the fsip 
the federal service relations statute,chapter,which was passed as part of the civil service reform act of,governs l abor relations within the federal civil service.dep t of def.flra.the flra is primarily responsible for administering the statute.under chapter,a federal agency and the exclusive bargaining representatives of that agency employees are required to negotiate in good faith over the subjects covered by the duty to bargain.see a.where negotiations fail to produce an accord,the statute provides for alternative dispute resolution processes.first,the parties may use the services of the federal mediation and conciliation service.a.should mediation fail to resolve a negotiation impasse either party may request the services of the fsip,b,an entity within the authority,the function of which is to provide assistance in resolving negotiation impasses between agencies and exclusive representatives of their employees,c.t he parties may also agree to adopt a procedure for binding arbitration of the negotiation impasse,but only if the procedure is approved by the panel.b.
upon submission of a request for panel assistance,the panel shall promptly investigate any impasse presented to it.c a.once it has investigated,t he panel shall consider the impasse and shall either i recommend to the parties procedures for the resolution of the impasse or ii assist the parties in resolving the impasse through whatever methods and procedures it may consider appropriate to accomplish the purpose of this section.c a.the panel has published regulations implementing.see.as relevant here,the regulations provide 
a upon receipt of a request for consideration of an impasse,the panel or its designee will promptly conduct an investigation,consulting when necessary with the parties and with any mediation service utilized.after due consideration,the panel shall either 
decline to assert jurisdiction in the event that it finds that no impasse exists or that there is other good cause for not asserting jurisdiction,in whole or in part,and so advise the parties in writing,stating its reasons or 
assert jurisdiction and 
i recommend to the parties procedures for the resolution of the impasse 
ii assist the parties in resolving the impasse through whatever methods and procedures the panel considers appropriate.
congressional restructuring of the faa in the 
the faa argues here,as before the panel,that legislation passed by congress in the withdrew the fsip jurisdiction as the final arbiter over disputes that arise between the faa and its employees over compensation and benefits.first,with the enactment of the department of transportation and related agencies appropriations act dot act,congress directed the faa to establish its own personnel management system,exempt from many of the provisions of federal personnel laws.see g.section g is derived from of the dot act,stat,and it now provides in relevant part that,
i n consultation with the employees of the administration and such experts in personnel management systems as he may employ,and notwithstanding the provisions of title and other federal personnel laws,the administrator of the faa shall develop and implement,not later than january,a personnel management system for the administration that addresses the unique demands on the agency workforce.such a new system shall,at a minimum,provide for greater flexibility in the hiring,training,compensation,and location of personnel.
on march,the faa issued its new personnel management system.the new system extended chapter protections to faa employees 
the faa,all faa employees,and all labor organizations representing faa employees shall have the same rights,and be subject to the same responsibilities and limitations,as are available to all federal agencies,employees,and labor organizations under chapter.
faa personnel management system,at,reprinted in joint appendix.the faa explained that,while congress did not require that the new system conform to chapter,t he faa has elected to continue the rights and benefits of union representation to our employees.id.at ii,reprinted in.it is undisputed that the current version of the faa personnel management system contains this same provision extending chapter protections to faa employees.
on march,congress amended to codify the agency choice to extend chapter protections to faa employees.res,stat.codified as amended at g.section now provides the provisions of title shall not apply to the faa new personnel management system with the exception of chapter,relating to relations.g c.the parties agree that none of these acts altered the panel jurisdiction to address collective bargaining impasses between the faa and the unions.
according to the faa,business as usual changed when congress enacted l in october.the faa argues that,u nder l,the faa has the power to fix compensation for officers and employees,but its power to bargain over compensation and benefits is strictly limited.br.for faa as amicus curiae at.section l states in relevant part 
except as provided in subsections a and g of section,the administrator is authorized,in the performance of the functions of the administrator,to appoint,transfer,and fix the compensation of such officers and employees,including attorneys,as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the administrator and the administration.in fixing compensation and benefits of officers and employees,the administrator shall not engage in any type of bargaining,except to the extent provided for in section a,nor shall the administrator be bound by any requirement to establish such compensation or benefits at particular levels.
l.this provision was added as of the air traffic management system performance improvement act of faa act,enacted as title ii of the federal aviation reauthorization act of,tit.ii,stat.the provision originally referred in its text to the uncodified version of g,but was put in its current form in the wendell ford aviation investment and reform act for the century,a,c,stat.
the faa points out that l invocation of section a of title incorporates a special process involving consultation,negotiation,mediation,and notification.if the parties can not agree on compensation and benefits after consulting and negotiating,the federal mediation and conciliation service is brought in to help the parties reach an agreement.then,if the parties still can not agree,the faa is authorized to implement its proposed changes if it follows a procedure of notifying congress and waiting a period of days.br.for faa as amicus curiae at.
the parties disagree over the import of l.the faa argues that l divests the fsip of jurisdiction over bargaining impasses between the faa and union bargaining agents with respect to compensation and benefits.in other words,the agency claims that it is only required to bargain to the extent provided for in section a.and under a,the faa can not be required to use the services of the fsip.the unions disagree,pointing out that the first line of l says e xcept as provided in subsection g of section,and that g in turn expressly incorporates chapter bargaining rights.neither the panel nor the authority has taken a position on the matter.
c.the bargaining impasses and the fsip 
natca represents around employees of the faa.after a lengthy period of negotiating with the faa on behalf of bargaining units,involving approximately union members,the parties reached a bargaining impasse.when their attempt to reach resolution with the assistance of the federal mediation and conciliation service failed,natca filed a formal request for assistance from the impasses panel on july.during the same month,pass filed a series of formal requests for assistance from the panel when its efforts to negotiate with the faa on behalf of four bargaining units,representing approximately faa employees,had similarly stalled.
on september,the faa responded by filing an objection to the fsip jurisdiction.based on its interpretation of the provisions of the faa act,the faa argued that the unions requests for assistance should be denied,because congress had decreed that disputes between the faa and its unions concerning changes to the personnel management system should be directed,first,to the federal mediation and conciliation service,and then,if agreement can not be reached,to congress.the fsip had no role to play,according to the faa.in this case,the federal mediation and conciliation service procedure had been exhausted,so the proper remedy,the faa argued,was for the faa to make the required submission to congress.
the unions replied in turn that the faa construction of the faa act was wrong.the crux of the unions argument before the panel was that a governs procedures for negotiating changes to the personnel management system and that subsection a has no application in the context of recurring collective bargaining between the faa and its unionized employees.and,further,according to the unions,g expressly confirms that chapter,which governs relations,applies to collective bargaining disputes between the faa and unions representing agency employees.
on january,the panel issued its decisions.in each case,the panel explained that a fter due consideration of the request for assistance the panel in accordance with its regulations,a,declines to assert jurisdiction because it is unclear whether the panel has the authority to resolve the parties impasse.department of transportation,federal aviation administration,washington,dc and natca,case fsip at,reprinted in natca decision department of transportation,federal aviation administration,washington,dc and pass,case fsip,and at,reprinted in pass decision.the panel found that the faa ha d raised arguable questions concerning whether the panel has the authority to resolve collective bargaining disputes over the compensation and benefits of faa employees.natca decision at,reprinted in pass decision at,reprinted in.the panel thus concluded that the various statutory provisions subject to conflicting interpretations must be addressed in an appropriate forum before the panel commits its resources to assist the parties in resolving the merits of their impasse.natca decision at,reprinted in emphasis added accord pass decision at,reprinted in.the panel assured the parties that its determination would not prejudice any party right to file another request for assistance should an appropriate forum determine that the fsip indeed continues to have jurisdiction over collective bargaining disputes between the faa and the unions over compensation and benefits.id.the fsip letter to pass added that its determination was neither an explicit nor implicit endorsement of the faa statutory interpretation.see pass decision at,reprinted in.
on january,the unions filed suit against the fsip and the authority in the district court.the unions sought a declaration that the panel decisions violated its mandatory statutory duties under and thereby deprived natca,pass,and the affected faa employees of their statutory rights.see air traffic controllers ass fed.serv.impasses panel,ca,wl,at.the unions also sought an order directing the panel to provide assistance in resolving the unions impasses with the faa.apparently,that same day,in accordance with the procedures set forth in a,the faa submitted to congress its final bargaining proposals for the units,together with a statement that it intended to impose the agency proposed changes sixty days following the transmittal.
on february,the district court granted summary judgment to the fsip and the flra,holding that it lacked jurisdiction under leedom to entertain the unions complaints.the unions filed a timely notice of appeal on march.on june,the faa notified natca that it intended to implement the terms and conditions of employment that the agency had submitted to congress.subsequent developments indicate that the dispute between natca and the faa is now moot.the parties agree,however,that the dispute between pass and the faa is not moot,because bargaining between pass and the faa remains at an impasse,just where it was in.
ii.analysis 
an order of the fsip is not reviewable except in extraordinary circumstances,because congress precluded direct judicial review of panel orders.brewer,at.the unions argue that this case presents an extraordinary circumstance,because the fsip had a mandatory statutory duty under c to assist the unions and the faa in resolving their collective bargaining impasses.the unions also contend that there is nothing in the faa act or in the faa personnel management system that divests the panel of this mandatory statutory duty,so the panel refusal to address the parties bargaining impasses was a flagrant abdication of its statutory duty.thus,according to the unions,the district court plainly erred in declining to exercise jurisdiction under leedom.appellees respond that leedom jurisdiction is not available in the instant case,because the panel determination not to assert jurisdiction was not a violation of a clear and mandatory statutory provision,and because the unions can seek redress from the flra for any alleged wrongdoing in this case.
ultimately,this case turns on the scope of leedom jurisdiction.in leedom,the relevant statute provided that the national labor relations board board shall not decide that any unit is appropriate for collective bargaining purposes if such unit includes both professional employees and employees who are not professional employees unless a majority of such professional employees vote for inclusion in such unit.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the statute was,thus,clear and mandatory with respect to the board obligations.id.at.the board nonetheless refused to allow professional employees to vote before certifying a bargaining unit that combined professional and nonprofessional employees.it was therefore clear that the board had attempted to exercise power that had been specifically withheld.id.at.under these circumstances,the court held that the federal dist
