duarte witting,doing business as nader nader,appeals from the trial court denial of its petition for a writ of administrative mandamus seeking to compel new motor vehicle board the board to hold an evidentiary hearing on the merits of a termination of nader plymouth franchise by real party in interest daimlerchrysler motors corporation daimlerchrysler,pursuant to vehicle code section et.undesignated statutory references are to the vehicle code.the reason for the termination of the plymouth franchise was daimlerchrysler discontinuation of the plymouth line.the board granted daimlerchrysler motion to dismiss nader protest to the termination,on the ground that the board could not require daimlerchrysler to continue producing plymouths and lacked authority to grant any remedy where termination was due to discontinuation of the product rather than dissatisfaction with the dealer performance.nader contends the board does not have statutory authority to grant a dismissal motion and must conduct an evidentiary hearing on good cause factors for termination,whether nader performed its obligations under the franchise agreement.we shall conclude the board has implied authority to dismiss a protest where,as in this case,the undisputed facts show good cause for termination of a franchise.we shall therefore affirm the trial court judgment denying the petition for writ of administrative mandamus.
factual and procedural background 
at all relevant times,daimlerchrysler was a manufacturer of several of new motor vehicles,including chrysler,plymouth,dodge,and jeep.nader was a new motor vehicle dealer in martinez which had franchise agreements with daimlerchrysler,authorizing nader to sell and service chrysler and plymouth vehicles.
daimlerchrysler issued a news release in november announcing the intent to phase out the plymouth brand at the end of the model year and to strengthen the chrysler brand,while continuing to meet its warranty obligations on existing plymouths.
on september,daimlerchrysler sent written notice to all plymouth dealers,including nader,giving notice that daimlerchrysler will discontinue the plymouth line make at the end of the model year,and its plymouth franchise agreements would terminate effective september,over a year after the date of the notice.daimlerchrysler also sent notice to all its plymouth dealers in california advising the dealers they could protest to the board under california law,though daimlerchrysler further stated it does not acknowledge that this provision applies to the discontinuation of the plymouth line make and is not waiving any of its rights.
we note there has been no attempt by daimlerchrysler to terminate nader chrysler franchise only nader plymouth franchise is at issue.moreover,nader does not dispute daimlerchrysler commitment to continue to meet its service obligations on existing plymouths.
nader filed a protest with the board pursuant to sections and which prohibit involuntary termination of a dealership without good cause,asking the board to order daimlerchrysler not to terminate nader plymouth franchise or replace it with an equally valuable franchise.
daimlerchrysler filed a motion to dismiss the protest,asserting its contract with nader allowed for termination upon discontinuation of the plymouth line,the board had no jurisdiction over a franchise termination caused by a manufacturer discontinuation of an entire of vehicle,or alternatively,such discontinuation constituted good cause for franchise termination as a matter of law.
nader filed an opposition to the dismissal motion,arguing it was entitled to a hearing on the merits of whether there was good cause for termination of the franchise.nader argued among other things that it incurred substantial cost to acquire the dealership in march and remodel it,and would not have done so had daimlerchrysler communicated its impending decision to discontinue the plymouth line.nader also argued daimlerchrysler was not really exiting the market but was repackaging its plymouth vehicles under other brand names,to the disadvantage of dealers such as nader that would be left with dealerships,and therefore nader should be given a franchise for such other brands.nader complained daimlerchrysler issued a letter of intention to award a jeep franchise to nader to replace the loss of the plymouth line,but when existing jeep dealers in the same market area protested as authorized by statute,daimlerchrysler withdrew the offer rather than fight the protests on nader behalf resulting in withdrawal of the competitors protests.nader argued that without a second brand,it would suffer an unfair competitive disadvantage in comparison to its competitors.nader asked the board to order daimlerchrysler to issue a jeep franchise.
following a hearing before an administrative law judge alj,the alj in may prepared a proposed ruling on motion to dismiss,in which the alj proposed dismissing nader protest for lack of jurisdiction,because the statutory scheme requiring good cause for termination was not intended to apply to terminations due to discontinuation of the product line,and the board had no power to grant any relief to nader.
after consideration of the alj proposal,the board rejected the proposed ruling and instead issued its own ruling on motion to dismiss,concluding the board did have subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute but lacked authority to grant any remedy where the termination was due to discontinuation of the product line,and therefore the protest was dismissed.the board could not order daimlerchrysler to keep making plymouths.the board could not,in this termination proceeding,order daimlerchrysler to give nader a jeep franchise,because that would implicate rights of third parties who were not parties to this proceeding,existing jeep dealers in the area.to the extent nader alleged daimlerchrysler allowed nader to spend money remodeling the dealership despite daimlerchrysler knowledge it would soon discontinue the plymouth line,the board had no authority to award damages,even assuming such allegations could be considered in a termination proceeding.the board noted some of these allegations may give nader grounds for relief in a civil lawsuit filed in court.
the board ruling also stated,there is no contention by nader that the plymouth will not cease to exist.the board acknowledged nader argument that it should get a dodge or jeep franchise because some plymouth vehicles may be renamed dodge or jeep,but the board said this proceeding could not be used to circumvent the rights of existing dealers to protest new franchises,nor was this proceeding the proper vehicle to seek such relief.
the board concluded,even though the board has subject matter jurisdiction over the protest,it has no authority to grant any remedy requested in the protest which would provide relief to nader,since it has no power to order the manufacturer to remain in business or to continue manufacturing any particular,nor can it order the issuance of a new franchise in violation of the rights of,nor does it have the power to award damages.
the board accordingly dismissed nader protest,but without prejudice because it is possible for nader to file a protest containing a request for relief within the board jurisdiction.
in june,nader filed in the trial court a petition for writ of administrative mandamus,asserting the board ruling was invalid because the board acted in excess of its jurisdiction by granting a motion to dismiss without specific statutory authority to grant a motion to dismiss the board abused its discretion by failing to proceed in a manner required by law,in that it denied nader a hearing on the merits of its protest the board abused its discretion in that the ruling is unsupported by the findings,specifically,the board found it had subject matter jurisdiction yet dismissed the protest and the board abused its discretion by making inconsistent findings that it could not grant any relief,while dismissing the protest without prejudice because it was possible for nader to file a protest requesting relief within the board jurisdiction.nader asked the trial court to order the board to hold an evidentiary hearing on the merits of nader protest.
following a hearing,the trial court in november issued a judgment denying nader petition for writ of administrative mandamus.

because an automobile franchise is not a fundamental vested right,a trial court reviews a decision of the board using the substantial evidence test.automotive management group,new motor vehicle bd.th,d.however,when the trial court bases its decision on undisputed facts,as in the instant case,the conclusion is a question of law,which the appellate court reviews de novo.foster snyder th,d bunnett regents of university of california th,d.
ii.the statutory scheme 
section provides in part 
a notwithstanding section of the business and professions code or the terms of any franchise,no franchisor shall terminate or refuse to continue any existing franchise unless all of the following conditions are met 
the franchisee and the board have received written notice from the franchisor as specified.
except as provided in section stipulated decisions,the board finds that there is good cause for termination or refusal to continue,following a hearing called pursuant to section.the franchisee may file a protest with the board within specified time periods.when a protest is filed,the board shall advise the franchisor that a timely protest has been filed,that a hearing is required pursuant to section,and that the franchisor may not terminate or refuse to continue until the board makes its findings 
section provides in part that t he board,or a hearing officer designated by the board,shall hear and consider the oral and documented evidence introduced by the parties and other interested individuals and groups,and the board shall make its decision solely on the record so made 
in any hearing on a protest filed pursuant to section or,the franchisor shall have the burden of proof to establish that there is good cause to terminate,or refuse to continue a franchise.
good cause for termination is addressed in section which lists various factors to be considered but expressly states the listed factors are not exclusive,and the board shall take into consideration the existing circumstances.
where the matter is heard by a hearing officer,the hearing officer submits a proposed decision to the board,subd.b.the board issues a written decision containing findings of fact and a determination of the issues presented.the decision shall sustain,conditionally sustain,overrule,or conditionally overrule the protest,subd.a.
either party may seek judicial review of final decisions of the board.
additionally,notwithstanding the board power to hear and decide protests,the courts have jurisdiction over all common law and statutory claims originally cognizable in the courts.for those claims,a party may initiate an action directly in any court of competent jurisdiction,subd.e.
iii.implied authority to dismiss protest 
as noted by nader,the board did not have express statutory authority to dismiss the protest.section authorizes the board to h ear and decide a protest.we note section,subdivision a,states the board decision shall sustain,conditionally sustain,overrule,or conditionally overrule the protest.section does not mention dismissal.
nader contends that,since the board does not have express statutory authority to grant a motion to dismiss a protest,its grant of the dismissal motion was an act done in excess of jurisdiction.nader cites case law purportedly holding that,once an administrative action is filed,an administrative agency can grant summary disposition only if authorized by statute or if the statutes demonstrate a clear intent that summary disposition is authorized.however,nader fails to show how the cited cases support its position.stewart county of san mateo d,said a county ordinance which expressly provided for a hearing after the sheriff revoked a private patrol operator license,could not be construed as allowing a hearing before the sheriff acted.id.at.the ordinance thus allowed a summary suspension subject to later review.id.at.the other case cited by nader,hough mccarthy cal d,found no due process problem with a summary procedure whereby the department of motor vehicles could suspend or revoke a driver license without a hearing,upon the driver conviction of drunk driving.nader fails to explain how either of these cases stands for the proposition that an administrative agency can grant summary disposition only if authorized by statute.id.at.
we shall conclude the board did not act in excess of jurisdiction,because it had implied authority to dismiss the protest.
the board is a administrative agency of limited jurisdiction.hardin oldsmobile new motor vehicle bd.th,d board did not have jurisdiction over car dealer claim that manufacturer accepted bribes in exchange for favors concerning vehicle allocation and new dealership awards.
administrative agencies only have the power conferred upon them by statute and an act in excess of these powers is void.citations.however,an agency powers are not limited to those expressly granted in the legislation rather,i t is well settled in this state that administrative officials may exercise such additional powers as are necessary for the due and efficient administration of powers expressly granted by statute,or as may fairly be implied from the statute granting the powers.citations.rich vision centers,board of medical examiners d,cited with approval in calfarm ins.deukmejian cal d,insurance commissioner had implied power to grant interim relief from plainly invalid rates.
rich vision centers,supra,d,said no statute expressly authorized the board of medical examiners to settle licensing disputes with medical professionals,and the court therefore had to decide whether the ability to negotiate settlement of disputes may be implied from the overall statutory scheme,in light of the purpose of the agency.id.at.the appellate court concluded that b ecause settlement is administratively efficient and furthered the purpose for which the board was created,the board had the implied power to settle licensing disputes.id.at.
similarly,in frankel board of dental examiners th,d,we rejected a dentist attempt to set aside a disciplinary order which was based upon his assent to settlement of an accusation filed against him by the executive director of the board of dental examiners.id.at,d.we observed although no statute expressly authorizes the settlement of a dispute that has given rise to a disciplinary accusation,the statutory scheme has been interpreted to give administrative agencies such as the board the implied power to settle licensing disputes and to incorporate the settlement into a formal board decision.citation.provided they do not include conditions that violate public policy,settlements are administratively efficient,further the purpose for which the board was created,and are consistent with the general policy of favoring compromises of contested rights.citation.id.at,d,citing rich vision centers,supra,d.
a dismissal by the new motor vehicle board was upheld in automotive management group,new motor vehicle,supra,th,d.there,the manufacturer moved to dismiss a dealer protest as untimely,and the dealer retorted the manufacturer should be estopped from invoking the time requirements.the alj held an evidentiary hearing on the dismissal motion.on appeal,the dealer argued the dismissal procedure was improper because there was no provision in the administrative procedure act for a motion to dismiss.id.at,d.the appellate court rejected the dealer argument,stating 
a proceeding before an administrative officer or board is adequate if the basic requirements of notice and opportunity for hearing are met.citation.the sufficiency of the notice and hearing is determined by considering the purpose of the procedure,its effect on the rights asserted,and other circumstances.citation.although the dealer argues that the board should have accepted the petition for filing,and then adjudicated the merits of the timeliness issue,we believe that permitting the alj to hear the issue as a motion to dismiss was fair.a hearing was held.the dealer was permitted to introduce evidence.four witnesses testified.exhibits were introduced.thus,it seems quite clear that the dealer was afforded an opportunity to be heard consistent with the requirements of due process.
in addition,a motion to dismiss was utilized in british motor car distributors,new motor vehicle bd.d.in that case,maserati terminated the british motors franchise.over one year later,british motors protested the termination.maserati then filed a motion to dismiss the protest on the grounds that it was untimely.the motion was denied by the board.citation.although british motor car distributors,supra,did not analyze the propriety of the motion to dismiss procedure,it is noteworthy that the procedure was employed in that case,and that its propriety was never questioned by the appellate court or the parties.automotive management group,supra,th,d.
although the foregoing cases involved different kinds of dismissal that are not at issue in this case,we shall conclude the purpose of the board and the goal of administrative efficiency support a conclusion that the board has implied authority to dismiss a protest where the undisputed facts demonstrate good cause for franchise termination as a matter of law and afford no basis for preventing termination of the franchise.the procedure in this case was analogous to a summary judgment motion where the franchisor established good cause for termination as a matter of law,and the undisputed facts gave nader no viable basis to prevent termination of the franchise.in this circumstance,there would be no point to conducting an evidentiary hearing on issues of whether the dealer was performing its obligations under the franchise agreement.such an evidentiary hearing would simply entail the wasteful expenditure of public funds.
the purpose of the board is reflected in an uncodified provision of a legislative amendment to the statute creating the board,which stated the legislature finds and declares that the distribution and sale of new motor vehicles in the state of california vitally affects the general economy of the state and the public welfare and that in order to promote the public welfare and in the exercise of its police power,it is necessary to regulate and to license vehicle dealers,manufacturers,manufacturer branches,distributors,distributor branches,and representatives of vehicle manufacturers and distributors doing business in california in order to avoid undue control of the independent new motor vehicle dealer by the vehicle manufacturer or distributor and to insure that dealers fulfill their obligations under their franchises and provide adequate and sufficient service to consumers generally.stats,ch.
dismissal of a protest in the circumstances of this case furthers the goal of administrative efficiency and is consistent with the board purpose.thus,where it is undisputed that a franchisor is discontinuing manufacture of the product and the franchise agreement allows for termination upon such discontinuation,good cause for termination of the franchise exists as a matter of law.the board has no power to conclude otherwise,nor does the board have the power to award damages or grant the other relief sought by nader,such as award of a new jeep franchise to compensate for termination of the plymouth franchise.hardin oldsmobile new motor vehicle,supra,th,d board lacks statutory authority to award damages.although the board may impose conditions on termination of a franchise,a ny conditions imposed by the board shall be for the purpose of assuring performance of binding contractual agreements between franchisees and franchisors or otherwise serving the purposes of this article,subd.a.nader does not demonstrate how this statute could apply to its case.in a footnote,nader suggests the board could have found a binding contractual agreement for daimlerchrysler to award a new jeep franchise to nader,and could have structur ed the condition in such a way that the establishment is conditioned upon unsuccessful protests of the competing dealers.however,it appears nader is suggesting the board could place a condition on the relief the award of a new jeep franchise,whereas the statute only allows the board to place a condition on termination of the existing franchise and therefore assumes the board has the power to prevent termination of the existing franchise in the event the condition is not met.nader also suggests in the same footnote that the board could have conditioned termination upon daimlerchrysler continuing to provide warranty service for existing plymouth customers.however,nader did not seek such a condition in the administrative proceedings,nor has nader disputed daimlerchrysler stated intent to continue performing its warranty obligations.
if nader has claims for damages or other relief,it may pursue those claims in court under section,subdivision e but it can not administratively halt the termination of the franchise.
nader suggests implied authority to dismiss is inconsistent with the board regulations,in that title,california code of regulations,section,provides a a document which purports to be a protest pursuant to section or which is received at the offices of the board shall not be filed until the secretary has reviewed it for compliance with the board enabling statutes and title,subchapter of the california code of regulations.if the secretary deems the document to comply,said document shall be filed.the secretary may reject any document that does not comply with the board enabling statutes and title,subchapter of the california code of regulations nader argues that since his protest was filed and assigned a protest number,the board was required to give him an evidentiary hearing on the factors listed in section.we disagree.the cited regulation speaks only to the filing of a protest and not to its dismissal once filed.
we also disagree with daimlerchrysler view that this regulation supports the board action,because title,california code of regulations,section,subdivision c,says,the secretary may,for good cause shown,accept for filing any papers that do not comply with the board enabling statutes and title,subchapter of the california code of regulations.good cause issues and challenges to the secretary compliance determinations may be resolved by law and motion proceedings before a hearing officer.italics added.this provision is similarly limited to acceptance of protests for filing it does not address disposition of protests after they have been filed.
though not cited by the parties,we note that in frost state personnel board d.frost,we held that in a contested case before an administrative agency,motions in the nature of demurrers to evidence or motions for nonsuit,based on want of evidence to make a prima facie case,may not be entertained and passed on to agency boards,at least in proceedings where a hearing officer alone takes the evidence.in frost,a state highway patrol employee complained of board action denying him a salary raise and downgrading his position.id.at.after the employee presented his case to an alj,the alj submitted to the board a proposed decision to grant a defense dismissal motion on the ground that the employee failed to establish a right to relief by the weight of the evidence.id.at.the trial court issued a writ of mandamus requiring the board to hold further hearings and decide the case on the merits.id.at.we affirmed,concluding the employee had made a prima facie showing in support of his claim,and therefore the procedural error in entertaining and granting the dismissal motion at the close of the employee evidence was prejudicial.id.at.with respect to the procedural error in entertaining and granting a dismissal motion in the nature of a nonsuit,we said,in view of the underlying purpose of the code for administrative procedure which is the expeditious and fair handling of adversary cases before the agencies,in view of the lack of legal training on the part of boards generally,in view of the difficulty of convening boards for the special and limited purpose of passing on such motions,in view of the lack of any prescribed procedure by which such motions
