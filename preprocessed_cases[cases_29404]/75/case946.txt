before the terrorist attacks of september,commercial airlines exercised responsibility for screening passengers and property at airports.shortly after the attacks,congress passed the aviation and transportation security act atsa,stat,establishing the transportation security administration tsa and entrusting it with the primary responsibility for civil aviation security.we deal here with several airlines arguments that tsa has erroneously overcharged them for their statutory portion of these security costs.
the atsa authorizes tsa to impose two types of fees to fund its security services.the first,which is not at issue here,is a fee on airline passengers.a.the second type of to as the aviation and security infrastructure fee asif,b is imposed directly on airlines.it is meant to plug the gap between the costs of tsa civil aviation security services and the sums raised by the passenger fee,but it is subject to two important limits.a a.group of claiming that tsa improperly subjected them to approximately million a year in increased asif liabilities.
atsa two limits on fees are its overall and its limits.under the overall limit,the fees in each fiscal year may not exceed,in the aggregate,the amounts paid in calendar year by carriers for screening passengers and property,as determined by the under secretary.a b i.under the limit,the fees collected from a carrier for fiscal years,and may not exceed the amount paid in calendar year by that carrier for screening passengers and property,as determined by the under secretary.a b ii emphasis added.starting with fiscal year,the act allows the under secretary to determine the limit on the basis of market share or any other appropriate measure in lieu of actual screening costs in calendar year.a b iii.
in its implementing regulations,tsa required every covered carrier to submit a to as appendix a detailing its passenger and screening costs for the year.d.it also required carriers to provide an audit of their reported costs.id.for the years,tsa generally set each carrier annual fee at the level of costs listed in the carrier appendix 
in,with the department of homeland security appropriations act,stat.the dhs appropriations act,congress intervened to make sure that tsa was collecting its full entitlement under atsa.it directed the government accountability office gao to review the airlines cost information for the year.and it stated that,beginning with amounts due in the year,if the result of this review is that an air carrier or foreign air carrier has not paid the appropriate fee to the transportation security administration,the secretary of homeland security shall undertake all necessary actions to ensure that such amounts are collected.id.
the gao report concluded that the airlines had collectively their security screening costs in the year by an estimated million.united states government accountability office,aviation fees review of air carriers year passenger and property screening costs.
relying in part on the gao analysis,tsa determined that each of petitioners had its year screening costs.it began by calculating the industry average cost per passenger screened.it then compared that average with each airline reported cost per passenger screened.for those airlines whose reported costs were at or above the industry average,it assessed no additional liability.it also gave a pass to airlines whose reported costs were below the industry average,but that had presented an adequate audit of their reporting costs.
when tsa it did for all of the an airline reported costs and did not provide an adequate audit,tsa presumed that its screening costs per passenger in the year were equal to the industry average.it then calculated the airline total screening costs for by multiplying the industry average by the number of passengers that airline screened in.finally it estimated each airline additional asif liability by subtracting its reported year costs from the new figure.
tsa director of revenue sent each petitioner a letter describing this method and advising the petitioner of its additional liability.petitioners appealed to tsa,which upheld the initial decisions in all relevant respects.
in their joint brief,petitioners challenge tsa final decisions,claiming that they reflected substantive statutory violations,were arbitrary and capricious,and were flawed procedurally.we find merit in the attack on tsa understanding of the atsa overall limit,but not in the other objections.
in addition,three of the petitioners advance individual claims,one of which that of spirit airlines spirit prevails.
before reaching the merits,we need to address the effect of two atsa provisions for.the original atsa provided that d eterminations of the under secretary under this subparagraph,a b,stating the limitations on air carrier fees are not subject to judicial review,stat.in the consolidated appropriations act,stat.december,congress relaxed this restriction,creating an exception for estimates and additional collections made pursuant to the appropriation for aviation security in public law,collections made pursuant to the dhs appropriations act provided that such judicial review shall be limited only to additional amounts collected by the secretary before october.a b iv.as the collections here within the scope of the provision were made pursuant to the directive of the dhs appropriations act,and all the issues apply in part to amounts collected by tsa before october,we have jurisdiction over all issues that petitioners pose.because some of the issues fall outside the basic clause,we will note to each issue on which petitioners our judgment applies to collections on or after october.
overall limit.the atsa overall limit provides that the fees in each fiscal year may not exceed,in the aggregate,the amounts paid in calendar year by carriers for screening passengers and property.a b i emphasis added.petitioners argue that tsa violated the plain language of the provision by basing its calculation of the fees on a gao estimate which had included the costs of screening,such as and sightseers.tsa acknowledges inclusion of the costs of screening such individuals,but seeks to justify doing so.its arguments do not convince us.
tsa argues that the reference to screening passengers is ambiguous,that the word screening may mean something more than the simple evaluation of whether a passenger poses a threat to aviation security.to screen may also mean to protect.the mother screened her child from the pounding hailstones.therefore tsa suggests,the phrase screening passengers can be read to include anything done to protect passengers,which of course would include exerting control over the access of potentially dangerous.but a mbiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context.brown gardner,d.in the context of airport security,the phrase screening passengers has a widely understood meaning it refers to the process of searching airline passengers at an airport security checkpoint,not to the entire set of activities undertaken to promote passenger safety.
tsa also notes that the statute refers not merely to screening passengers,but also to screening property.true enough and the statute does not limit the relevant property to that of passengers.thus,tsa could include the costs of screening the property of in its calculation.but that authority provides it no justification for also including the costs of screening the themselves.
tsa also asserts an equally unpersuasive argument from statutory purpose.it asserts that congress did not intend to bestow a windfall on carriers by assuming the full burden of providing services that inured to the benefit of the industry,and that had previously been provided at the industry expense.respondent br.at.the argument might conceivably trump the statutory language if it accorded with the facts,but it does.as petitioners observe,sightseers and have been barred from secure airport areas since the september attacks and,therefore,are not screened by tsa.petitioners reply br.at.tsa interpretation serves no purpose.
finally,tsa argues that petitioners interpretation is inconsistent with another part of the statute.it points to a,which directs tsa to provide for the screening of all passengers and property.tsa suggests that this provision must be interpreted to give it the power to screen all persons who enter controlled boarding areas it would be absurd to deny tsa power to screen.and if passengers and property includes in a,tsa argues,the phrase should have the same meaning in a b i.supporting tsa theory is the standard presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.sorenson sec y of treasury,d quoting helvering stockholms enskilda bank.but this presumption is not so strong as to displace the plain meaning of a statutory provision simply by virtue of the fact that interpreting a different provision the same way would or might be absurd.in addition,although the question of a meaning is not before us,we note that we are not convinced that it is the only possible source of tsa power to screen.see h authorizing tsa screening of all individuals before entry into a secured area of covered airports,including among sources of authority for certain airport screening activities.in short,tsa violated the plain meaning of the atsa overall limit when it included the costs of screening in its estimate of the costs of covered screening in.
this holding governs amounts collected before october,what of the effect of the provision on amounts collected thereafter our conclusion rests not on a review of a determination under the subparagraph covered by the provision,but rather resolves the question whether tsa has made the kind of determination required by the statute.we drew just this distinction in comsat fcc,which involved a provision precluding judicial review of increases or decreases in fees made by amendments pursuant to this paragraph.id.at quoting b.we read the clause to mean simply that the courts may not review the commission actions where the commission has acted within the scope of its authority under the controlling statute.id.at.so,too,here.therefore,the provision does not apply,and our holding on this point governs the collections made after.
limit.petitioners argument here is far less persuasive.they assert that the statutory limits each carrier asif to the amount it paid in calendar year for screening passengers and property,as determined by the under secretary,a b ii unconditionally precludes tsa use of the industry average as a proxy for petitioners cost per passenger screened.we see no such preclusion.
first,the statute amount paid language is qualified as determined by the under secretary.as roberts observed in chao,we have noted in the past the distinction between the objective existence of certain conditions and the secretary determination that such conditions are present,stressing that a statute phrased in the latter terms fairly exudes deference to the secretary.id.at roberts,concurring in part and dissenting in part quoting kreis sec y of air force.the atsa similarly gives tsa broad discretion to choose a suitable method for making the required determination.
here tsa choices were clearly permissible.although the airlines may prefer that tsa rely on their appendix a information,tsa was certainly entitled to conclude that,in the absence of an audit,such data were not reliable enough.tsa was also free to select a reasonable alternative,such as the industry average cost.that average by a logically chosen variable,the number of passengers screened by the carrier in the year fact constitutes a measurement of a specific carrier screening costs.
the dhs appropriations act called for gao review of the calendar year cost information for screening passengers and property pursuant to section a,stat.at emphasis added petitioners therefore reframe their argument to claim that the act requires the gao to examine the individual air carriers actual security costs,instead of using sampling data.petitioners br.at.the argument fails here,naturally,for the same reasons as it did in the context of a b itself.
starting with the fiscal year,of course,a b iii gives tsa even broader latitude,authorizing application of the limit by reference to market share or any other appropriate measure.for the collections at issue here,however,tsa has invoked this section.
finally,we note that the limit,like the overall limit,rests on an estimate of the costs of screening passengers and property.because tsa industry average included the costs of screening,that calculation was not a determination under a b,and must be corrected on remand.
claims that tsa acted arbitrarily and capriciously.petitioners first such argument is that tsa penalized them for not complying with its requirement of providing an unqualified audit opinion for their appendix requirement they say was impossible to fulfill.their records were inadequate to provide the required information without making significant assumptions,and thus their auditors would not provide unqualified opinions.
assuming arguendo that tsa was obligated to supply a feasible alternative before relying on an industry average,this argument still fails because tsa did in fact supply such an alternative.in response to the industry concerns,tsa announced that it would accept a qualified opinion if an auditor could not provide an unqualified one.but tsa stipulated that,as the qualified opinions would not supply adequate details and reasoning,a carrier relying on such an opinion would have to submit the auditor working papers rather than merely assuring their availability to tsa.see joint appendix.
petitioners do not claim that they complied with this alternative procedure.in their reply brief,however,they seem to argue that they could not have done so,on the grounds that an auditor working papers are its property,not theirs.petitioners reply br.at.it is not clear to us why an auditor property interest presumably a negotiable matter in any event would allow the airlines to make the papers available upon request,but not to submit them in the way outlined by tsa.in any event,petitioners waived the argument by failing to make it in their opening brief.carducci regan.
in petitioners second argument,they reformulate their contention that tsa misread the statute limit,now saying that it was arbitrary to use the industry average cost per passenger as a proxy for each petitioner cost.they also say that tsa wrongly ignored their appendix as and failed to give proper weight to their evidence that their screening costs were below the industry average.
assuming this argument is actually distinct from the statutory interpretation claim,it fares no better.given the technical character of the issue,tsa is entitled to a good deal of deference on its resolution.see,west virginia epa,milk train,veneman.here,the carriers own explanations as to why it was impossible for them to obtain unqualified audits completely undermine their position for carriers that did not collect adequate information on screening costs for,it was hardly arbitrary for tsa to rely on an industry average.
petitioners then object that the gao report on which tsa relied had allocated excessive amounts of airport law enforcement officer leo costs to passenger screening.the calculations,of course,were based on tsa mistaken decision to include the costs of screening it may be that the redo necessitated by our decision will occasion agreement between the parties on these subsidiary issues,or at least less disagreement.specifically,when an airport explicitly identified an leo charge as being for flexible response,gao,in reliance on its contractor,included of leo costs in screening when an airport allocated a portion of its leo budget to the terminal cost center,gao accepted its contractor decision to judgmentally apply of such costs to screening.see gao,contractor.
these allocations are hardly rock solid.but tsa was operating in a environment,as shown by petitioners own arguments about their data.tsa contractor interviewed airport officials,eliciting a wide range of statements about the actual role of leos.this is most certainly not a case where there is reason to believe that materially superior information cou
