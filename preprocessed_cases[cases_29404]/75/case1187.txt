introduction 
plaintiff mario castro castro a california resident,sustained physical injuries in a traffic collision in alabama allegedly caused by an overturned truck owned by defendant and respondent budget system,budget prior to the accident,budget had leased the truck that overturned to defendant carlos diaz,doing business as carlos diaz fresh produce diaz.at the time of the accident,diaz employee,defendant jose lopez lopez,was driving budget leased truck while allegedly intoxicated.
plaintiffs sued budget and others in california state court for negligence and lost consortium.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of budget on the grounds that alabama federal or california and that under alabama common law doctrine governing the permissive use of motor vehicles permissive user law,budget was not responsible for the negligence of either diaz or lopez.on appeal,plaintiffs contend that federal law or the common law nondelegable duty doctrine should apply,either of which would result in budget liability.they argue that at the time of the accident,budget qualified as a motor carrier under applicable federal law and as a consequence is financially responsible for their injuries.
we hold that in connection with the accident,budget was not a motor carrier as that term is defined in the relevant federal statutes,regulations,and case law and therefore is not liable under federal law or the common law nondelegable duty doctrine.as the trial court ruled,budget liability to plaintiffs is governed by alabama permissive user law that entitled budget to summary judgment.we therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.

procedural background 
plaintiffs first amended complaint included causes of action for motor vehicle negligence,general negligence,and negligence per se against budget.plaintiffs alleged that castro was injured in a traffic accident in alabama caused by budget.they further alleged that lopez was operating budget truck in the course and scope of his employment with diaz at the time of the accident,and that lopez was intoxicated when he lost control of the truck and overturned it in the middle of the roadway,blocking both lanes of traffic.according to plaintiffs,lopez negligent and reckless operation of his truck while intoxicated,and his subsequent abandonment thereof,created an condition which resulted in the unavoidable crash of castro truck and severe bodily injuries to castro.
budget filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that alabama law applied and that under alabama permissive user law,budget was not liable for the negligence of either diaz or lopez.plaintiffs opposed the motion,arguing that budget was a motor carrier subject to the federal statutes and regulations governing interstate motor transportation and therefore responsible for plaintiffs damages.in support of their opposition to the motion,plaintiffs filed the declaration of an expert who opined that budget was a motor carrier subject to federal regulation,including the regulatory provisions that require minimum insurance coverage of.
the trial court ruled that the federal statutes and regulations upon which plaintiffs relied did not apply to budget,that alabama law controlled the liability issue,and that budget was entitled to summary judgment.the trial court subsequently entered judgment in favor of budget and against plaintiffs.plaintiffs timely appealed.

budget was not a motor carrier 
plaintiffs contend that budget is a motor carrier subject to the control and responsibility requirements of federal law a c see transamerican freight lines,brada miller freight systems,d and is therefore liable for diaz negligent operation of budget truck.in support of this contention,plaintiffs rely on the federal statute and regulations that require motor carriers to maintain specified levels of financial responsibility in the form of insurance or,et.according to plaintiffs,budget,through,voluntarily complied with the minimum financial responsibility requirements under federal law,thereby demonstrating that budget is a motor carrier subject to those requirements.the issue therefore is whether budget,as a lessor of the vehicle involved in the accident,qualifies as a motor carrier in connection with that incident,so as to be subject to the federal control and responsibility requirements upon which plaintiffs rely.
during the first half of the twentieth century,interstate motor carriers attempted to immunize themselves from liability for negligent drivers by leasing trucks and nominally classifying the drivers who operated the trucks as independent contractors.citations.in order to protect the public from the tortious conduct of the often operators,congress in amended the interstate common carrier act to require interstate motor carriers to assume full direction and control of the vehicles that they leased as if they were the owners of such vehicles.citations.the purpose of the amendments to the act was to ensure that interstate motor carriers would be fully responsible for the maintenance and operation of the leased equipment and the supervision of the borrowed drivers,thereby protecting the public from accidents,preventing public confusion about who was financially responsible if accidents occurred,and providing financially responsible defendants.morris jtm materials,fn.omitted.the goal was to make lessees of trucks responsible for the negligent operation of those trucks,regardless of whether the lessees employed the drivers.the surface transportation board formerly the interstate commerce commission and the secretary of transportation enforce the united states government transportation policy with regard to transportation by motor carrier a,and the board has jurisdiction over the transportation of property by motor carrier between a place in one state and a place in another state.a.serna pettey leach trucking,th,d serna.
neither party disputes that motor carriers are required to comply with the provisions of title of the united states code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.johnson transport,cir.title of united states code section a requires motor carriers that use leased vehicles to have control of and be responsible for operating those motor vehicles in compliance with requirements prescribed by the secretary on safety of operations and equipment,and with other applicable law as if the motor vehicles were owned by the motor carrier.under code of federal regulations part c,the lease agreements covering such vehicles shall provide that the authorized carrier lessee shall have exclusive possession,control,and use of the equipment for the duration of the lease.the lease shall further provide that the authorized carrier lessee shall assume complete responsibility for the operation of the equipment for the duration of the lease.the control and responsibility requirements under federal law render lessee carriers vicariously liable,notwithstanding traditional principles of agency,for injuries sustained by third parties resulting from the negligence of the drivers of leased vehicles.johnson transport,supra,at.
title united states code section and the regulations promulgated under that provision prescribe the minimum levels of financial responsibility required to be maintained by motor carriers of property operating motor vehicles in interstate,foreign,or intrastate commerce.the financial responsibility provisions complement the control and responsibility requirements.the purpose of the regulations promulgated under section is to create additional incentives to motor carriers to maintain and operate their vehicles in a safe manner and to assure that motor carriers maintain an appropriate level of financial responsibility for motor vehicles operated on public highways.ibid.according to those regulations n o motor carrier shall operate a motor vehicle until the motor carrier has obtained and has in effect the minimum levels of financial responsibility as set forth in part of this subpart.a.
the financial responsibility regulations apply to i for hire motor carriers operating motor vehicles transporting property in interstate or foreign commerce a,italics added and ii motor carriers operating motor vehicles transporting hazardous materials,hazardous substances,or hazardous wastes in interstate,foreign,or intrastate commerce.b,italics added.under code of federal regulations part,motor carriers engaged in carriage are required to maintain liability insurance in the amount of for nonhazardous interstate or foreign commerce that has a gross vehicle weight rating of pounds or more.that section further provides that motor carriers engaged in either or private carriage involving the transportation of hazardous materials,hazardous substances,or hazardous waste are required to maintain higher levels of liability insurance.
title united states code section contains a series of definitions applicable to,inter alia,interstate motor carriers.section defines a motor private carrier as a person,other than a motor carrier,transporting property by commercial motor vehicle as defined in section when a the transportation is as provided in section of this title b the person is the owner,lessee,or bailee of the property being transported and c the property is being transported for sale,lease,rent,or bailment or to further a commercial enterprise.section defines motor carrier as a person providing commercial motor vehicle as defined in section transportation for compensation.
the financial responsibility regulations define motor carrier as a motor carrier or private motor carrier.the term includes,but is not limited to,a motor carrier agent,officer,or representative an employee responsible for hiring,supervising,training,assigning or dispatching a driver or an employee concerned with the installation,inspection,and maintenance of motor vehicle equipment accessories.although the financial responsibility regulations do not contain a specific definition of either a motor carrier or a private motor carrier,they define f carriage as the business of transporting,for compensation,the goods or property of another.ibid.
moreover,united states code section c the statute under which the financial responsibility regulations were the definition of motor private carrier contained in united states code section.that a provision in the financial responsibility statute and incorporates the definition of motor private carrier in united states code section suggests that the general definitions in section,including the definition of a motor carrier in subsection quoted above,are applicable to section and the financial responsibility regulations promulgated under it.
plaintiffs contend that budget,as the lessor of the truck that caused castro injuries,qualifies as a motor carrier under federal law,and is therefore financially responsible for their injuries.but the quoted code sections and regulations do not mention lessors in the various definitions of motor carrier,motor private carrier,or carriage.if congress or the dot had intended to extend to lessors of equipment including lessor owners the financial responsibility requirements imposed under title of the united states code,the code sections and regulations that define those requirements should contain some explicit reference to lessors that would cover vehicle leasing companies such as budget.the absence of any such reference in the applicable code sections and regulations supports the conclusion that they do not apply to lessors of vehicles.
notwithstanding the absence of any reference to lessors in the code sections and regulations upon which they rely,plaintiffs maintain that budget is a federally regulated motor carrier because it is in the business of leasing to others commercial vehicles that will be used to transport goods or property across state lines,and it is compensated for that activity.budget correctly counters that the mere act of leasing the truck to diaz did not qualify it as a motor carrier because it did not retain possession or control over the truck or otherwise operate the truck to transport goods.budget cites del real united states fire insurance crum forster d del real in support of its position.
in del real,supra,d,the plaintiffs,relatives of the victim of a fatal traffic collision,obtained a state court judgment against the owner of the truck involved in the collision.at the time of the accident,the truck was pulling a trailer that the truck owner had leased from strick leasing.id.at.in a separate insurance coverage action in federal court,the plaintiffs attempted to recover the unsatisfied amount of the state court judgment from strick leasing insurer.id.at.the plaintiffs argued that by leasing the trailer to the truck owner,strick leasing was a motor carrier subject to the financial responsibility requirements of title of the united states code,including the requirement that it procure an endorsement to cover injuries that arise in the operation,maintenance,or use of motor vehicles subject to the financial responsibility requirements.id.at.
the court in del real,supra,d,rejected the plaintiffs contention that strick leasing,as lessor of the trailer,was a motor carrier as that term is defined in the regulations promulgated under united states code section.according to the court in del real,strick leasing was an equipment lessor of trailers,and not a motor carrier.id.at.therefore,the court concluded that the leased trailer was not subject to the financial responsibility requirements of the motor vehicle act.ibid.
plaintiffs contend that del real,supra,d,is distinguishable from this case because here budget was using a lease arrangement with diaz to disguise that it qualified as a motor carrier under federal law and to avoid the financial responsibility requirements imposed under that law.the undisputed facts in the instant case,however,do not fit the typical situation in which a lease arrangement is used to disguise the provision of transportation services in an attempt to avoid the application of the safety and financial responsibility requirements of federal law these facts show that there was a lease agreement between the parties,nothing more.there are no facts showing that agreement was not legitimate and not entered into in good faith,or that budget was trying to evade the letter or spirit of the law.there is nothing about the straightforward lease agreement that suggests or implies that budget was engaging in the transportation of goods or property for compensation.on this record,budget was not a motor carrier within the meaning of the cited federal statutes and regulations.
plaintiffs emphasize that in certain documents filed with the dot,budget identified itself as an interstate carrier engaged in the business of transporting general freight and household goods.therefore,according to plaintiffs,there is a triable issue of fact concerning whether budget was acting as a motor carrier in connection with diaz lease of the truck from budget.
plaintiffs evidence arguably may raise a triable issue of fact as to whether,as a general matter,budget was a registered carrier authorized to transport goods or property interstate for compensation.that evidence,however,does not address the issue in this budget was acting as a motor carrier in connection with the accident in question.as we have concluded,budget was not a motor carrier in connection with the accident because budget lease transaction did not constitute the business of transporting goods for hire.it was not hired to transport the load of produce being shipped by diaz,did not dispatch or employ lopez to deliver the produce,and was not transporting the produce itself as a private carrier.in connection with the vehicle lease in question,budget was not a motor carrier under federal law,and therefore federal law does not render it liable to plaintiffs.
nondelegable duty doctrine 
under california nondelegable duty doctrine,a carrier who undertakes an activity which can be lawfully carried on only under a public franchise or authority and which involves possible danger to the public is liable to a third person for harm caused by the negligence of the carrier independent contractor.serna,supra,th at,d.plaintiffs contend that budget was conducting business under a federal franchise as a motor carrier,and,under the nondelegable duty doctrine,budget is responsible for diaz negligence regardless of alabama permissive user law.
in support of their nondelegable duty argument,plaintiffs rely primarily on serna supra,th,d in that case,the defendant,a carrier subject to federal regulation,entered into a contract with a georgia poultry company for the defendant to arrange transportation to california of a load of frozen poultry.id.at,d.the defendant then arranged for another company to pick up the load of poultry and transport it to california,using that company truck and driver.ibid.after entering california,the truck collided with a motorcycle,killing the motorcycle driver.ibid.the victim wife and children sued the defendant,contending the defendant was vicariously liable for the truck driver negligence.ibid.
the trial court in serna,supra,th,d,granted a nonsuit in favor of the defendant,ruling that the defendant was not vicariously liable for the truck driver negligence.id.at,d.the trial court concluded that the type of goods being shipped exempted the defendant carrier from federal regulations and permit requirements.the court of appeal reversed,holding that a carrier that undertakes an activity that can be lawfully carried on only under a public franchise or authority and that involves possible danger to the public is liable to third parties who are injured by the carrier subcontractor.id.at,d.according to the court in serna,w ere the rule otherwise,a carrier could escape liability for the negligence of its independent contractors,thus reducing the incentive for careful supervision and depriving those who are injured of the financial responsibility of those to whom the privilege was granted.for these reasons,the carrier duties are nondelegable,and it is only when the carrier is not regulated at all that the rule is otherwise.ibid.in reaching its conclusion that the carrier was liable,the court in serna rejected the argument that the carrier was not regulated,holding that although the cargo was exempt from economic regulation,the carrier was not exempt from federal safety and financial regulation.ibid.
the rule stated in serna,supra,th,d,has no application to the facts here.the serna case presented the paradigm in which a shipper contracts with a carrier operating under a franchise to transport the shipper goods interstate,and the carrier arranges for a subcontractor to perform the transportation services on the carrier behalf.under the nondelegable duty doctrine discussed above,the carrier is treated in such cases as if it owned the truck and employed the driver for purposes of determining the carrier liability for the negligence of the subcontractor.
here,it is undisputed that budget did not contract with anyone to transport the produce that was being hauled by lopez at the time of the accident.nor did budget subcontract with diaz to perform transportation services on budget behalf.budget leased the truck to diaz under a lease agreement,and diaz performed the transportation of goods using an employee,lopez.in leasing the truck to diaz,budget did not engage in an activity that could lawfully be carried out only under a public franchise or authority.moreover,budget did not engage in an activity that was potentially dangerous to the public,as was the defendant transportation of goods across state lines in serna,supra,th,d.instead,as discussed above,budget business lease activity in this case was not regulated under the federal statutes and regulations upon which plaintiffs rely because budget was not acting as a motor carrier,and therefore was not subject to the financial responsibility requirements governing such carriers.thus,unlike the situation in serna,which turned on the question of exempt goods,here the business activity itself is not subject to the federal regulations in issue.as a result,budget had no duty under the common law nondelegable duty doctrine to assume financial responsibility for diaz negligence.
d.the applicable state law 
budget contends that because federal law does not govern the issue of its responsibility for castro injuries,the state law of either alabama or california governing the liability of vehicle owners for the negligence of permissive users should control the liability issue.because plaintiffs argue that either federal law or the common law nondelegable duty doctrine controls,they do not address the issue of whether the permissive user rules of alabama or california should apply 
as discussed above,the federal law upon which plaintiffs rely does not apply to the facts of this case.we therefore agree with budget that either alabama or california law should be applied to the issue of budget liability to plaintiffs.under the undisputed facts of this case,and as the trial court correctly ruled,alabama permissive user law controls that issue and entitles budget to a judgment in its favor as a matter of law.
past decisions establish that in analyzing a issue,california courts apply the governmental interest analysis,un
