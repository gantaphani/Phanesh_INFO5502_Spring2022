in the early,a number of federal judicial decisions invalidated a substantial portion of the iwc wage orders on the ground that the limited application of such orders to women workers and children violated the prohibition on sex discrimination embodied in title vii of the federal civil rights act of.citations.in response to these federal decisions,the california legislature in and amended the applicable provisions of the labor code to authorize the iwc to establish minimum wages,maximum hours and standard conditions of employment for all employees in the state,men as well as women.citations.the constitutionality of this legislative expansion of the iwc jurisdiction to all california workers is explicitly confirmed by article xiv section of the california constitution industrial welfare com.superior court,supra,cal d,see also bell farmers ins.exchange th,d.
the expansion of its jurisdiction in the did not alter the basic nature of the iwc authority industrial welfare com.superior court,supra,cal d.as noted by our high court,judicial authorities have repeatedly emphasized that in fulfilling its broad statutory mandate,the iwc engages in a endeavor,a task which necessarily and properly requires the commission exercise of a considerable degree of judgment and discretion.id.at.in the exercise of this power,the iwc has promulgated wage orders,following a similar format,which each apply to separate industries or occupations.see morillion royal packing cal th,d,tit,et wage order applies to the transportation industry.see,tit.
wage order,the first wage order promulgated for the transportation industry under the iwc present jurisdiction,provided that the state regulation of hours of service did not apply to employees whose hours of service are regulated by the united states department of transportation code of federal regulations,title,sections to,hours of service of drivers.see wage order,subd.i.the cited regulations form part of the federal motor vehicle safety standards et and establish a unique regulatory scheme regulating the driving hours of truck drivers,which is designed to balance safety considerations against the demands of the trucking industry.they exist under statutory authority for the regulation of motor vehicle safety b,which has a pedigree going back to the motor carrier act.stat.those motor carrier employees,whose hours of service are regulated by this set of safety standards,have always been exempted from the coverage of the federal fair labor standards act of.see b.june,and stat.
subsequent revisions of wage order,reflected in wage order and,retained this exemption based on federal motor vehicle safety standards and added a reference to a parallel set of california regulations in title,california code of regulations,subchapter,governing the maximum driving and time of truck drivers.see wage order,subd.i and wage order,subd.h.as in effect during,wage order,subdivision h,provided the provisions of this section are not applicable to employees whose hours of service are regulated by the united states department of transportation code of federal regulations,title,sections to,hours of service of drivers,or title of the california code of regulations,subchapter,section and following sections,regulating hours of drivers.an identical exemption is contained in other wage orders covering industries that may involve use of motor carriers 
restoration and workplace flexibility act of 
the restoration and workplace flexibility act of hereafter act was in large measure a response to the iwc amendment of five wage orders on april,which,among other things,eliminated the state daily overtime rule in favor of the less restrictive weekly overtime rule of the federal flsa.prior to amendment,the iwc wage orders established a rule requiring payment of overtime for more than eight hours of work in a day the flsa required payment of overtime for hours worked beyond hours in a week.see california labor federation industrial welfare,supra,th,d.these amendments,which were effective january,applied to the wage orders covering manufacturing professional,clerical,mechanical and similar occupations public housekeeping industry mercantile industry and transportation industry 
section of the act declared the five wage orders,as amended effective january,to be null and void and reinstated the earlier wage orders that were in effect during other portions of the act established a new statutory scheme governing hours of labor and overtime compensation for all industries and occupations,which codified certain provisions of iwc wage orders,amended other provisions,and added a series of new options for alternative workweeks.the alternative workweek provisions do not concern this appeal.it is important to note,however,that labor code section constitutes the key provision in this new statutory scheme.as amended by the act,section now states the general rule that was earlier contained only in wage orders.subdivision a of section provides in part eight hours of labor constitutes a day work.any work in excess of eight hours in one workday and any work in excess of hours in any one workweek and the first eight hours worked on the seventh day of work in any one workweek shall be compensated at the rate of no less than one and times the regular rate of pay for an employee.
labor code section,subdivision b 
appellants contend that,with respect to truck drivers in their class,the act eliminated the exemption for motor carriers contained in past wage orders and brought them within the overtime rules of labor code section and other pertinent provisions of the act.each of their causes of action alleges violations of the act,which necessarily assumes that appellants are no longer within the motor carrier exemption.their interpretation of the act rests on subdivision b of labor code section,the provision dealing with overtime exemptions.
subdivision b consists of two sentences,of which the first provides except as
