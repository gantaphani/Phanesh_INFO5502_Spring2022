pursuant to rule of the california rules of court,we granted the request of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit to address the following question what is the appropriate test for determining whether an insured is engaged in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles without operators under california insurance code,section,subdivision b 
under the version of insurance code section,subdivision b former subdivision b controlling in this case,if a leased commercial vehicle is involved in an accident with one or more other vehicles,and its owner,the insured,is engaged in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles without operators,then the insured policy is conclusively presumed to be excess to any other insurance covering the loss.the rule is part of a statutory scheme intended to establish workable,bright line rules for allocating loss among coinsurers in the context of liability policies covering accidents.the public policy behind section is to avoid conflicts,litigation,and resulting court congestion in the determination of which liability policies covering multiple vehicles in an accident will provide primary,excess,or sole coverage for the resulting personal injury and property damage.it has further been observed,the purpose in shifting the risk of damage from the owner policy to the commercial lessee policy recognizes the commercial reality that the profitmaking lessee would be better able to absorb the expense of the policy as a cost of doing business.mission ins.hartford accident indemnity,supra,d at.
two of the appellate court decisions cited in the ninth circuit indemnity maryland casualty,supra,th,d travelers,and mccall great american ins,supra,d.mccall hold that courts should look to the nature of the insured primary business in determining whether the insured is engaged in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles without operators within the meaning of former subdivision b.the other three carriers ins.exchange pacific ins,supra,d,mission ins.hartford accident indemnity,supra,d,and transport indemnity alo,supra,d.the focus should be on the factual circumstances surrounding the lease of the particular commercial vehicle involved in the accident when making that determination.this court to date has not rendered a decision interpreting the disputed former statutory language.
in august,one month after the ninth circuit requested this court to clarify the test for determining whether an insured is engaged in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles without operators under former subdivision b,the legislature amended the statute,deleting the language with which we are here concerned and replacing it with the phrase who in the course of his or her business rents or leases motor vehicles without operators,subd.b.stats,ch.this amendment of the statutory language eliminates any ambiguity as to whether the leasing of commercial vehicles must be a regular part of the insured business see travelers,supra,th at,d in order for the conclusive presumption to apply under the amended language.section,subdivision b,now clearly provides that the renting or leasing of commercial vehicles without operators in the course of any business can qualify for the conclusive presumption that the insured coverage is excess,where all the statutory requirements are otherwise met.
as a result of the legislature amendment in of the very language in former subdivision b that the ninth circuit has asked us to construe,our interpretation of the deleted language would be of limited precedential value.nor is a definitive construction of the former statutory language necessary to resolve this matter.the insured lessor below,john trucking,jti,routinely leased nearly three quarters of its commercial fleet of trailers to independent truckers with whom it contracted for hauling jobs.the lease in question was a business transaction through which jti received compensation for the lease of two trailers to the lessee,independent trucker richard justice justice,who in turn made a profit from their use.such leasing activity can not within reason be viewed as merely incidental to jti hauling business.travelers,supra,th at,d.we conclude that jti leasing of the commercial trailers in question plainly qualified under former subdivision b for the conclusive presumption that its policy was excess to other insurance covering the loss.
factual and procedural background 
in may,justice,an independent trucker,was involved in a collision in the city of san diego with a vehicle driven by april russo,in which her mother,patricia nila,was a passenger.justice was driving his peterbilt tractor while pulling two owned by the insured,jti,pursuant to a subhaul agreement.russo and nila brought personal injury actions against justice and jti.jti successfully moved for summary judgment.the john deere insurance company john deere,which insured justice and was an undisputed primary insurer,eventually settled the personal injury actions on his behalf for,which was less than the policy limits.thereafter,sentry select insurance company sentry became john deere successor in interest,and was assigned any rights or claims that might be due and owing to john deere from jti insurer,fidelity guaranty insurance company fidelity,in connection with the litigation.sentry then brought this diversity action against fidelity in the united states district court for the southern district of california,alleging causes of action for contribution,implied equitable indemnity,and implied contractual indemnity.
sentry claims turn on the question whether the insured jti lease of the two to justice is a lease of qualifying commercial vehicles within the meaning of former subdivision b,which in turn depends on whether jti was engaged in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles without operators,the statutory language in effect at that time.if former subdivision b is found applicable to jti business and lease of the two to justice,any coverage for the loss afforded through jti fidelity policy would conclusively be presumed excess to any coverage afforded under the john deere policy insuring justice tractor.since john deere settled the third party claims against justice for less than its policy limits,no contribution or indemnity would be owed by fidelity to sentry as john deere successor in interest if the statutory presumption applies.
jti business and insurance coverage 
jti is a carrier company that usually performs its hauling contracts by subcontracting with independent truckers,although it owns a fleet of tractors and trailers.in,the year of the accident in question,jti owned tractors,sometimes commonly referred to as power units,and trailers,sometimes referred to as when doubled up for towing behind a power unit.each tractor is designed to pull two trailers.accordingly,jti utilized up to tractors and paired trailers,employing its own drivers for those rigs.it routinely leased the remaining trailers to independent contractors pursuant to a standard trailer lease agreement,such as the one executed by justice and jti below.during,jti had approximately active subhaul agreements with various independent contractors it used on a regular basis.under those agreements,the independent contractors received percent of the fee jti charged its customers for jobs undertaken while using their own trailers,but only percent if they leased trailers from jti.put differently,jti charged the independent truckers percent of the fee earned on a hauling job for the lease of its trailers.jti gross income from trailer rentals to independent contractors during the year in question was nearly.jti did not lease its trailers to the general public.
fidelity insured jti under a comprehensive general liability policy that specifically described and rated the two trailers owned by jti and leased to justice as covered vehicles.justice was not named as an additional insured,nor was his peterbilt tractor mentioned or rated under jti policy.the policy also contained an other insurance clause,which provided that while a covered auto which is a trailer is connected to another vehicle,the liability cover
