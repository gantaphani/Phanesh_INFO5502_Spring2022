congress enacted the national labor relations act the act to protect the right of employees to participate in collective bargaining for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment.see.in an effort to avoid an application of the act and its concomitant collective bargaining requirement,friendly cab company,friendly maintains that its taxicab drivers are independent contractors,rather than employees,and are therefore excluded from the protections of the act.after conducting an unfair labor practice proceeding,the national labor relations board nlrb or board concluded that friendly taxicab drivers are employees and that friendly violated the act by refusing to meet and engage in collective bargaining with the east bay taxi drivers association union.friendly now seeks review of that decision.acting pursuant to the jurisdiction that congress granted under section of the act,we affirm the conclusion of the nlrb that friendly drivers are employees within the meaning of the act.this conclusion is supported by substantial evidence that friendly exercised considerable control over the means and manner of its drivers performance and did not provide its drivers the ability to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities.
background 
friendly,along with six other taxicab entities,operates out of a facility in oakland,california,and is under the control of surinder singh,the chief administrator,and her husband,baljit singh,the president of the company friendly owns approximately eighty taxicabs fifty of which are designated as airport cabs and leases these cabs to its drivers who operate them at the oakland international airport and in the cities of emeryville,oakland,berkeley,and alameda,california.these leases typically state that the taxicabs are rented for seven days,renew automatically,and provide the drivers with six days of service and one day of mandatory maintenance per week.each of friendly drivers is required to pay a fee or gate,which ranges from to per week based on friendly discretion in determining this fee,friendly takes into account the cab model,as well as the driver driving record,driving ability,and prior accidents.friendly has a limited number of permits to operate at the oakland airport,which are in high demand and are typically held by drivers with more experience.although drivers designate which entity they want to work for,friendly retains the discretion to assign drivers to different taxicab entities,taxicab models,and the type of cab airport or street cabs.these leases also specify that there is no relationship between friendly and its taxicab drivers,and that friendly is not responsible for withholding any federal or state taxes or providing worker compensation insurance.
as part of the lease,friendly drivers agree to comply with friendly taxicab company policy manual manual and its standard operating procedures sop.although friendly manual and sop cover a broad range of topics that are common to the operation of a taxi service,safety concerns,policy,there are a number of regulations that concern friendly control over its drivers.for example,the manual instructs drivers that a cceleration should be smooth,they should a void abrupt stops,they should not stop next to puddles or in front of obstacles such as signs,trees or hydrants,and that w hen stopping at curbs,stop either right next to curb or out away from the curb.friendly manual also imposes a dress code,which requires that all taxicab drivers maintain good personal hygiene and dress appropriately and professionally collared shirts with sleeves,slacks or skirts,closed shoes with socks or hose.
friendly sop contains a number of relevant regulations as well.of particular significance to this case,the sop restricts outside business opportunities for friendly drivers by stating that a ll calls for service must be conducted over company provided communications system and telephone number.no private or individual business cards or phone numbers are allowed for distribution to customers as these constitute an interference in company business and a form of competition not permitted while working under the lease.the sop also provides that d rivers must service all reasonable customer calls from dispatchers.several drivers testified that the dispatcher will ignore or bypass them if they refuse or are late to a dispatch.one driver testified that if drivers do not respond in a certain amount of time,the dispatcher reminds drivers over the radio that we run the show,you guys are just the driver.just drive.that it.
although there was conflicting testimony regarding whether friendly drivers had to accept credit cards,the sop requires that drivers accept scrip and vouchers from customers 
taxicab drivers are required to respond at friendly discretion to dispatches for voucher service from contract accounts that friendly transportation an independent company owned by the singhs maintains with companies such as united parcel service,federal express,union pacific,and the american red cross.it is not clear how often this occurs since the sop indicates that friendly transportation vans and sedans have primary responsibility for these corporate accounts and taxicabs are used at friendly discretion as a secondary option.on such occasions,friendly reimburses drivers according to a rate list,minus a set percentage based upon the total amount of the voucher.for vouchers up to,friendly keeps ten percent of the total amount from to,fifteen percent from to,twenty percent from to,percent and over,thirty percent there is testimony from the drivers that these flat rates can be less than the meter rate for the same trip,but the drivers do not have the ability to refuse a voucher dispatch.
in addition to the requirements contained in the manual and the sop,friendly imposes a number of additional restrictions on its drivers.for example,friendly general manager testified that taxicab drivers are not able to sublease their vehicles to other drivers.friendly also requires that its taxicabs carry advertisements for outside vendors on the roofs of the taxicabs.drivers must return to the station to replace these advertisements at friendly discretion.furthermore,friendly requires that its drivers attend,at their expense,annual classes on company policies and laws dealing with discrimination.finally,if the drivers do not comply with friendly policies,friendly can terminate their leases.friendly employs a road manager who monitors the drivers appearance and compliance with friendly policies.
as a result of tension between friendly and its drivers,the union was appointed as the representative of a number of friendly drivers.the union filed a petition under section c of the act with the nlrb for a declaration that friendly taxicab drivers were employees and thus entitled to representation for collective bargaining purposes.following a hearing conducted before a hearing officer,a nlrb regional director issued a decision and direction of election concluding that friendly drivers were employees within the meaning of section of the act and directing that a formal vote take place among all of the taxicab drivers to determine whether they wanted the union as their official representative.friendly petitioned for review,and a panel of the nlrb affirmed the regional director decision in a decision on review.see friendly cab,generally referred to as the underlying representation proceeding.
following its certification as the exclusive representative of friendly taxicab drivers,the union wrote friendly on several occasions to meet and negotiate over the terms of employment of friendly taxicab drivers.friendly refused on the basis that it would seek judicial review of the underlying representation proceeding.the union subsequently filed a charge with the nlrb alleging that friendly violated sections a and a of the act by refusing to participate in collective bargaining.following a trial,an administrative law judge alj concluded that friendly violated the act and recommended friendly be ordered to,to meet and bargain on request with the union,and,if an understanding is reached,to embody the understanding in a signed agreement.the nlrb affirmed the alj decision that friendly violated the act and adopted the alj recommended order.see friendly cab,bna,generally referred to as the unfair labor practice proceeding.friendly now seeks review of that order.because the nlrb decision in the unfair labor practice proceeding is based on findings made in the underlying representation proceeding,the record in the underlying representation proceeding is also before this court.see d.
ii.standard of review 
in reviewing the nlrb application of agency principles to the facts of this case,the court should not set aside the board determination of the issue merely because the court,as an original matter,would have decided the case the other way.if the board conclusion represents a choice between two fairly conflicting views,it may not be displaced.merchants home delivery,nlrb,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also nlrb town country,d stating s ince the task of defining the term employee is one that has been assigned primarily to the agency created by congress to administer the act,the board construction of that term is entitled to considerable deference internal quotation marks and citations omitted.however,the nlrb decision can not be upheld if its application of the law to the facts overlooked accepted principles of the law of agency sida of hawaii,nlrb,cir citation omitted.this is because a determination of pure agency law involve s no special administrative expertise that a court does not possess.nlrb united ins.of,d.accordingly,we will uphold the nlrb decision if it correctly applied the law and if there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support its findings of fact.chipman freight,nlrb,cir citing nlrb int l longshoremen ass n,d.
iii.analysis 
the entire dispute between friendly,its taxicab drivers,the union,and the nlrb can be distilled into one question are friendly taxicab drivers employees or independent contractors under the act if they are employees,friendly drivers are protected by the act and are entitled to collective bargaining representation.see defining employees united,at.stating that the act protects only employees and excludes independent contractors.conversely,if friendly drivers are independent contractors,the act does not afford them any collective bargaining rights id.
in order to distinguish an employee from an independent contractor,we must undertake a inquiry applying common law principles of agency.united,at.stating that there is no doubt that we should apply the common law agency test in distinguishing an employee from an independent contractor merchants,at same restatement second of agency common law agency principles.although courts must look to the totality of the circumstances,t he essential ingredient of the agency test is the extent of control exercised by the employer.it rests primarily upon the amount of supervision that the putative employer has a right to exercise over the individual,particularly regarding the details of the work.sida,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.additional factors that are relevant to this determination include entrepreneurial aspects of the individual business risk of loss and opportunity for profit and the individual proprietary interest in his business.see merchants,at sida,at see also corporate express delivery nlrb.we must assess and weigh all of the incidents of the relationship with the understanding that no one factor is decisive,see united,at,and that i t is the rare case where the various factors will point with unanimity in one direction or the other.merchants,at.
we can not displace the nlrb conclusion that friendly drivers are employees within the meaning of the act because there is substantial evidence in the record that friendly exercises significant control over the means and manner of its drivers performance.in finding that the incidents of the relationship between friendly and its drivers militate in favor of employee status,we place particular significance on friendly requirement that its drivers may not engage in any entrepreneurial opportunities.
evidence of independent contractor status 
the payment by taxicab drivers of a fixed rental rate to an employer where drivers retain all fares collected without accounting to that employer typically creates a strong inference that the employer does not exert control over the means and manner of the drivers performance.see nlrb associated diamond cabs,cir local,democratic union org,seafarers int l union of,nlrb,city cab of orlando,city cab of orlando i.the rationale behind this strong inference is that the employer does not have an incentive to control the means and manner of the drivers performance when the employer makes the same amount of money irrespective of the fares received by the drivers.see associated diamond cabs,at local,seafarers,at city cab of orlando i,at.
here,the nlrb accepted that this strong inference exists because friendly drivers pay a flat fee and are not required to account for the amount of fares or tips they collect.friendly cab,at.although friendly received the benefit of this inference,the nlrb was generous to give it.there is nothing flat about this fee since it varies among the drivers between and,depending on their cab model,driving record,driving ability and prior accidents.id.at.those drivers that do not incur additional expenses for example,in the form of higher automobile insurance rates for poor driving records or increased costs for repairs of taxicabs damaged in presumably rewarded with lower rental rates.friendly rental fees thus do in fact reflect some control over the drivers performance.
in addition to friendly rental fees,the nlrb found additional indicia of independent contractor status.these include the facts that friendly drivers do not work set hours or a minimum number of hours the taxicab lease agreements provide that the drivers are independent contractors,friendly does not provide any benefits to drivers,and friendly does not withhold social security or other taxes on behalf of the drivers.id.at.however,the nlrb properly concluded that such factors are substantially outweighed by the evidence in the record of significant control by friendly over the means and manner of its drivers performance.
evidence of employee status 
the ability to operate an independent business and develop entrepreneurial opportunities is significant in any analysis of whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor under the common law agency test.see merchants,at see also corporate express,at.friendly restrictions against its drivers operating independent businesses or developing entrepreneurial opportunities strongly supports the nlrb determination that friendly drivers are employees.
in sida,this court found that the taxicab drivers were independent contractors,stating t he drivers are substantially independent in their operations.they are generally free to work or not work for sida when they choose they may moonlight by working for other cab companies they are free to make their own arrangements with clients and to develop their own goodwill at.similarly,in merchants,this court found that the entrepreneurial characteristics of the tip decidedly in favor of independent contractor status,noting that the delivery truck drivers sometimes engage in business.at see also corporate express,at placing significance on entrepreneurial opportunities of delivery drivers in analyzing contractor status eastern,nlrb,same.
in the underlying representation proceeding,the nlrb stated that t he most significant evidence of employer control in this case is that the drivers are not permitted to operate independent businesses.friendly cab,at.a review of the record supports this conclusion.friendly own general manager testified that drivers can use the taxicabs only to respond to dispatches from friendly and not for outside business.the sop prohibits drivers from soliciting customers,stating that all calls for service must be conducted over company provided communications system and telephone number.it also requires that drivers maintain company business cards at all times in the taxicab and prohibits drivers from distributing any private business cards or telephone numbers to customers because this would constitute an interference in company business and a form of competition not permitted while working under the lease.drivers can not accept calls for service on personal cellular telephones and,in fact,can not even use cellular telephones while driving 
these limitations do not allow friendly drivers the entrepreneurial freedom to develop their own business interests like true independent contractors.in sida,our conclusion that the taxicab drivers were independent contractors was premised largely on the fact that sida drivers were able to make their own arrangements with clients and to develop their own goodwill.at.here,it is telling that friendly sop mandates that its drivers must operate the taxis in such a manner as to protect the goodwill that exists between the company and its customers.
additional entrepreneurial as substantial investment in property and the ability to employ also absent.see merchants,at finding ownership and ability to employ others as important factors indicating independent contractor status sida,at finding ownership as an important factor indicating independent contractor status see also corporate express,at stating t ypically an entrepreneur not only supplies his own equipment or tools he may also hire subordinates and work for more than one party.friendly taxicab drivers do not own the taxicabs,but must lease them from friendly.friendly also prohibits its drivers from employing others by preventing the subleasing of its taxicabs.one former driver testified that while he was hospitalized,he was instructed by singh that drivers were prohibited from subleasing the vehicles,even to other friendly drivers.
another factor supporting the nlrb determination that friendly drivers are employees is the evidence that friendly sought to control the means and manner of its drivers performance by regulating the manner in which they drive,imposing a strict disciplinary regime,requiring drivers to carry advertisements without receiving revenue,requiring drivers to accept vouchers subject to friendly processing fees,imposing a strict dress code,and requiring training in excess of government regulations.as set forth below,this evidence of control supports the nlrb determination that friendly drivers are employees.
friendly maintains direct control over the performance of its drivers duties by exercising discretion to determine which entity a driver is assigned to,the model of the vehicle assigned to a driver,and whether a driver may drive an airport cab.friendly cab,at.friendly manual further instructs drivers in the manner they should accelerate and stop their vehicles,as well as factors they should consider in choosing where to stop their taxicabs.thus,friendly interest in controlling the means and manner of its drivers performance extends to the actual details of the operation of the taxicabs.
in assessing control,courts have also focused on the presence,or lack thereof,of discipline imposed by a taxicab company on its drivers.in city cab of orlando,nlrb,city cab of orlando ii,the court found it significant that drivers were reluctant to refuse either a dispatcher call for fear of not receiving future dispatches or an airport assignment because they would have to return to the end of the airport taxicab line.id.at concluding that taxicab drivers were employees see nlrb limousine,cir finding company right to fine or reprimand the drivers for failure to comply with company procedures as support for concluding limousine drivers were employees accord stamford taxi,finding taxicab drivers that refused dispatch calls were subject to discipline,denial of further dispatched calls,or lease termination as support for concluding taxicab drivers were employees.conversely,in yellow taxi of minneapolis nlrb,the court held the lack of a disciplinary regime was an important factor leading to the determination that the taxicab drivers were independent contractors.id.at see also eastern,at finding company lack of a conventional disciplinary system was an indicator of independent contractor status.distinguishing the disciplinary system in city cab of orlando ii,the court in yellow taxi of minneapolis found that the drivers were free to refuse any radio call from the dispatcher.at.in fact,the chief dispatcher testified that the drivers were free to refuse orders for runs,without penalty,and dispatchers are so instructed.id.such is not the case here.
friendly exercised substantial control over its drivers through a strict disciplinary regime.significantly,friendly disciplines its drivers for any refusal to cooperate with friendly dispatcher.friendly sop states that d rivers must service all reasonable customer calls from dispatcher.friendly drivers testified that they are disciplined if they refuse or are late to a dispatch.drivers are also disciplined when they disagree with management.singh assessed a fifty dollar fine to one driver who disagreed with her and purportedly told him that you open a mouth in front of me,now you have to pay the penalty.furthermore,in order to monitor drivers appearance and compliance with friendly policies,friendly employs a road manager who has the authority to not only warn drivers,but to suspend or terminate lease agreements.one driver testified that the road manager unilaterally changed the terms of the lease including the weekly gate and preset fees to repair a taxicab to punish him for an accident.the evidence reveals that if the taxicab drivers do not perform their duties in an acceptable manner,friendly punishes them using the most effective tool available taking money out of the drivers income.
friendly requirement that its taxicabs carry advertisements is additional evidence of control because drivers are subject to friendly discretionary requests to change advertisements.friendly cab,at.these requests require that the driver sit idle while advertisements are changed and result in the driver losing potential fares.also,drivers testified that they complained to friendly that they did not want advertising signs for various companies on top of their taxicabs,but were told they did not have a choice in the matter.one driver testified that friendly required him to change the advertising up to once every twenty days,requiring him to wait each time at the company premises between fifteen minutes and one hour.
the type of control friendly exercises over its drivers exceeds that found in the typical case in which a company requires its workers place advertisements on work vehicles.in carnation company nlrb,cir,this court found that carnation requirement that its dairy distributors maintain advertisements on their work vehicles did not evidence an relationship.id.at see also associated diamond cabs,at concluding that income from advertisements that went to taxicab company was irrelevant to the issue of an employer control over the lessees.similarly,in city cab of orlando i,a taxicab company requirement that a driver return to its facility in order for a mechanic to place decals listing the new telephone number of the company was found to not be the type of control normally exercised by an employer over an employee.at.this was because the decals primarily benefitted the taxicab drivers and the general public.id.in this case,friendly requirement constitutes significantly greater control.friendly advertising requirement represents a form of control that inures to the benefit of friendly at the financial expense of the drivers.
friendly requirement that its drivers accept vouchers is yet further evidence of control.some courts have found that requiring taxicab drivers to accept flat voucher fees is not evidence of sufficient control by itself to indicate employee status.see,yellow taxi of minneapolis,at air transit,nlrb,cir.however,friendly exercises greater control through the graduated processing fees it charges drivers when they redeem vouchers.while it is unclear how often it occurs,friendly drivers are required at friendly discretion to transport passengers and packag
