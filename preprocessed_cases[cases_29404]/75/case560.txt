the hot springs school district and hot springs school board school district discontinued busing students of bethesda lutheran school bethesda,a private religious school located within the school district boundaries.daniel,amy,luke and benjamin pucket puckets,parents of students and students enrolled at bethesda,filed an action under,arguing that the school district termination of busing services for bethesda students violated the first and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.the puckets argue that the school district unconstitutionally deprived them of busing services because it relied on two allegedly unconstitutional provisions of the south dakota constitution to terminate the busing services.south dakota attorney general lawrence long state intervened to defend the state constitution provisions.the district court granted the summary judgment motions of the school district and the state.on appeal we conclude that the puckets lack standing to bring this lawsuit,and we affirm the dismissal.
background 
prior to the school year,the school district provided bus transportation to students attending bethesda who lived along existing school district bus routes.on march,the school district received a letter from linda joski,an account executive at arthur gallagher,the administrator for the school district automobile liability insurance policy.the letter informed the school district that i t has come to our attention that hot springs school district is transporting children for a local parochial school.the letter requested that the school district discontinue busing as soon as possible and no later than the beginning of the school year because this activity would not be considered school sponsored and thus create d a liability situation which was beyond the scope of the school district insurance policy.beth spitzer,bethesda principal,learned of the insurance problem from a school district employee.
in july,the association of school boards association,of which the school district was a member,received a letter from its counsel,who was also counsel for the school district,addressing the issue of insurance coverage for school districts providing busing for children.in the letter,counsel noted that in south dakota attorney general opinion opinion the attorney general determined that a public school district lacked the statutory authority to provide busing for children attending a religious school and questioned whether such an arrangement would be constitutional even if statutory authority permitted it.counsel concluded that an insurance company could deny coverage to a school district busing children.the school district also received a copy of this letter.
the school district decided to discontinue busing bethesda students in accordance with its insurance administrator request by the start of the school year.on october,the school district attorney contacted the south dakota attorney general to request a formal opinion on the question of whether a school district was authorized to transport children.on november,the attorney general office responded by stating that,this issue has been addressed in official opinion.
the south dakota attorney general prepared opinion in in response to a question by another south dakota school district regarding the legality of a public school district providing busing to students of a preschool.opinion concluded that school districts could not provide simultaneous busing to public and nonpublic school students based on south dakota statutes that regulate busing,particularly south dakota codified laws and.section states that 
the school board may grant the use of school facilities,computers,motor vehicles,or land belonging to the school district for any purposes which it considers advisable as a community service for such compensation as it determines the use may not interfere with school activities.any person or persons or public body using such school facilities,computers,motor vehicles,or land is responsible to the school district for any and all damages that may be caused by reason of the use or occupancy.
the school board of any school district may acquire,own,operate,or hire buses for the transportation of students to and from its schools either from within or without the district or for transportation to and from athletic,musical,speech,and other interscholastic contests in which participation is authorized by the school board.
while opinion noted that n othing on the face of would prohibit simultaneous public and private use of a bus,the attorney general concluded that when the entire scheme on public and private use of school buses is considered,it is my opinion that simultaneous public and private use of a school bus is not permissible under the existing statute.opinion also expressed serious doubts as to whether,even if busing was allowed under south dakota statutes,it would be permissible under the south dakota constitution article vi,which provides that n o money or property of the state shall be given or appropriated for the benefit of any sectarian or religious society or institution and article viii,which states that n o appropriation of lands,money or other property or credits to aid any sectarian school shall ever be made by the state.
at a december,meeting and in response to spitzer repeated requests,the school district board passed a motion stating the district would not allow bethesda lutheran school students bus service because it was declared unconstitutional by the south dakota attorney general and the loss of the district catastrophic insurance coverage if bus service is provided.as directed by the puckets counsel,spitzer specifically requested that the school district motion include a statement that the board was relying on the attorney general opinion that public schools busing of children would violate the south dakota constitution.
following that meeting,on january,vern hagedorn,the school district superintendent,recorded in his busing log that the school district had offered to help bethesda introduce legislation to allow busing for bethesda students,but all she spitzer wanted was a statement that we would transport their students.the next day spitzer recorded in her busing log that the counsel for the association and the school district had called her and want ed to pursue legislative action,but that she responded by telling him that there was going to be a lawsuit.
shortly thereafter,the south dakota legislature passed south dakota codified law,which was effective immediately when the governor signed the bill on march.it stated in relevant part 
school districts may provide transportation to nonpublic school students if no additional public funds are expended to provide the transportation.no school district,however,is required under this section to provide transportation to nonpublic school students.
on february,the school district learned that,in anticipation of the enactment of,busing bethesda students would no longer impact the school district liability insurance.although the puckets did not request that the school district reinstate busing for bethesda students after became effective,the school district did so on may.
however,on april,prior to the reinstatement of busing,the puckets filed this lawsuit against the school district under for its failure to bus bethesda students.the puckets claimed that the decision not to bus bethesda students violated the first and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.their complaint,which was served on the school district on may,alleged that the school district violated the equal protection and free exercise clauses of the constitution by denying bethesda students busing based on their religion,that the school district violated the free speech clause of the constitution by denying bethesda students busing because it teaches from a religious viewpoint,and that the school district violated the establishment clause of the constitution by denying bethesda students busing based on the south dakota constitution provisions,which it claimed was applied to disfavor all faiths deemed sectarian.the state intervened to defend the constitutionality of the south dakota constitution provisions.the school district and the state filed motions for summary judgment.
granting the motions for summary judgment of the school district and the state,the district court found that the puckets lacked standing to sue prior to march,when became effective,because school districts did not have legal authority to bus children under,and.because the school district lacked legal authority to bus children,the district court determined that the puckets could not show that the school district actions caused an.while the district court held that the puckets had standing after march,it also concluded that no reasonable jury could find that the school district failure to reinstate busing between march and may,was based on the south dakota constitution provisions.therefore,the court declined to decide whether the south dakota constitution provisions violated the united states constitution.the court,however,did find that the school district policy of refusing to bus bethesda students did not violate the first and fourteenth amendments to the constitution.
the puckets appeal the district court decision,arguing the district court erred in concluding that they did not have standing before march,that no reasonable jury could find that the school district failure to reinstate busing between march and may,was based on the south dakota constitution provisions and that the school district policy did not violate the first and fourteenth amendments.the puckets also urge us to find that the south dakota constitution provisions violate the united states constitution.we conclude that the puckets did not have standing either before or after march.

august to march,
the district court concluded that the puckets lacked standing to assert a claim based on the period from august,when the school district discontinued busing,until march,when,which specifically gave school districts discretion to bus children,became effective.the district court concluded that prior to the enactment of,public school districts were not authorized to bus children under south dakota law.thus,the court concluded that the puckets lacked standing to sue as they suffered no based on the school district decision to discontinue busing bethesda students,because the school district did not have statutory authority to do so.on appeal the puckets argue that the district court erred by misinterpreting the south dakota statutes at issue and by failing to consider the legislative history of.

when determining the scope of a school board authority,we must examine the statutes that govern school boards.we begin with the plain language of each statute and try to ascertain the intent of the legislature by looking at the language of the statute itself and giving it its plain,ordinary and commonly understood meaning.in re m s grading,cir quotation omitted.it is well established that courts do not interpret statutes in isolation,but in the context of the corpus juris of which they are a part.branch smith,d.the correct rule of interpretation is,that if divers statutes relate to the same thing,they ought all to be taken into consideration in construing any one of them.united states freeman,how.
as the district court correctly explained,does not provide authority for the school district to bus bethesda students.under,school districts may bus students to and from its schools or for athletic,musical,speech,and other interscholastic contests.emphasis added.bethesda is not one of the school district schools,and bethesda students are not being bused to athletic,musical,speech or other interscholastic contests.thus,we conclude that the plain language of does not authorize the school district to bus bethesda students.
the puckets also argue that the district court erred in its interpretation of and.section states,in relevant part,that t he school board may grant the use of school facilities,computers,motor vehicles,or land belonging to the school district for any purposes which it considers advisable as a community service for such compensation as it determines the use may not interfere with school activities.section provides that a school board may allow nonprofit civic organizations or other government entities to use vehicles owned by the school district to transport persons to various activities deemed by the school board to be in the public interest.
both statutes authorize school boards to grant or allow others,including nonprofit organizations,to use a school district vehicles.use is defined as to put or bring into action or service.webster new world dictionary of the american language college ed.riding as a passenger in a vehicle does not constitute putting the vehicle into action or service.accordingly,applying the ordinary meaning of use,we conclude that and merely authorize the school district to allow a nonprofit organization actually to operate the school district motor vehicles.
the puckets argue that use by a nonprofit,nonpublic school includes students enrolled at that school riding on buses operated by drivers employed by the school district.however,this broad interpretation of use is not consistent with the command that any power sought to be exercised by a school district must be either expressly granted or necessarily implied by the statute.see in re writ of certiorari as to wrongful payments of attorney fees made by brookings sch.dist.sch,at.such a reading also is inconsistent with the language of other south dakota statutes regulating busing.section authorizes school districts to provide transportation of students to and from its schools and interscholastic contests,and now authorizes school districts to provide transportation to nonpublic school students to and from their schools.neither of those statutes employ the word use.when intending to enable a school district to provide busing services to its students the south dakota legislature notably chose the phrase provide transportation.if the legislature intended or to authorize school districts to provide busing services to children,it would have expressed that intent by using the word transportation.the fact that the legislature instead chose the word use indicates that the legislature did not intend for either of these statutes to permit school districts to provide busing services for children.rather,the plain language of and authorizes a school district to allow other nonprofit groups to use its buses,employing their own drivers 
finally,the puckets argue that we should consider the legislative history of,which they claim supports their argument.the puckets rely on statements of two legislators regarding the passage of to support their claim that the legislature passed only to clarify and confirm that school districts already had the authority to bus children.however,when statutes are straightforward and clear,legislative history and policy arguments are at best interesting,at worst distracting and misleading,and in neither case authoritative.states power united states,cir.as the district court noted,if school districts had the authority to transport children to and from school,the legislature would not have needed to enact.see farmers union prop.cas.universal underwriters ins,the legislature does not intend to insert surplusage in its enactments.accordingly,south dakota law did not authorize the school district to bus bethesda students until became effective on march.
the puckets can not show that the school district alleged discrimination caused their injury because the school district did not have the statutory authority to bus the puckets or any other bethesda students before march.see,donaghy city of omaha,cir holding that police officer lacked standing to challenge city employment decisions because,even if the city had only promoted based on rank order,he would not have been promoted based on his rank grahek city of paul,cir citing donaghy in finding that the plaintiff lacked standing to sue because he would not have been referred for openings for which he applied even if the police chief had not applied an plan wilson glenwood intermountain,cir a person who fails to satisfy lawful,nondiscriminatory requirements or qualifications for the benefit lacks standing to raise claims of discrimination in the denial of the benefit.see also charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.causation is most easily rejected when a plaintiff challenges the denial of a benefit on one ground,and it is shown that the plaintiff is in any event ineligible for the benefit on some other ground.therefore,we agree with the district court that the puckets lack standing to challenge the school district decision to discontinue busing bethesda students prior to march,
march,to may,
after march,specifically authorized the school district to bus bethesda students,but it did not require the school district to do so.the law stated that s chool districts may provide transportation to nonpublic school students if no additional public funds are expended to provide the transportation.codified law emphasis added.
as noted above,a plaintiff may not simply allege a generalized grievance,but he or she must instead demonstrate a concrete injury.in analyzing standing,the supreme court has repeatedly found that a plaintiff lacks standing to sue when the plaintiff can not demonstrate specific injuries.see,lujan.warth seldin,d.
in warth,various plaintiffs,including a home builders association,challenged allegedly discriminatory zoning ordinances.at.the supreme court held that members of the home builders association lacked standing because t he complaint refer red to no specific project of any of its members that was currently precluded either by the ordinance or by respondents action in enforcing it.id.at.the complaint did not claim that any member had applied for a building permit or variance for any current project,and there was no indication that respondents delayed or thwarted any project currently proposed by home builders members,or that any of its members took advantage of the remedial processes available under the ordinance.id.the court concluded that insofar as the complaint sought prospective relief,home builders failed to show the existence of any injury to its members of sufficient immediacy and ripeness to warrant judicial intervention.id.the court also rejected the claims of another plaintiff when neither the complaint nor any materials of record indicate d that any member of housing council took any step toward building housing in penfield.id.at.thus,the court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing when they failed to demonstrate even a mere application for a building permit or zoning variance.id.at.
likewise in lujan,the supreme court held that simply demonstrating past travels to certain international destinations and the desire to return there without specific travel plans failed to support standing for two members of the defenders of wildlife who were challenging a rule promulgated by the secretary of the interior.at.in the endangered species act of esa,congress passed a provision,allowing a private citizen to sue to enjoin anyone alleged to be in violation of the esa.id.at.the members of the defenders of wildlife were challenging a rule promulgated by the secretary of the interior interpreting of the esa,which required federal agencies to consult with the secretary of the interior to ensure that projects they funded did not threaten endangered species.id.at.the secretary interpreted of the esa to apply only to actions taken in the united states or on the high seas,and not to actions taken in foreign nations.id.at.the two members of the defenders of wildlife claimed that this interpretation would increase the rate of extinction of endangered and threatened species.id.at.the members stated in affidavits that they had previously visited egypt and sri lanka and intended to do so again with hopes of observing the native endangered animals in their natural habitats.id.at.the court found that these two members profession of their intent to return without any description of concrete plans,or indeed even any specification of when the some day would be did not support a finding of the actual or imminent injury required to establish standing.id.at.
other courts also have found that if a plaintiff is required to meet a precondition or follow a certain procedure to engage in an activity or enjoy a benefit and fails to attempt to do so,that plaintiff lacks standing to sue because he or she should have at least taken steps to attempt to satisfy the precondition.see,webster,cir finding that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge procedures to obtain a bypass to required parental consent for an abortion when they had never attempted to obtain the judicial bypass gilles davis,cir holding that a campus speaker lacked standing to challenge the university permit policy because the speaker never applied for a permit interstate commerce comm appleyard,cir concluding that a trucker lacked standing to challenge an injunction against operating without a certificate or permit from the icc when he failed to show that he ever applied for a permit or that he could not obtain one.
here,there is no evidence that the puckets actually requested that the school district reinstate busing after became effective on march.the puckets counsel confirmed at oral argument before this court that the puckets did not request that busing be resumed after became effective,instead assuming that the school district
