michael gorman petitions for review of an opinion and order of the national transportation safety board ntsb or board,which affirmed a federal aviation administration faa emergency order revoking gorman commercial pilot certificate.the faa found that gorman deliberately violated federal aviation regulations fars by operating aircraft carrying cargo for compensation or hire without obtaining the required operating certificate and operations specifications and without complying with competency and line check requirements set out in subpart c of far part,et,and far part,id.et,even after the faa informed him he was required to do so under far section b,b.gorman maintains,as he did below,that the regulation,which on its face applies only to aircraft having a configuration of less than seats,does not apply to his two aircraft because they have no passenger seats and therefore no configuration whatsoever.gorman also asserts that far section,as interpreted by the faa,is ultra vires and that license revocation was too severe a sanction.for the reasons set out below,we conclude that the faa reasonably construed its regulation to apply to aircraft with no passenger seats,that the regulation is not ultra vires and that gorman has waived his objection to the severity of the penalty.accordingly,we deny the petition for review.
in,gorman obtained a part operating certificate to operate his business flying cargo in the form of bank checks for a single bank.in,gorman decided he did not need a part certificate to operate his business under the applicable fars and obtained a written opinion from robert griscom,an aviation attorney,that as a private carrier gorman did not need such a certificate which,griscom averred,is required only for common carriers.see hearing ex,sturgell gorman,docket no,at ntsb,july,letter from robert griscom to mike gorman.gorman private carriage,griscom opined,may be conducted under the rules of far part,id.at,which is titled air traffic and general operating rules.griscom sent a copy of his opinion letter to monroe balton,faa regional counsel for the western pacific region,who responded that the opinion accurately reflects the current state of the faa regulations,advisory circular and policy on the issue of private carriage.hearing ex,sturgell gorman,at ntsb,letter from monroe balton to robert griscom.
in march,while on routine surveillance at the long beach,ca airport,two faa aviation safety inspectors observed an airplane displaying charter advertising on the side of the fuselage.when questioned by one of the inspectors,gorman,the airplane pilot,responded that he did not need an air carrier certificate to operate his business.in a subsequent telephone conversation,the other inspector told gorman that he might be in violation of pt.b if he was transporting bank checks for hire without an air carrier certificate.hearing ex,sturgell gorman,at ntsb,record of,telephone call from mike gorman to gary lackey.gorman insisted that far section b did not apply to him because he was in private carriage and that he had legal opinions from griscom and from faa counsel balton supporting his position.when contacted by the inspectors,balton opined that indeed gorman would need an air carrier certificate if he was transporting for hire in private carriage.id.
in april,according to gorman,faa inspector gary lackey informed him by telephone that he was grounded,that he had received bad advice from his attorney and that he was operating illegally.admin.hearing transcript,sturgell gorman,at,ntsb testimony of gorman hearing tr.after being advised by griscom and other private counsel that lackey lacked authority to ground him,gorman called faa operations unit supervisor robert kemp.kemp clarified that gorman was not grounded but kemp advised gorman that operations defined as private carriage require the issuance of an operator certificate and that gorman operation appears to meet this definition and warned him that if gorman was engaged in this type of activity,he m ight be in violation of title of the code of federal aviation regulations title cfr and subject to civil penalties.hearing ex,sturgell gorman ntsb,april,letter from robert kemp to mike gorman.
on may,balton drafted a memorandum addressing certification requirements for private carriage by a small airplane operator.hearing ex,sturgell gorman,ntsb,may,memorandum from balton to long beach flight standards district offices balton memo.in it balton stated that advisory circular,which he had cited in his earlier opinion,had not been revised since and therefore did not take into account far part,which was issued and became effective later in time and therefore better represents the faa position with respect to private carriage.id.at.balton then set out the text of far section b 
each person who conducts noncommon carriage except as provided in b of this chapter or private carriage operations for compensation or hire with airplanes having a configuration of less than seats,excluding each crewmember seat,and a payload capacity of less than pounds shall 
comply with the certification and operations specifications requirements in subpart c of this part 
conduct those operations in accordance with the requirements of part of this chapter,except for those requirements applicable only to commuter operations 
b,quoted in balton memo at emphasis added.far section b,balton noted,is regulatory in nature and must be complied with,while advisory circular is advisory suggested means of complying with the regulations and is not regulatory and is not enforced by the faa.balton memo at.under far section,he explained,large aircraft operators engaged in private carriage must have at least a certificate and operations specifications issued under part,and small aircraft operators must hold a certificate and operations specifications issued under part and conduct operations in accordance with far part.id.he therefore advised that griscom opinion,to the extent it fails to recognize this fact,is in error and his earlier concurrence in griscom opinion was completely in error,admitting that he had failed to review the requirements of far part and had only reread the advisory circular.id.at.
on june,lackey drafted a letter to gorman,with a copy of balton memo attached,in which lackey indicated that cargo operations of this nature are indeed subject to title code of federal regulations b and require an air carrier certificate.hearing ex,sturgell gorman,at ntsb,june,letter from gary lackey to mike gorman.thus,lackey advised,c ontinued operations by you without an air carrier certificate are contrary to cfr part and part and would be subject to enforcement action.id.gorman responded in a letter dated june,expressing his disagreement with balton revised opinion.exhibit,sturgell gorman,at ntsb,june,letter from mike gorman to faa.following this exchange,gorman continued to operate his private carriage business as before,without regard to far section b directives to c omply with the certification and operations specifications requirements in subpart c of part requiring a covered person to obtain an operating certificate and operations specifications that prescribe the authorizations,limitations,and procedures under which each kind of operation must be conducted,b and to c onduct his operations in accordance with the requirements of part.
on august,the faa served an emergency order revoking gorman commercial pilot certificate because,notwithstanding he was advised by the faa that his cargo operations were in violation of the far,on at least occasions he continued said operations from san diego to long beach as pilot in command,in deliberate disregard of faa notification that such operation was in violation of the far,in particular,far section b.emergency order of revocation,michael charles gorman,case,at faa.the emergency order stated that each of the two aircraft gorman was operating had a configuration of less than seats and a payload capacity of less than pounds and his operation of the flights constituted noncommon carriage or private carriage operations,for compensation or hire,thereby triggering the certification and operations specifications requirements of far section as well as the competency and line check requirements of far part.id.at.the order set out a list of provisions in far parts and that gorman operations violated id.at.based on the foregoing,the order concluded 
as a result of your operation in deliberate disregard of the faa notification to you that such operations are in violation of the far,the administrator finds that you lack the qualification necessary to hold a commercial pilot certificate,or an airman pilot certificate of any kind.she therefore has determined that safety in air commerce or air transportation and the public interest require the revocation of any and all airman pilot certificates you hold.the administrator further finds that an emergency requiring immediate action exists with respect to safety in air commerce or air transportation.
id.at.accordingly,the emergency order directed that any certificate gorman held be immediately revoked and surrendered to faa regional counsel and that for one year thereafter,no application for a new airman certificate be accepted from him nor an airman certificate issued to him.id.
gorman appealed and a hearing was conducted by an ntsb administrative law judge alj on september.at the hearing,gorman argued that part b absolutely does not apply to all cargo operations,noncommon carriage in aircraft of his class.hearing tr.at.he reasoned that far section b only applies to aircraft having a passenger seat configuration and his aircraft d id not have a passenger seat configuration because it did not have any passenger seats.id.the faa disagreed,maintaining that far section applied to gorman aircraft because z ero is less than.id.at.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the alj issued an oral ruling affirming the emergency order with respect to all but one of the alleged regulatory violations as well as the revocation of gorman pilot certificate id.at.the alj concluded that,contrary to gorman contention,the faa reasonably interpreted far section b,which applies to airplanes having a configuration of less than seats,to apply to aircraft such as gorman which have no passenger seats 
if you have zero seats,you do have less than,in my view.
i,therefore find on the reasonable interpretation of this regulation,that respondent did,in fact,change the passenger seat configuration in his aircraft by removing all of the passenger seats to zero seats,and zero seats is less than.
hearing tr.at.based on his interpretation of far section b,the alj found that gorman violated not only far section b but also far sections g,b,b,a,b and a,the requirements of which were triggered by far section b.the alj also found that revocation was the appropriate sanction because 
g iven the fact that gorman was advised in june,whether or not he agreed with it,he was advised that his operations were in probable violation of the appropriate regulation,he intentionally continued to operate upon his own determination that the faa was wrong and he was right 
this was deliberate choice by gorman to disregard the advice and caution issued to him on his belief that his interpretation was correct and nobody in the faa that he had dealt with knew what they were talking about that is inappropriate.if pilots simply disregard some portion of the regulations,operational,medical,whatever,maintenance,and say whatever they require or your interpretation that i got to use this tool or this condition does not prohibit safe performance or i do have to comply,that would be chaos.
gorman appealed the alj decision to the ntsb,which issued an order on november,denying the appeal and affirming the alj decision upholding the faa emergency order except as to far section b.opinion and order,sturgell gorman,docket ntsb.the board concluded that it is bound by all validly adopted interpretations of laws and regulations that the administrator carries out,unless it find s that an interpretation is arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise not in accordance with law,id.at,and that section b is clear on its face and the faa interpretation of it was therefore not arbitrary,capricious or contrary to law and precedent,id.at.
gorman filed a petition for review with this court on december.on january,gorman filed a petition for rehearing with the ntsb,which the board denied in an order issued may,for the following reason 
respondent filed a petition for review of his case in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit on december,and that court has so notified the board therefore,the board no longer has jurisdiction and the petition is subject to dismissal.
sturgell gorman,docket at ntsb may,ntsb rehearing order footnotes omitted citing b.alternatively,the board noted that,even if the filing of the petition for judicial review did not deprive it of jurisdiction,gorman petition for rehearing would have been untimely,and therefore subject to dismissal.id.at.
on july,we ordered sua sponte that the parties address in their briefs whether petitioner filing of a petition for agency rehearing after filing this petition for review renders the petition for review incurably premature.order,gorman ntsb,at july.
we first address the jurisdictional issue and then move on to the merits.
jurisdiction 
as recited supra,the ntsb issued its final decision on the merits on november,and gorman filed a petition for review with the court on december.gorman subsequently filed a rehearing petition with the ntsb on january,the prescribed window,see a b petition for rehearing,reargument,reconsideration or modification of a board order on appeal from a law judge initial decision or order must be filed with the board,and simultaneously served on the other parties,within days after the date of service of the board order on appeal from the law judge initial decision or order and on may,the ntsb issued the order dismissing the rehearing petition.pursuant to the court july,order,the parties have briefed the issue whether gorman petition here is incurably premature.order,gorman ntsb,at citing collins ntsb,telestar,fcc.the parties agree that the petition is not incurably premature.we agree as well.
our caselaw treat s a petition for review filed during the pendency of a request for administrative reconsideration as incurably premature,and in effect a nullity.collins,at internal citation omitted see also telestar,at filing of a challenge to agency action before the agency has issued its decision on reconsideration is incurably premature so that when a petition for review is filed before the challenged action is final and thus ripe for review,subsequent action by the agency on a motion for reconsideration does not ripen the petition for review or secure appellate jurisdiction.in this case,we confront a question left unresolved in collins.in that case,the petitioner had filed two petitions for judicial days after the ntsb initial decision and one days after the ntsb dismissal of an untimely request for administrative reconsideration filed between the initial board decision and the first petition for judicial review.we concluded that the petition for judicial review was not incurably premature for two alternative reasons if the request suspended the running of the time limit for appeal,then the second petition for review was timely if it did not,then the initial petition was effective.either way,we have jurisdiction.collins,at.because jurisdiction existed whether or not the untimely reconsideration request tolled the time for filing a petition for judicial review,the court found it unnecessary to determine the precise effect of an untimely request for ntsb reconsideration.id.we now address this issue squarely and conclude the filing of an untimely petition for agency reconsideration does not render incurably premature an otherwise valid petition for judicial review.
in united transportation union icc,we concluded,as had other circuits,that the filing of a timely petition for reconsideration must render the underlying agency action nonfinal,explaining 
where a motion for rehearing is in fact filed there is no final action until the action is denied.w hen the party elects to seek a rehearing t
