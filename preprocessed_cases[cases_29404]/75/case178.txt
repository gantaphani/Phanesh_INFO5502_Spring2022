this diversity action,governed by new york law,arises out of the seizure by russian governmental authorities of a shipment of frozen food sent by plaintiff international multifoods corporation multifoods to russia.it raises several issues of contract interpretation with respect to two insurance policies that protected multifoods against risks associated with the shipment.the district court granted summary judgment in multifoods favor on multifoods claim for indemnification against defendant commercial union insurance company cu,and awarded damages in the amount of plus applicable interest.it granted summary judgment to defendant indemnity insurance company of north america iina on multifoods claim,and cu,seeking indemnification from iina.for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part and vacate in part the grant of summary judgment to multifoods,and remand for further proceedings.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to iina.
facts and procedural background 
in september,multifoods shipped a cargo of frozen chicken and meat products from pascagoula,mississippi to petersburg,russia aboard the ozark the ozark,pursuant to a contract with ascop corporation ascop.the ozark arrived in petersburg on september.on september,and september,pursuant to an order of the ministry of internal affairs of the russian federation,the ozark and all tangible assets on board were arrested incident to a criminal investigation involving a different shipper.at some point thereafter,the local russian authorities,over multifoods objection,discharged and appropriated multifoods cargo from the ozark.despite substantial efforts,including oral and written appeals to the russian government,multifoods was never able to recover the cargo or any part of its value,nor was it able to ascertain precisely what had happened to the cargo.
this litigation primarily centers on whether multifoods can recover the value of its cargo under an insurance policy the cu policy procured by ascop from cu and certified by cu to multifoods.the district court opinion offers a thorough and detailed canvass of the cu policy terms,see international multifoods commercial union ins,d,and we therefore pause here only to note two provisions of the cu policy that are essential to the determination of this case,both of which appear in a model boilerplate insurance london institute frozen meat clauses a hours breakdown cl.the london form that was incorporated into and attached to the back of the cu policy.
first,clause the war exclusion clause of the london form,the meaning of which is central to this litigation,provides as follows 
in no case shall this insurance cover loss damage or expense caused by 
war civil war revolution rebellion insurrection,or civil strife arising therefrom,or any hostile act by or against a belligerent power 
capture seizure arrest restraint or detainment piracy excepted,and the consequences thereof or any attempt thereat 
derelict mines torpedoes bombs or other derelict weapons of war.
to the right of clause appears bold language identifying clause as the war exclusion clause.second,a special note at the end of the london form states that t his insurance does not cover loss damage or expense caused by rejection prohibition or detention by the government of the country of import.as we discuss in greater detail below,cu relies upon the war exclusion clause and the special note to argue that multifoods loss is excluded from coverage under the cu policy.
on march,multifoods made a claim under the cu policy for the loss of its cargo.on april,cu disclaimed coverage,asserting inter alia that the coverage terminate d upon the discharge of the goods from the overseas vessel and that the seizure and disposal of the goods by the russian authorities was in any event excluded from coverage by the war exclusion clause.
multifoods then filed this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alvin hellerstein,judge to recover the value of its loss from cu.in an oral decision rendered on december,and confirmed by a december,order,the district court granted partial summary judgment to multifoods on the war exclusion clause issue,holding that the war exclusion clause applied only to losses that were incurred in connection with an actual war,and did not exclude coverage for governmental seizures during peacetime.the district court set forth its reasoning in a june,reported opinion denying cu motion for reconsideration,international multifoods commercial union ins,d.
multifoods subsequently filed for summary judgment,arguing that cu had no defense other than the war exclusion clause.cu responded by arguing that multifoods had not as a prima facie matter established that it incurred a loss within the meaning of the cu policy because multifoods could not prove what had happened to the cargo.in a november,decision rendered orally and confirmed by a written order,the district court tentatively denied multifoods motion for summary judgment,holding that multifoods had not yet demonstrated as a prima facie matter that it had incurred a loss covered by the cu policy.the district court ordered additional discovery relating to the circumstances surrounding the seizure of the cargo.
following additional discovery,the parties were unable to determine what had happened to the cargo after its seizure by the russian authorities,although it became clear that multifoods had exerted substantial effort in attempting to recover the cargo.at this point,multifoods again moved for summary judgment.cu argued that material issues of fact about the events in russia precluded summary judgment.it also at this juncture asserted that the special note excluded coverage for multifoods loss.in an october,reported opinion,international multifoods,supp d at,the district court held that the facts adduced at discovery demonstrated that multifoods had incurred a compensable loss under the cu policy and that cu had no defense to multifoods claim.it rejected cu special note argument,holding that only clauses of the london form were incorporated into the cu policy as exclusions.international multifoods,d at.accordingly,it granted summary judgment to multifoods,and awarded full damages under the cu policy of plus appropriate interest 
an additional insurance policy is involved in this litigation.defendant indemnity insurance company of north america iina had issued a policy the iina policy directly to multifoods covering,among other things,the ozark shipment.in the district court,multifoods named iina as a defendant,and cu asserted a against iina arguing that if both cu and iina were liable for indemnification under their respective policies,iina should be required to indemnify multifoods.as a defense to the claims of multifoods and cu,iina asserted that the clause the fc s clause of the iina policy barred any recovery.that clause provides that n otwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary this insurance is warranted free from capture,seizure,arrest,restraint and the consequences thereof whether in time of peace or war and whether lawful or otherwise emphasis added.as we discuss more fully below,multifoods and cu contended in the district court that while the fc s clause would by its terms appear to exclude coverage,it was rendered inapplicable to these facts by other provisions of the iina policy.the district court,however,rejected this argument.in an orally rendered decision confirmed by an order,the district court granted summary judgment to iina on this issue,holding that the fc s clause excluded from coverage the seizure of multifoods cargo and dismissing all claims against iina.
on appeal,cu argues that i the district court erred in holding that multifoods had as a prima facie matter demonstrated that it had incurred a covered loss under the cu policy ii even if multifoods incurred a covered loss,the district court erred in holding that neither the war exclusion clause nor the special note excluded the loss from coverage and iii the district court erred in granting summary judgment to iina.multifoods does not itself appeal the grant of summary judgment to iina.
standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate only where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.proc.c celotex catrett,d alexander alexander,v.these certain underwriters at lloyd,london,cir.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,and we,like the district court,must view a ll facts,inferences,and ambiguities in a light most favorable to the nonmovant.alexander alexander,at citing matsushita electric industrial zenith radio,d.
under new york law,the initial interpretation of a contract is a matter of law for the court to decide.bell,lloyd underwriters,cir quoting readco,marine midland bank,cir.the key inquiry at this initial interpretation stage is whether the contract is unambiguous with respect to the question disputed by the parties.an ambiguity exists where the terms of an insurance contract could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs,practices,usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.morgan stanley group new eng.ins,cir quoting lightfoot union carbide,cir.if an ambiguity is found,the court may accept any available extrinsic evidence to ascertain the meaning intended by the parties during the formation of the contract.id.at quoting alexander alexander,at.we have explained that i f the court finds that the contract is not ambiguous it should assign the plain and ordinary meaning to each term and interpret the contract without the aid of extrinsic evidence and it may then award summary judgment.alexander alexander,at.bearing these principles in mind,we turn to the issues raised under the two insurance policies at issue here.
ii.the cu policy 
a.did the district court properly find that multifoods had made a prima facie case that the loss fell within the scope of the policy 
as the district court correctly observed,multifoods,as an insured,has the burden of establishing a prima facie case for recovery by proving the existence of an policy,an insurable interest in the subject of the insurance contract,and the fortuitous loss of the covered property.international multifoods,d at citing farr man coffee chester,wl,at deriving these three requirements from controlling federal and new york law.in this case,there is no dispute that the cu policy is an policy and that multifoods,by endorsement,has an insurable interest through the cu policy in the seized cargo.the sole issue is whether multifoods has suffered a fortuitous loss.cu argues that multifoods has not demonstrated a fortuitous loss because the evidence does not specifically explain what happened to the goods after the seizure by the russian authorities and therefore does not prove a loss.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
the burden on the insured with respect to demonstrating a fortuitous loss under an policy such as the cu policy is relatively light 
all risk coverage covers all losses which are fortuitous no matter what caused the loss,including the insured negligence,unless the insured expressly advises otherwise.a loss is fortuitous unless it results from an inherent defect,ordinary wear and tear,or intentional misconduct of the insured.an insured satisfies its burden of proving that its loss resulted from an insured peril if the cargo was damaged while the policy was in force and the loss was fortuitous all risk open cargo policies provide broad coverage for shippers.
ingersoll milling machine bodena,cir,cert.denied,d internal citation omitted.multifoods thus needs only to show a fortuitous loss it need not explain the precise cause of the loss.see in re balfour maclaine int l,cir in order to recover under an all risk policy,the burden of proof is on the insured to prove a fortuitous loss of the covered property.the insured,however,need not prove the cause of the loss.internal citations omitted.
here,the issue largely relates to whether multifoods has demonstrated a loss,rather than to whether such loss should be characterized as fortuitous.we agree with cu and with the district court,which made this point through a hypothetical at oral argument,see joint appendix at that the mere seizure of the goods would not by itself have constituted a loss triggering coverage under the cu policy in the sense that coverage obviously would not have been triggered if the cargo had been returned to multifoods the day after the seizure at little or no cost to multifoods.however,the fact that multifoods was unable to recover the goods despite substantial effort is in our view sufficient to support the conclusion that the seizure of multifoods cargo constituted a fortuitous loss within the meaning of the cu dispossession from the property was never remedied,and resulted in a considerable financial loss to multifoods.see pan american world airways,aetna casualty surety.cir when a peril results in the owner losing control over insured property,any subsequent damage to or loss of the property is attributable to the peril causing the loss of control.magoun new england marine ins,fed.cas,story,circuit justice where a vessel and its goods were confiscated by foreign authorities and the vessel was later returned virtually ruined by deterioration while in the custody of the authorities,the shipper had suffered a loss within meaning of insurance policy because the restraint and detainment under the seizure rather than the long delay and exposure to the climate was the proximate cause of the loss.
in pan american world airways,we held that the seizure of an airplane over london by hijackers was the proximate cause of the loss of the airplane,even though the airplane was blown up only after having been flown to beirut and then to cairo,and even though the passengers had already left the plane prior to its explosion.pan american world airways,at.the present case is distinguishable from pan american world airways and magoun in that the actual destruction or destination of the cargo in this case has never been verified.nonetheless,we agree with the district court that the principle of pan american world airways controls here to make the seizure the proximate cause of multifoods loss.the pan american world airways court specifically cited cases which recognize the principle that the taking characterizes the loss.id.at.while these cases generally involve a confirmed destruction of the insured property,they recognize that from the perspective of the insured,the real loss if never the loss of control that occurs upon a dispossession.given that there is no dispute that multifoods lost possession of the cargo upon the seizure by the russian authorities and given that multifoods unsuccessfully exerted diligent effort to regain its cargo,the seizure effectively created a loss for multifoods we thus partially affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to multifoods,and hold that there is no dispute of material fact with respect to whether multifoods has established its prima facie claim for indemnity under the cu policy.
b.the war exclusion clause 
while we thus agree with the district court that multifoods has incurred a loss within the meaning of the cu policy,we respectfully differ with the district court holding that there is no dispute of material fact with respect to whether the war exclusion clause excludes multifoods loss from coverage.for convenience,we once again set forth the text of the war exclusion clause 
in no case shall this insurance cover loss damage or expense caused by 
war civil war revolution rebellion insurrection,or civil strife arising therefrom,or any hostile act by or against a belligerent power 
capture seizure arrest restraint or detainment piracy excepted,and the consequences thereof or any attempt thereat 
derelict mines torpedoes bombs or other derelict weapons of war.
as noted above,to the right of clause appears italicized language identifying clause as the war exclusion clause.
multifoods argues that the context of clause and the marginal caption make clear that clause applies only to events occurring during wartime or during one of the other conflicts listed in clause.cu,by contrast,contends that clause by its plain terms applies to any governmental seizure of goods,irrespective of whether such seizure occurs during wartime or peacetime.the district court agreed with multifoods 
the meaning of clause is clear and unambiguous.the risks discussed throughout are risks.the caption and subdivision plainly say so,and subdivision sets out various species of war subdivision describes applications or consequences of war affecting insured property and subdivision extends the exclusion to the of the detritus of war,the consequences of derelict mines,torpedoes and bombs.
international multifoods,d at.
we share the district court view that the fact that the caption titles clause the war exclusion clause supports multifoods interpretation of the clause.captions are relevant to contract interpretation.see mazzaferro rli ins,cir internal quotations omitted a contract of insurance must be read as a whole,including any introductory clause or heading,to determine the intent of the parties.we also agree that the fact that clause proclaims that it deals with derelict weapons of war supports the inference that clause deals exclusively with perils.however,for the reasons that follow,we can not conclude that the war exclusion clause unambiguously applies only to wartime seizures.
although the caption and the content of clauses and support multifoods argument,several other aspects of the language of the war exclusion clause bolster cu position that clause excludes even peacetime seizures,and at a minimum suggest the existence of an ambiguity.first and most importantly,as noted above,the plain language of clause is global and unqualified.the fact that clause explicitly provides that i n no case shall this insurance cover loss damage or expense caused by capture seizure arrest restraint or detainment piracy excepted,and the consequences thereof or any attempt thereat,is arguably by itself enough to demonstrate that the terms of the contract at least suggest,morgan stanley,at,that peacetime seizures are excluded.second,if,as the district court held,clause excludes from coverage only seizures caused by war,international multifoods,d at,it would appear to serve no purpose in light of the fact that clause already excludes from coverage all damage caused by war civil war revolution rebellion insurrection,or civil strife arising therefrom emphasis added.we disfavor contract interpretations that render provisions of a contract superfluous.see scholastic,harris,cir quoting sayers rochester.supplemental mgmt.pension plan,cir in determining whether a contract is ambiguous,a court must look at the entire integrated agreement,to safeguard against adopting an interpretation that would render any individual provision superfluous.galli metz,cir quoting garza marine transport lines,cir under new york law an interpretation of a contract that has the effect of rendering at least one clause superfluous or meaningless is not preferred and will be avoided if possible.lawyers fund for client protection of state of bank leumi trust,bank leumi interpretation would render the second paragraph superfluous,a view unsupportable under standard principles of contract interpretation.
finally,while we agree that the caption supports multifoods argument that the war exclusion clause applies only to wartime seizures,we note that multifoods heavy reliance on the caption is undercut somewhat by the fact that the london form exclusion clause that immediately follows the war exclusion clause contains language broader than implied by its caption.clause is titled the strikes exclusion clause.however,while clauses and relate to labor strikes,clause excludes damage caused by any terrorist or any person acting from a political motive.thus,the clause caption obviously does not intend exhaustively to subsume the entire scope of clause.this supports cu view that the war exclusion clause title merely reflects an attempt to choose a caption that embodies an important theme of the clause rather than serving as an indication that the clause excludes only wartime situations.
hence,while both the caption read in a vacuum and the frequent references in clause to war and to perils that are clearly associated with war support multifoods interpretation of the clause,other textual arguments favor cu interpretation.we must consider the caption in tandem with the actual contractual provisions.see couch on insurance ed.while the caption or designation of the type of policy does not broaden the coverage expressed in the body of the policy,the policy must be considered as a whole and the caption read in connection with the remainder of the contents and a n index of the policy contents forms a part of the contract and should be construed with the detailed provisions of the policy to which it refers.given the competing inferences that can be drawn from the language of the cu policy,we believe that the district court erred in holding that the war exclusion clause unambiguously applied only to wartime seizures.we therefore remand to the district court for determination of the intent of the parties with respect to the meaning of the war exclusion clause.we note that because the contract is facially ambiguous,the district court may consider any evidence that is probative of the parties intent,including parol evidence and evidence of custom and usage see morgan stanley,at once a court concludes that an insurance provision is ambiguous,the court may accept any available extrinsic evidence to ascertain the meaning intended by the parties during the formation of the contract.quoting alexander alexander,at.
c.the special note 
as noted above,an additional issue on appeal relates to the relevance,if any,of the special note that appears at the end of the london form and provides as follows 
special note this insurance does not cover loss damage or expense caused by embargo,or by rejection prohibition or detention by the government of the country of import or their agencies or departments,but does not exclude loss of or damage to the insured caused by risks insured hereunder and sustained prior to any such embargo rejection prohibition or detention.
cu argues that the special note either i by itself excludes multifoods loss from coverage or ii serves to explain that the war exclusion clause excludes multifoods loss from coverage.
we believe that ambiguities exist with respect to the scope,meaning,and force of the special note.the language of the special note supports cu interpretation of the cu policy,providing that t his insurance does not cover loss damage or expense caused by rejection prohibition or detention by the government of the country of import.however,the force of the special note is very unclear.it does not appear to be an operative provision of the london form certainly it is not an exclusion in the sense that the war exclusion clause is an exclusion indeed,clause of the london form specifically provides that the insured has coverage subject to clauses,and,which clauses all have captions that describe them as exclusions there is no reference to the special note as an exclusion.the special note reads almost like an interpretive comment which could be a useful aid in interpreting the form.however,in the words of the district court,the cu policy is a document,i ts insuring clauses,exceptions and exclusions a re repetitive and inconsistent,and t he of clauses,from and to indorsements,special indorsements,specimen clauses and appendices increase s the interpretive difficulty.international multifoods,d at.given this background,it is difficult to determine how much interpretive weight the special note should be accorded.
at the end of the day,we do not believe that it is possible satisfactorily to determine the relevance or force of the special note only on the basis of the cu policy itself.resort to extrinsic evidence bearing on the intent of the parties with respect to the force of the speci
