introduction 
plaintiffs zhang guimei et,sri huntati et,shi haiyan et and xiang cheng et appeal from an order staying their consolidated actions on the ground of forum non conveniens.the order was made on the motion of defendants general electric,bombardier,bombardier aerospace and china eastern airlines.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
a.the parties and the airplane crash 
on november,china eastern yunnan airlines ceya flight,flying from baotou in inner mongolia to shanghai,crashed into a lake shortly after takeoff.passengers,six crew members and two people on the ground were killed.with the exception of one indonesian passenger,all of the victims were chinese citizens.all of the passengers purchased their tickets in china.all of the crew members were licensed by the general civil aviation administration of china 
ceya hub of operations and repair and maintenance facilities were located at wu jia ba airport in kunming,yunnan,china.the airplane involved in the crash was operated and maintained in china exclusively.in may,defendant china eastern airlines,cea acquired ceya assets.cea is a commercial airline incorporated in china,with its principal place of business,engineering and maintenance facilities in shanghai,china.
the airplane was a bombardier crj lr regional jet,designed,manufactured,assembled and tested in canada by defendant bombardier,bombardier.bombardier is a canadian corporation with its principal place of business in montreal,quebec,canada.bombardier does not conduct business in california.it sold the airplane to china aviation supplies import and export corporation in quebec in.
defendant bombardier aerospace corporation bombardier aerospace is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in richardson,texas.it did not design,manufacture,assemble,sell or service the airplane.
the airplane was powered by two model turbojet engines designed and manufactured by defendant general electric ge.ge is incorporated in new york and has its principal place of business in fairfield,connecticut.the engines were not designed,manufactured,assembled,tested or shipped in california.
b.the complaints and the forum non conveniens motion 
on august,huntati filed suit against ge,bombardier,bombardier aerospace and cea as the surviving spouse,and guardian ad litem of the minor child of one of the crash victims.on november,cheng and other relatives of one of the crash victims filed suit against ge,bombardier,bombardier aerospace and cea on their behalf and on behalf of the decedent minor child.also on november,guimei and other relatives of crash victims filed suit against ge,bombardier,bombardier aerospace and cea.
these three cases were ordered related to one another and assigned to the same judge on january.they were ordered consolidated on february.
on february,cea moved to dismiss,or in the alternative stay,the actions on the ground of forum non conveniens motion.cea claimed california was not a convenient forum for trial of the actions,and china provided an adequate alternative forum for trial.ge,bombardier and bombardier aerospace joined in the motion to dismiss.
thereafter,on november,haiyan and other relatives of crash victims filed suit against ge,bombardier,bombardier aerospace and cea.this action was consolidated with the other three on march.defendants moved to dismiss,or in the alternative stay,this action as well on the ground of forum non conveniens.
as part of their motion,cea made a commitment that,if the motion were granted,it would not contest liability in the four actions in the chinese courts completely compensate the plaintiffs in accordance with chinese law and not seek to enforce limitations on wrongful death damages waive any applicable statutes of limitations so long as the actions were refiled in china within six months of the dismissal or stay be bound by and satisfy any judgment in the chinese court following any appropriate appeals.
ge,bombardier and bombardier aerospace similarly agreed they would submit to personal jurisdiction in china waive any applicable statutes of limitations so long as the actions were refiled in china within six months of the dismissal or stay accept service of process comply with discovery orders and satisfy any final judgment in the chinese court.
while the motion was pending,the parties attempted to negotiate a settlement.when a dispute arose as to whether the parties had an enforceable settlement agreement,plaintiffs amended their complaints to allege that cea breached the agreement.they later dismissed these claims,however.
c.the trial court ruling 
the trial court granted defendants motion and stayed the consolidated actions for the purpose of permitting proceedings in china.it scheduled status conferences every six months in order to monitor the proceedings.the trial court ruling was conditioned on the agreements set forth above.
the trial court explained that the first issue to be resolved was whether there was a suitable alternative forum in which plaintiffs could obtain a judgment against defendants,one in which defendants are subject to the court jurisdiction and the cause of action is not barred by the statute of limitations.stangvik shiley cal d,fn,d.here,defendants unquestionably are subject to the jurisdiction of the chinese courts,and they agreed to waive the statute of limitations.this makes china a suitable forum,even if california law is more favorable to plaintiffs or recovery would be more difficult in china.shiley superior court th,d stangvik,supra,at,d.
an exception to this rule arises if the remedy provided by the alternative forum is so inadequate as to amount to no remedy at all.this exception may arise where the alternative forum is in a foreign country controlled by a totalitarian regime in which there is no independent judiciary or due process of law.piper aircraft reyno,fn,d shiley superior court,supra,th at fn,d.the question before the court was whether the exception applies here.plaintiffs claimed it did,and that they could not get a fair trial in china.
the trial court rejected this claim.it noted that plaintiffs present evidence from distinguished academics providing anecdotal evidence,or evidence about the chinese judicial system record on issues of human rights and political dissidents,and cases involving challenges to governmental actions.plaintiffs present evidence that cea is a entity,the government is seeking to encourage foreign companies like bombardier and ge to invest,the courts are under communist party leadership,cases are often subject to local protectionism,trials are not public in the sense we understand openness,lower courts seek advice or instruction from a higher court without informing the parties,there is corruption among judges,and judges are often uneducated.
the trial court agreed that s ome or all of these factors may be serious problems in the chinese judicial system.it was not persuaded to the contrary by defendants evidence that this case is likely to be filed in shanghai,a sophisticated jurisdiction with educated judges and numerous lawyers,china follows the rule of law,enterprises lose many civil suits in china,plaintiffs prevail in of administrative claims against the government,litigants in shanghai often perceive their case to properly turn on facts and law and not improper influences,and local protectionism is a problem that is less likely in shanghai.
the trial court was not persuaded by the general evidence submitted by both sides.the evidence shows a legal system in the growing stages,not a fully mature legal system endowed with judges and juries who follow the rule of law where ever it leads.but this did not establish that plaintiffs would be unlikely to get basic justice if the case were to be tried in china.plaintiffs failed to present evidence of a personal injury or wrongful death case against a government owned or controlled entity that has been the subject of the manipulation and interference they fear.nor have they presented admissible evidence that they are likely to be mistreated.
the trial court acknowledged that plaintiffs presented evidence that their lawyers were interrogated by local police officials when they interviewed prospective clients.this was some evidence of local protectionism.but,the trial court concluded,it pales compared to the strong evidence that plaintiffs will receive fundamental justice in china.the best evidence is that the chinese government investigation found cea responsible for the crash and cea officials have been sanctioned.for this reason,the trial court found it highly likely that plaintiffs will recover and the courts will not be confronted with local protectionism or communist party influence.
the trial court also noted that cea had agreed not to contest liability and had already paid million to settle claims arising from water contamination caused by the crash.there was no evidence cea had exerted any kind of political influence against the plaintiffs or their representatives.there was no evidence of any sinister conduct on the part of cea with respect to this lawsuit or the parties thereto.the court also found no reason to suspect there would be government interference in the litigation against bombardier,bombardier aerospace and ge.
the trial court then considered the second issue before it,a balancing of the private interests of the litigants against the public interest in retaining the litigation in california.it concluded that california had little or no interest in this case.there are no witnesses or documents in california,whereas there are witnesses and evidence in china.california has no interest in requiring its courts and juries to hear a case having no nexus to it.
discussion 
standard of review 
just as the trial court determination of a forum non conveniens motion is a process,review of that determination requires two separate steps.first,we determine whether substantial evidence supports the trial court finding as to whether a suitable alternative forum exists.see stangvik shiley,supra,cal d at,d.in making this determination,there is no balancing of interests or exercise of discretion.boaz boyle th,d.
second,we review the trial court determination on balancing private and public interests for abuse of discretion.morris agfa th,d.we will only interfere with a trial court exercise of discretion where we find that under all the evidence,viewed most favorably in support of the trial court action,no judge could have reasonably reached the challenged result.citation.a s long as there exists a reasonable or even fairly debatable justification,under the law,for the action taken,such action will not be set aside citations.conservatorship of scharles d.
whether china is an adequate alternative forum for litigation of plaintiffs product liability claims 
an alternative forum is suitable if it has jurisdiction and the action in that forum will not be barred by the statute of limitations.morris agfa,supra,th at,d.it bears emphasis that i t is sufficient that the action can be brought,although not necessarily won,in the suitable alternative forum.roman liberty university,th,d.that the law is less favorable to the plaintiffs in the alternative forum,or that recovery would be more difficult if not impossible,is irrelevant to the determination whether the forum is suitable unless the alternative forum provides no remedy at all.stangvik shiley,supra,cal d at,d,roman,supra,at,d boaz boyle,supra,th at,d.
the no remedy at all exception applies only in rare circumstances,such as where the alternative forum is a foreign country whose courts are ruled by a dictatorship,so that there is no independent judiciary or due process of law.shiley superior court,supra,th at,d.this exception has been applied in cases where the proposed alternative forum is in a foreign country that lacks an independent judiciary.id.at,fn,d.for example,in rasoulzadeh associated press,the court held that an alternative forum in iran was not available since the courts there were administered by iranian mullahs and the plaintiffs were likely to be shot if they returned to iran.similarly in phoenix canada oil texaco,the court found that ecuador was not a suitable forum since it did not have an independent judiciary.courts controlled by a military junta in chile were likewise found unsuitable.canada overseas ores compania.chong superior court th,d.
however,as cases cited by plaintiffs make clear,in order to defeat a forum non conveniens motion,plaintiffs must show more than general allegations of corruption,lack of due process or other factors making an alternative forum unsuitable.for example,in eastman kodak kavlin,the court dealt with the question whether corruption in bolivian courts precluded application of forum non conveniens to allow trial of the matter in bolivia.the court noted that generalized allegations of corruption do not enjoy a particularly impressive track record.id.at.in the case before it,however,plaintiffs not only presented evidence of corruption but also alleged that defendant was and ha d already used the criminal justice system to extort a commercial settlement from one plaintiff,as well as to obtain criminal convictions of the plaintiff employees.id.at.against this evidence,the court ruled that the defendants had not met their burden of proving that bolivia was a suitable alternative forum.id.at.
similarly,in daventree republic of azerbaijan d,the court found that i n contrast with general allegations of corruption,the possibility that the sovereign defendants could dictate the outcome of this dispute through their control over azeri courts would effectively foreclose the plaintiffs right to pursue their claims and render the azerbaijan courts an inadequate forum.id.at.
with respect to chinese courts,plaintiffs claim that there is increasing recognition that chinese courts are.the cases they cite do not support their claim,much less a claim that the no remedy at all exception applies.
in s d trading academy,llc aafis,d,the court found that china was a suitable alternative forum,in that chinese law recognized plaintiffs causes of action,and defendant agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the chinese court.id.at.the court did refer to the current nationwide concern about china lackadaisical enforcement of intellectual property rights,but this was in the context of the balancing of public and private interests,the court noting that this concern heightens local interest in cases in which international corporations are accused of wrongfully using and profiting from intellectual property.id.at,fn.
in bp chemicals limited jiangsu sopo d,the court found china to be an inadequate forum.however,this finding,too,was based upon a balancing of public and private interests,particularly plaintiff choice of forum.additionally,the court found defendant failed to meet its burden of proving all elements necessary for the court to dismiss a claim based on forum non conveniens.id.at.
in other cases,china has been accepted as a suitable alternative forum.in sinochem int l malaysia int l shipping,d,the court found the litigation should be dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds based on the pendency of litigation in china.id.at.in china tire holdings goodyear tire and rubber d,the court gave collateral estoppel effect to a prior holding that plaintiff claims most appropriately would be adjudicated in china.id.at.in in re compania naviera joanna d,the court noted that w hile a description of the prospects for pursuing litigation in china paints an unrosy picture for claimants,it does not suggest that they are left without a remedy.id.at.
this brings us to a consideration of the evidence presented in the instant case on whether china is a suitable alternative forum.as stated above,the question is whether substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that china is a suitable alternative forum.see stangvik shiley,supra,cal d at,d.substantial evidence is evidence of ponderable legal significance.bowers bernards d.
the trial court,as trier of fact,has the duty to weigh and interpret the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom.in re cheryl d.we can not reweigh the evidence or draw contrary inferences.ranch superior court th,d in re cheryl,supra,at.we presume the trial court found every fact and drew every reasonable inference necessary to support its determination.provencio wma securities,th,d.we can not reject evidence accepted by the trial court as true unless it is physically impossible or its falsity is obvious without resort to inference or deduction.dipirro bondo th,d.
in support of their forum non conveniens motion,defendants presented the declarations of randall peerenboom peerenboom and jacques delisle delisle.peerenboom is a professor of law at ucla,where he has taught on chinese law.he has written extensively on chinese law,has worked with chinese law firms and has been an expert witness on chinese law.
peerenboom opined that that the chinese courts available to plaintiffs provide an adequate forum in this case.this opinion was based,in part,on chinese law which provides procedures for multiparty commercial litigation and a right to appeal.it also was based on plaintiffs ability to choose the venue for the litigation.the choices included shanghai,where cea headquarters were located,whose intermediate court is experienced in handling cases such as the instant one.
peerenboom disagreed with plaintiffs experts attempt to put the entire chinese legal system on trial.he pointed out that most of the problems with the chinese legal system arose in politically sensitive cases as opposed to commercial cases such as the instant one.additionally,evidence showed corruption in chinese courts was decreasing and was less than that of courts in other countries with similar levels of per capita income.
peerenboom also noted substantial monetary awards to airplane crash victims in another case,no basis for concern about local protectionism in shanghai courts,and the availability of counsel in china able to represent plaintiffs.he concluded that t he problems and issues discussed at length by the plaintiffs and their experts are either not applicable in this case or not a bar to a fair trial.
delisle is a professor at the university of pennsylvania school of law,who teaches on chinese law,has authored numerous publications and has been an expert witness on chinese law.delisle opined that the declarations of plaintiffs experts paint a picture of the chinese judiciary and legal system that is far darker than the relevant reality warrants and rely on examples and interpretations that are misleading or potentially so.to the contrary,in a case with the characteristics of this case,brought in the chinese courts in which plaintiffs could bring this case,plaintiffs would have adequate legal remedies.
in particular,delisle pointed to the increase in foreign investment in china,which has created a need for a sophisticated,legal system.china now has many large law firms as well as branch offices of foreign law firms.delisle noted that while practice in china has frustrations and disappointments,it is not consistent with plaintiffs picture of a deeply flawed legal system irreconcilable with the professional norms and experiences of lawyers trained in the united states and other western countries.
like peerenboom,delisle pointed out that shanghai boasts a legal system superior to that in other areas of china.it has a high percentage of large and foreign law firms and lawyers educated at elite universities,as well as judges who are far better and more professionally educated than their counterparts in most of china.additionally,courts in shanghai have experience handling cases involving multiple plaintiffs.
according to delisle,l ocal protectionism and related phenomena are significant problems in china,but they are not nearly as pervasive as plaintiffs imagine.for a number of reasons,they are not a problem in shanghai.the courts there serve the entire province and are more professional than in other areas.additionally,cea is not a local company but is owned by a holding company which is a central body which holds a vast portfolio of interests.further,defendants are not major components of the local key factor in local protectionism.
delisle also noted that china long ago abandoned the idea that enterprises much less partly ones are immune from legal liability in chinese or foreign courts.or largely enterprises lose many civil lawsuits in china.the chinese government increasingly has emphasized the need for the law and courts to protect consumers and ordinary chinese against harms caused by illegal,careless or otherwise behavior by enterprises.
plaintiffs go to great lengths to attack the credibility of peerenboom and delisle as compared to that of their own experts,whose declarations painted a completely different picture of the legal system in china.however,a determination as to whether substantial evidence supports the trial court findings does not require that the evidence appear to the appellate court to outweigh the contrary showing.people javier cal d,department of parks recreation state personnel bd.d.
plaintiffs also argue that the trial court improperly overlooked the chinese legal system inability to adjudicate complex product liability claims.in support of their argument,they rely on the declaration of one of their experts.however,the testimony of delisle and peerenboom supports a conclusion that chinese least in shanghai,where plaintiffs may bring their in fact capable of adjudicating complex product liability claims.the judges and attorneys are and sophisticated,and they have experience in complex,litigation,including litigation involving airplane crashes.
as stated above,it is the trial court,as trier of fact,which must weigh and interpret the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom.in re cheryl,supra,d at.we can not reweigh the evidence or draw contrary inferences.ranch superior court,supra,th at,d in re cheryl,supra,at.neither can we reject evidence accepted by the trial court as true unless it is physically impossible or its falsity is obvious without resort to inference or deduction.watson department of rehabilitation d.the evidence of peerenboom and delisle does not fall into this category.we thus must accept it as substantial evidence in support of the trial court finding that china,indeed,provides a suitable alternative forum for this litigation.
whether the trial court abused its discretion in finding trial of plaintiffs claims in california would be so inconvenient as to justify granting the motion 
once it is determined that there is a suitable alternative forum,the trial court must weigh the private interests of the parties against the interests of the public in retaining the action in california.stangvik shiley,supra,cal d at,d,morris agfa,supra,th at,d.the private interest factors are those that make trial and the enforceability of the ensuing judgment expeditious and relatively inexpensive,such as the ease of access to sources of proof,the cost of obtaining attendance of witnesses,and the availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses.the public interest factors include avoidance of overburdening local courts with congested calendars,protecting the interests of potential jurors so that they are not called upon to decide cases in which the local community has little concern,and weighing the competing interests of california and the alternate jurisdiction in the litigation.citations.stangvik,supra,at,d,morris,supra,at,d.the trial court has great flexibility in weighing these factors no one factor is determinative.stangvik,supra,at,d,morris,supra,at,d.
we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that california is a seriously inconvenient forum.the trial court found california has little or no interest in this case.there are no witnesses or documents in california,whereas there are witnesses and evidence in china.california has no interest in requiring its courts and juries to hear a case having no nexus to it.see,china tire holdings goodyear tire and rubber,supra,d at.
these private interest factors support the conclusion that china is the more convenient forum.the events that are subject to this action occurred exclusively in china.it is thus reasonable to assume that there will be more chinese witnesses than united states witnesses if any.moreover,the relevant evide
