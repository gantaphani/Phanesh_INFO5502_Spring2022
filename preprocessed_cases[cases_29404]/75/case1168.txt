introduction 
plaintiff and appellant rick auerbach,in his capacity as the los angeles county assessor assessor,levied,enrolled a property tax assessment on a business jet aircraft owned by real party in interest cke associates cke that included a hypothetical sales tax as an element of value.cke appealed the assessment to the respondent los angeles county assessment appeals board appeals board.the appeals board found that cke aircraft was exempt from sales tax based on its use by a common carrier,that the assessor therefore improperly included the sales tax figure as an element of value,and that the assessment should be reduced accordingly.the assessor filed a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus in the trial court seeking to overturn the decision of the appeals board.the trial court denied the petition.
on appeal from the judgment of the trial court,the assessor argues that the use of cke aircraft as an,unscheduled air taxi did not qualify it for the common carrier exemption from sales tax.in the alternative,the assessor contends that there is no evidence in the administrative record that cke aircraft was operated in a manner that qualified it for the common carrier exemption as of the january valuation date.
we hold that i the use of cke aircraft as an unscheduled air taxi qualified it under the definition of a common carrier,even though the aircraft was not a commercial aircraft used for scheduled airline operations ii based on its use by a common carrier,cke aircraft was exempt from sales tax iii the assessor did not carry his burden of proof to show that cke aircraft was not operated by a common carrier as of the january valuation date and iv an amount attributed to sales tax should not have been included in the assessor valuation of cke aircraft.we therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.
factual and procedural background 
on july,cke purchased a gulfstream aerospace business jet aircraft,serial number aircraft from gulfstream aerospace corporation in savannah,georgia for.cke entered into an agreement with elite aviation,llc elite,which had an air carrier certificate authorizing it to operate as an air carrier and conduct common carriage operations in accordance with said act federal aviation act of.pursuant to the agreement,elite would charter the aircraft to third parties on behalf of cke,which did not have an air carrier certificate.cke also authorized another company comparable to elite,avjet corporation avjet,to operate the aircraft under the same federal regulations applicable to elite.it is not uncommon for private individuals or companies owning corporate jets,as here,to enter into agreements with charter companies to charter the jets for use by third parties when the owners are not using the jets.
in april,the state board of equalization sbe sent cke a letter stating,the state board of equalization administers the sales and use tax law.the purchase of an aircraft for use,storage,or other consumption in this state is subject to sales or use tax.a purchase from a licensed dealer is subject to sales tax payable by the dealer directly to the board of equalization.all other purchases are subject to use tax payable by the purchaser.there is no indication in our records that your purchase was a dealer sale.therefore,your purchase appears subject to use tax.if you made your purchase through a broker and did not pay use tax,or your purchase was from a private party,you must complete the enclosed return form and mail it with the payment of the use tax due.the enclosed instructions contain information regarding possible exemptions from the use tax.bold emphasis omitted.
cke responded by filing a use tax return for aircraft seeking an exemption from use tax as a common carrier.in january,the sbe sent cke a letter requesting documentation that would establish that the principal use of the aircraft was as a common carrier during the first twelve months of operational use.cke replied in february with a letter that enclosed the information that the sbe requested in its letter dated january.according to cke,o ut of the operational hours that the aircraft flew in the first months of use,hours were charter hours.in may,the sbe sent cke a letter advising that the information received from cke has enabled the sbe to close cke consumer use tax file 
in october,the assessor sent cke a notice of enrollment of escape assessment for the year year in which an assessment presumably had already been made.the amount of the assessment was.on november,the assessor enrolled the escape assessment and notified cke of its right to appeal.according to cke,the assessment was based on so called underreported costs that consisted of a theoretical sales tax on the value of the aircraft.
in january,cke filed an application for changed assessment in which cke contended that because the aircraft purchase was exempt from california sales or use tax and no california sales or use tax have sic ever been payable on this aircraft there is no justification in fact or law to impose a property tax based on a theoretical sales or use tax which has never been assessed or paid.
cke also requested an opinion from the sbe regarding the propriety of the escape assessment on its aircraft.the sbe provided the following opinion w e conclude that cke aircraft was exempt from sales and use tax when it was purchased and when it was valued by the assessor so long as cke is a common carrier as defined and implemented by the california code of regulations,title,section.
the appeals board held a hearing on cke application for a change in the escape assessment.cke appeared through its tax agent,david lucero,who introduced several of the documents discussed above into the record,including the correspondence with the sbe showing that cke had established an exemption from use tax as a common carrier in and the opinion letter from the sbe stating that cke aircraft should be valued without including sales tax.in addition,lucero presented excerpts from sections of the assessors handbook issued by the sbe for use by the local boards of equalization and assessors those excerpts stated that because aircraft operated by common carriers are exempt from sales or use tax,they should be valued without any sales tax component lucero also introduced the air carrier certificates that authorized elite and avjet to operate cke aircraft as an air carrier.on,lucero admitted that cke was not in the aircraft business and that he was unaware of the line of business in which cke was engaged.
carol ruwart,senior tax counsel with the sbe legal department,opined that all aircraft operated by air carriers are equally situated and should be treated for purposes of property tax assessment as being at the same trade level.according to ruwart,the common carrier exemption creates essentially a trade level of its own,a subgroup.ruwart concluded that so long as an aircraft is operated in a manner that qualifies as a common carrier sales tax should not be an element of value.
the assessor supervising appraiser for the marine aircraft section,ira litchman,explained that the assessor considers only two trade levels for carriers such as delta,united,and southwest and general aviation aircraft.the aircraft of commercial carriers are valued using a methodology based on the amount of time in the county,landings and take offs and ground time general aviation aircraft are assessed at percent of market value using the aircraft blue book price digest and various adjustments that are required.normal adjustments for general aviation aircraft,including cke aircraft,include adjustments for engine and airframe hours maintenance service plans a reduction off the market value in blue book guides to account for an average condition for the aircraft and sales tax according to litchman,a common carrier is generally understood to be a commercial airline,not a charter company,and therefore the common carrier exemption from sales or use tax applied only to commercial airlines.
litchman indicated that he and his staff researched cke and determined that it was formed by michael ovitz and that it was composed of four separate companies that represented artists and persons in the entertainment industry.litchman believed the aircraft was a business jet owned by cke and that cke was not a commercial air carrier or a charter business.
litchman determined from the federal aviation administration website that cke leased the aircraft to elite to charter the aircraft out.he opined that a majority of the corporate jets in the county are privately owned,but leased to charter companies to use when the owners are not using them to help defray the costs associated with maintenance and operation of the aircraft.
litchman asserted that there was no evidence that cke aircraft was being operated by a common carrier as of the lien date in issue,january.instead,it appeared to him that the aircraft was exempted from sales or use tax at the time of its purchase in because it was purchased out of state,not because cke was a common carrier.he also understood that cke aircraft was not a certificated aircraft,as that term is used in revenue and taxation code section,because,based on his understanding,that section refers to commercial airlines.
the appeals board issued its findings of fact and noted that cke agreed to all of the elements of the assessor calculation of the value of cke aircraft except the sales tax trade level adjustment.the appeals board made the following findings the board finds that the assessor primary basis for finding that this aircraft should have a sales tax component added is not justified.the assessor agrees that the subject aircraft is a certified common carrier,but that it is an unscheduled air taxi,the assessor has relied on revenue and taxation code section c.the board finds that the assessor reliance on this section is ill founded.the board believes that this code section is intended to only differentiate between scheduled commercial carriers and air taxis for the methodology to be use sic for allocation purposes.the board agrees with letters and testimony of the sbe that as long as this aircraft is continued to be used as a common carrier it is exempt from the addition of sales tax as component of value.the board finds that the assessor is correct that he may question that the use of the aircraft still meets the standards set by the sbe to be a common carrier as defined by regulation on the annual lien date.in this matter,the assessor is wrong that the applicant has the burden of proof.the addition of sales tax was by a roll change and the assessor has the burden.the assessor presented no evidence that the aircraft was not still being used as a common carrier.therefore,the board finds for a total value of.
the assessor filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus in the trial court challenging the appeals board decision on the valuation issue.the trial court agreed with the appeals board that the assessor had the burden of proof in the administrative proceeding,and denied the petition.the trial court reasoned that the regulation defines a common carrier as,any person who engages in the business of transporting persons or property for hire or compensation and who offers his or her services indiscriminately to the public or to some portion of the public.ccr section a.the decision of the appeals board is supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record and is not contrary to law.the assessor has failed to carry his burden of proof that the aircraft is not being used as a common carrier or that the price of the aircraft,if purchased by cke on the valuation date,would not be exempt from sales tax.
the trial court entered judgment in favor of cke.the assessor timely filed a notice of appeal from the judgment.

burden of proof 
the parties disagree as to which of them had the burden of proof before the appeals board.the assessor contends that under california code of regulations,title,section he merely had the burden of production,which he satisfied by providing the appeals board with the factual detail of the challenged assessments,together with an analysis of the law and applicable public policy.cke contends that revenue and taxation code section placed the burden of proof on the assessor because the challenged assessment was an escape assessment.see fn,ante.according to cke,it was entitled under revenue and taxation code section to a presumption that its aircraft was operated by a common carrier on the lien date and that the assessor had the burden of proving otherwise.
revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a provides notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,and except as provided in subdivision b,there shall be a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof in favor of the taxpayer or assessee who has supplied all information as required by law to the assessor in any administrative hearing involving the imposition of a tax on an dwelling,the assessment of an dwelling pursuant to this division,or the appeal of an escape assessment.by its express terms,section,in effect,shifts the burden of proof to the assessor in an appeal of an escape assessment.in doing so,the statute creates a rebuttable presumption in favor of cke that cke valuation of its aircraft was correct.see mitchell county of los angeles th,d under revenue and taxation code section,in an administrative hearing involving an dwelling,there is a rebuttable presumption that the owner valuation is correct.in such an instance,the burden is on the county to overcome the presumption.
the assessor reliance on california code of regulations,title,section in support of his burden of proof argument is misplaced.revenue and taxation code section creates for an appeal of an escape assessment an exception set by law to the general rule that it is presumed the a ssessor has properly performed his or her duties,tit,subd.a.california code of regulations,title,section does state that the presumption in favor of the taxpayer may be rebutted by the submission of evidence supporting the assessment.but,in appeals in which the assessor disputes the factual basis of the taxpayer valuation,the assessor submission must,under a reasonable reading of the regulation,include evidence rebutting that factual basis.
in this case,the assessor challenged cke valuation on both legal and factual grounds.the legal challenge asserted either that charter carriers like elite were not common carriers for purposes of the sales tax exemption or that even if cke aircraft was operated by a common carrier,such a status was legally irrelevant to the property tax calculation.according to the assessor,the relevant determination was whether cke aircraft was operated as a scheduled air taxi,in which case the sales tax exemption would apply,or as an unscheduled air taxi,in which case the exemption would not apply 
the assessor factual challenge,however,asserted that,even if unscheduled air taxis could qualify for the common carrier sales tax exemption,cke aircraft was not being operated by a common carrier on the lien date.as to that factual challenge,the assessor had the burden of proof under revenue and taxation code section to show how cke aircraft was being operated on the lien date.
common carrier exemption 
california revenue and taxation code section,subdivision a expressly exempts from sales tax aircraft that are leased to lessees that use the aircraft as common carriers of persons or property see also of,tit,subd.b a b application of tax.aircraft.tax does not apply to the sale of and the storage,use,or other consumption of aircraft sold,leased,or sold to persons for the purpose of leasing,to a a person who operates the aircraft as a common carrier of persons or property,provided.the person operates the aircraft under authority of the laws of this state,of the united states,or of any foreign government,and.the person use of the aircraft as a common carrier is authorized or permitted by the person governmental authority to operate the aircraft the term common carrier means any person who engages in the business of transporting persons or property for hire or compensation and who offers his or her services indiscriminately to the public or to some portion of the public.of,tit,subd.a.
in,cke submitted evidence to the sbe that during the first year of operation,the use of its aircraft met the definition of a common carrier under the sales and use tax law.as a result,the sbe determined that cke aircraft was exempt from use tax.
assuming that cke aircraft qualified for the common carrier exemption on the january,lien factual issue we discuss legal issue is whether sales tax should nevertheless have been included as an element of its market value.according to several opinions from the sbe,a sales tax should not have been included in the assessor valuation.for example,in september,the sbe sent an opinion letter to the santa clara county assessor regarding sales tax as a component of value when valuing an aircraft,in which the sbe concluded,if sales tax is typically included in the taxable value of the aircraft,it should be included in the value,whereas if aircraft are not subject to sales tax common carriers,sales tax is not an element of their value.
similarly,the two excerpts from the assessors handbook,both prepared by the sbe and introduced in evidence by cke,provide that there are exceptions to the general rule that sales tax is an element of value.equipment rented to federal instrumentalities and aircraft used by common carriers neither of which are subject to sales tax,for example,are valued without sales tax as an element of value.the reason in both cases is that the consumer the federal government or the air carrier is never liable for sales tax on purchases of such equipment.consequently,the reproduction or replacement cost of such property should not include sales tax,unless or until the property is put to private use or rented to a private party.moreover,the opinion letter that cke obtained from the sbe after receiving notice of the escape assessment was consistent with these opinions w e conclude that cke aircraft was exempt from sales and use tax when it was purchased and when it was valued by the assessor so long as cke is a common carrier as defined by california code of regulations title,section.
in addition,ruwart,a senior tax counsel with the sbe legal department,stated that as long as an aircraft was operated by a common carrier,a sales tax should not be an element of value.she reasoned that common carriers had their own trade level because of the sales tax exemption.
the appeals board agreed with and adopted the sbe conclusions concerning the effect of the common carrier exemption on the valuation of an aircraft for property tax purposes.according to the board,as long as the use of cke aircraft met the definition of a common carrier,a sales tax should not be an element of valuation for purposes of property tax assessment.
we agree with the trial court,which in turn agreed with the appeals board.they properly relied upon the sbe opinion letters and the assessor handbook excerpts,as well as the views of ruwart.see watson cogeneration county of los angeles th,d,fn.assessors handbooks have been relied upon by the courts and been accorded great weight in the interpretation of valuation questions.cat partnership county of santa cruz th,fn.d prudential ins.city and county of san francisco d.
the sbe concluded in that the operation of cke aircraft qualified it for the common carrier sales or use tax exemption,and such agency opinions,although not binding or dispositive,are entitled to deference under the circumstances of this case.as the supreme court explained,we addressed the issue of judicial deference to administrative agency statutory interpretation in yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th d,yamaha.in yamaha,the court of appeal had determined a state board of equalization publication represented the dispositive interpretation of revenue and taxation code section et.yamaha,supra,at d.in reversing and remanding,we acknowledged that while agency interpretation of the meaning and legal effect of a statute is entitled to consideration and respect by the courts id.at d,agency interpretations are not binding or authoritative id.at d.courts must,in short,independently judge the text of a statute id.at d.we determined that the weight accorded to an agency interpretation is fundamentally situational id.at d,italics omitted and turns on a legally informed,commonsense assessment of its contextual merit id.at cal th,d.yamaha set down a basic framework of factors as guidance and concluded that the degree of deference accorded should be dependent in large part upon whether the agency has a comparative interpretative advantage over the courts and on whether it has arrived at the correct interpretation.id.at d.bonnell medical board cal th,d.
the appeals board interpretation is also entitled to considerable deference.see los altos el granada investors city of capitola th,d the board interpretation of an ordinance implementation guidelines is given considerable deference and must be upheld absent evidence the interpretation lacks a reasonable foundation.citation.the burden is on the appellant to prove the board decision is neither reasonable nor lawful.citation.based on the administrative record,the appeals board interpretation does not lack a reasonable foundation.to the contrary,in light of the sbe consistent conclusions concerning the application of the common carrier exemption to the aircraft valuation issue,the appeals board adoption of that interpretation was reasonable.the definition of a common carrier in california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision a is broad enough to include unscheduled air taxi operations as well as large commercial airlines.the definition expressly includes any person who engages in the business of transporting persons for hire.
relying primarily on the decision in xerox,supra,d,the assessor contends that california business personal property is routinely assessed at a valuation level that includes a provision for sales tax.according to the assessor,the decision in xerox supports the assessor conclusion that the trade level for cke aircraft is that of general aviation aircraft,which,according to the assessor,are always assessed using sales tax as an element of value.
in xerox,supra,d,the personal property in question consisted of office copying machines and related equipment manufactured by xerox,and leased by it on the lien date to various users id.at.under the lease agreements,the property remained under xerox ownership.ibid.althoug
