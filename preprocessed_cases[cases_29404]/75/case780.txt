we must decide whether the california department of transportation policy of permitting an individual to display united states flags,but no other expressive banners,on highway overpasses constitutes unreasonable viewpoint discrimination in violation of the first amendment.
background 
in the wake of the september terrorist attacks,an american citizenry united in grief,fear,and defense of country,joined in a spontaneous display of patriotism.across america,her great national emblem,the united states flag,and its colors,became ubiquitous,appearing everywhere from cars to homes,buildings to clothes.the president of the united states,on september,addressed the nation the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it,eliminate it and destroy it where it grows.this declaration of a war on terrorism heightened the patriotic fervor,and,according to the california department of transportation caltrans,resulted in the proliferation of flags on california highways.
highway in santa cruz,california,was no exception.private individuals hung flags from the highway overpasses.on november,amy courtney and cassandra brown,concerned over the public apparent failure to question the prospect of going to war,hung a responsive banner adjacent to a flag reading,at what cost.a scotts valley police officer immediately removed the banner because it posed a safety risk the following week courtney and brown attempted again to voice their message,hanging another sign reading,at what cost as well as one reading,are you buying this war.these banners were also immediately removed.although the person who removed the banners is unknown,caltrans has taken the position throughout this litigation that it would have removed them pursuant to its own policy if someone else had not.
it is caltrans stated encroachment permit policy that citizens who wish to display a sign on a california highway overpass must obtain a permit to do so.even then,permits are only available for signs designating turnoffs for special events.citizens wishing to display any other message are prohibited from using the highway overpass to do so.notwithstanding this policy,caltrans does not prohibit the display of american flags,nor does it impose a permitting process for their display.
brown and courtney filed an action under for deprivation of their first amendment rights against caltrans and its director jeff morales collectively caltrans.finding highway to be a nonpublic forum under the first amendment,the district court ruled that the caltrans policy met neither the reasonableness nor viewpoint neutrality requirements for state infringement on speech in a nonpublic forum.accordingly,it entered a preliminary injunction against caltrans policy of exempting american flags from permit requirements but requiring permits for,or prohibiting altogether,the display of all other expressive signs and banners.
caltrans challenges entry of the injunction.it argues that because alternative means for expression of courtney and brown messages are available,they failed to demonstrate the requisite risk of irreparable injury.caltrans also asserts that courtney and brown failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their first amendment claim,maintaining that its policy was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral.because the policy is neither,and no equivalent alternative means of expression have been demonstrated,we affirm 
ii.standard of review 
to obtain a preliminary injunction,courtney and brown must demonstrate either a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable harm or that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips in their favor.a m records,napster,cir.the formulas do not differ,but reflect two points on a sliding scale in which the degree of irreparable harm increases as the probability of success on the merits decreases.associated contractors of,coalition for econ.equity,cir.

iii.likelihood of success on the merits 
to evaluate the likelihood of success on the merits of courtney and brown free speech claim,we must address three issues.first,we must classify the highway under the supreme court forum analysis to determine whether the government interest in limiting the use of its property outweighs the interest of those wishing to use the property for other purposes.cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d.second,we assess the appropriate level of scrutiny for that forum.children of the rosary city of phoenix,cir.finally,we must determine whether caltrans policy withstands this scrutiny.id.
in defining the relevant forum,the court has focused on the access sought by the speaker.id.because courtney and brown hung their banners from highway overpass fences,the forum at issue is the highway overpass fence.we must next determine whether a highway overpass fence is a public,designated public,or nonpublic forum.a traditional public forum,such as a public park or sidewalk,is a place that has traditionally been available for public expression.diloreto downey unified sch.dist.bd.of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,w hen the government intentionally opens a nontraditional forum for public discourse it creates a designated public forum.id.all remaining public property is considered nonpublic fora.id.at.
the district court determined,and courtney and brown do not contend otherwise,that california state highway overpass fences are not public fora.we agree.the state highway overpass fences have not traditionally been available for public expression.id at.
the district court also correctly determined that the overpass is not a designated public forum.the government does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse,but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse.cornelius,at.to determine whether the government intended to open the forum for public discourse,the court has looked to the policy and practice of the government,the nature of the property and its compatibility with expressive activity,and whether the forum was designed and dedicated to expressive activities children of the rosary,at.as the district court recognized,overpass fences are not compatible with expressive activity because messages displayed invariably distract drivers,thereby posing safety risks.the policy and practice of caltrans has been to prohibit all expressive banners except directional signs and american flags.because caltrans has not intentionally made highway overpasses available for public discourse,they are not designated public fora.
the highway overpasses are thus nonpublic fora.restrictions on free expression in a nonpublic forum are constitutional only if the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and viewpoint neutral.cornelius,at.
reasonableness 
the reasonableness analysis focuses on whether the limitation is consistent with preserving the property for the purpose to which it is dedicated.diloreto,at.it is undisputed that the purpose of the highway is for transportation and caltrans is charged with monitoring its maintenance and safety.the purpose of the highway overpass and its fence is for safe crossing over the highway,either by pedestrians or other vehicular traffic.caltrans offers two reasons why its policy of allowing flags,but no other banners on the overpasses is reasonable its policy,it says,is designed to promote safety and conform to state law.
according to caltrans,the posting of signs and banners poses a variety of significant safety risks,including the po
