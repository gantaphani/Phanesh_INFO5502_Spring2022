jessica howard jessica howard appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york allen schwartz,holding that the contract damages owed by norfolk southern railway norfolk southern,which has conceded liability for the partial loss of jessica howard shipment of ladies garments during their transit from shanghai,china to north bergen,new jersey,are,as a matter of law,limited to jessica howard cost of acquiring the goods in shanghai or.jessica howard sky light,civ.ags,wl march.the district court did not resolve which of several potentially operative documents controlled norfolk southern liability and instead determined that each of the four documents limited damages to the same figure.we hold that under the terms of one of these documents,the norfolk southern intermodal rules circular,damages can not,as a matter of law,be measured by the value of the goods at the origin of the shipment.we therefore vacate the district court judgment and remand to the district court for further consideration of which document governs this dispute and what the proper measure of damages should be under the governing document.
background 
appellant jessica howard,plaintiff below,contracted to have ladies garments shipped via intermodal transport from shanghai,china to north bergen,new jersey.the containerized goods traveled from china to the west coast by ship and then to the east coast by rail service provided by,norfolk southern.upon arrival,the shipment was missing garments.jessica howard initially sued multiple parties,but norfolk southern has since admitted liability for the loss,and jessica howard has voluntarily dismissed its claims against all defendants except norfolk southern.
in the district court,both parties moved for summary judgment on damages.they agree that norfolk southern liability is governed by contract documents generated in connection with the shipment,but they disagree about the extent of this liability.norfolk southern claims that its liability is limited to,the alleged cost of acquiring the goods at the shipment origin in shanghai jessica howard claims that the amount is,the alleged actual market value of the goods at destination,plus interest and costs.
in its march,order,the district court directed entry of judgment against norfolk southern in the amount of.the district court noted that four documents,each potentially impacting norfolk southern contractual liability,were generated in conjunction with the shipment.direct forwarding,a freight forwarder,issued a combined transport bill of lading the dfc bill of lading.k line,the ocean carrier of the shipment,issued a separate bill of lading the k line bill of lading.norfolk southern used its intermodal rules circular,dated june,the circular,to govern its liability during its segment of intermodal shipments in general.finally,the district court found there was some evidence that norfolk southern issued an edi waybill in connection with the jessica howard shipment.
although the parties disputed which of these documents controlled norfolk southern liability,the district court did not resolve that question because the result was the same under any of them and held that norfolk southern liability is limited to jessica howard cost of acquiring the lost goods in shanghai regardless of which document governs.the district court left open whether the edi waybill existed and whether certain documents incorporated the terms of others instead of resolving these disputes as a matter of law or leaving them for trial,it determined that under any possible factual scenario,only two liability provisions could provision in the circular or the provision in the k line bill of lading and that both measured damages by the cost of acquiring the goods in shanghai.
the circular offers two liability options,standard and carmack the district court determined,and the parties do not dispute on appeal,that the standard terms apply as jessica howard never opted into the carmack regime.in the standard liability provisions and restrictions section,the circular provides that norfolk southern liability 
w ill not extend beyond the actual physical loss or damage to the cargo itself,plus any costs reasonably incurred in efforts to mitigate the loss or damage.norfolk southern will not be liable for attorney fees,for interest,or for special,consequential,indirect or punitive damages.unless amended,norfolk southern liability for loss,damage or delay to any shipments under this circular shall be limited to the lesser of the destination value of the cargo or.
the district court interpreted the actual physical loss to be jessica howard cost of acquiring the goods in shanghai and noted that the parties agree d that the cost of acquisition is.it reasoned that the carmack terms limit liability to the fair market value of the lost goods at destination,and that measuring liability under the standard terms by value at destination would render the standard liability option meaningless.it also noted that the standard terms expressly excluded consequential damages.because lost profits are a type of consequential damages and because measuring jessica howard loss by the destination value of the garments would compensate for lost profits,the district court determined the standard terms could not measure actual physical loss by the destination value of the lost goods.
the district court held that the k line bill of lading,presuming its own terms apply,includes a himalaya clause that extends limitations of liability included in the k line bill of lading to all connecting carriers,including norfolk southern.by its own terms,the k line bill of lading thus limits norfolk southern liability to merchants net invoice cost,plus freight and insurance premium,if paid.as under the circular,the district court determined the merchants net invoice cost also to be jessica howard cost of acquiring the goods in shanghai.
on march,the district court entered judgment in favor of jessica howard in the amount of.

we hold that the district court erred in interpreting the actual physical loss liability provision in the circular to require,as a matter of law,that damages be measured by jessica howard cost of acquiring the goods at the point of the shipment origin in shanghai.we do not reach,and we remand to the district court for consideration of,the question whether the liability limitation provision in the circular,the k line bill of lading or some other document governs because the record is insufficient for us to make the determination as a matter of law.
actual loss liability provisions are often measured by market value at destination 
the term actual loss has a long history in carriers liability provisions and has most frequently been measured by the fair market value of the lost or damaged goods at destination.the supreme court has noted the common law rule that t he measure of the shipper recovery is normally the market value of the goods at destination,and has described this default measure as the shipper actual loss from which contractual agreements could deviate by specifying a limitation of liability to invoice value plus freight.ansaldo san giorgio i rheinstrom.see also weirton steel,cir,the ordinary rule is indeed that damages for injury to goods while in possession of a carrier are to be computed at the difference between the sound market value at destination and the value as damaged.
courts have also consistently interpreted statutory provisions that refer to loss during shipping as referring to the value of the goods at destination.in chicago,milwaukee paul railway,the supreme court not only interpreted a federal statute requiring rail carriers to be liable for any loss,damage,or injury to property to measure damages at the point of destination but also held that a private contract specifying damages computed at the place and time of shipme
