introduction 
back in the,a character in a theatrical comedy flatly stated that there is no such thing as a perfect crime.to which the retort was ever buy a used car 
the exchange might be a bit out of date today.california law has not only required car dealers to be licensed since see,added by stats,ch,but has subjected car dealers to specific statutes against fraud see generally since that date as well.and a relatively recent statute,section added by stats,ch,goes so far as to completely preclude any recovery by a dealer of the price of a car if the dealer is not licensed.the dominant purpose of california statutory car dealer licensing scheme is,of course,the protection of car buyers from irresponsible or unscrupulous dealers.valiyee department of motor vehicles th,italics added.
the irony of the present case is that a scheme designed to protect consumers from unscrupulous dealers has,at least under the law as interpreted by the trial court on a successful demurrer,resulted in a car dealer reaping the benefit of an outright fraud on one of its salespeople,to whom it owed substantial finder fees.the theory,which the trial court accepted on demurrer,was that the salesman really was himself a used car dealer,and,because he did not have a dealer license,he could not complain when he was not paid his finder fees for about cars he obtained for the dealership.
at this stage we deal only with the facts in the complaint.that said,to affirm would be to allow the car dealership to get away with a perfect crime.we reverse.
ii.the complaint and demurrer 
the last operative complaint by the plaintiff was the second amended complaint.again,we stress that the case comes to us after a sustained demurrer without leave to amend.that means plaintiff alex wald is entitled to all reasonable inferences from facts alleged in that document,but not conclusions of law.
the story alleged is this plaintiff wald is in the business of finding,buying and then selling again used porsches defendant truspeed is in the business of selling sued porsches.truspeed liked wald ability to find used porsches,and in june wald and three representatives of truspeed met to work out an arrangement the meeting resulted in an oral agreement which would work this way wald would locate a used porsche,and propose the car to truspeed.if truspeed was interested,wald and truspeed would negotiate a price between themselves.then wald would return to the owner and negotiate a lower price the difference between the price and the price would be wald there was a statement by one of the truspeed representatives that wald would receive no less than per vehicle 
importantly,the actual buying of a used porsche would be done by truspeed it would be truspeed that would write the check and do the other paperwork to actually procure the car from the owner located by wald and at the price negotiated by him we may make a reasonable inference from that would not automatically get paid as might be case if he bought the used porsche himself and then it to the dealer.he was dependent on the dealer for any compensation for his services.the parties thus called the compensation a finder fee and wald trusted truspeed to obtain any necessary licenses to implement the arrangement 
a few other aspects of the complaint are noteworthy the truspeed representatives asked wald whether he would be interested in selling vehicles for truspeed on the floor,though the parties agreed that plaintiff would essentially be locating cars from private parties and would receive a finder fee for his work.a truspeed representative also asked wald to assist with inspections and shipping,and also encouraged wald to spend time at the store,offered him an office and asked him to help on the sales floor once or twice a week.
the complaint does not say that wald accepted any of these on the floor offers.but the complaint does say that truspeed representative rob morgan and wald had a discussion over the possibility that some of the prospective buyers might not want to sell to a dealer which was the substance of the would be the real buyer.in this conversation,morgan told wald he did not care how wald got the cars and encouraged wald to lie to the sellers and say whatever it took to get the cars.the complaint does not say whether wald actually misrepresented his ultimate purpose of having truspeed buy the used porsches,but the allegations to the effect that it was truspeed who wrote the checks and actually did all the buying establishes a reasonable inference that wald did not lie and that all sellers knew that the buyer of their cars was a dealer.
about cars were obtained by wald for truspeed under the arrangement,and if the contract had been honored wald would have been paid about.truspeed,however,reneged on the deal and refused to pay wald his fees for any of the cars obtained truspeed profits on the cars were alleged to exceed.
truspeed filed a demurrer based on wald lack of dealer license and lack of a salesperson license for that matter.the trial court sustained,without leave to amend,truspeed demurrer to four of the five causes of action set forth in the second amended complaint overruling a cause of action for common counts for in actual expenses incurred.the court ruled that section of the vehicle code,which applies to unlicensed dealers,precluded any recovery by wald of monies owed under the oral contract.as against wald argument that he was really a salesperson and his claims could be enforced in equity despite his lack of a salesperson license,the trial court alluded to,cal d,a case dealing generally with when illegal contracts may be enforced,but found the case inapplicable we will have more to say about and its ensuing jurisprudence in a moment.
after wald himself dismissed his surviving fifth cause of action with prejudice,a judgment was entered against him.from that judgment he has timely appealed.
iii.discussion 
a.in substance,a salesperson 
section is strict.very strict.basically it says if you are car dealer and you sell a car,if you are not licensed,you can be stiffed by the buyer,and there nothing you can do about it 
the operative words in section are in its opening clause,introducing the subject of a long sentence a person acting as a dealer,who was not licensed as a dealer as required by this article italics added.the reader is immediately referred to the licensing requirements of this article,which is in sections et as noted in the introduction,those statutes have provided since that car dealers must be licensed.
there is a statutory definition of dealer in the vehicle code,to be found in section.we reproduce the entirety of the statute in the margin 
readers should notice this about the statute it was obviously intended to be read in conjunction with a list of exceptions spelled out in section,because,if read independent of the exceptions in section,section pretty much covers anybody whoever buys or sells a car,including ordinary consumers simply hoping to get a few bucks on their old clunker as a.basically the scheme is define everybody who sells or buys or even negotiates in regard to buying or selling a car as a dealer,then provide a list of exclusions from the otherwise blanket coverage of the statute.
so now to section,which lists even though they otherwise would fall under the rubric of dealer in the previous statute.we also reproduce the entirety of that statute in the margin one of the reasons we provide the entire statute is so that readers can see the exertions of the legislature in trying to work around a statutory scheme which first so broadly defines a category as to be virtually unrealistic,anyone who ever tries to sell his or her own car is a dealer under the definition and then tries to remove from that broad definition people and organizations who are obviously not dealers.thus section goes to some lengths to define and then exempt charitable organizations to which consumers can donate cars,as well as ordinary consumers themselves and auto clubs who will often helpfully negotiate firm prices from certain dealers real dealers,thus sparing their members the burden of haggling.even yacht brokers have to be specifically exempted from section ambit.
and,of course,car dealer salespeople are also exempted,in subdivision c.that exemption is remarkable fairly short c persons regularly employed as salespersons by vehicle dealers licensed under this code while acting within the scope of that employment.
vehicle salespeople,as distinct from dealers,are defined in section.we set out the entire statute in the margin it is a kind of of section definition of dealer.first,in subdivision a,the statute sets forth a series of categories,any one of which is sufficient to make a person a salesperson,and then,in subdivision b,it lists exceptions.among the categories bringing a person within the definition are formal employment as a salesperson by a dealer,as defined in section,but also a person who under any form of contract,agreement,or arrangement with a dealer,for commission,money,profit,or other thing of value,sells,exchanges,buys,or offers for sale,negotiates,or attempts to negotiate,a sale,or exchange of an interest in a vehicle required to be registered under this code.italics added.
none of the exceptions in subdivision b applies here.we need only note that one of those exceptions persons regularly employed as salespersons by a vehicle dealer authorized to do business in california under section of the vehicle code refers to dealers,as distinct from truspeed 
the law prefers substance to form,and in substance,wald was regularly employed as truspeed salesperson.the essence of wald services were in negotiating with used porsche owners for their same sort of work that car salespeople do every day when a buyer comes in with a,and work that fits within section inclusion of people who professionally negotiate for dealers as salespeople.on top of that,it is a reasonable inference that wald was devoting a substantial portion of his time to work on behalf of dealer truspeed,he was regularly employed as a salesperson.moreover,wald received all compensation for his services directly from truspeed,with all paperwork on the cars purchased handled by truspeed.
compensation enforceable in equity 
determining that wald is a salesperson,as distinct from a dealer,is not,however,the end of the matter.under section,salespeople too must be licensed and there is no question that wald did not have a salesperson license.
statutory sanctions for unlicensed work are different for dealers and salespeople,perhaps reflecting a recognition on the part of the legislature that the law not be used to oppress unlicensed car salespeople from being paid for their work.thus,while section is borderline draconian in its bar of unlicensed dealers from getting right in law,no right in equity,no how no is no similar statute precluding,a priori,any possibility that salespeople will get paid for their unlicensed work.the reasonable inference in the scheme is that the legislature was willing to leave the payment of unlicensed salespeople up to the courts under existing case law involving illegal contracts.
which brings us back to,supra,cal d,a case which the trial court did not think applicable because it was an unfair competition case.we must part company with the trial court on the case.
to be sure,was a dispute between two manufacturers in which one accused the other of undercutting its competitors to gain a monopoly in the newspaper machinery market.but the court did have some general things to say about how courts should treat efforts to recover under illegal agreements,in considering a second action by one of the manufacturers against a former officer involving the backdating of some stock purchases to perpetrate a tax fraud,and a claim by the officer for the balance of agreed consideration despite the improper tax purposes of agreement.see,supra,cal d at.
the supreme court allowed,in,the officer the aid of the courts in obtaining the agreed consideration for the assets which he had delivered to the manufacturer,supra,cal d at.in the passage in the opinion allowing his claim,the high court pointed to four factors that allowed the officer to sue despite the illegality of the agreement the greater moral fault of the manufacturer the lack of serious moral turpitude in the conduct of the officer the fact the manufacturer would be unjustly enriched if the contract were not enforced and the deterrent policy of the law would be best realized by allowing the officer claim rather than letting the manufacturer keep the benefit of its illegal bargain 
and indeed,has engendered a line of jurisprudence,asdourian araj cal d asdourian california physicians service aoki diabetes research institute th california physician service which,in contexts other than backdated stock option purchase agreements,have distilled the same or similar factors.asdourian,supra,cal d at in each case,the extent of enforceability and the kind of remedy granted depend upon a variety of factors,including the policy of the transgressed law,the kind of illegality and the particular facts.california physicians service,supra,th at.
as a gloss on what the supreme court said in asdourdian,the california physician service court stressed sophistication of the defendant and hence whether a member of the class needing protection whether the illegality was malum in se or malum prohibitum and the whether not enforcing the agreement might result in the unjust enrichment of the defendant.see california physician service,supra,th at in asdourdian our supreme court enforced oral home improvement contracts,despite a regulatory statute requiring such contracts to be in writing in enforcing the contracts,the court noted that defendant property owners were not unsophisticated consumers but real estate investors,and thus are not members of the group primarily in need of the statute protection.also,the contracts at issue were not malum in se immoral in character,inherently inequitable or designed to further a crime or obstruct justice but were malum prohibitum only voidable depending on the factual context and the public policies involved the court also noted that the contracts had been fully performed,and that the defendants would be unjustly enriched if allowed to retain the value of the benefits bestowed by plaintiff without compensating him.
indeed,california physician service is factually quite similar to the case at hand both cases involve a debtor trying to repudiate a debt based on the putatively illegal business status of the creditor.there,a health care provider,a diabetes research institute,sued a health care service plan for breach of contract,seeking reimbursement for medical services provided to the plan members.but the plan said that the provider was illegally organized as a nonprofit corporation instead of a professional medical corporation or partnership.california physician service,supra,th at.applying the factors noted above,the appellate court easily affirmed a judgment for the provider.see id.these same considerations support our conclusion that adri should not be denied relief.the ban on the corporate practice of medicine is meant to protect patients,not health care service plans a contract for the provision of medical services by licensed professionals is plainly not malum in se blue shield would be unjustly enriched if it were allowed to retain the benefit of services bestowed on its subscribers without compensating adri.
applying the physicians service yields an ineluctable result 
the class of people who are the beneficiaries of california car dealership licensing scheme and preclusions against recovery by unlicensed dealers are most certainly not the car dealers themselves.
the greater moral fault is easily truspeed.it knew of the licensing statutes,it seeks to enjoy a tangible windfall based on wald work and deny him all recompense for it.all it posits in opposition to the moral fault point on pages of the respondent brief are arguments to the effect that wald should have known to get a license and was in compliance with the licensing statutes.indeed,nothing in the facts indicates moral turpitude on wald part.again,the inference at this stage is that he did not follow truspeed direction to lie about truspeed being the ultimate buyer of the used porsches.all he did was find cars for truspeed and negotiate an acceptable price for truspeed to buy the cars and then resell.nothing in wald being able to receive compensation for his efforts is malum in se.
truspeed will be unjustly enriched by the value of wald services worth.all truspeed has to offer against the point on pages of the respondent brief is an argument that misconstrues the complaint truspeed says that wald real complaint is that truspeed should have paid the sellers more and given him the difference.real complaint is that he found cars for truspeed at prices that truspeed would pay,but truspeed now wants to diddle him out of his finder fee.
the deterrent policy of the law regulating dealerships would be best realized by allowing wald claim to proceed.nothing in this dispute implicates the real reason for the dealer licensing statutes and section in particular,which is to protect the public from unscrupulous dealers.see merrill department of motor vehicles cal d,looking to the entire statutory scheme governing the licensing of automobile dealers we observe that the primary concern therein manifested is that the public be protected from unscrupulous and irresponsible persons in the sale of vehicles subject to registration under the code.it would upend that statutory goal to allow a dealer to use the licensing statute to get away with not paying for services actually rendered,supra,cal d at allowing recovery under illegal contracts so as to to prevent the guilty party from reaping the benefit of his wrongful conduct.
c.the fraud claim 
truspeed says that,even if wald can state contract or unjust enrichment claims against it,his fraud claim still must be subject to dismissal for his failure to plead it with sufficient particularity.
the basis of wald fraud claim the fourth cause of action in the complaint is,as one might expect,the allegation that truspeed made its promise to pay wald not having any intention to perform.hence,after just two months and after substantial services were provided and knowingly received by truspeed,truspeed informed wald that it was not going to pay him because it did not believe that any court would uphold an oral agreement.
the basic rules as to the need to plead fraud with specificity were recently recapitulated by the court in citizens of humanity,llc costco wholesale th,in california,fraud must be pled specifically general and conclusory allegations do not suffice.this requirements serves two purposes.first,it gives the defendant notice of the definite charges to be met.second,the allegations should be sufficiently specific that the court can weed out nonmeritorious actions on the basis of the pleadings.thus the pleading should be sufficient to enable the court to determine whether,on the facts pleaded,there is any foundation,prima facie at least,for the charge of fraud.thus,a plaintiff must plead facts which show how,when,where,to whom,and by what means the representations were made.when the defendant is a corporate defendant,the plaintiff must further allege the names of the persons who made the representations,their authority to speak,to whom they spoke,what they said or wrote,and when it was said or written.there are certain exceptions to the particularity requirement.less specificity is required when it appears from the nature of the allegations that the defendant must necessarily possess full information concerning the facts of the controversy.italics added.
tested under these rules,the complaint passes muster.how oral statements made at a meeting.when june.where truspeed offices.to whom wald.by what means oral statements in which truspeed agreed to pay wald finder fees.names of persons speaking for the corporation rob morgan,scott mccloud and brack roerderer.their authority to speak rob morgan had apparent authority to ask wald to work the floor.to whom they spoke wald.what they said we will pay you a finder fee for used porsches we buy based on the prices you negotiate.when it was said june.
we need only add the following the allegations that truspeed had expertise in licensing,plus the allegation that truspeed allowed wald to work for two months,then repudiated the entire agreement even to the point of not paying wald expenses,would,if proved,allow a reasonable jury to conclude that truspeed did have a secret intention to make a promise without any intention of performing it.see,a promise,without any intention of performing it is a species of deceit.that is,these facts would show that truspeed made the agreement with the secret intention of allowing wald to work without ever being paid because it thought that wald lack of a dealer license would,in effect,be a king x,allowing the firm to barefacedly repudiate the oral argument then say to wald,in effect hey neener neener,gotcha sucker.see griffin dewatering northern ins.of new york th,as the trial judge rightly intuited,an insurance company can not first promise coverage,then barefaced repudiate that promise by pointing to an integration clause in the written contract,and saying in effect,hey neener neener.indeed,it was the houston oral promise that has posed the biggest problem in the case for us surely,we first thought,at least some punitive damages were merited given such a barefaced repudiation.
iv.disposition 
in light of the wins at this assertion that this court should dismiss the appeal as frivolous is obviously.while the request for dismissal itself borders on the frivolous,we will merely deny the motion to dismiss and leave matters at that.see in re marriage of koester th,let us merely say that we heartily disapprove of requests for sanctions brought by any litigant,and leave it at that.
the judgment is reversed.appellant wald shall recover his costs on appeal.

all further undesignated statutory references in this opinion are to the vehicle code.
the relevant language from the second amended complaint is plaintiff has been and remains in the business of locating,purchasing and selling high performance automobiles,including porsches.plaintiff had demonstrated an ability and expertise to locate porsche automobiles and negotiate a reasonable purchase price.
the relevant language from the second amended complaint is plaintiff and the truspeed representatives met at the offices of truspeed for the purpose of working out a business arrangement.before that meeting scott mccloud one of the representatives called plaintiff and said that rob morgan another truspeed representative wanted plaintiff to come down to truspeed and discuss an employment arrangement.mccloud offered plaintiff at least per car to locate them for truspeed,an amount that plaintiff declined as being too low.also prior to the meeting,plaintiff was told by truspeed representatives that truspeed did not have the time to find vehicles,arrange shipping,arrange inspections and other related tasks.truspeed actively sought the services of plaintiff because they knew he could find the cars they wanted and did not want other car dealers in the same business to get the benefit of plaintiff services.
the relevant language from the second amended complaint is plaintiff and truspeed entered into an oral agreement whereby plaintiff would locate porsche automobiles and propose the vehicle to truspeed.if truspeed was interested,plaintiff and truspeed would negotiate a price for the vehicle.once that price was agreed upon,plaintiff would then negotiate with the owner of the vehicle to purchase it.plaintiff would receive the difference between the amount plaintiff and truspeed agreed on as a price and the amount that plaintiff negotiated with the owner of the vehicle.thus,if truspeed agreed on a price of for a vehicle and plaintiff ultimately negotiated a price of with the owner,plaintiff would receive as compensation.as part of the agreement,plaintiff was obligated to exclusivity with truspeed whereby plaintiff was required to provide truspeed with the right of first refusal on each porsche that he located.rob morgan stated that under the agreement,plaintiff would make on some cars and could make more than on other cars depending on the deal and that,in any event,plaintiff would not make less than on any car.
the relevant language from the second amended complaint is on vehicles that were located,truspeed would purchase the vehicles directly from the private sellers,handle all of the paperwork,and write the checks.
the relevant language from the second amended complaint is during the discussions,plaintiff was asked whether he would be interested in selling vehicles for truspeed on the floor,and that he should have a salesperson license.the parties agreed that plaintiff would essentially be locating cars from private parties and would receive a finder fee,the amount of which was determined as set forth hereinabove.based on the statements of truspeed representatives,plaintiff understood that truspeed,who had superior knowledge of the business of selling vehicles and the necessary licensing requirements and obligations,would get any necessary licenses for plaintiff to accomplish the purposes of the arrangement.plaintiff was also told that he would be an independent contractor and would receive a for whatever he was paid.further,plaintiff would not be involved in purchasing or selling cars.
the relevant language from the second amended complaint is from and after the date of the agreement,plaintiff located and offered to truspeed numerous vehicles.plaintiff and truspeed agreed on and completed transactions on at least vehicles which were subject to this agreement.in addition,plaintiff incurred expenses on some of the vehicles for which truspeed agreed to reimburse and lost income as a result of the right of first refusal obligation.plaintiff right to compensation under the agreement with respect to the completed transaction,reimbursement rights,and lost income exceeds.
the four causes of action were breach of contract,account stated,unjust enrichment,and fraud.
to quote from the substantive portion of the minute order in connection with defendant demurrer which was argued at the hearing on,the court has again reviewed the papers filed by plaintiff and defendant.the court has also read cal cited by plaintiff in his opposition to the demurrer.the facts of which is an unfair competition case are clearly very distinguishable from the fact situation of the instant case and is not persuasive with respect to the issues raised by the demurrer.it is clear from the complaint that plaintiff much more fits the definition of dealer as defined by vehicle code section than the definition of a salesperson as defined by vc section.in addition to not being licensed as a dealer,plaintiff admits that he was also not licensed as a salesman pursuant to section.
