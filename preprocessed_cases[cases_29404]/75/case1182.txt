introduction 
in this appeal,we must determine whether the city and county of san francisco city may be liable for contract damages following a valid exercise of its police power.in march,the san francisco airport commission commission passed a resolution granting certain benefits to drivers of taxis providing transit service at san francisco international airport sfo.thereafter,plaintiffs and appellants alex cotta,aloizio costa,majed dajani,andrew lindemann,isam kayed,mohamad quitteineh,and saleem shaikh purchased compressed natural gas cng taxicabs and operated them at sfo.in november,the commission adopted a new resolution that conferred reduced benefits,and appellants brought suit for breach of contract.on for summary judgment,the trial court granted the city motion and denied appellants motion.appellants challenge those rulings on theories of breach of contract,promissory estoppel,and inverse condemnation.we will affirm.
ii.factual and procedural 
in,the taxicab alternative fuels working group was formed for the purpose of encouraging the san francisco taxicab industry to purchase cabs powered by cng.the commission initiated a pilot program of incentives to cng cabs providing service at sfo in order to improve air quality at sfo while maintaining effective transit service for the public.
on october,to encourage the acquisition of new vehicles,the commission adopted a clean vehicle incentive program for taxis serving sfo.the resolution provided the first clean air cabs put into service would receive one fol privilege per driver shift for two years,with the trip fee waived the next cabs put into service would receive one fol privilege per driver shift for months,with the trip fee waived and the next cabs put into service would receive one fol privilege per driver shift for months,with the trip fee waived.the resolution provided that the trip fee waiver incentive was subject to modification by the airport director.
from october,through april,one additional cng taxi was put into service for a total of cng taxis operating out of sfo.
on april,the commission adopted a new resolution modifying the incentive program for cng taxis to add one additional fol privilege per driver shift,for a total of two fol privileges per shift.the resolution also provided that,the duration of this new incentive shall be determined by the airport director in consultation with airport staff,cng taxi owners,and cng providers.the airport director shall have the sole authority to begin,end or reinstate this new incentive.
as of march,cng taxis were operating out of sfo,an increase of since april,
on march,to further encourage the acquisition of cng cabs,the commission adopted a resolution modifying the incentive program once again.
the resolution provided.the first clean air taxicabs put into service will receive fol privileges four times per day for four years.for the first two years,no trip fee will be charged for two of these trips per day.the subsequent clean air taxicabs put into service will receive fol privileges four times per day for eighteen months.no trip fee will be charged for two of these trips.after eighteen months,these vehicles will receive fol privileges two times per day,for which the standard taxi trip fee will be charged.the subsequent clean air taxicabs put into service will receive fol privileges four times per day for one year.no trip fee will be charged for two of these trips.after one year,these vehicles will receive fol privileges two times per day,for which the standard taxi trip fee will be charged.clean air taxicabs put into service after the initial vehicles will receive fol privileges two times per day for one year.these trips will be subject to the standard taxi trip fee.
the resolution did not contain language regarding authority to determine the duration of the incentives or to begin,end,or reinstate the incentives.between march,and november,an additional cng cabs were placed in service at sfo,an increase of percent.
within several months of the march,resolution,sfo became aware of logistical problems and growing conflict between of cng cabs and of cabs.in several memoranda to members of the commission,the airport director described the success of the incentive program,particularly the fol privileges,in increasing the number of cng cabs,but also reported that demand for taxis at sfo had decreased for a variety of reasons,including the economic downturn,the events of,and the of bart service to sfo in june.the result was a significant increase in wait times,significant adverse economic consequences for drivers of regular taxis,and increased congestion in the staging lots for cabs generally due to space constraints at sfo.
sfo tried to alleviate the problems through procedural changes,but the attempted modifications were not successful.on labor day weekend,a taxicab driver work stoppage at sfo caused major operational problems.sfo held several meetings with interested parties,including drivers of both cng and cabs,to resolve the problems that had developed since the march,resolution.these efforts were unavailing.
on november,the commission rescinded the prior clean taxi incentive program resolutions dated october,april,and march,and adopted a new resolution providing incentives to drivers of cng taxis as follows the incentives would be limited to the service life of the first cng cabs all cng cabs would have one fol privilege per shift for four years,with different trip fee waiver provisions based on the order in which the cab was put into service.the resolution provided that the taxicab incentive program would be phased out as the original cng cabs were retired after four years of service.in addition,the resolution stated,the airport commission reserves the right to eliminate or modify these incentives at any time to meet operational needs of the airport or in the event the board of supervisors the taxi commission approves legislation mandating that a percentage of san francisco taxicabs be clean fuel vehicles with no further accommodation to program participants.
in connection with his analysis supporting his november recommendation to airport director john martin that fol privileges be curtailed,deputy airport director for operations and security trygg mccoy testified that he concluded that each lost fol privilege was worth to a cab driver.
on october,the commission adopted a resolution continuing the fol privileges under the november,resolution for cng cab drivers who purchased a new cng vehicle when their original cng taxi reached the end of its service life under taxi commission regulations.
of the cng cabs purchased between march and november,were still in service as of the date the parties filed their summary adjudication and summary judgment motions on september.in addition,between november,and september,more cng cabs were placed in service at sfo.
on september,appellants filed their second amended complaint alleging causes of action for breach of contract,promissory estoppel,misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,and inverse condemnation.by order filed on january,the trial court sustained the city demurrer to the causes of action for misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation but overruled the demurrer as to the remaining causes of action.
appellants filed their motion for summary adjudication on september.on the same day,the city filed its motion for summary judgment,summary adjudication,judgment on the pleadings.the hearing was held on october,and the court took the matter under submission.on october,the court issued its order granting the city summary judgment motion and denying appellants summary adjudication motion.
appellants filed a timely notice of appeal on december.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
summary judgment is granted only when the papers presented in support of the moving party establish that no issue of material fact exists to be tried and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citations.on appeal,the reviewing court exercises its independent judgment,deciding whether the moving party established undisputed facts that negate the opposing party claim or state a complete defense.romano rockwell,cal th,d.summary judgment may be affirmed on any theory,regardless of the ground relied on by the trial court.kirby sega of america,th,d.
contentions 
appellants contend that they entered into unilateral contracts with the city they accepted the city offer of the incentives described in the march resolution by purchasing and operating cng taxis at sfo,by performance.thereafter,according to appellants,the city breached those contracts when it enacted the november resolution which reduced the incentives.appellants argue that,having purchased their services in furtherance of its goal of improving air quality at sfo,the city should be bound by its agreement.
the city responds that the march resolution was a legislative act providing a subsidy to cng taxi drivers pursuant to the city police power,and was not contractual in nature.as such,appellants had no vested right in the continuation of its provisions,and,even if the city had wanted to guarantee those benefits for a certain amount of time,it could not contract away its ability to exercise the police power in the future.the city argues that it did not purchase goods or services,the typical situation in which contractual obligations arise from the enactment of legislation.further,none of the city required formalities under the city charter were satisfied.
appellants agree that the city enacted the resolutions pursuant to its police power,and that both the march and november resolutions were valid exercises of that power.the city at all times retained the police power to regulate taxi operations but,appellants claim,in so doing,it breached its contracts with them in november when it reduced the incentives it had promised in march of that year.
legal principles 
the police power 
a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.cal,art.xi.often referred to as the police power,this constitutional authority of counties or cities to adopt local ordinances is the power of sovereignty or power to inherent reserved power of the state to subject individual rights to reasonable regulation for the general welfare.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.constitutional law.the police power extends to legislative objectives in furtherance of public peace,safety,morals,health and welfare.birkenfeld city of berkeley cal d.massingill department of food agriculture th,d.
it is settled that a government entity may not contract away its right to exercise the police power in the future.see,avco community developers,south coast regional com.cal d,avco county mobilehome positive action,county of san diego th,d county mobilehome alameda county land use city of hayward th,d alameda county.a contract that purports to do so is invalid as against public policy.county mobilehome,supra,th at,d.
the county mobilehome case is instructive.there,the county imposed a moratorium on the enactment of any rent control legislation with respect to mobilehome park owners who entered into an accord with the county.th at,d.the county enacted an ordinance whereby it agreed with any park owner who signed the accord that the county would not adopt any ordinance,rule,regulation,or initiative measure that would regulate how much the park owner could charge a resident for rent.id.at,d.the accord specified that its duration was years and that its provisions were to govern over any inconsistent action taken by the county,such as the enactment of any ordinance or regulation.id.at,d.read together,the ordinance and the accord constituted a contractual agreement by the county not to enact rent control legislation for years as to signatories of the accord.id.at,d.the court held that the ordinance was facially unconstitutional and the accord was invalid because,together,they represented an express attempt by the county to surrender or bargain away its control of a police power.id.at,d.
california courts have consistently invalidated agreements that had the effect of surrendering or impairing the police power.in alameda county,two cities and a county entered into a memorandum of understanding mou concerning a parcel of approximately acres of open space,portions of which were in all three jurisdictions,agreeing to use their best efforts to adopt into their respective general plans certain specified goals and policies concerning that land.th at,d.the mou further provided that any amendment to one of the entities general plans concerning that land would not become effective unless the other two entities adopted parallel amendments.id.at,d.the plaintiffs challenged the mou,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.division five of this court held the agreement invalid,stating that it constituted a surrender of each respondent power to amend its own general plan.this policy divests each respondent,presently and in the future,of its sole and independent authority to amend its respective general plan,by providing outside jurisdictions a veto over such amendments.what the law has designed to be the exclusive power of an individual jurisdiction has become a contingent power,dependent on the concurrence of other jurisdictions.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
in avco,a developer agreed to sell and dedicate coastal land to the county,conditioned upon the issuance of certain approvals for a building project.cal d at.the approvals were granted,and the developer began work on the project.the developer relied on this agreement in seeking an exemption from a coastal permit requirement.id.at.our supreme court held that the developer had not acquired a vested right to complete the development,either at common law or pursuant to statute.the court also rejected the developer estoppel claim,explaining that even assuming the agreement constituted a promise by the government that zoning laws thereafter enacted would not be applicable to the developer tract,the agreement would be invalid and unenforceable as contrary to public policy.id.at.land use regulations,such as the coastal zone conservation act,involve the exercise of the state police power citation,and it is settled that the government may not contract away its right to exercise the police power in the future.citations.id.at.
similarly,in delucchi county of santa cruz d.delucchi,the plaintiff landowners and the county entered into a land use agreement concerning coastal land.the plaintiffs sued for specific performance,damages,and attorney fees after the county adopted new zoning ordinances that conflicted with the agreement.on appeal,the court declined to interpret the agreement as precluding the city from changing its zoning,noting that if it upheld the interpretation urged by the plaintiffs,the contract would be invalid as one that purported to contract away the government right to exercise the police power.id.at.the police power being in its nature a continuous one,must ever be reposed somewhere,and can not be barred or suspended by contract or irrepealable law.it can not be bartered away even by express contract.citations.it is to be presumed that parties contract in contemplation of the inherent right of the state to exercise unhampered the police power that the sovereign always reserves to itself for the protection of peace,safety,health and morals.its effect can not be nullified in advance by making contracts inconsistent with its enforcement citations.carty city of ojai d,quoting mott cline cal.delucchi,supra,d at.
the taxicab industry 
the regulation of the taxicab industry is a traditional subject of the police power of cities and counties.see,subd.b providing that l ocal authorities may adopt rules and regulations by ordinance or resolution regarding l icensing and regulating the operation of vehicles for hire and drivers of passenger vehicles for hire,local authorities may by ordinance license and regulate the location of stands on streets and highways for use by taxicabs and other public carriers for hire in their respective jurisdictions.
local authorities act pursuant to their police power in regulating virtually all aspects of the taxicab business,including who may operate a cab,how many cabs may be operated,how much cabs may charge,where cabs may travel,and where cabs may pick up passengers.see,superior court d.license or permit to operate a taxicab is granted by local government entity pursuant to police power people ex rel.freitas city county of san francisco d.affirming city power to regulate cabs in re petersen cal d,affirming city power to designate certain stands for the exclusive use of certain taxi companies in picking up passengers people buck d supp,affirming power of county to prohibit cabs from operating in specific areas of county people galena d supp,galena affirming power of city supervisors to regulate taxicab stands to promote the convenience,safety,and welfare of the traveling public,and to adopt measures that will best assure adequate service and will be of the most practical benefit.
in addition,california courts have consistently held that taxicab drivers do not obtain any vested right in the grant of permission to operate taxicabs on the public roadways.rather,that permission may be altered at the discretion of the issuing authority.for example,in luxor cab cahill d,the plaintiff cab drivers and a cab company challenged the city issuance of additional cab medallions,arguing that it infringed on the vested rights of present certificate holders.id.at.the court rejected the argument the use of streets by taxicabs is a privilege that may be granted or withheld without violating either due process or equal protection.this privilege may be granted exclusively or nonexclusively to render public services citation.in any event,the granting or withholding of a privilege based upon certificates of public convenience and necessity presents no judicial controversy touching on the impairment of vested rights citation.ibid.
in galena,the defendant was convicted of violating an ordinance that prohibited taxis from picking up passengers at specific taxi stands for which they had not obtained a permit.the court rejected the plaintiff argument that he had a vested right to pick up passengers there streets and highways are for the use of the traveling public,and,as members of the public,all persons in like situation have equal rights to use the streets and highways in a reasonable manner in the customary way.citation.however,the common right to use streets in the ordinary way is quite different from the right to use them as a place of business for private gain.ordinary usage is the right of all,but there is no vested or constitutional right to subject a street to the conduct of private business.such use,when authorized,is a special or extraordinary privilege.it is an added easement or burden on the street,and is not comparable to the right to conduct lawful business on private property.use of a public street for private enterprise may,under some circumstances,redound to the public good but nevertheless it is a special privilege peculiarly subject to regulation,and one which may be granted on reasonable terms or entirely withheld.citations.galena,supra,d supp.at.
in superior court,supra,d,the court rejected a challenge to a proposition passed by popular vote that required all existing taxicab permittees to exchange their permits for new ones which,unlike the old ones,would be nontransferable and nonassignable.the court held that a license or permit to engage in the taxicab business,issued by the city pursuant to its police power,does not convey a vested property right.id.at.in so doing,the court explained that an ordinance adopted in the exercise of the police power does not create contract rights in the continuation of the regulation.see also,any statute may be repealed at any time,except when vested rights would be impaired.persons acting under any statute act in contemplation of this power of repeal.
contract claims 
based on the legal principles discussed above and the undisputed facts,we conclude that no contract was formed.the several resolutions adopted by the city in furtherance of its goal of cleaner air at sfo,including those of march and november,were part of a pilot program,the clean vehicle program for taxis serving sfo.these were regulatory acts,adopted by the city pursuant to its police power.the incentives,fol privileges and trip fee waivers were created by modifying regulations already in place that governed taxi operation at sfo,specifically,the order in which taxis may pick up passengers and the fees taxis must pay per trip.these modified regulations clearly were experimental and subject to change.it is apparent that the commission was experimenting with the level of incentives in its efforts to encourage the purchase and operation of cng cabs while also maintaining effective public transit at sfo.the commission adjusted the incentives upwards to encourage the placement into service of more cng cabs.the commission adjusted the incentives downwards when they caused operational problems.
appellants make much of the fact that the march resolution included no provision reserving authority to change or end the incentives,and argue that the absence of such provision evidenced the city intent to guarantee that the incentives would not be changed.the incentive program as delineated by the earlier and resolutions contained clauses reserving discretion in the airport director to make changes,and there is no dispute that,prior to march,the program was subject to change.we disagree with appellants that the omission of a provision giving the airport director the individual authority to make changes also took away the power of the commission to act in accordance with its established procedures.we will not infer intent to contract on the part of the city based on the mere omission of a statement granting additional authority to the director to amend the regulations.the program experimental,conditional nature was not transformed to binding and contractual by the failure to state what was obvious the program was subject to change.
as an additional reason the march resolution did not create contracts,the city argues that it did not comply with charter provisions that govern city contracting.specifically,the contract was not approved as to form by the city attorney,and there was no certification from the controller that sufficient funds were available.see charter,in jv city and county of san francisco th,d,both of these requirements were held to be ministerial and the failure to satisfy these requirements did not invalidate the otherwise binding contract.however,unlike the public works contract in,here there is no contract.
we also reject appellants attempt to recharacterize this case as involving the purchase by the city of clean air at the airport.appellants argue this government as purchaser point in order to bring this case within the ambit of others in which courts have found that statutes enacted pursuant to the police power involving the purchase of goods or services created contract rights.in county of san luis obispo gage cal,the court found an implied contract between the county and the state under a law that provided for payment of specified sums annually for the maintenance and support of orphans.in california medical lackner d.lackner,the court found an implied contract between the state and providers who treated patients in reliance upon a statutory scheme that provided for reimbursement for services rendered to patients.and in california teachers association cory d,the court found that the state impliedly promised to fund the teachers pension fund.in all three cases,the courts found implied contracts based on legislative intent to grant private rights of contract through specific promises to pay compensation for services rendered.see lackner,supra,d at,fn,quoting longshore county of ventura cal d,t he right to compensation vest ed upon performance of the work.
these cases bear no resemblance to the situation presented here.the terms of the march resolution created a modified regulatory framework in the form of a subsidy for cng taxicab operators.unlike the cases appellants cite,here there simply was no intent to grant private rights of contract,no promise to pay for services rendered,and no vested right t
