the city of chicago chicago or city has conceived a billion program to modernize international airport,which consistently ranks as one of our nation busiest and most delayed airports.to fund the initial component of the preparation of an environmental impact statement eis regarding the modernization sought and received from the federal aviation administration faa approval to impose a facility fee on passengers enplaning at.now three chicago suburbs,the villages of bensenville and elk grove and the city of park ridge,petition for review of the faa decision,alleging that,in approving chicago application,it violated the federal aviation act of,et,the administrative procedure act,a,the national environmental policy act,et,and its own regulations.because the faa did not find,as required by statute,that chicago passenger facility fee will generate only that revenue necessary to fund the eis,we grant the municipalities petition and remand for the faa further consideration.
the faa may authorize an eligible agency,a public agency controlling a commercial airport,see a,to impose a passenger facility fee of from one to three dollars on each paying passenger of an air carrier to be used to finance an eligible project,id.b.an eligible project includes a project for airport development or airport planning.id.a a.once the faa determines that an agency passenger facility fee application is substantially complete,it must advise the public of its decision by letter and give notice in the federal register of its intent to rule on the application and invite public comment thereon.see id.c b c.the faa has days after receiving the application to approve or deny it,in whole or in part.see c c.
before authorizing any passenger facility fee,however,the faa must make three specific findings based on the application.see d.the faa must find that the proposed passenger facility fee will not generate excessive revenue,that is,revenue constituting more than the amount necessary to finance the specific project.id.d.additionally,the faa must find that the specific project is an eligible project that will maintain or improve the capacity,safety,or security of the national air transportation system reduce airport noise or improve conditions for competition between or among air carriers and foreign air carriers.id.d a c.finally,the faa must find that the application includes an adequate justification for the specified project.id.d.
the faa may also authorize,under a different standard,a higher passenger facility fee of or.id.b.i n the case of an airport that has more than percent of the total number of annual boardings in the united states,the higher fee can be imposed if the faa finds that the project will make a significant contribution to improving air safety and security,increasing competition among air carriers,reducing current or anticipated congestion,or reducing the impact of aviation noise on people living near the airport.id.b a.the faa approved chicago passenger facility fee challenged here under this statutory framework.
in october,chicago department of aviation department applied to the faa for authority to impose and use a passenger facility fee of to fund a runway formulation project,the initial component of the city modernization program.joint appendix.in its application,the department explained that the modernization program would cost billion and provide for the phased reconfiguration of the airfield at as well as corresponding expansions and reconfiguration of passenger terminals,systems and necessary support facilities.according to the department,the major functional components of the program included the addition of a new runway,the relocation of three existing runways and the extension of two others.the department explained that the program also entailed the construction of an airside concourse,a western terminal and access roads,acquisition of necessary land and measures to mitigate airport noise.
as for the runway formulation project itself,the department explained that it involved the c ompletion of all technical,physical and operational planning,as well as environmental processing needed for the modernization program,with a particular focus on the impacts and requirements for the first phase of the modernization program.the department then explained in greater detail what the runway formulation project entailed.
this project includes,but is not limited to,surveys of existing conditions,including soil borings and geotechnical analyses,utility surveys,environmental surveys,drainage design,utility and other underground corridor definition,review and updating design standards,continued refinement of capital cost estimates,project scope definition and other studies as required for processing of the eis for the entire airfield and major components of other aspects of the modernization program.
the department initially estimated that the runway formulation project would cost million,response to the faa concerns about the project downsized the project and concomitantly lowered its estimated cost to million compare,with.
in support of its modernization program generally and its runway formulation project specifically,the department explained that consistently ranks as one of the nation busiest and most delayed airports.the modernization program addresses these conditions,the department explained,because it has been formulated to preserve and enhance the capacity of the national air transportation system.the department further stated that t he justification for this capital investment lies in the operational benefits reduced delays and airfield capacity enhancement that will result from the design and construction of the modernization program.turning to the subject of its application,the runway formulation project,the department explained that it will preserve and enhance the capacity and safety of the national air transportation system by providing for projects which reduce delays and congestion at and that t he analysis to be performed through this project is necessary to support environmental processing.emphasis in original.
the faa deemed chicago passenger facility fee application substantially complete on november.accordingly,the faa published notice in the federal register of its intent to rule on chicago application and invited public comment.see notice of intent to rule on application to impose a passenger facility charge pfc at chicago int l airport to use the revenue at chicago int l airport,chicago,il airport,gary,in.
in february,the faa partially approved chicago application.see final agency decision,city of chicago,dep t of aviation,chicago,il,reprinted in.in its order,the faa authorized chicago to impose and use a passenger facility fee to fund a runway formulation project with a total estimated cost of over million,a sum intended to be divided equally between the cost of the eis itself and associated financing and interest costs in doing so,the faa explained that c ongestion,capacity,and competition constraints at have been noted in many studies and reports,most recent ly the faa airport capacity benchmark report and that chicago modernization program has been formulated to address some of these concerns.the faa repeatedly noted,however,that the runway formulation project entailed only the work leading to the completion of an eis,for the modernization program,which also included the study of alternatives to the modernization program.see.according to the faa,the runway formulation project includes only that work involved in the completion of all technical,physical,and operational planning,as well as environmental processing,leading to the completion of an eis for the entire airfield and other major components of the modernization program.the faa further stressed that its authorization of the passenger facility fee to fund the eis did not in
