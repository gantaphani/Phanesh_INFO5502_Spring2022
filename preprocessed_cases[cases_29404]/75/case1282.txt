lippman,chief judge 
this appeal asks us to decide whether certain specifications in the bid solicitation of the new york city department of education doe for a school transportation contract comport with the public bidding laws.we conclude that the employee protection provisions epps contained in the solicitation are subject to heightened scrutiny,and hold that doe has not proven that the epps are designed to save the public money,encourage robust competition,or prevent favoritism.however,we apply rational basis review to the remaining disputed bid specifications and hold that doe actions regarding the pricing of school transportation and discounted payment arrangements are rational business judgments that lie within doe discretion.
prior to,the board of education of the city of new york the board administered special education and general education contracts with private bus companies for the transport of disabled children and the general population of children to their respective schools.contracts were awarded pursuant to the competitive bidding procedure under education law and included a provision requiring replacement contractors to give hiring priority,according to seniority,to employees of private bus companies who lost their jobs as a result of the change in contractor.when the board attempted to exclude this provision from certain bid solicitations,members of local,amalgamated transit union,afl cio local went on strike.
following a arbitration,the board,local,and major bus companies entered a settlement,which required the contracts to include certain employee protection provisions epps in the specifications.in particular,the epps established a master seniority list,requiring contractors with the board to give priority in hiring to employees on the list when such employees become unemployed because of reassignment of busing contracts.the new york city department of transportation dot,however,had at the same time been administering transportation contracts for young children in the pre k and early intervention ei programs by competitive,sealed bidding,without such epps.
in,dot transferred its pre k and ei contracts to doe.local,which represents approximately drivers and escorts who work for pre k and ei bus companies,requested that doe include the epps in its solicitation for contract bids.doe agreed,and the solicitation provided that 
a ny new contractors,those who did not provide service pursuant to contract expiring june,shall give priority in employment in july,or thereafter on the basis of seniority to every operator driver,mechanic,dispatcher and attendant performing service pursuant to such contract starting from the first employee from the master seniority list until such master seniority list is exhausted bid solicitation.
a similar provision applied to existing contractors see id.
doe invited bids for providing transportation between home and school to handicapped children participating in pre k and ei programs.bids were required to be submitted on a per rider per day basis so that doe could track transportation costs per child for purposes of its own reimbursement.doe solicited bids on a contract to transport participants to schools,not necessarily located in the same borough,based on an estimate of the number of participants and the frequency and level of transportation required at any given time.the contract also provided doe with a discount for timely payment and vendors with increased reimbursement in the event of a reduction in the number of children transported but only if the decrease were to exceed of ridership.
petitioners,transportation vendors,commenced this cplr article proceeding to prevent doe from implementing the allegedly illegal bid solicitation.petitioners asserted that the requirement that bids be submitted on a per rider per day basis created such grave uncertainties,that potential bidders would submit speculative bids,risk substantial economic harm,or not bid at all.moreover,petitioners urged that inclusion of epps would cause bidders to inflate their bids to protect against the unknown costs of giving priority to whichever employees from the master seniority list were unemployed after the doe awarded the contracts.likewise,petitioners claimed that the failure to include in the solicitation the addresses or boroughs of children to be bused,as had been included in dot prior solicitation,prevented bidders from calculating costs.petitioners also sought revision or removal of nine specific provisions of the solicitation.local was granted leave to intervene and moved to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action insofar as petitioners sought to bar the inclusion of epps.
as relevant to this appeal,supreme court granted the petition to the extent of declaring the following bid specifications unlawful i section,employee protection provisions ii section b,regarding doe right to change the service requirements in the contractor manual at any time without prior notice iii section,to the extent it permitted doe to add entire schools and programs in the vendors service requirements without adjusting the vendors prices iv section,to the extent it provided for a price adjustment only in the event of a loss of ridership in excess of v section,liquidated damages and vi section discount for doe for prompt payment.supreme court additionally ordered doe to include in the specifications the addresses of children who currently participated in pre busing 
the appellate division affirmed the relevant aspects of supreme court order matter of l m bus v new york city of,dept.discussing the uncertainty inherent in various provisions of the bid specifications,the court observed that the solicitation presents a considerable challenge to potential bidders due to the complexity in ascertaining the extent of the transportation services to be supplied id.at and that further difficulty arises in the uncertainty surrounding the individual contractor responsibility for labor costs id.at.in striking the epps,the court reasoned,the anticompetitive impact resulting from the restriction of the vendors autonomy to hire nonunion workers subjects these arrangements to the same scrutiny applied to project labor agreements id.at.
we granted leave to appeal and now modify the appellate division order.
general municipal law mandates that all contracts for public work be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder.education law and family court act b,which governs the busing of children participating in ei programs,similarly require that transportation contracts be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder dual aims underlie these requirements protection of the public fisc by obtaining the best work at the lowest possible price and prevention of favoritism,improvidence,fraud and corruption in the awarding of public contracts matter of new york state,associated contrs.of am.v new york state thruway,hereinafter new york state chapter.
doe contends that the appellate division erred by applying to epps the heightened standard of review used to evaluate project labor agreements plas.a pla is a prebid contract between a construction project owner and a labor union or unions establishing the union as the collective bargaining representative for all persons who will perform work on the project and typically provides that only contractors and subcontractors who sign a prenegotiated agreement with the union can perform project work id.at.consistent with the goals of public bidding laws,we held in matter of council of city of v bloomberg hereinafter council bloomberg that plas and other procedures having an anticompetitive effect on the bidding process can be justified only by proof that they are designed to save the public money by causing contracts to be performed at smaller cost or without disruption id.at.
in new york state chapter at,we ruled 
that the features of plas that trigger heightened scrutiny are their atypical nature and comprehensive scope 
generally,when a public entity adopts a specification in the letting of public work that impedes the competition to bid for such work,it must be rationally related to these twin purposes.where it is no
