on may,a valujet commercial airliner crashed in the florida everglades and all persons on board perished.it was a tragic accident that could have been avoided.following an investigation,the government,for the first time,indicted an aviation repair station,sabretech,and several of its employees for various violations related to the transportation of hazardous materials.the record reflects that these aviation repair station personnel committed mistakes,but they did not commit crimes.the jury found sabretech not guilty of willful violations of the hazardous materials transportation act hmta.the jury did,however,find sabretech guilty of recklessly causing the transportation of hazardous material in air commerce.we hold that the government and the district court improperly relied upon hazardous materials regulations that had not been authorized by the federal aviation act faa,as required by,to support the reckless counts.as will be discussed infra,these counts are a legal nullity.accordingly,we affirm in part,vacate and remand in part.
background 
from july until june,sabretech engaged in the repair,modification,and maintenance of commercial aircraft.in january,valujet airlines delivered three used mcdonnell douglas aircraft to sabretech facility in miami,florida,for major modification and maintenance prior to their introduction into the valujet fleet.in the course of overhauling these aircraft,sabretech mechanics determined that many of the oxygen generators had exceeded their year service life.valujet personnel issued written work orders instructing the mechanics to remove the old oxygen generators and install new ones.the work orders listed steps for sabretech mechanics to follow when replacing the old oxygen generators with new ones.the work orders contained a warning that unexpended oxygen generators could generate extremely high temperatures.
in the process of removing the old oxygen generators,mechanic john taber taber noticed the absence of shipping caps.taber asked his supervisor david wiles wiles about the shipping caps,and wiles told him to set the old generators aside and continue working.taber,along with fellow mechanics robert rodriguez rodriguez and eugene florence florence,then proceeded to wrap the lanyards tightly around the firing pins of the generators and tape the ends of the lanyards to the body of the generators to prevent the release of the trigger mechanism.in march,new generators,bearing yellow,stickers,arrived at the sabretech facility.the mechanics installed the new generators and tagged the old generators with green unserviceable tags on which they wrote as the reason for removal.the mechanics boxed the old generators and stored them in the hangar where they remained for six weeks.
on may,sabretech shipping clerk andy salas salas the generators with bubble wrap and placed them in boxes that he sealed with tape.he placed valujet comat labels on the boxes,indicating that the boxes contained valujet company materials.the shipping ticket described the contents as boxes of oxy canisters empty.the next day,a sabretech driver took the boxes to the valujet ramp area where flight was scheduled to depart for atlanta.valujet personnel placed the boxes in the forward section of the aircraft cargo compartment.shortly after,a fire erupted on the plane.flight crashed into the everglades and killed all persons on board.
on july,a grand jury returned a indictment against sabretech and employees daniel gonzalez gonzalez,florence,and mario valenzuela valenzuela count i charged all defendants with conspiracy to make false statements on aircraft maintenance records,in violation of.count ii charged gonzalez with knowingly and willfully making a false statement on a maintenance record,in violation of.counts charged sabretech,florence,and valenzuela with knowingly and willfully making false statements on valujet maintenance records,in violation of.counts vii,ix,xi,xiii,xv,xvii,xix,and xxi charged sabretech with willfully causing the transportation in air commerce of hazardous materials without complying with packaging,marking,and labeling requirements of hazardous materials regulations,in violation of the hmta,and a,a,a,a,e,b,a a,b.counts viii,x,xii,xiv,xvi,xviii,xx,and xxii charged sabretech with willfully causing the transportation in air commerce of oxygen generators,in violation of the faa,and.these counts also charged all defendants with recklessly causing the transportation in air commerce of oxygen generators,in violation of and.count xxiii charged sabretech with willfully failing to train its employees in accordance with hazardous materials regulations,in violation of,and a,a.count xxiv charged sabretech with willfully placing destructive devices on the plane,in violation of the aircraft sabotage act,and.
prior to trial,sabretech moved to dismiss the section counts,arguing that the faa had not authorized,as required by,the hazardous materials regulations cited as predicates for the alleged criminal activity.following argument,a magistrate judge recommended that the counts be dismissed.the district court rejected the recommendation.the trial commenced,and at the conclusion of the government case,sabretech renewed its pretrial motion to dismiss the section counts.the district court denied that motion.sabretech also moved for judgment of acquittal on the section counts,the section counts,and the hazardous materials training count,on the ground that the government had presented insufficient evidence to support these counts.the district court also denied this motion.the district court did,however,grant a judgment of acquittal to florence,finding the evidence insufficient to support a section charge against him.
after trial,the jury acquitted sabretech of counts i,ix,xi,xiii,xv,xvii,xix,xxi,and xxiv.the jury found sabretech guilty of counts viii,x,xii,xiv,xvi,xviii,xx,xxii,and xxiii.the jury acquitted gonzalez of all charges and florence of all remaining charges.following an extensive sentencing hearing,the district court sentenced sabretech to pay a fine of and restitution of.

iv.discussion 
validity of reckless counts 
sabretech argues that the statutory and regulatory history creates a dichotomy between the hmta and the faa that can not support as a crime the reckless violations of the hazardous materials regulations.it contends that the reckless counts are a legal nullity.in these counts,the government alleged that sabretech should be punished pursuant to criminal penalty provision of the former violation of certain hazardous materials regulations.section a makes it a crime to recklessly cause to be transported hazardous material in violation of any regulation or requirement prescribed under the faa.sabretech posits that the regulations it was convicted of recklessly violating were not enacted under the faa.these regulations were promulgated under a different statutory hmta.that statute penalizes only willful violations of its regulations.therefore,sabretech contends that the government improperly charged it with a crime.we agree
