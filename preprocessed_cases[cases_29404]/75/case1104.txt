factual and procedural background 
california online privacy protection act of 
in,the legislature added sections through to the business and professions code,known as the online privacy protection act of oppa,to address the obligations of an operator of a commercial web site or online service regarding the posting of a privacy policy on the internet.stats,ch.the legislature found and declared all of the following a each operator of a commercial web site or online service has an obligation to post privacy policies that inform consumers who are located in california of the web site or online service information practices with regard to the consumers personally identifiable information and to abide by those policies.b it is the intent of the legislature to require each operator of a commercial web site or online service to provide individual consumers residing in california who use or visit the commercial web site or online service with notice of its privacy policies,thus improving the knowledge these individuals have as to whether personally identifiable information obtained by the commercial web site through the internet may be disclosed,sold,or shared.c it is the intent of the legislature that internet service providers or similar entities shall have no obligations under this act related to personally identifiable information that they transmit or store at the request of third parties.stats,ch.

delta fly delta mobile application 
delta is primarily an air carrier engaged in the business of providing passenger air transportation.to facilitate access to its services by consumers and potential consumers,delta maintains a commercial website accessible on the internet.since at least october,delta is also an operator of online services,in the form of the fly delta mobile application,which can be downloaded from the internet and runs on smart phones and other mobile devices.in its complaint,the state alleges that the fly delta mobile application may be used to online for an airplane flight,view reservations for air travel,rebook cancelled or missed flights,pay for checked baggage,track checked baggage,access a user frequent flyer account,take photographs,and even save a user.the fly delta mobile application also allegedly allows customers to send and receive information over the internet,and collects certain personally identifiable information pii about individual consumers residing in california however,as of the filing of the complaint,delta had failed to post a readily accessible privacy policy concerning the pii collected from users of the fly delta mobile application either in the fly delta mobile application itself,in the platform stores from which the mobile application could be downloaded,or on the website consequently,as of the filing of the complaint,the current version of the fly delta mobile application,released june,on google and june,on apple,had been downloaded by consumers millions of time since october without the posted privacy policy required by the oppa.and,thus,users of the fly delta mobile application were not informed that pii was collected concerning them,how delta used that information,or to whom that information was shared,disclosed or sold.
by a letter dated october,the state attorney general notified delta that its fly delta mobile application did not comply with the requirements of the oppa,and that violations of the oppa were subject to enforcement under the ucl.among other things,delta was told that a web site or online service operator that collects personally identifiable information pii and fails to post its privacy policy that complies with statutory requirements within days after being notified of noncompliance is in violation of the oppa.delta was asked to respond within days of the date of the letter with the following information delta specific plans and timeline to comply with the law or why delta believed the fly delta mobile application was not covered by the law.on october,several media sources reported that delta had released a statement that said we have received a letter from the attorney general and intend to provide the requested information.
superior court proceeding 
on december,the state filed this lawsuit alleging that as of the filing of the complaint,the fly delta mobile application on multiple platforms still does not have a privacy policy conspicuously posted,reasonably accessible to consumers within the mobile application.the complaint sole cause of action alleged that delta was in violation of the ucl by committing unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent business acts and practices,including,but not limited to,the following a delta has continued to fail to conspicuously post a privacy policy in its fly delta mobile application,in violation of the oppa,despite receiving written notice on or about october,from the attorney general that the fly delta mobile application was noncompliant with section of the oppa,and such unlawful failure to comply is made either i knowingly or willfully or ii negligently and materially,pursuant to section and b delta has further violated section of the oppa,by failing to even comply with the website privacy policy posted on the delta website,in that the fly delta application does not comply with the delta website privacy policy,and such unlawful failure to comply is made either i knowingly and willfully or ii negligently and materially.in its prayer for relief,the state sought for each violation of the ucl,proved at trial,injunctive relief enjoining delta from committing any acts of unfair competition,and an award of costs of the lawsuit including attorney fees and investigation costs.
in lieu of an answer,delta filed a demurrer,arguing,in pertinent part,that the plain terms of the ada,and united states supreme court decisions interpreting the ada broad preemption provision,compelled the conclusion that the federal law expressly preempted the state lawsuit.the state opposed the demurrer,arguing that the ada did not preempt its lawsuit.finding that the ada expressly preempted the state lawsuit,the superior court sustained delta demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.the state timely appeal ensued

iii.the ada preemption provision b 
prior to,the federal aviation act of faa stats,as amended.et,gave the civil aeronautics board cab authority to regulate interstate airfares and to take administrative action against certain deceptive trade practices.it did not,however,expressly state regulation,and contained a savings clause providing that nothing in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute,but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.now c.as a result,the states were able to regulate intrastate airfares including those offered by interstate air carriers see,california cab,cert.denied,and to enforce their own laws against deceptive trade practices.see nader allegheny airlines.morales trans world airlines,morales.
in,however,congress,determining that maximum reliance on competitive market forces would best further efficiency,innovation,and low prices as well as variety and quality of air transportation services,enacted the airline deregulation act ada.a,a now a,a.to ensure that the states would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own,the ada included a provision,prohibiting the states from enforcing any law relating to rates,routes,or services of any air carrier.a now b.morales,supra,at.in its current form,this provision states that a state,political subdivision of a state,or political authority of at least states may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier that may provide air transportation under this subpart.b.northwest,ginsberg,supra.at ginsberg.the ada retained the cab previous enforcement authority regarding deceptive trade practices which was transferred to the department of transportation dot when the cab was abolished in,and it also did not repeal or alter the saving clause in the prior law.morales,supra,at.
the united states supreme court has addressed the reach of the ada preemption provision in three cases morales,supra,wolens,supra,and ginsberg,supra.
in,in morales,the high court confronted detailed travel industry enforcement guidelines,composed by the national association of attorneys general naag.the naag guidelines purported to govern,inter alia,the content and format of airline fare advertising.see morales,supra,at appendix to court opinion setting out naag guidelines on air travel industry advertising and marketing practices.several states had endeavored to enforce the naag guidelines,under the states general consumer protection laws,to stop allegedly deceptive airline advertisements.the states initiative,the high court determined,related to airline prices,routes,or services,morales,supra,at consequently,the high court held,the fare advertising provisions of the naag guidelines were preempted by the ada morales,supra,at.wolens,supra,at.morales,in pertinent part,broadly defined the relating to language in the ada preemption clause as having a connection with,or reference to,airline prices,routes,or services,even if the state law did not directly regulate those activities.morales,supra,at,see also rowe new hampshire motor transp,rowe,quoting with approval morales,supra,at.but,as later explained by the high court,in wolens,t he morales opinion presented much more,however,in accounting for the ada preemption of the state regulation in question.the opinion pointed out that the concerned federal agencies the department of transportation dot and the federal trade commission ftc objected to the naag fare advertising guidelines as inconsistent with the ada deregulatory purpose both agencies,morales observed,regarded the guidelines as state regulatory measures preempted by the ada.citations.morales emphasized that the challenged guidelines set binding requirements as to how airline tickets may be marketed,and imposed obligations that would have a significant impact upon the fares airlines charge.citation.the opinion further noted that the airlines would not have carte blanche to lie or deceive consumers,for the dot retains the power to prohibit advertisements which in its opinion do not further competitive pricing.citation.morales also left room for state actions too tenuous,remote,or peripheral to have effect.citation.wolens,supra,at,fn.omitted.
in,in wolens,supra,the high court again considered the application of the ada preemption clause to a claim concerning an airline frequent flyer program.wolens,supra,at.the illinois supreme court had held that the ada did not prohibit american airlines american frequent flyer program members from pursuing a claim for money damages based on an allegation that the airline retroactive modification of the program benefits violated illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act consumer fraud act or act.wolens,supra,at.describing frequent flyer programs as not essential,but merely peripheral to the operation of an airline,the illinois court typed plaintiffs claims as related to american prices,routes,and services only tangentially or tenuously id.at.the high court reversed,and held that the ada preemption prescription bars regulation of air carriers wolens,supra,at.in so ruling,the high court initially addressed the illinois supreme court decision in the following manner we need not dwell on the question whether plaintiffs complaints state claims relating to air carrier prices,routes,or services.morales,we are satisfied,does not countenance the illinois supreme court separation of matters essential from matters unessential to airline operations.plaintiffs claims relate to prices,american charges in the form of mileage credits for free tickets and upgrades,and to services,access to flights and upgrades unlimited by retrospectively applied capacity controls and blackout dates.wolens,supra,at.as to the issue of whether plaintiffs claims under the illinois consumer fraud act were preempted,the high court explained the illinois consumer fraud act declares unlawful u nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices,including but not limited to the use or employment of any deception,fraud,false pretense,false promise,misrepresentation or the concealment,suppression or omission of any material fact,with intent that others rely upon the concealment,suppression or omission of such material fact,or the use or employment of any practice described in section of the uniform deceptive trade practices act in the conduct of any trade or commerce whether any person has in fact been misled,deceived or damaged thereby.citation.the act is prescriptive it controls the primary conduct of those falling within its governance.this illinois law,in fact,is paradigmatic of the consumer protection legislation underpinning the naag guidelines.the naag task force on the air travel industry,on which the attorneys general of california,illinois,texas,and washington served citation,reported that the guidelines created no new laws or regulations regarding the advertising practices or other business practices of the airline industry.they merely explain in detail how existing state laws apply to air fare advertising and frequent flyer programs.citation.the naag guidelines highlight the potential for intrusive regulation of airline business practices inherent in state consumer protection legislation typified by the consumer fraud act.for example,the guidelines enforcing the legislation instruct airlines on language appropriate to reserve rights to alter frequent flyer programs,and they include transition rules for the fair institution of capacity controls.citation.as the naag guidelines illustrate,the consumer fraud act serves as a means to guide and police the marketing practices of the airlines the act does not simply give effect to bargains offered by the airlines and accepted by airline customers.in light of the full text of the preemption clause,and of the ada purpose to leave largely to the airlines themselves,and not at all to states,the selection and design of marketing mechanisms appropriate to the furnishing of air transportation services,the court conclude d that the ada preempts plaintiffs claims under the illinois consumer fraud act.wolens,supra,at,fn.omitted see also rowe,supra,at,citing with approval wolens,supra,at.
and,in ginsberg,supra,the high court again considered the reach of the ada preemption provision to a claim based on an airline alleged violation of its frequent flyer program.id.at.in that case,the plaintiff filed a class action on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated members of northwest frequent flyer program,alleging,among other things,that the airline had breached its implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it terminated the plaintiff membership in its frequent flyer program.id.at.the trial court determined that the breach of implied covenant claim was preempted because it related to northwest rates and services and thus fell within the ada preemption provision.ginsberg,supra,at.on appeal,t he ninth circuit court of appeal reversed.citation.relying on circuit precedent,the ninth circuit first held that a breach of implied covenant claim is too tenuously connected to airline regulation to trigger preemption under the ada.citation.such a claim,the ninth circuit wrote,does not interfere with the ada deregulatory mandate and does not force the airlines to adopt or change their prices,routes,or services the prerequisite for preemption.citation.in addition,the ninth circuit held that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not fall within the terms of the ada provision because it does not have a direct effect on either prices or services.citation.ginsberg,supra,at.the high court reversed.it found that under the circumstances presented,the breach of implied covenant claim was preempted by the ada.ginsburg,supra,at.reaffirming morales broad interpretation of the ada preemption provision id.at,the high court concluded that the breach of implied covenant claim relate d to prices,routes,or services.id.at.the high court stated a claim satisfies this requirement if it has a connection with,or reference to,airline prices,routes,or services morales,supra,at,and the claim at issue here clearly has such a connection.that claim seeks the plaintiff reinstatement in northwest frequent flyer program so that he can access the program valuable benefits,including flight upgrades,accumulated mileage,loyalty program status or benefits on other airlines,and other advantages.citation.like the frequent flyer program in wolens,the northwest program is connected to the airline rates because the program awards mileage credits that can be redeemed for tickets and upgrades.citation.when miles are used in this way,the rate that a customer pays,the price of a particular ticket is either eliminated or reduced.the program is also connected to services,access to flights and to higher service categories.citation.ginsberg,supra,at.the high court further noted that its ruling did not leave participants in frequent flyer programs without protection.the ada is based on the view that the best interests of airline passengers are most effectively promoted,in the main,by allowing the free market to operate.if an airline acquires a reputation for mistreating the participants in a frequent flyer program who are generally the airline most loyal and valuable customers,customers can avoid that program and may be able to enroll in a more favorable rival program.federal law also provides protection for frequent flyer program participants.congress has given the department of transportation dot the general authority to prohibit and punish unfair and deceptive practices in air transportation and in the sale of air transportation a,and congress has specifically authorized the dot to investigate complaints relating to frequent flyer programs.see faa modernization and reform act of,stats.pursuant to these provisions,the dot regularly entertains and acts on such complaints.ginsberg,supra,at.
having described our high court pertinent decisions in this area of law,we now discuss whether the ada preemption provision bars state enforcement of the oppa as applied to delta fly delta mobile application.
iv.the ada as applied to the state lawsuit to enforce the oppa against delta 
preliminary to our analysis,we address several issues that have been conclusively disposed of by morales and wolens.
we agree with the attorney general that in determining whether the ada preempts this ucl action,we examine the underlying state law predicate for the ucl action the oppa.morales calls for an analysis of the underlying state regulations to see if they relate to an air carrier prices,routes,or services when enforced through the ucl.people ex rel.harris pac anchor transportation,cal th,cert.denied.pac anchor transportation see morales,supra,at.
however,we reject the attorney general argument that in our analysis,we are required to presume congress did not intend to preempt the oppa.t he presumption against preemption only arises if congress legislates in a field traditionally occupied by the states.citation.in matters of air transportation,the federal presence is both longstanding and pervasive that field is simply not one traditionally reserved to the states.the supreme court has not suggested that the presumption against preemption should be interposed in that field,nor has the high court been hesitant to give force to the ada preemption provision.brown united airlines,cir,see difiore american airlines,cir,difiore buck american airlines,cir,buck.our conclusion is supported by morales and wolens,in which the high court has not adopted the attorney general position in this case that we should presume strongly against preempting in areas historically occupied by state law.difiore,supra,at buck,supra.at.instead,in resolving the scope of the ada preemption provision,the high court analyses in those cases centered on the impact that the challenged state law would have on airline prices and services,and not on the fact that the preempted laws were enacted pursuant to the states police power to combat consumer fraud.de jesus american airlines,puerto rico d,de jesus see wolens,supra,at the ada preemption prescription bars regulation of air carriers morales,supra,at ada preemption prescription bars state enforcement of naag fare advertising guidelines under the states general consumer protection laws.
we also reject the attorney general argument that the complaint does not relate to delta services.by its complaint,the state seeks to compel delta to maintain its fly delta mobile application in compliance with the oppa privacy policy requirements.the fly delta mobile application,selected and designed to facilitate access to the airline services,is a marketing mechanism appropriate to the furnishing of air transportation services.wolens,supra,at.as alleged in the complaint,the fly delta mobile application,at a minimum,may be used to online for an airplane flight,view reservations for air travel,rebook cancelled or missed flights,pay for checked baggage,track checked baggage,and access a user frequent flyer account.thus,it is clear,beyond cavil,that the complaint does relate to delta services in that the allegations have a connection with,or reference to delta services 
we additionally find no merit to the attorney general assertions that the oppa is a law of general applicability,which does not reference or coercively regulate delta services,and delta is not required to offer a mobile application in order to conduct its business,and therefore,the oppa applies to delta only because delta chooses to provide a mobile application that is subject to the oppa.italics in original.again,the high court has disposed of these arguments in morales and wolens.rejecting the argument that only state laws specifically addressed to the airline industry are,whereas the ada imposes no constraints on laws of general applicability,morales explained besides creating an utterly irrational loophole there is little reason why state impairment of the federal scheme should be deemed acceptable so long as it is effected by the particularized application of a general statute,this notion ignores the sweep of the relating to language.morales,supra,at.the high court has also made it clear that ada preemption does not turn on whether the state law is related to a matter essential,as opposed to a matter that is unessential,to airline operations.wolens,supra,at.
we now turn to the issue before us,namely,whether the complaint under the oppa is preempted by the ada.in light of the full text of the preemption clause,and of the ada purpose to leave largely to the airlines themselves,and not at all to the states,the selection and design of marketing mechanisms appropriate to the furnishing of air transportation services wolens,supra,at,we conclude the ada preempts the state claim under the oppa as applied to delta operation of its fly delta mobile application.
in arguing against federal preemption,the attorney general asserts the oppa is merely a disclosure regime,in that other than some baseline requirements,the oppa gives the operator of online services broad discretion as to what to say and where to conspicuously post the policy a ny policy will do.the law simply requires that an operator have a policy and then follow it.however,the attorney general argument does not fully capture the scope of the compliance mechanism under the oppa.the state,through the oppa,seeks to mandate delta compliance with the baseline requirements of the statute as applied to its fly delta mobile application.the law,among other things,requires operators of online services to draft a privacy policy describing their collection of certain categories of personally identifiable information,and to provide for a reasonably accessible means of making the privacy policy available for consumers of the online service.bus,subds.a,b.thus,similar to the naag guidelines in morales and the illinois consumer fraud act in wolens,the oppa is prescriptive it controls the primary conduct of those falling within its governance.wolens,supra,at.it serves as a means to guide and police the marketing practices of the airline the oppa does not simply give effect to bargains offered by the airline and accepted by airline customers,as the attorney general suggests.wolens,supra,at.this california law,in fact,is paradigmatic of the consumer protection legislation underpinning the naag guidelines and the illinois consumer fraud act,and highlight s the potential for intrusive regulation of airline business practices inherent in state consumer protection legislation wolens,supra,at.
more significantly,like the obligations imposed by the naag guidelines,a ll,in all,the obligations imposed by the oppa would have a significant impact upon the airline ability to market its product through its fly delta mobile application,and hence a significant impact upon the fares they charge.morales,supra,at.if each state were to require delta to comply with its own version of the oppa,it would force delta to design different mobile applications to meet the requirements of each state.and,indeed,enforcement of the oppa privacy policy requirements might well make it impossible for an airline to use a mobile application as a marketing mechanism at all.morales,supra,at.thus,to interpret the ada preemption provision not to reach the oppa could easily lead to a patchwork of state laws,rules,and regulations,which would be inconsistent with congress s major legislative effort to leave such decisions,where federally unregulated,to the competitive marketplace.air transport of america,cuomo cir,per curiam see wolens,supra,at,congress could hardly have intended to allow the states to hobble competition for airline passengers through the application of restrictive state laws the ada was designed to promote maximum reliance on competitive market forces.
we also reject the attorney general argument that the oppa does not run afoul of the ada because it would have at best a peripheral effect on ticket prices,routes,or airline services.when the high court invoked the rubric tenuous,remote,or peripheral,it used as examples limitations on gambling,prostitution and obscenity state regulation comparatively remote to the transportation function.difiore,supra,at,citing to morales,supra,at.because the oppa would require delta to meet state standards regarding privacy policy requirements in place of the market forces currently dictating delta selection and design of its fly delta mobile application,the effect of the oppa would not be tenuous,remote or peripheral.morales,supra,at.nor are we persuaded by the attorney general assertion that the cost to delta to comply with the oppa would be minimal because within a day of the state filing its complaint delta was able to post a privacy policy for the fly delta mobile application.see bower egyptair airlines cir,cert.denied.the ada preempts laws regulating the operations of airlines whether at high cost or low.
we conclude our discussion by noting that we do not write on an entirely clean slate.several federal district courts have considered the scope of ada preemption in the context of state enforcement of consumer protection laws similar to the ucl for an air carrier violation of its privacy policy regarding the collection of pii.all the courts have reached the same conclusion we reach here today the ada preempts claims seeking to enforce air carriers privacy policies through consumer protection laws similar to the ucl.see in re jetblue airways.privacy litigation d jetblue airways in re american airlines,privacy litigation d american airlines copeland northwest airlines dist.lexis copeland in re northwest airlines privacy litigation dist.lexis northwest airlines.in these cases,the plaintiffs claimed to have been injured by an airline unauthorized collection and disclosure of certain of their pii in their passenger name records pnrs in violation of the airline stated privacy policies concerning the sharing of pii.jetblue airways,supra,at,american airlines,supra,at copeland,supra,at pp.northwest airlines,supra,at.the plaintiffs alleged the airlines conduct constituted deceptive trade practices under the texas deceptive trade practices consumer protection act,the new york general business law,the minnesota deceptive trade practices act,the tennessee consumer protection act,and similar statutes of other states and the district of columbia,which prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices.jetblue airways,supra,at,fn.american airlines,supra,at copeland,supra,at,fn.northwest airlines,supra,at.the federal district courts uniformly concluded that the plaintiffs claims were expressly preempted by the ada under morales and wolens.jetblue airways,supra,at american airlines,supra,at copeland,supra,at pp.northwest airlines,supra,at pp.as the federal district court in jetblue airways explained,the plaintiffs claim concerning a violation of the airline privacy policy fits squarely within the range of state law actions that the supreme court concluded,in wolens and morales,are expressly preempted by the ada,because it represents a direct effort to regulate the manner in which the airline communicates with its customers in connection with reservations and ticket sales,both of which are services provided by the airline to its customers.jetblue airways,supra,at.and,as further explained by another federal district court,and pertinent to our discussion,congress surely intended to immunize airlines from a host of potentially varying state laws and causes of action that could effectively dictate how air lines manage personal information collected from customers to facilitate the ticketing and reservation functions that are integral to the operation of a commercial airline.american airlines,supra,at.we find these decisions both persuasive and dispositive of the federal preemption issue in this case 
we therefore hold that state enforcement of the oppa privacy policy requirements as applied to delta fly delta mobile application is expressly preempted by the ada.to compel delta to comply with the oppa would effectively interfere with the airline selection and design of its mobile application,a marketing mechanism appropriate to the furnishing of air transportation service,for which state enforcement has been held to be expressly preempted by the ada.wolens,supra,at see morales,supra,at.
state request for leave to amend 
when a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the superior court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citations.zelig county of los angeles cal th.as we have concluded,the allegations as currently set out in the complaint are not sufficient to impose liability on delta under existing statutes or case law.the attorney general argues,however,that the complaint can be amended to delete any reference to the collection of passenger ticketing information,and to retain allegations of the collection of pii data information and photographs and t
