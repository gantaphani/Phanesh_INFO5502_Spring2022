hornbeck offshore transportation,llc owns and operates oil transport vessels,including the energy,a oil barge.all oil barges have been slated to be phased out under the oil pollution act of opa,but the actual date depends on a vessel gross tonnage.c.the coast guard initially assigned a date which hornbeck believed was too early.after successfully challenging the coast guard initial determination under the administrative procedure act apa,hornbeck filed a tort suit under the federal tort claims act ftca,seeking recovery of for the alleged damages caused by the misassignment.because hornbeck common law allegations have no local law analog,we reject his ftca claims and affirm the district court dismissal.
background 
after the exxon valdez oil spill,congress passed the opa,requiring all newly constructed barges to be to reduce the risk of similar accidents.a.oil vessels that predated the as the energy subject to statutory dates based on gross tonnage as relevant here,if the gross tonnage of the barge was gross tons or more,it had to be phased out by january,id.c a vii if the gross tonnage of the barge was less than gross tons,it had to be phased out by january,id.c.
there are two methods of determining the gross tonnage of a barge the regulatory system and the convention system.see id.e.in,the energy regulatory system measurement was tons.in,the convention system measurement was tons.hornbeck requested a date based on the lighter measurement.the coast guard denied the request and assigned a date.see hornbeck offshore,llc coast guard,d,discussing in detail the statutory framework,the measurement systems,and the coast guard decision.
in,hornbeck filed an apa suit challenging the assigned date and,while the suit was still pending,took its barge out of service.see id.at.after the district court interpreted the statutory language to require the later date,id.at,the coast guard changed energy date to,and hornbeck placed the barge back into service.
in,hornbeck filed a lawsuit under the ftca,for both negligent and intentional torts,seeking consequential damages for the lost profits while its barge was out of service.see hornbeck offshore,llc united states,d.hornbeck claims it lost over million dollars in potential profits as a result of the coast guard lack of due care,negligence,and wrongful acts in assigning an improper opa date for the barge.compl.the district court granted the government motion to dismiss the ftca suit for lack of jurisdiction,holding that the united states has sovereign immunity because there is no local private analog to hornbeck claim.d at.
ii.discussion 
the ftca waives sovereign immunity under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.b.this statutory text does not create a cause of action against the united states it allows the united states to be liable if a private party would be liable under similar circumstances in the relevant jurisdiction.we look to the law of the local this case,the district of determine whether there is a local private party analog to hornbeck claims.we conclude there is none.hornbeck identifies no duty that would give rise to liability under district of columbia law its claims arise purely out of a federal statutory scheme that has no local analog.although hornbeck casts its complaint in common law and intentional action can sustain its claim,as neither action is analogous to the federal legal duty that was violated.
federal law 
violations of federal not accompanied by any local law support a suit under the ftca.art,united states.the supreme court has consistently held that b reference to the law of the place means law of the source of substantive liability under the ftca.fdic meyer,d.in meyer,the court rejected the applicability of the ftca to a tort based on a constitutional violation,holding that federal law,not state law,provides the source of liability for a claim alleging the deprivation of a federal constitutional right.id.the same is true in this case.
although hornbeck attempts to bring its claims under tort law,the violation flows only from a federal statute specifying dates for c which permits barges under gross tons to continue to operate until.according to hornbeck own complaint,its negligence suit is based entirely on the coast guard assigning an improper date and failing to assign the proper date for the energy.compl.this,according to hornbeck own what caused injuries and damages in the amount of.id.as the very allegations make clear,the only alleged error in this case was the coast guard failure to follow federal law.no local law imposes tort liability for bungling the date for hornbeck barge.
absent the federal law requirement,hornbeck could not possibly have a claim for damages.without the opa provision,hornbeck it it does not have any claim for injury.oral arg.recording at if they had applied the statute c correctly,that true,we would have a lawsuit.clearly,then,the only basis for hornbeck claim is a federal statute,not any state or local law.although the ftca can apply where a federal statute provide s the standard of care against which the government conduct should be assessed,art metal,at,nothing in the federal provision suggests the creation of a standard of care to be applied under local law.nor does the statute indicate that the government has assumed duties under local tort law.id.at.
in art metal,we affirmed dismissal for a negligence suit brought against the united states for failure to follow federal regulations and due process requirements.at.in a holding directly applicable here,art metal explained that by basing its negligence claim entirely on violations of federal duties,the plaintiff fails to consider that the ftca waives the immunity of the united states only to the extent that a private person in like circumstances could be found liable in tort under local law.id.at emphasis added.it is that the violation of a federal statute or regulation by government officials does not of itself create a cause of action under the ftca.id.
hornbeck attempts to circumnavigate the local law requirement by arguing that there is a general duty of one who undertakes an action to act with due care.appellant br.at.although we do not doubt that this extremely generalized standard of due care may be part of common law of negligence,citation to the generic duty to act with due care while undertaking an action does not help hornbeck in this case.the ftca local law requirement may not be circumvented merely by casting the alleged constitutional wrong as negligence.art metal,at.similar reasoning applies here,where hornbeck has merely a violation of a federal statute as common law claims.we agree with the reasoning of several of our sister circuits,which have noted that i t is virtually axiomatic that the ftca does not apply where the claimed negligence arises out of the failure of the united states to carry out a federal statutory duty in the conduct of its own affairs.sea air shuttle united states,cir second alteration in original see also united states agronics,cir johnson sawyer,cir en banc t he ftca is unavailable where t he existence or nonexistence of the claim depends entirely upon federal statutes.second alteration in original.
to say the violation of a federal statute can not be the sole basis of an ftca claim is not to say the claim must exist entirely independently of any federal provision.it means the claim must at least be supported by analogous local,a private person guilty of similar malfeasance would be liable under local law.in other words,an ftca claim is not necessarily barred if it is partially related to a federal statute,because the ultimate inquiry is always whether there is a proper local analog.art metal,at.but where a claim is wholly grounded on a duty created by a federal statute such that there is no local law that could support liability of a private party for similar actions,the ftca does not apply.johnson,at.
despite hornbeck heavy reliance on indian towing united states,that case is distinguishable.in indian towing,the supreme court
