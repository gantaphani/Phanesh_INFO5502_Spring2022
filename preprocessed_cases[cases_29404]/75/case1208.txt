introduction 
the issue in this case is whether state law requires the santa clara valley transportation authority vta to bargain with a certain labor union when the bargaining unit the union represents includes supervisory and management personnel.resolution of the issue turns upon interpretation of two arguably contradictory sections of the public utilities code section states that all questions relating to the collective bargaining rights of vta employees are to be resolved by application of relevant provisions of the federal labor management relations act of et lmra.section applies to a subset of employees who transferred to vta from other public entities in as a result of reorganizing legislation.this section requires vta to recognize the employee organizations that represented the transferring employees immediately prior to their employment by vta.the apparent contradiction between the two code sections is that under the lmra,an employer may not be compelled to bargain with supervisors and managers,but section appears to require vta to bargain with a group of supervisory and managerial employees that transferred to vta in.
we conclude that section,the more recent and more specific of the code sections,granted collective bargaining rights to the entire subset of employees involved in the reorganization regardless of their position in the employment hierarchy.
ii.the statutory context 
analysis of the problem before us requires reference to three separate labor relations schemes.first,there is vta scheme.in,the legislature passed the santa clara county transit district act et the act,which created the transit district now known as vta.see.the act is one of a number of different acts governing transit districts around the state.see,et costa transit district et san francisco bay area rapid transit district et los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority et orange county transit district et santa cruz metropolitan transit district.each of the transit acts contains its own labor relations provisions.
section is the act grant of collective bargaining rights employees shall have the right to,to form,join or assist labor organizations,to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing,and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.section provides whenever a majority of the employees employed by the district in a unit appropriate for collective bargaining indicate a desire to be represented by a labor organization and upon determining,as provided in section,that said labor organization represents at least a majority of the employees in the appropriate unit,the board and the accredited representative of employees shall bargain in good faith and make all reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the terms of a written contract governing wages,hours and working conditions.subsequent sections provide for mediation and arbitration and referral to the state conciliation service for resolution of contract disputes.
questions of representation are resolved by reference to the lmra.specifically,section provides any question which may arise with respect to whether a majority of employees in an appropriate unit desire to be represented by a labor organization shall be submitted to the director of the department of industrial relations dir.in resolving such questions of representation including the determination of the appropriate unit or units,petitions,the conduct of hearings and elections,the dir shall apply the relevant federal law and administrative practice developed under the lmra et and for this purpose shall adopt appropriate rules and regulations.italics added.the act does not define the term employee.
the lmra is the comprehensive federal labor law,which,by its terms,is applicable only to labor relations in the private sector.the lmra defines employee as any employee except,among other things,any individual employed as a supervisor and any individual employed by someone not defined as an employer.the lmra further provides that no employer subject to this subchapter shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law,either national or local,relating to collective bargaining.a.managers are also excluded from the rights granted under the lmra.nlrb bell aerospace,d.vta is not an employer under the terms of the lmra because public entities are not employers within the meaning of the federal law.application of the lmra in this case comes about solely as a result of the directive in section.
the third set of labor relations laws pertinent to our analysis is the act,et mmba,which is a state law that defines the collective bargaining rights of public employees.the mmba definition of public employee includes supervisory and management employees.organization of deputy sheriffs county of san mateo d.santa clara county counsel woodside cal th,d,subd.d.although the mmba applies generally to local public entities,the act expressly provides that the mmba does not apply to vta,subd.a.
iii.background 
history of vta 
vta was formed to take over the operation of public transportation functions that had historically been provided by private companies.when it was first created,vta was primarily an operating entity.its employees were bus drivers,dispatchers,mechanics,and maintenance personnel.support services such as management,administration,and clerical services were provided by employees of the county of santa clara or by the santa clara county congestion management agency collectively,county employees.
in,the legislature amended the public utilities code,consolidating all transit functions under the vta umbrella,which meant that the county employees who had been providing services to vta would become employees of vta instead.as part of the reorganization,the legislature passed sections and,which preserved benefits and rights that the county employees had earned and enjoyed while employed by the county.among other things,section required vta to recognize those employee organizations which served as the recognized representatives of the former county employees described in section immediately prior to their employment by vta and to observe all applicable provisions of existing labor contracts for the remainder of the term of each such contract.
the transfer of employees took place on january.at least two employee organizations represented the county employees at the time service employees international union local seiu and county employees management association cema.the group of employees represented by cema was identified as the bargaining unit.this unit included employees classified as supervisors or managers.
after the transfer was accomplished,the union that had been representing the original vta employees,the amalgamated transit union division atu,complained that the transferred employees should be part of the atu bargaining unit.vta filed petitions with the dir,seeking a declaration of its obligations to recognize and bargain with each of the three labor organizations and to resolve a dispute over which of the unions is entitled to be the exclusive bargaining representative of which vta employees.the consolidated petitions became case.
in the decision and award in case,the dir concluded that when the legislature passed the reorganizing legislation,it intended to maintain the status quo with respect to existing labor relationships so that the unions representing the county employees would continue to represent them.furthermore,the dir decided that even though section required vta to honor the existing labor agreements only until those agreements expired,it required vta to continue to recognize and bargain with the representatives of the employee organizations seiu and cema after expiration of the existing agreements.
the dir defined the bargaining unit as all classified and unclassified employees in the coded classifications,and the positions held by such employees,in the bargaining unit,who transferred to the district effective as of january,as a result of the statutory reorganization mandated by assembly bill and who,prior to the transfer,held positions covered by a labor agreement in effect between cema and the county of santa clara.
b.the present controversy 
after the transfer,vta recognized and bargained with cema as the representative of the unit and entered into labor agreements with it.the most recent agreement between vta and cema expired on june.in march,the american federation of state,county and municipal employees,local,afscme petitioned the dir to certify it as the representative of the bargaining unit.in april,and again in august,vta filed petitions requesting clarification of the existing bargaining unit.vta wanted to exclude all supervisors and managers,leaving only employees in the unit.according to vta,the unit included approximately managers,supervisors,and employees.vta petitions were based upon its contention that under the lmra,it could not be compelled to bargain collectively with supervisory or managerial personnel.a nlrb bell aerospace,supra,d.the dir dismissed both petitions without prejudice,citing national labor relations board nlrb regulations that precluded entertaining a clarification petition when a question of representation was pending.
the dir appointed a hearing officer and set a hearing to consider afscme petition for certification as the unit bargaining representative.the dir instructed the hearing officer to determine whether an election is to be held,and,if so,the appropriate unit or units within which such election shall be held and the categories of employees who shall be eligible to vote in such unit or units.
vta position at the hearing was the same as its position in the dismissed unit clarification petitions the hearing officer should exclude the supervisory and managerial employees from its determination of the appropriate unit because,under the lmra,vta was not required to bargain with supervisors or managers.vta also argued that it was an unfair labor practice to allow a unit containing employees to be dominated by supervisors and managers,and for that reason as well,the supervisors and managers should be excluded.there was no evidence that the job descriptions or responsibilities of the employees in the unit were any different than they were prior to the transfer.indeed,the parties stipulated that the unit described in afscme petition was the same unit that had been organized for collective bargaining purposes since at least,and was the same unit described by the dir in case.
the hearing officer issued a proposed decision and order in which she concluded that an election should be held and that the appropriate unit was the unit the dir defined in case.the dir adopted the proposed decision,specifying that section was the basis for concluding that the existing bargaining unit was the appropriate unit within which to hold the election.the election was held in march.the employees were offered the choice of cema,afscme,or no representation.the employees rejected cema and elected afscme as their exclusive bargaining representative.
vta filed a petition for writ review,seeking,in substance,reversal of the dir decision ordering an election to be held within the existing bargaining unit.vta petition named the dir as respondent and cema and afscme as real parties in interest the superior court granted the petition.the court concluded that the dir acted in excess of its jurisdiction by failing to apply relevant federal law,including the express statutory declaration in and exempting supervisors from bargaining rights under the lmra,and by making findings unsupported by substantial evidence in determining afscme certification petition and the matters at issue.the court reasoned that although sections and require vta to grant recognition to the representative of the transferring employees,nothing in those sections expressly refers to supervisors or managers,and nothing in the legislation presupposes that any transferring unit of employees is an appropriate unit for unit determinations.the judgment directed the clerk to issue a peremptory writ of administrative mandate instructing the dir to set aside its final order and reconsider its action in light of the court decision.the dir and afscme appeal from the judgment.
iv.discussion 
collateral estoppel 
before proceeding to the substantive issue,we first dispose of appellants contention that vta is estopped from challenging the composition of the bargaining unit because the dir had defined the unit five years earlier,in case.
collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings only if,among other things,the issue sought to be precluded from relitigation is identical to that decided in a former proceeding.pacific lumber state water resources control bd.cal th,d.the party asserting the doctrine has the burden to prove that the doctrine applies.ibid.
in the present case,there is no record of the former proceeding other than the final and interim decisions.it is true that one of the interim decisions notes that there remained to be decided the question of whether positions held by true managers and supervisors,who are exempt under lmra standards,can be declared to be within a statutorily recognized bargaining unit.although one might surmise that the issue was decided affirmatively because the dir ultimately identified the existing unit as appropriate,given the incompleteness of the record we can not tell to what extent the issue was actually litigated.accordingly,appellants have not carried their burden and we can not apply collateral estoppel in this case.
b.the arguments of the parties 
turning now to the substance of the appeal,we first describe the various arguments advanced by the parties.
afscme argues that the act as a whole extends collective bargaining rights to supervisors.afscme points out that under the lmra,the term employee expressly excludes supervisors but the act does not contain the same definition.in fact,there is no definition of employee in the act.afscme maintains that since the act does not specify otherwise,it must be read to extend and collective bargaining rights to all vta employees,supervisory as well as rank and file.thus,although section requires the dir to apply relevant federal law to questions of representation,the portion of the lmra excluding supervisory employees is not relevant to questions of representation in this or any other case involving vta.
the dir contends that the lmra is not relevant to the narrower question of whether vta must bargain collectively with supervisors and managers in the bargaining unit previously represented by cema.according to the dir,we need not consider whether the act extends bargaining rights to supervisors generally,since section by itself controls resolution of the issue.
vta position,which the trial court adopted,is that since the act requires the dir to apply the lmra to questions of representation,and since the lmra expressly exempts supervisors from the rights granted under that act,vta may never be compelled to bargain with a unit containing supervisory or management employees 
c.the issue 
the parties arguments boil down to a single substantive issue under the undisputed facts of this case,does section require vta to recognize and bargain with the representative of the unit even though that unit includes employees classified as supervisors and managers 
because we conclude that section requires vta to bargain with the existing unit,we need not reach the broader issue of whether,as a general matter,section extends collective bargaining rights to supervisory and managerial personnel.
standard of review 
the operative pleading is vta first amended for writ of certiorari or,alternatively,for writ of mandamus,or,alternatively,for writ of administrative mandamus.the superior court treated the petition as one for administrative mandamus.the parties do not challenge this decision and we find it to be appropriate.
judicial review of most public agency decisions is obtained by a proceeding for a writ of ordinary or administrative mandate.code civ.the applicable type of mandate is determined by the nature of the administrative action or decision.citation.usually,acts are reviewed by ordinary mandate and acts are reviewed by administrative mandate.mcgill regents of university of california th,d.there are subtle differences between the scope of judicial review applied to ordinary mandamus and that used for administrative mandamus.bunnett regents of university of california th,d.regardless of the writ involved,however,where the facts are undisputed,the reviewing court faces a question of law.on questions of law arising in mandate proceedings,we exercise independent judgment.ibid.in those circumstances,the trial and appellate courts perform the same function.shapell industries,governing board th,d.accordingly,to decide the meaning of sections and,we apply our independent review without reference to the trial court actions.mcgill regents of university of california,supra,th at,d.
in exercising our independent judgment,we rely upon settled rules of statutory construction.statutes are to be interpreted in accordance with their apparent purpose kaiser foundation health plan,lifeguard,th,d.first and foremost,we look for that purpose in the actual language of the statute.mercer department of motor vehicles cal d.if the meaning is without ambiguity,doubt,or uncertainty,then the language controls.security pacific national bank wozab cal d.if the meaning of the words is not clear,we may refer to various extrinsic aids,including the history of the statute,to determine the intent of the legislature.kaiser foundation health plan,lifeguard,supra,th at,d.finally,if neither the words of the statute nor its legislative history reveal s a clear meaning,we apply reason and practicality,and interpret the statute in accord with common sense and justice,and to avoid an absurd result.halbert lumber,lucky stores,th,d.in re marriage of campbell th,d.
although our review is independent,we do not necessarily disregard the dir interpretation of the law.where the meaning and legal effect of a statute is the issue,an agency interpretation is one among several tools available to the court.depending on the context,it may be helpful,enlightening,even convincing.it may sometimes be of little worth.see traverso people ex rel.of transportation th,d.considered alone and apart from the context and circumstances that produce them,agency interpretations are not binding or necessarily even authoritative.to quote the statement of the law revision commission in a recent report,the standard for judicial review of agency interpretation of law is the independent judgment of the court,giving deference to the determination of the agency appropriate to the circumstances of the agency action.judicial review of agency action cal.law revision com,italics added.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.it follows that if application of the settled rules of statutory interpretation does not clearly reveal the legislature intent,the dir interpretation of the statutes in the context of this case may be helpful.
sections and 
sections and were part of the reorganizing legislation stats,ch.section describes the employees who would be transferring to vta and vta obligations pertaining to accrued benefits county employees and employees of the santa clara county congestion management agency who,on a date or dates determined by the board of directors,terminate their employment and immediately thereafter become employees of vta,shall transfer to vta,and vta shall assume liability for,all of their accrued and unused vacation,sick leave,personal leave,compensating time off and sto balances and days of accrued service in accordance with the records of their former employer in lieu of any payment by the former employer for those balances.those employees who were covered by a county or congestion management agency pension plan shall be entitled to the same or equivalent rights,options,privileges,benefits,obligations,accrued service,and status under the pension plan of vta.
section consists of the following two paragraphs 
to the extent permitted by law,and until altered or revoked as provided by law,vta shall grant recognition to those employee organizations which served as the recognized representatives of the former county employees described in section immediately prior to their employment by vta.
vta shall assume and observe all applicable provisions,including wages,of existing written memoranda of understanding in effect between the county and the above recognized labor organizations for those former county employees described in section who are employed by vta in positions which would have been covered by those memoranda if the employees had remained employed by the county.this obligation extends only for the remainder of the term of the respective existing written memoranda of understanding and to the extent not superseded by a successor agreement between vta and a recognized labor organization.
the first paragraph of section required vta to grant recognition to any employee organization that,immediately prior to the transfer,was the recognized representative of the county employees.as the superior court noted,section says nothing about the composition of the bargaining units that selected these representatives.that omission does not convince us that the legislature intended to exclude supervisory and managerial employees from any such unit.to the contrary,in our view,the legislature intended that vta accord collective bargaining rights to all the transferring county employees to the extent the employees enjoyed such rights in their prior employment.our conclusion is based upon the settled principles of statutory interpretation.
the plain language of section requires vta to grant recognition to the representatives of the employees described in section.the employees described in section are the county employees transferring to vta as part of the reorganization.section requires vta to assume liability for all benefits those employees earned in their prior employment,thereby relieving the county of any obligation to cash out those benefits when the employees were terminated.the provision quite plainly applies to all the transferring employees regardless of their job description.it follows that the reference in section to the employees described in section is to all the transferring employees.
the historical context of the legislation confirms that the legislature did not intend to exclude supervisory employees from the scope of section.the legislature would have been aware that county employees transferring to vta in had collective bargaining rights under the mmba during their employment with the county.see people mcguire th,d we assume legislature was aware of existing law at the time it enacted the statute.since the mmba accords collective bargaining rights to supervisors and managers,the legislature must have anticipated that there would be organizations of supervisory or managerial employees among those transferring to vta.yet the legislature required vta to recognize the employees existing bargaining representatives without expressly limiting the requirement to any particular employment categories.
the unqualified requirement of section may be contrasted with section,which pertains to the employees of transit facilities acquired by vta.section,which was part of the original enabling legislation stats,ch,provides that whenever vta acquires existing facilities,the employees of the existing facility shall be appointed to positions with vta and shall retain all benefits they had with their former employer and that vta shall assume and observe all existing labor contracts.the section expressly states,however,that these rights apply only to those officers or supervisory employees of the acquired utility as shall be designated by the vta board.had the legislature intended to limit the rights granted under section to employees,it could have expressed that intent as it did in section.see california fed.savings loan city of los angeles cal th,d,legislature knows how to create an exception when it wishes to do so.
the legislative history of section further supports the conclusion that the legislature intended to provide for continuity
