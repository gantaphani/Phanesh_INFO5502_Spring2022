this case concerns the scope of the public utilities commission jurisdiction over light rail transit systems operated by a transit district.the santa clara valley transportation authority vta,a regional transit district,timely sought a writ of review of two decisions of the public utilities commission puc in which the puc concluded that it had independent authority to review the transit district light rail crossings,pursuant to public utilities code section,which concerns the safety of public transit guideways,and pursuant to public utilities code sections and,which are more broadly worded grants of power to the puc over railroad crossings in general the transit district agreed that the puc has safety oversight jurisdiction over light rail transit systems,including crossings,under section,but the transit district asserted that the puc exclusive jurisdiction over railroad crossings under sections and did not apply to the transit district.we issued a writ of review to decide the limited issue of whether the exclusive railroad crossing jurisdiction conferred on the puc by the legislature pursuant to sections and also applies to the vta light rail transit crossings.we conclude that sections and do not apply to the transit district,and we therefore annul the puc decisions to the extent the puc asserted jurisdiction over the transit district light rail crossings pursuant to these sections.
factual and procedural background 
the santa clara county transit district,now known as vta,is a transit district formed pursuant to the santa clara county transit district act in.et the vta is one of several public transportation operators that currently operate light rail transit systems in california.
in january,the vta filed an application with the puc for authorization to construct an crossing of hamilton avenue by the light rail transit line of its vasona light rail project in the city of campbell.puc application.the puc rail staff protested the application based on safety concerns regarding an crossing and asserted that a crossing was the only safe method of crossing after further study,the vta decided to construct an aerial crossing of the road and filed a petition to withdraw the application.in its petition to withdraw the application,the vta took the position that the puc authorization to construct the hamilton avenue crossing was not required since the vta had decided to cross hamilton avenue by an aerial grade separation and had abandoned its earlier plan to cross at grade.the puc decision denying the vta petition to withdraw the application and the related puc decision denying rehearing are the subject of this court review.
in its decision,the puc found that it had jurisdiction to approve the construction and placement of the vta light rail crossings.puc,wl,hereafter decision.the puc also discussed the scope of its jurisdiction to review and approve crossings.as noted in the decision,the vta admitted that it was subject to puc jurisdiction under sections,and.decision,at.the puc found that it had broad safety authority under section and that this safety jurisdiction extended over transit system guideways,including inspection and approval of crossings the puc also found that its exclusive rail crossing jurisdiction,conferred by section,applied to street railroads operated by transit districts,including the vta.as stated in the decision,since a plain reading of makes it clear that the commission has exclusive jurisdiction over street crossings by street railroads like those operated by vta,the commission is required to review and approve the proposed hamilton avenue crossing before that crossing can be constructed.that jurisdictional imperative,both as to and,derives from the constitution and has been broadly interpreted to apply in the case of public agencies.we conclude that vta is subject to the rail crossing authority of this commission.decision,at.
the vta filed an application for rehearing of the decision,claiming that those portions of the decision that asserted jurisdiction over the vta regarding the placement and construction of its light rail transit street crossings under sections and were in excess of the puc jurisdiction.in may,the puc denied the application for rehearing.puc,wl may,hereafter rehearing decision.in its rehearing decision,the puc emphasized that it had adequate authority to review the vta crossings pursuant to either section,concerning the safety of public transit guideways,or pursuant to sections and,concerning railroad crossings.the puc concluded that its authority pursuant to either statutory scheme was sufficient to support its conclusion that it had the authority to require the vta to file an application for approval prior to the construction of the vta light rail crossings.the puc also found that it independently had authority over the vta light rail crossings pursuant to sections and.
the vta filed a petition for writ of review,challenging only the puc assertion of exclusive jurisdiction under sections and.we issued a writ of review to resolve this limited jurisdictional issue.
ii.scope of review 
this court authority to issue a writ of review and the scope of such review is set forth in section et.section,subdivision a provides in relevant part within days after the commission issues its decision denying the application for a rehearing,any aggrieved party may petition for a writ of review in the court of appeal or the supreme court for the purpose of having the lawfulness of the original order or decision or of the order or decision on rehearing inquired into and determined.if the writ issues,it shall be made returnable at a time and place specified by court order and shall direct the commission to certify its record in the case to the court within the time specified.the scope of judicial review includes determining,inter alia,whether the commission acted without,or in excess of,its powers or jurisdiction,whether the commission has not proceeded in the manner required by law,or whether the order or decision was an abuse of discretion,subd.a.
here,petitioner vta timely filed a petition for a writ of review after denial of rehearing,challenging the scope of the puc assertion of exclusive jurisdiction below.as set forth in the puc decision and rehearing decision,the puc repeatedly asserted that it independently has authority over light rail crossings pursuant to sections and,that it has exclusive rail crossing jurisdiction under section,and that the vta is subject to its section and section jurisdiction since it operates a street railroad.
since the puc has repeatedly asserted that it possesses jurisdiction over the vta under sections and,the instant matter is the proper subject of a writ of review by this court.there is a legitimate question whether the puc is acting outside the scope of its jurisdiction by asserting continuing jurisdiction under sections and,notwithstanding the fact that the puc admittedly has safety jurisdiction over light rail crossings under sections,and.
the puc maintains that the issue in this case is whether it has the authority to require the vta to file an application and obtain the puc approval prior to constructing its light rail crossings.the puc asserts that two separate legislative grants provide it with authority to review the placement and construction of light rail transit crossings and that either statutory scheme,section safety jurisdiction and section exclusive railroad crossing jurisdiction,provide it with independent sources of authority to review the vta crossings.
we wish to emphasize that the issue we decide is limited to the question of whether the exclusive railroad crossing jurisdiction conferred on the puc by the legislature pursuant to sections and also applies to the vta light rail transit crossings.we do not reach the separate issue of whether the puc has the authority to require the vta to file an application and obtain the puc approval of its light rail transit crossings pursuant to the puc section safety jurisdiction and the existing general order application requirement since the vta has conceded this issue and did not contest this aspect of the decision in its rehearing application see.here,the puc maintains that sections and provide it with an independent statutory source of jurisdiction over the vta light rail transit crossings.hence,we address only the issue of the puc assertion of jurisdiction under sections and.
iii.discussion 
prior to oral argument,we requested that the parties be prepared to discuss whether the case should be considered moot in light of the fact that the puc subsequently approved the vta application for an aerial crossing of hamilton avenue,which was filed after the puc decision in this case.at oral argument,both the puc and vta acknowledged that a continuing jurisdictional dispute remained and noted the importance of having this court decide this issue.
after further consideration,we find that the matter is not moot and that this controversy is ripe for our review.the vta subsequent application for an aerial crossing was made pursuant to sections and and general orders and,and it expressly reserved the legal jurisdictional issues in the puc decision for later determination by the puc or the courts.puc application.the subsequent application notwithstanding,the puc issued its final rehearing decision in this case,reaching the section and section jurisdictional dispute,continuing to assert such jurisdiction,and triggering the vta right to petition this court for review.in light of the puc continuing assertion of section and section jurisdiction over the hamilton avenue crossing,we find that a material controversy remains for our determination and that the matter is not moot.see eye dog foundation state board of guide dogs for the blind cal d.
furthermore,even if we were to find the matter technically moot as to the hamilton avenue crossing,we would exercise our discretion to resolve this jurisdictional dispute since it is a matter of continuing public importance and the issue is likely to recur with respect to future light rail transit crossings constructed by the vta and other public entities that operate light rail transit systems throughout the state.see morehart county of santa barbara cal th,d.

the vta,like all transit districts in the state,is a public district organized pursuant to state law and designated as a transit district in its enabling legislation.see.pursuant to its enabling legislation,the legislature has granted the vta a broad range of powers in order to meet the public transit and transportation problems of santa clara county.the vta is statutorily authorized to exercise any and all powers granted by any other law that,by its terms,is applicable to transit districts generally,to public agencies generally,or to any classification of districts or public agencies that includes a district of the type provided for in this part,but the district shall not exercise any power contrary to an express provision of this part.the vta enabling legislation also grants the vta broad authority over the design,location,and construction of its light rail transit system.see,subd.a.
here,the fundamental issue concerns the scope of the puc jurisdiction under sections and,which generally grant the puc exclusive jurisdiction over railroad and street railroad crossings.the california constitution authorizes the legislature to grant jurisdiction to the puc,and the legislature has conferred section and section jurisdiction on the puc however,the legislature also enacted the vta enabling legislation and granted the vta extensive powers as a transit district.since the vta is in essence a creature of statute and given the statutory basis of the disputed jurisdiction,resolution of this case turns on the issue of statutory interpretation and legislative intent.the important question in this case is whether the legislature intended for sections and to apply to the transit district.we believe that the resolution of this issue requires an understanding of the context in which the legislature created the section and jurisdiction,the vta,and related statutes.
the relevant provisions of sections and and the associated declaration of legislative intent found in section predate the creation of the vta.the puc exclusive railroad crossing jurisdiction pursuant to section actually predates the creation of transit districts and was included in the original act creating the public utilities code in.stats,ch.in fact,the historical origin of the puc section exclusive railroad crossing jurisdiction can be traced back much further.see,stats,ch,predecessor of,subds.a c stats,ch,a,predecessor of stats,ch,predecessor of.

when the legislature passed the vta enabling legislation,it included an express provision subjecting the vta to puc regulation relating to safety appliances and procedures.however,the vta enabling legislation did not and does not contain any provision similar to section that would expressly provide the puc with exclusive jurisdiction over the vta light rail crossings.

with this background in mind,we now turn to the question of whether the puc section and jurisdiction applies to the vta.
standard of review 
initially,the puc asserts that its interpretation of sections and as applying to light rail transit crossings is entitled to great deference.the vta argues that the interpretation of the statutes is the subject of independent judicial review.
an agency interpretation of the meaning and legal effect of a statute is entitled to consideration and respect by the courts however,unlike regulations adopted by an agency to which the legislature has confided the power to make law,and which,if authorized by the enabling legislation,bind this and other courts as firmly as statutes themselves,the binding power of an agency interpretation of a statute or regulation is contextual its power to persuade is both circumstantial and dependent on the presence or absence of factors that support the merit of the interpretation courts must,in short,independently judge the text of the statute,taking into account and respecting the agency interpretation of its meaning,of course,whether embodied in a formal rule or less formal representation.where the meaning and legal effect of a statute is the issue,an agency interpretation is one among several tools available to the court.depending on the context,it may be helpful,enlightening,even convincing.it may sometimes be of little worth.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,original italics see also southern cal.edison public utilities com.th,d.
this case turns on statutory interpretation and issues of legislative intent underlying sections and as well as the vta enabling legislation and related statutes applicable to public light rail transit systems.therefore,our review is independent review.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.
a fundamental rule of statutory construction is that a court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.in construing a statute,our first task is to look to the language of the statute itself.citation.when the language is clear and there is no uncertainty as to the legislative intent,we look no further and simply enforce the statute according to its terms.citations.additionally,however,we must consider the statutory language in the context of the entire statute citation and the statutory scheme of which it is a part.we are required to give effect to statutes according to the usual,ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.citations.citations.if possible,significance should be given to every word,phrase,sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.citation.when used in a statute words must be construed in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.citations.moreover,the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.citations.renee superior court cal th,d,quoting phelps stostad cal th,d.

jurisdictional analysis 
looking first at the statutory language,we note that section speaks in terms of requiring the puc permission to construct roads or tracks across the tracks of any railroad or street railroad corporation and that section gives the puc exclusive jurisdiction over the crossings of a railroad or street railroad.in section,the legislature has expressly declared that sections to were enacted as aids to the jurisdiction vested in the commission for the supervision,regulation,and control of railroad and street railroad corporations.
the public utilities code contains general definitions for these terms.a street railroad corporation is generally defined to include every corporation or person owning,controlling,operating,or managing any street railroad for compensation,and a street railroad is generally defined to include every railway being mainly upon any street a public utility is generally defined to include,inter alia,every common carrier,and common carrier is generally defined to include every person and corporation providing transportation for compensation,including every street railroad corporation,subd.a.a corporation is generally defined to include a corporation,a company,an association,and a joint stock association.
in contrast to these general definitions,the definitions contained within the vta enabling legislation govern its construction unless the context otherwise requires.the vta enabling legislation defines person to include any individual or corporation but does not include a public agency,as defined in this chapter.a public agency is defined in the enabling legislation to include,inter alia,any district or public entity of,or organized under the laws of,this state.while the vta arguably could be considered to be operating a street railroad,it is a public agency,not a person and arguably not a corporation.while we recognize that the vta conceivably could be characterized as a type of public corporation see turlock irrigation dist.hetrick th,d,it is not designated as such in its enabling legislation,and,regardless,it does not necessarily follow that the vta should be considered a street railroad corporation,which appears to be the target of section and section jurisdiction.
construing this statutory language within the context of the statutory schemes,we believe that it is unclear from the statutory language alone whether the legislature intended section and section to apply to a public transit district such as the vta.under the circumstances,we find the language of sections,and ambiguous as to whether the puc section and section rail crossing jurisdiction applies to the light rail crossings of a public transit district.therefore,it is necessary to turn to legislative history and other interpretive aids to resolve the issue of legislative intent.
as noted above,the legislature granted the puc exclusive railroad crossing jurisdiction under sections and long before it passed the enabling legislation for the vta.significantly,in the meantime,the puc jurisdiction over public transit was the subject of two california supreme court decisions,los angeles met.transit authority public utilities com.cal d,hereafter mta i,and los angeles met.transit authority public util.com.cal d,hereafter mta ii.these decisions are significant because they reveal the legislature historical treatment of public transit agencies and its view of the puc jurisdiction over such public agencies,as interpreted by the california supreme court.see county of inyo public utilities,supra,cal d.
in mta i,the los angeles metropolitan transit authority authority sought to annul a puc order granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to charter bus transportation company,which operated a privately owned transportation system.charter bus transportation company operated seasonal passenger stage services to several racetracks located in the vicinity of los angeles and sought to expand and operate a bus service to the home games of the los angeles dodgers baseball club.the authority contended that its enabling legislation precluded the puc from authorizing new passenger stage operations in los angeles county.after analyzing the authority enabling legislation,the supreme court concluded that the puc had the power to authorize privately operated public transit,and it affirmed the puc order.
as discussed in mta i,the original los angeles metropolitan transit authority act was enacted in stats,ch,and expressly placed the authority under the regulatory control of the puc.when the legislature originally placed the authority under the control of the puc,it expressly declared that it was making an exception to a long established policy.stats,ch,see mta i,supra,cal d at,fn,quoting legislative declaration.however,the act proved inadequate,and the legislature passed the los angeles metropolitan transit authority act of stats,ch,which greatly increased the powers of the authority.mta i,supra,cal d at.the act gave the authority some of the foregoing powers,but expressly provided that it could exercise its powers only under the regulatory control of the public utilities commission.the authority routes and rates,and contracts were also subject to control by the public utilities commission.under the act the commission has no control over the authority with respect to any of these matters.in the absence of legislation otherwise providing,the commission jurisdiction to regulate public utilities extends only to the regulation of privately owned utilities.id.at,fns.omitted.
four years later,in mta ii,the authority challenged the validity of a puc order requiring it to comply with safety rules and regulations contained in puc general order.the order challenged by the authority was entered by the puc pursuant to the mandate of a amendment to the act.the authority contended that the california constitution allowed the legislature to grant the puc regulatory jurisdiction over private transportation utilities only and prohibited the puc from exercising jurisdiction over public transportation companies such as the authority.mta ii,supra,cal d at.the supreme court concluded that the legislature could constitutionally grant the puc regulatory jurisdiction over the authority safety practices.id.at.
as discussed in mta ii,the los angeles metropolitan transit authority act of expressly required the authority to adopt and comply with safety regulations prescribed by the public utilities commission applicable to comparable street railway and bus systems stats,ch,and pursuant to a amendment,the authority was expressly made subject to the puc jurisdiction with respect to safety rules and other regulations governing the operation of passenger stage corporations and street railroad corporations as contained in general order stats,ch,mta ii,supra,cal d at.as observed in mta ii,many public transportation authorities are presently being established to solve the transportation problems of metropolitan regions.it would appear that the legislature has determined that the safety of operators and passengers of the petitioning metropolitan public authority can best be assured if limited regulatory jurisdiction over safety practices is conferred upon respondent commission.mta ii,supra,at.
the puc relies on the supreme court decision in mta ii,supra,cal d,in support of its position that public agencies can be street railroad corporations subject to its section jurisdiction.the puc asserts that the fact that the vta is publicly owned does not prevent it from being a street railroad corporation or common carrier subject to the puc regulation.
a close reading of mta ii reveals that the critical issue decided in that case was whether the california constitution prohibited the legislature from granting the puc jurisdiction over the transit authority.see mta ii,supra,cal d at.the statute at issue in mta ii expressly and specifically conferred such regulatory power over the safety aspects of the transit authority operations,and the supreme court concluded that the legislature lawfully granted the puc regulatory jurisdiction over the transit authority safety practices.id.at.
in reaching its decision,the supreme court found that the california constitution did not restrict the legislature from conferring puc jurisdiction over a common carrier,however it is organized.the fact that the transportation authority was a publicly owned,as opposed to a privately owned common carrier,did not take it out of the general category of common carrier.mta ii,supra,cal d at.in fact,the legislature has conferred regulatory jurisdiction over publicly owned common carriers by enactment of sections,and.
however,even assuming that the legislature could extend the puc section exclusive railroad crossing jurisdiction to cover the light rail transit crossings of the vta or any other transit district in the state,this does not mean that the legislature has done so or ever intended to do so.hence,the puc reliance on mta ii is misplaced.rather,we read mta ii as actually supporting the vta position since the case affirmatively demonstrates that when the legislature has intended to confer puc jurisdiction over a publicly owned common carrier,it has specifically and expressly done so.
against this backdrop,the legislature passed the vta enabling legislation in,expressly conferring puc jurisdiction over the vta safety appliances and procedures pursuant to section.the legislature then followed up by passing statutes expressly vesting additional safety related jurisdiction in the puc,including the addition of section in,the addition of section in,and the related amendment of section in,all of which admittedly apply to the vta.
the legislature historic treatment of this subject area demonstrates that the legislature has taken great care in crafting the enabling legislation for transit districts.in the case of the vta,the legislature has included express provisions vesting puc jurisdiction over certain aspects of the vta operations.here,in the absence of an express provision,we will not infer a legislative intent to confer puc jurisdiction over a transit district.see orange county air pollution control dist.public util,supra,cal d.rather,puc jurisdiction over a transit district must be clearly provided by statute.if the legislature had wanted sections and to apply to transit districts,it could simply have said so.t he judicial role in a democratic society is fundamentally to interpret laws,not to write them.california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d.when the legislature has intended to grant the puc jurisdiction over transit districts or public light rail transit systems,it has passed express legislation doing so.viewed in such context,we can not discern any legislative intent,express or implied,to impose the puc section and section exclusive railroad crossing jurisdiction on the vta.we do,however,respectfully invite the legislature to amend the statutory scheme if it determines that the issue requires clarification.
finally,we believe that our interpretation is consistent with the legislature ongoing attempts to address the changing transportation needs of various areas of the state.see,legislative findings and declarations expressing changing transportation problems and the need to vest additional authority in the vta to solve t
