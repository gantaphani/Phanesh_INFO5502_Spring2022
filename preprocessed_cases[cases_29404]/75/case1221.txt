during the regular session of the legislature,both the assembly and the senate passed assembly bill ab to allow aliens who do not have a social security number to obtain a california driver license or a california identification card if they have petitioned,or are the beneficiaries of a petition,for lawful immigration status or an extension of legal presence in the united states.ab was sent to enrollment on september,and,plaintiff alleges,the bill went to the governor on october.soon thereafter,the chief clerk of the assembly retrieved ab from the governor office and returned it to the legislature,where it was withdrawn from enrollment and placed in the legislature inactive file on motion of the bill author.the following year,the legislature returned ab to enrollment and sent it to the governor,after which he vetoed the legislation.
prior to the governor veto,plaintiff mary grace de asis,whose application for a california identification card was denied because she did not have a social security number,filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief,alleging that ab became law by virtue of the governor failure to approve or veto the bill in a timely manner after it was sent to him on october.cal,art.iv,subd.b.thus,she sought to compel the department of motor vehicles and its director dmv to implement ab 
finding that the chief clerk of the assembly retrieved ab shortly after it was enrolled on september,thereby cut ting short the presentation period provide d to the governor for considering legislation,the trial court concluded that ab did not become law as plaintiff claimed.hence,the court sustained dmv demurrer without leave to amend and entered a judgment of dismissal.
for reasons that follow,we reject plaintiff claims on appeal.as we will explain,when the legislature and the governor acquiesce in the retrieval of a bill after enrollment but before expiration of the time period allotted to the governor to deliberate on the bill,courts will not interfere with that decision.and since such retrieval deprives the governor of the full period in which to deliberate on the bill,it can not become law without the governor signature because the bill has not been presented to the governor within the meaning of article iv,section,of california constitution.
accordingly,the trial court correctly concluded that ab did not become law,and we shall affirm the judgment of dismissal.
background 
when ab was introduced,the law required an application for a california driver license or california identification card to include the social security number of the applicant.accordingly,a person who did not have a social security number could not obtain a california driver license or california identification card 
ab would have enabled some persons who can not obtain a social security number to obtain a california driver license or california identification card by using an alternative form of identifier 
the complete bill history prepared by the assembly reflects that ab was approved by the assembly and sent to the senate on june.ab was approved by the senate with amendments on september,and that same date the bill was sent for enrollment after the assembly concurred in the senate amendments.the complete bill history does not reflect that ab was actually presented to the governor.rather,the next entry on january,shows that the bill was withdrawn from enrollment and placed in the inactive file upon motion of its author.
on august,the legislature withdrew ab from the inactive file and returned the bill to enrollment.some time thereafter,ab was presented to the governor,who vetoed the bill on september.
in her complaint,plaintiff alleges that on september,after both houses had approved ab,the legislature adjourned for a joint recess to reconvene in.she further alleges,on information and belief,the following on or about october,ab was enrolled and sent to the governor the chief clerk of the assembly then retrieved the bill from the governor desk and returned it to the legislature and the asserted reason for retrieving ab was not based upon any clerical error,but because the bill was mistakenly sent to the governor.
the complaint alleges that the retrieval of ab from the governor was ineffectual because the chief clerk of the assembly lacked the authority to do so.it follows,the complaint claims,that when the governor failed to act upon the bill in the time period allotted by the constitution,it automatically became law.cal,art.iv,subd.b.
discussion 
article iv,section,subdivision a,of california constitution provides each bill passed by the legislature shall be presented to the governor.it becomes a statute if it is signed by the governor.the governor may veto it by returning it with any objections to the house of origin,which shall enter the objections in the journal and proceed to reconsider it.if each house then passes the bill by rollcall vote entered in the journal,two thirds of the membership concurring,it becomes a statute.
article iv,section,subdivision b,of california constitution provides any bill,other than a bill which would establish or change boundaries of any legislative,congressional,or other election district,passed by the legislature on or before the date the legislature adjourns for a joint recess to reconvene in the second calendar year of the biennium of the legislative session,and in the possession of the governor after that date,that is not returned within days after that date becomes a statute.
as we have noted,plaintiff claims that ab was sent to the governor on or about october,that the chief clerk of the assembly had no authority thereafter to retrieve the bill,and that when the governor neither signed nor vetoed ab within days of october,the measure automatically became law.
dmv notes there is nothing in the record to establish that ab had ever been presented to the governor before it was withdrawn from enrollment.nevertheless,dmv goes on to address the merits of plaintiff claim,assuming that ab in fact went to the governor prior to its retrieval by the chief clerk of the assembly.so shall we.for purposes of demurrer,we will accept plaintiff factual allegations as true.the issue presented is whether those factual allegations,if true,establish a cause of action upon which relief may be granted.
we begin our analysis by noting that the governor acquiesced in the retrieval of ab.therefore,we are not concerned with whether the legislature can compel the governor to allow retrieval of a bill that has been sent to him and,if so,the circumstances in which,or the formalities by which,the legislature could do so.the legislature also acquiesced in the retrieval of the bill.thus,both parties to the lawmaking function acquiesced in the retrieval of the bill,neither of them asserts that retrieval was ineffective or that presentation to the governor was complete,and neither of them maintains that ab became law by the passage of time.
in this case,we are confronted with a private person claim that,regardless of the views of the governor and the legislature,ab became law without the governor approval.we can not agree.
plaintiff claim for relief is premised upon her argument that the retrieval of ab by the chief clerk of the assembly chief clerk was ineffectual because he had no authority to take the bill back once it was sent to the governor by the legislature.consequently,she contends,the constitutional deadline for the governor to act on the bill remained in effect.
plaintiff concedes that,in some instances,the chief clerk does have authority to retrieve a bill from the governor office.her argument is not that the chief clerk lacks all authority to retrieve a bill,but that his reason for doing so in this instance was insufficient.thus,plaintiff wants the court to determine,as a question of fact,whether the chief clerk action was within his authority.we decline the invitation.
the power of the state is vested,by the constitution,in the legislature and while the constitution has prescribed the formalities to be observed in the passage of bills and the creation of statutes,the power to determine whether these f
