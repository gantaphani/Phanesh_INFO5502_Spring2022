this case involves a fatal highway collision that occurred at an intersection where vandals had repeatedly removed stop signs.the issue is whether the texas tort claims act the act waives the state immunity for claims arising from the accident,which allegedly happened because unknown third parties removed the intersection stop signs.a jury determined that the texas department of transportation negligence proximately caused the accident,and the trial court rendered judgment on the verdict.the court of appeals affirmed,holding that a stop sign susceptibility to repeated and extraordinarily frequent vandalism can be a condition for purposes of section a liability.we disagree.
we conclude that section a does not apply in this case and thus does not waive the state immunity.we further conclude that section a of the act is the section that does apply.however,because there is no evidence that txdot had actual notice that someone removed the stop signs before the accident occurred,txdot immunity from suit is not waived in this case.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment that the plaintiffs take nothing.
background 
on sunday,february,maria alicia gonzalez was driving eastbound on fm in hidalgo county.at the intersection with fm,maria car collided with a northbound van driven by stanley brock.maria and three passengers died at the scene.a fourth passenger,as well as brock and his passenger,suffered minor injuries.
usually,the intersection has two stop signs facing fm,which require traffic on that road to yield the to traffic on fm.however,when the accident occurred,the stop signs were missing,because vandals had allegedly knocked them down or removed them.maria,who was unfamiliar with the intersection,did not stop,yield the,or slow down.
at least six times during the period before the accident,vandals had knocked down or removed the intersection stop signs.each time txdot received notice about the vandalized signs,it promptly reinstalled or replaced them.in response to the repeated vandalism,txdot ordered regular inspections at least twice a day on weekdays.txdot also asked the hidalgo county sheriff department to help monitor the intersection at night.however,txdot did not change the methods it used to reinstall or replace the signs,and it did not order its employees to perform overtime inspections during weekend hours.
txdot reinstalled at least one stop sign at the intersection on friday,february.an txdot employee,who drove through the intersection on saturday afternoon,testified that he observed both stop signs in place.however,at around on sunday morning,a motorist who testified at trial noticed that no stop signs stood at the fm intersection.but,because the motorist had never driven through the intersection before,she did not realize that the intersection should have had stop signs facing fm.consequently,she did not notify txdot about the signs absence.
the accident occurred around in the afternoon on sunday,february.soon after,txdot received notice that the stop signs were down.in response,txdot dispatched a maintenance crew to reinstall the signs.the crew completed its work within two hours.
several plaintiffs,individually and as representatives of the estates of the deceased gonzalez,sued txdot under the act.gonzalez alleged the repeated vandalism to the intersection stop signs constituted a condition under section a of the act txdot had notice of the condition but did not correct it within a reasonable time and txdot negligence proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries.txdot filed a plea to the jurisdiction,asserting that the act does not waive immunity for gonzalez claims.the trial court denied the plea,and the case went to trial.
the trial court instructed the jury to find txdot negligent if a premises condition posed an unreasonable risk of harm to maria txdot had actual knowledge of the danger maria did not have actual knowledge and txdot failed to use ordinary care to warn maria about the condition or to make the condition reasonably safe.over txdot objection,the jury charge also contained a spoliation instruction about txdot actual knowledge.
the jury found txdot negligent,and the trial court entered judgment for gonzalez.the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment.at.the court of appeals recognized that section a of the act discusses the state immunity when third parties vandalize signs.at.but it held that the state immunity was waived under section a,because the vandalism was so severe and pervasive it constitutes a condition of the sign,signal or traffic control device.at.under these circumstances,the court of appeals concluded,the state has a duty to respond to the vandalism frequency.at.the court of appeals also held that,under section a,a plaintiff need not show that the state had actual knowledge that the sign was down on the day of the accident.at.we granted txdot petition for review to determine whether repeated vandalism is a condition for which subsection a of the act waives immunity.
