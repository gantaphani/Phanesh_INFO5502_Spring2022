in this eminent domain action,defendant property owner lester hinz,appeals a judgment that rejected his challenges to the resolution of necessity adopted by the city of saratoga the city when it decided to condemn an easement over a portion of hinz property to improve a private road so that the road might be accepted into the city system of public streets.the road improvement project was undertaken and financed by the vessing road assessment district vrad,a special assessment district composed of property owners who own parcels that adjoin hinz property.
hinz contends the trial court erred when it found that his affirmative defense challenging the validity of the assessment district was barred by the limitations period in streets and highways code section.and if not,then he challenges the validity of the district,arguing that percent districts are not valid under proposition and that the assessment district is not valid because it confers no general benefit on the surrounding community.hinz also challenges the resolution of necessity on the grounds that the road improvement project is not a public use and that the city finding of public interest and necessity in the resolution of necessity was not supported by substantial evidence.we find no error and affirm the judgment.
early efforts to form vessing road assessment district 
this case arises out of efforts to improve vessing road in saratoga.vessing road is a private street.it is approximately feet long and to feet wide.it was paved in and has not been repaved since.vessing road connects two public streets,quito road and vessing court.quito road is a thoroughfare.vessing court is a landlocked.the only access to vessing court is off of vessing road.
in early,of the property owners who reside on vessing road and vessing court petitioned the city to assist them in improving vessing road to minimum city standards,so that vessing road could be dedicated to the city and accepted into the city system of publicly maintained streets.
hinz owns an parcel located at the corner of vessing road and quito road.hinz takes access to his property off of quito road and generally does not use vessing road for ingress and egress.in the spring of,hinz learned of the project to improve vessing road and told his neighbors that he did not approve of the project.
in and,the city and the homeowners in the vessing road area conducted a series of meetings regarding the possibility of forming a special assessment district to fund the proposed improvements to vessing road.hinz attended a number of these meetings and expressed his objections to the project.the project ultimately included improvements to the road and to the water system that serves vessing road and vessing court.the city representatives advised the homeowners that the city would not contribute financially to the cost of the proposed improvements and that the improvements would have to be funded percent by the members of the proposed assessment district.the city reasoned that although the project was a public project involving the construction of a road,the properties in the proposed assessment district were the only properties that benefited from the project and that the property owners therefore had to pay the entire cost of the improvement.the city helped the property owners retain legal counsel and a civil engineer to assist them in the formation of the assessment district.
larry perlin was the director of public works for the city when the property owners approached the city regarding the project to improve vessing road.he was subsequently promoted to city manager and retained responsibility for the project.in february,perlin circulated a petition to the vessing road property owners regarding the formation of an assessment district.at that time,the boundary map for the proposed assessment district included the hinz property.at the time,perlin thought it was appropriate to include hinz property in the proposed assessment district,since his property abutted vessing road and it appeared reasonable to include him in the district.
shortly thereafter,perlin changed his mind and circulated a second petition that excluded hinz property from the assessment district.hinz participation in the project was a topic of discussion from the beginning.according to perlin,the passage of proposition,which became effective on january,emphasized the need to define the special benefits that a particular property received from an assessment and provided that only those properties that received special benefits can be assessed for the costs of an improvement.after circulating the first petition,perlin became convinced that hinz did not belong in the assessment district because his property did not receive a special benefit from the proposed improvements since his access was off of quito road perlin was also concerned that hinz could attack the formation of the district on the ground that he did not receive a special benefit from the district.hinz does not believe the project will benefit his property 
hinz quiet title action 
several properties along vessing road were encumbered by reciprocal private easements dating back to,which provided that feet on either side of the property lines would be used for ingress and egress by pedestrians and vehicles.this created a wide area that was used as a private road.the road was paved in.the paved road ranges in width from to feet.most of the paved portion of the road that is adjacent to hinz property is located on property that belongs to the adjoining landowners,not hinz property.in may of,hinz filed a quiet title action against the city and the members of the vrad seeking to extinguish the wide easement on his property.
resolutions passed by the city regarding formation of assessment district 
on may,the city passed a series of resolutions in connection with the proposed vrad,including a resolution of intent for the vrad to reimburse the city for any money the city spent on the improvements,a resolution approving the boundary map for the vrad,resolutions approving agreements for legal and engineering consulting services,and a resolution of intent to order improvements,which appointed the engineer of the work and called for the preparation of the engineer report.that same day,hinz attorney advised the city that hinz would defend against any taking of his property related to the proposed improvements.
gene scothorn of civil consultants group was appointed engineer of the work.scothorn work on the project included determining the amount of the special benefit attributable to each of the parcels in the vrad and the dollar amount of each property owner assessment.in his final report,which was dated november,scothorn concluded that the street improvements conferred direct and special benefits on the members of the vrad and that there was no general benefit to the surrounding community or the public in general the proposed assessments ranged from to.
in,the trial court ruled against hinz and in favor of the city and hinz neighbors in the quiet title action.
on march,most of the property owners in the proposed assessment district attended a meeting at city hall to review the status of the proceedings and to decide whether to continue with the formation of the assessment district.at that time,the majority of the property owners supported formation of the district.in a report to the city council regarding that meeting,perlin stated that the property owners had been unsuccessful in developing an alternative to the assessment district for improving vessing road,that they remained eager to fulfill their original objective of improving vessing road to a standard that will allow them to dedicate the road to the city for ongoing maintenance purposes,and that a significant obstacle to forming the district had been overcome as a result of the judgment that was entered in the property owners favor in hinz quiet title action.
on april,hinz sent a letter to the city council,threatening to sue the city if the city council approved the formation of the assessment district.
shortly thereafter,the owners of of the properties in the proposed assessment district,who accounted for percent of the assessments,voted in favor of forming the district.at a public hearing on april,the city council passed two resolutions,one overruling prior protests to the project on the grounds that they did not constitute a majority protest resolution and one approving the engineer report,the assessments,and the formation of the district and ordering the improvement resolution.according to the latter resolution,construction of the improvements included the acquisition of all lands,easements and necessary to complete the project.hinz attended the april,city council meeting.he did not directly challenge the resolution approving the formation of the assessment district.
the city resolution to exercise eminent domain power over easement on hinz property 
in order to complete the project,the city decided to acquire a permanent easement for ingress and egress over the wide,long strip of land along the southernmost portion of hinz property.that part of hinz land was already encumbered by the express easement for ingress and egress for the existing private road.the city sought to acquire similar easements over two other properties that belonged to vrad members.
the city had the easements appraised.the city attorney advised the city council that t he easements will encumber no more land than the existing private vessing road.due to the fact that the private was established by recorded easements,the highest and best use of the can only be for ingress and egress.therefore,because the can never be developed or used for any purpose except vehicular and pedestrian access,the city appraiser placed a nominal value of on each easement 
on august,the city sent hinz a copy of the appraisal and a written offer to purchase the easement for.on august,the city sent hinz and the other property owners written notice that the city council would consider the adoption of a resolution of necessity to condemn the easements at its september,council meeting.
hinz attended the september,city council meeting,accompanied by his attorney.hinz attorney made a formal statement for the record,objecting to the adoption of a resolution of necessity authorizing eminent domain proceedings to acquire an easement over hinz property.hinz argued that the improvement of vessing road was a private matter that the city should not be involved in.he also argued that the vrad may be legally flawed as to its formation and implementation.he argued that if the district confers no general public benefit and no portion of the cost of the district is being paid by public funds,then the formation of the district could be a violation of proposition.he asserted that if there was no general benefit to the city arising from the district,then there was no public convenience or necessity that justified the taking of any property by eminent domain.hinz also argued that the offer of was unfair and that he should not be compelled to finance what should be paid for by other parties.he suggested the city pay him fair market value for a full fee interest in the property.he reminded the city council that he had sued the city to erase the private easement from his property and that,although he had lost that action in the trial court,the matter was up on appeal 
six members of the vrad,the city manager,the city attorney,and hinz attorney spoke at the public hearing.after hearing from the public and reviewing the executive summary and other documents submitted by the city manager,the city council voted four to one to adopt the resolution of necessity to proceed with the eminent domain action resolution.after the hearing,the owners of the other two properties who had objected to the proposed taking voluntarily conveyed their easements to the city,obviating the need for any condemnation action against those property owners.the only property owner that continued to object was hinz.hinz wants to keep his property the way it is to discourage trespassing and maintain his privacy.
the city eminent domain action against hinz 
on september,the city filed an eminent domain action against hinz and obtained an ex parte order for prejudgment possession.on october,the court granted hinz motion to stay the order of prejudgment possession on the ground that there is no public use that would support the city exercise of its power of eminent domain,since the engineer report repeatedly indicates that the improvements have no benefit to the public in general.the court thus concluded that there was a reasonable probability that hinz would prevail in the eminent domain action.
hinz subsequently filed an answer to the city eminent domain complaint that asserted a number of affirmative defenses,three of which are the subjects of this appeal.hinz asserted that the city eminent domain action is barred because the city resolution of necessity authorizing the eminent domain action was influenced and affected by the city gross abuse of discretion because the purpose for which his property is to be taken is not a public use and because the vrad is illegal in all respects including,without limitation,its formation and implementation,because the district confers no general benefit to the citizens of the city hereafter,we may refer to the latter defense as the invalidity defense.
the eminent domain action was bifurcated for the purpose of trial.in the first phase of the trial,the court adjudicated hinz defenses and objections to the city right to exercise its eminent domain power to acquire the easement.the issue of just compensation for the taking was reserved for the second phase of the trial.
at the beginning of trial,the court granted the city motion in limine to exclude evidence and argument challenging the formation and validity of the vrad on the ground that such a challenge was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in streets and highways code section.thus,the court found that hinz affirmative defense challenging the validity of the vrad was.the court did,however,permit hinz to introduce extensive,detailed evidence regarding the history and formation of the district as background and because it was relevant to hinz other defenses 
the court concluded that hinz had not met his burden of proving that the city had committed a gross abuse of discretion in adopting resolution resolution.the court found that the city was therefore entitled to a conclusive presumption that the public interest and necessity require the project,that the project is planned or located in the manner that would be most compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury,and that the property sought to be acquired is necessary for the project,as stated in resolution.the court overruled hinz objections to the city right to take the property and ordered the stay on the order of prejudgment possession lifted.hinz did not request a statement of decision.
in july,the parties resolved the issue of compensation and stipulated that was just compensation for the easement.the court entered its final order of condemnation and judgment on july.hinz appeals.
discussion 
hinz affirmative defense asserting the invalidity of the assessment district was 
we begin by addressing hinz claim that the trial court erred in granting the city motion in limine and finding that his affirmative defense attacking the validity of the vrad was barred by the limitations period set forth in streets and highways code section hereafter section.
hinz argues that the limitations period in section does not apply to this condemnation action for several reasons.first,he argues that section does not apply to his defenses to the condemnation action.second,he asserts that the limitations period in section does not apply because he was not aggrieved by the formation of the vrad until the city brought the condemnation action against him and that he had no right to challenge the formation of the assessment district prior to that time.third,he argues that only property owners against whom a special assessment is levied may judicially challenge a special assessment,suggesting that such property owners are the only ones subject to the limitations period in section.fourth,he asserts that section does not apply to him,since he did not challenge a specific assessment,but rather sought a finding that the assessment district itself was invalid.hinz also contends that his challenge to the validity of the assessment district in the eminent domain action does not invalidate the assessments levied against the property owners in the vrad,since any claims they may have regarding the validity of the assessments are now.
standard of review and rules of statutory construction 
since the issue presented involves the interpretation of a statute and the application of that statute to undisputed facts,it is subject to this court independent or de novo review.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d,international engine parts,feddersen cal th,d.
in statutory construction cases,our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citations.if the terms of the statute are unambiguous,we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.if there is ambiguity,however,we may then look to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.in such cases,we select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.estate of griswold cal th,d,quoting day city of fontana cal th,d.
limitations period set forth in statute 
section provides the validity of an assessment or supplementary assessment levied under this division shall not be contested in any action or proceeding unless the action or proceeding is commenced within days after the assessment is levied.any appeal from a final judgment in such an action or proceeding shall be perfected within days after the entry of judgment.
the statute provides a limitations period on any action or proceeding that challenges the validity of an assessment.section provides that the cause of action accrues and the limitations period begins to run when the assessment is levied.for the purposes of section,an assessment is levied when the governing body passes a resolution that confirms the assessments and orders the proposed improvement to be made.city of oxnard d.atascadero county sanitation district d.fahey city council d.
the assessments were levied on april,when the city adopted resolution,which approved the engineer report,confirmed the assessments,approved the formation of the district,and ordered the improvements.assuming section applies to hinz invalidity defense,hinz had days from april,or until may,to contest the assessments in a legal action.the city filed its eminent domain action on september.hinz filed his answer asserting the invalidity defense and other defenses on october.thus,hinz challenge was not raised within days of the date the assessments were levied.
applicability of section to actions contesting the validity of an assessment district 
there is no merit to hinz claim that section does not apply to this action because he is challenging the formation of the district and not the levying of a special assessment.an action challenging the validity of a special assessment district is an action contesting the validity of an assessment within the meaning of section.dawson town of los altos hills cal d,dawson vogel city of millbrae d.
persons subject to section 
as for hinz contention that only those property owners who have been assessed may judicially challenge the assessment and are therefore subject to the limitations period in section,we note that the party challenging the special assessments in,supra,d at pages and.did not own property in the special assessment district.the court concluded that his challenge to the validity of the assessments was barred under section because it was filed more than days after the assessments were levied.id.at.the court did not expressly address the question of whether a person who does not own property in the assessment district has standing to challenge a special assessment.however,streets and highways code section,subdivision a provides that when a public entity passes a resolution confirming the assessments and ordering the improvement,t he resolution shall be final as to all persons,and the assessment thereby levied upon the respective subdivisions of land in the assessment district.italics added.hinz could have brought a declaratory relief action to determine his rights and duties with respect to the property.code civ.
these authorities lead to the conclusion that the limitations period in section applies to all persons,including those who do not own property within the assessment district.furthermore,if we take hinz argument to its logical conclusion,hinz would not be able to judicially challenge the validity of the vrad in this action,since no special assessment was ever levied against him.these authorities also tend to dispose of hinz argument that he had no right to challenge the formation of the vrad until city filed its condemnation action against him.
applicability of limitations periods to defenses the rule from styne stevens 
hinz also asserts that the limitations period in section does not apply to his defenses in this eminent domain proceeding.our supreme court addressed the applicability of statutes of limitation to affirmative defenses in styne stevens cal th,d,styne.styne was a contract action in which norton styne sued entertainer connie stevens for money that was allegedly due under an oral contract involving stevens association with a cable television network and the sale of her beauty products.as a defense,stevens asserted that styne was acting as a talent agent but lacked the license required under the talent agencies act.styne argued that the defense was barred by the talent agencies act statute of limitations,found in labor code section.id.at,d.
the court observed that there is a clear rule that statutes of limitations do not apply to defenses.styne,supra,cal th at,d.the court explained,under authority,a defense may be raised at any time,even if the matter alleged would be barred by a statute of limitations if asserted as the basis for affirmative relief,and observed that t he rule applies in particular to contract actions.ibid.the court reasoned that s tatutes of limitations bar actions or proceedings citation,thus guarding against stale claims and affording repose against litigation citation.citation.as the united states supreme court recently stated in another context,the object of a statute of limitation in keeping stale litigation out of courts,would be distorted if the statute were applied to bar an otherwise legitimate defense to a timely lawsuit,for limitations statutes are aimed at lawsuits,not the consideration of particular issues in lawsuits.citation.id.at,d,citing beach ocwen fed.bank,d.
the court also stated that the phrase actions and proceedings in labor code section,subdivision c must be construed as referring to claims for affirmative relief and that nothing in the language of section was intended to bar a mere defense to a claim for relief initiated by another.styne,supra,cal th at,d.the court concluded that the limitations period in labor code section,subdivision c did not bar the assertion of stevens defense based on the talent agencies act.id.at,d.
parties assertions regarding the applicability of styne stevens to section 
we asked the parties to provide us with supplemental briefing addressing the applicability of styne to the statute of limitations issue presented in this case.hinz argues that styne applies and requires a reversal of the trial court ruling on the motion in limine.
the city distinguishes this case from styne by arguing that it is an eminent domain action brought to promote public interests and not a contract action or other action brought to enforce private rights.the city argues that section was not enacted to afford repose to private parties and that its purpose is to promptly foreclose disruptive and destructive challenges to private funding of public,often involve the issuance and sale of bonds.as the court noted in styne,the rule precluding application of statutes of limitations to defenses has been applied chiefly in contract actions.styne,supra,cal th at,d,see also witkin,california procedure ed.actions.the city points out that the limitations period at issue here affords litigants the shortest amount of time within which to pursue their claims days.as the city notes,only a handful of actions,all having to do with challenges to governmental activity,share such a short limitations period.witkin,supra,actions.
interpretation of section 
the city attempts to distinguish the limitations period in section from the labor code section at issue in styne,by arguing that the language of the provision at issue here is broader than the language in the code section at issue in styne and therefore applies to defenses.
the limitations period in styne is found in labor code section,subdivision c,which provides no action or proceeding shall be brought pursuant to this chapter with respect to any violation which is alleged to have occurred more than one year prior to commencement of the action or proceeding.italics added.the limitations period at issue here,section,provides the validity of an assessment or supplementary assessment levied under this division shall not be contested in any action or proceeding unless the action or proceeding is commenced within days after the assessment is levied.italics added.
interpreting the statutory language at issue in styne,the supreme court stated the talent agencies act limits actions and proceedings citation and contains no exception for defensive use,though the legislature must have understood that artists would routinely commence proceedings before the commissioner,seeking to avoid their contractual commitments by claiming violations of the act.but the act phrase actions and proceedings which parallels the universal statute of limitations reference to actions see,code civ,et must be construed in the same fashion,as referring to claims for affirmative relief.nothing in the language of section,subdivision c suggests that,in contrast with other statutory limitations periods,it was intended to bar a mere defense to a claim for relief initiated by another.styne,supra,cal th at,d.
as the styne court noted,other limitations statutes contain express references to the defensive use of a limitations period.for example,government code section provides for a limitations period on a ny action or proceeding to attack,review,set aside,void or annul the decision of an advisory agency,appeal board or legislative body concerning a subdivision,thereafter all persons are barred from any such action or proceeding or any defense of invalidity or unreasonableness of such decision or of such proceedings,acts or determinations italics added.similar language is found in government code sections and,subdivision d,as well as streets and highways code section in contrast,the statute at issue here contains no such express reference to defensive use of the limitations period.the question then becomes whether the phrase shall not be contested in any action or proceeding in section is broad enough to encompass defensive use of the limitations period,absent an express statement to that effect.
the city argues that the use of the word contested in section broadens its scope and extends the limitations period to the assertion of defenses.the city relies on the definition of contest from black law dictionary ed page,which defines the term as to assert a defense to an adverse claim in a court proceeding.to oppose,resist,or dispute the case made by a plaintiff or prosecutor to defend,as a suit or other proceeding.the more recent black law dictionary ed page defines contest as.to litigate or call into question challenge.to deny an adverse claim or assert a defense to it in a court proceeding collegiate dictionary ed page defines contest as to make the subject of dispute,contention,or litigation.according to these sources,contest applies to both affirmative claims and any defenses that are raised in a lawsuit.unlike the statutory provision in styne,the use of the term contested in section indicates that the limitations period was intended to bar a defense to a claim for relief initiated by another.
numerous code provisions contain limitations periods that employ the phrase shall not be contested in any action or proceeding.see code civ,limitations period on assessments for public improvements by chartered cities,open space maintenance act health,special assessment areas within redevelopment projects sts,street lighting act of,street lighting act of,tree planting act of,landscaping and lighting act of,parking and business improvement area law of,and parking and business improvement area law of stats,ch,west ann.supp.ch,stats,ch,west.supp.ch,stats,ch,west.supp.ch,stats,ch,west.ch,stats,ch,west.ed.ch,local flood control,watershed protection,and water conservation acts.
the city does not cite and our research has not revealed any cases that interpret the phrase shall not be contested in any action or proceeding as it is used in these statutes.as noted above,the phrase only appears in limitations provisions involving governmental action.
one of the reasons for the short limitations period in section is the need for finality in the levying of assessments.as the court noted in it is a fact of common knowledge that the mere existence of a lawsuit usually prevents the sale of bonds and the raising of the funds required to do the work of improvement for which the special assessment has been levied.citation.the short statutes of limitations such as section are essential to the consummation of the proceedings and to provide assurance to bond buyers that their investment will be reasonably safe and secure,supra,d at.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the phrase shall not be contested in any action or proceeding is broad enough to encompass defensive use of the limitations period.the holding from styne,therefore,does not apply to the statute at issue here and the trial court was correct when it concluded that the limitations period in section bars hinz from asserting the invalidity defense.
in addition,the trial court ruling on the motion in limine did not prejudice hinz.first,our supreme court has concluded that evidence of proceedings to assess property is irrelevant to an action to condemn property that has not been assessed and that is not located within the assessment district.san francisco kiernan cal.whether the property of the members of the vrad was validly assessed or not has no possible bearing or effect upon any material issue in the condemnation action against hinz.alameda cohen cal.second,very little evidence related to the formation of the vrad was in fact excluded from the trial of the action.the evidence that was ruled inadmissible was excluded on the grounds of relevance either because it involved the value of the property,which was not before the trial court,or was not before the city council when it voted on the resolution of necessity.the court heard extensive evidence regarding the formation of the vrad,which was admitted as background to inform the court of the history of the formation of the district and because the city council had considered the history of the project in approving the resolution of necessity.
in light of our conclusion,we shall not reach the parties arguments regarding whether section contains a substantive provision rather than a procedural limitations period or the city contention that the statute of limitations applies to hinz invalidity defense because he sought affirmative relief.
furthermore,in view of our conclusion that hinz invalidity defense was barred by the statute of limitations,we shall not reach hinz arguments on the merits of the defense.as to this point,we again note our supreme court holdings in san francisco kiernan,supra,cal,and alameda cohen,supra,cal,that any challenge to the validity of the assessments is irrelevant to this eminent domain action.since hinz invalidity defense is subject to the limitations periods set forth in section,we also conclude that hinz appeal is as to that issue,since it was filed more than days after entry of judgment 
ii.hinz other challenges to the city eminent domain action 
legal requirements for a taking 
as we explained in santa cruz county redevelopment agency izant th,d izant,the power of eminent domain is an inherent attribute of sovereignty.citations.the government eminent domain power has two important constitutional limitations.citation.first,property may only be taken or damaged for a public use,amends.v,xiv cal,art.i,citation.second,just compensation must be awarded for properties taken.cal,art.i.
the exercise of the eminent domain power requires a finding of public necessity.code civ.there are three elements to such a finding.first,public interest and necessity must require the project.second,the project must be planned or located in the manner that will be most compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury.third,the property sought to be acquired must be necessary for the project.code civ,see also redevelopment agency norm slauson d.norm.
a public agency must hold a hearing to consider whether the taking meets these three criteria.code civ,norm supra,d at.the person whose property is to be acquired must be given notice and an opportunity to be heard.code civ,citation.after the hearing,if the agency decides the taking meets the criteria,then it must adopt a resolution of necessity.code civ.a resolution of necessity is a prerequisite to beginning a condemnation action.code civ.
once a resolution of necessity is adopted,the resolution conclusively establishes the three criteria set forth under code of civil procedure section.code civ.however,a person having an interest in property described in a resolution of necessity may still obtain judicial review of the validity of the resolution.code civ.review is available before the eminent domain action via a writ of mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section.code civ.review is also available after the commencement of the eminent domain proceeding by objection to the right to take.code civ,citations.izant,supra,th at,d fn.omitted.
hinz objected to the taking on various grounds in his answer.two additional defenses are at issue on appeal.first,he objects to the taking on the grounds that the city resolution of necessity was affected by a gross abuse of discretion.second,he contends that the purpose for which his property is being taken is not a public use.
defense alleging gross abuse of discretion by the city 
a resolution of necessity will not have a conclusive effect as to the three criteria set forth under code of civil procedure section to the extent that its adoption or contents were influenced or affected by gross abuse of discretion by the governing body.code civ,subd.b anaheim redevelopment agency dusek d.a gross abuse of discretion may be shown by a lack of substantial evidence supporting the resolution of necessity.citation.it may also be shown where at the time of the agency hearing,the condemnor had irrevocably committed itself to the taking of the property regardless of the evidence presented.norm,supra,d.izant,supra,th at,d,footnotes omitted.hinz assets both that there is a lack of substantial evidence supporting the city resolution of necessity and that the city had irrevocably committed itself to the taking before the hearing on the resolution.
standard of review regarding alleged gross abuse of discretion 
the adoption of a resolution of necessity is a legislative act and by choosing the more deferential gross abuse of discretion standard,the legislature evidenced an intent to narrowly circumscribe the scope of judicial review of legislative determinations of necessity.anaheim redevelopment agency dusek,supra,d at.the trial court reviews the agency decision for a gross abuse of discretion to determine whether adoption of the resolution of necessity was arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support.the court must not retrace the legislative body analytic route when the statutory scheme requires much greater deference to the condemning body determination of necessity.citation.izant,supra,th at,d.the trial court review of the validity of the resolution of necessity is limited to a review of the agency proceedings no additional evidence may be admitted.ibid.
in reviewing the trial court determination on the question of whether the public agency has committed a gross abuse of discretion,appellate courts apply the standard of review applicable to ordinary mandamus.in such cases,the appellate court is ordinarily confined to an inquiry as to whether the findings and judgment of the trial court are supported by substantial evidence.citation.however,the appellate court may make its own determination when the case involves resolution of questions of law where the facts are undisputed.citations.redevelopment agency of the city of chula vista rados th,d,fn.omitted.
substantial evidence supports the city resolution of necessity 
hinz argues that the city adoption of the engineer report,which contained a finding that the vrad does not confer any general benefit,in resolution resolution prevents the city from condemning his property.he asserts that a finding of no general benefit in resolution means there could not possibly have been substantial evidence to support the trial court order upholding the city finding that public interest and necessity require the project in resolution.hinz contends that these two findings are inconsistent and that the city did nothing to address or resolve the blatant conflict between its initial finding that the vrad conferred no general benefit and its later finding that public interest and necessity require the project.hinz asserts that general benefit encompasses the same elements as public interest and necessity.we disagree.
hinz cites no legal authority for the proposition that general benefit means the same thing as public interest and necessity.the city focuses on the evidence at trial and argues that the evidence shows that these two concepts are not synonymous.according to the city,engineer scothorn explained the factors he relies on in determining whether a public project will provide a general benefit and they are nothing like those used to determine whether there is a public necessity for a proposed project.scothorn testified that the two concepts are a bsolutely two different things.scothorn stated that t here are,within the purview of assessment engineering,a variety of tests that we make as to whether or not a benefit either benefits the general public or it benefits an individual property as a special benefit according to scothorn,there is nothing inconsistent in his conclusion that there was no general benefit and the fact that the improvement of vessing road is a public improvement project.
hinz argues that scothorn testimony is irrelevant to the issue presented here,since the interpretation of the legal terms general benefit and public interest and necessity is a question of law for the court.we agree that the question presented,whether the phrase general benefit is synonymous with public interest and necessity,is a question of law for this court to determine.
we begin our analysis by noting that the concepts that hinz alleges are synonymous are terms of art in assessment district law and eminent domain law.assessment district law was modified in,when the voters adopted proposition,the right to vote on taxes act.howard jarvis taxpayers city of san diego th,d.the stated purpose of proposition was to protect taxpayers by limiting the methods by which local governments exact revenue from taxpayers without their consent.the proposition generally provides for taxpayer approval for the adoption,extension or increase of taxes or assessments.proposition added article xiii c involving general and special taxes and article xiii d involving assessments to the california constitution.howard jarvis taxpayers city of san diego,supra,th at,d.
the parties do not cite any definitions of general benefit.article xiiid of the california constitution does not expressly define general benefit.however,it provides that a general benefit is something that benefits the public at large,whereas a special benefit benefits only the property owners within the assessment district.cal,art.xiiid,subd.f.
article xiid defines a ssessment and s pecial benefit.review of those definitions is helpful to our analysis.article xiiid,section provides as used in this article b assessment means any levy or charge upon real property by an agency for a special benefit conferred upon the real property.cal,art.xiiid,subd.b.it also defines s pecial benefit as a particular and distinct benefit over and above general benefits conferred on real property located in the district or to the public at large.general enhancement of property value does not constitute special benefit.cal,art.xiiid,subd.i.
the proposition omnibus implementation act,act defines a ssessment for the purposes of article xiiid and the act as any levy or charge by an agency upon real property that is based upon the special benefit conferred upon the real property by a public improvement or service,that is imposed to pay the capital cost of the public improvement,the maintenance and operation expenses of the public improvement,or the cost of the service being provided,subd.b,italics added.
under proposition,only special benefits are assessable.cal,art.xiiid,subd.a.local governments may not impose assessments to pay for the cost of providing a general benefit to the community and are directed to separate the general benefits from the special benefits conferred on a parcel.ibid.no property owner assessment may exceed his or her proportionate share of the cost of the special benefit.ibid.in addition,public entities that own property within a district shall not be exempt from assessment,unless they can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that they receive no special benefit.ibid.
in concluding that article xiiid is consistent with decisional law prior to the adoption of proposition,our supreme court explained a n improvement that was the subject of a special assessment had to specially benefit the assessed property a special assessment was levied against real property particularly and directly benefited by a local improvement in order to pay the cost of that improvement,citation.because the rationale of a special assessment was that the assessed property had received or would receive a special benefit over and above that received by the general public ibid,the amount of the assessment could not exceed the benefit to the property citation.ventura group ventures,ventura port dist.cal th,d.

our analysis is aided by a review of the nature of special assessment districts.a special assessment other public districts such as irrigation districts and reclamation not a legal entity with officers and corporate rights and duties.r ather such a district,in the words of the municipal improvement act of under which the city proceeded,is merely the district of land to be benefited by the improvement and to be specially assessed to pay the costs and expenses of the improvement and the damages caused by the improvement.sts.dawson,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.improvement projects undertaken by special assessment districts include all work and improvements authorized to be done under the municipal improvement act of which are for a public purpose or which are necessary or incidental to a public purpose.sts,italics added.thus,special assessment districts are formed for purposes that are public in nature.
the fact that the municipality is required to distinguish between the special and general benefits to be derived from the project during the assessment process does not detract from the inherently public nature of the project.the fact that a particular improvement project does not confer any general benefit on the community at large does not make the project any less public.this is particularly true in this case.
the project included widening and resurfacing the existing private road to bring it up to minimum city standards,so that it might be dedicated to the city.the private road,which had not been paved since,is to feet wide.the city minimum public standards require that it be feet wide.in addition,the city requires three feet on either side of the road for the installation of utilities.the improvements included the installation of pavement,curbs,gutters,driveway aprons,striping,signage,retaining structures,and a long water transmission system.the water system improvements included installation of meters and a fire hydrant.
the road will connect vessing court,a public street,with quito road,another public street.the engineer concluded that the project does not confer any general benefit because vessing road and vessing court constitute a street which provides for neither n or general vehicular circulation.the engineer noted that travel along vessing road and vessing court is local in nature and does not benefit the properties in the surrounding community or the public in general.the engineer also opined that there was no quantifiable general benefit attributable to the water system improvements.
the fact that this project does not confer any general benefit for assessment purposes does not detract from the inherently public nature of the project.if we were to accept hinz argument,then there would never be a public interest or necessity in the construction of local street improvements that benefit a small area,especially those involving streets and.for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that general benefit and public interest and necessity are not the same and that the trial court did not err when it upheld the city finding of public interest and necessity.
the city had not irrevocably committed itself to the taking 
hinz also argues that the taking was affected by a gross abuse of discretion because the city was irrevocably committed to the condemnation of his property after it adopted resolution in april of.hinz relies on norm,supra,d.in norm,the defendant property owner property was not part of any existing redevelopment plan.in fact,the redevelopment agency led the defendant to believe that it would be permitted to expand and improve its restaurant business.without any notice to the defendant that its land would be needed for redevelopment,the redevelopment agency entered into an agreement with a developer in which the redevelopment agency agreed to obtain the defendant land and transfer it to the developer,who would build condominiums on the site.before considering a resolution of necessity,the agency issued and sold bonds to finance the acquisition of the defendant property.
the court concluded that the agency adoption of the resolution of necessity was a sham and that the agency board had simply rubber stamped a predetermined result.norm,supra,d at.the court explained by the time the agency actually conducted a hearing to determine the necessity for taking the property in question,it had,by virtue of its contract with the developer and issuance of revenue bonds,irrevocably committed itself to take the property in question,regardless of any evidence that might be presented at that hearing.all the while the owner had been misled,if not deceived,as to what fate was going to befall his property.that hearing was thus affected not by just a gross abuse of discretion but by the prior elimination of any discretion whatsoever.the effect of that abuse was,if not to nullify,to deprive the resolution of any conclusive effect on the three critical issues involved.ibid.
