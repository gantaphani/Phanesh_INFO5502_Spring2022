the plaintiffs,real parties in interest in the proceedings before us,roger wang and vivine wang from time to time collectively referred to as the wangs,sued petitioner princess cruise lines,over charges added to the price of shore excursions taken during a cruise conducted by petitioner.the wangs asserted five causes of action.the first three were based on business and professions code sections first cause of action and second and on civil code section et third.respectively,these statutes are california unfair competition law ucl,false advertising law fal and consumers legal remedies act clra.the fourth and fifth causes of action were based respectively on common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation.
petitioner moved for summary judgment and summary adjudication.the trial court granted summary adjudication on the fourth and fifth causes of action because the wangs could not show they relied on petitioner alleged misrepresentations.the trial court,however,denied the motion for summary judgment because it concluded that on the ucl,fal and clra causes of action the wangs did not have to show that they relied on petitioner alleged misrepresentations.
we issued the order to show cause,received briefing and heard oral argument on the question whether a plaintiff asserting ucl,fal and clra causes of action must show that he or she relied on the defendant misrepresentations.we conclude that the answer is yes and we also address other issues that need resolution.we vacate the trial court order denying petitioner motion for summary judgment and we remand with directions to grant the motion and to conduct such further proceedings as are appropriate.
the facts and the pleadings 
the wangs bought tickets issued by petitioner for themselves and their two daughters in for a cruise with stops in six northern european cities.they also purchased and paid for shore excursions that were offered as part of the cruise.
the gravamen of the operative pleading,the second amended complaint referred to hereafter as the complaint,is that petitioner represented that the shore excursions were operated and controlled by third parties,and not petitioner,who were independent contractors and that,as far as the shore excursions were concerned,petitioner only served as an agent for these independent operators.in truth,the complaint alleges,petitioner effectively controlled the operators of the shore excursions and inflated charges for shore excursions which exceeded the price the shore excursion providers were actually charging for those services.
the complaint seeks relief on behalf of the wangs and for a class of persons similarly situated,which the complaint defines as all california residents who were passengers on cruises operated by petitioner who paid prices for shore excursions that were in excess of the shore excursion operator actual price.
the first cause of action alleges a violation of business and professions code section.in pertinent part,this cause of action alleges that the wangs read and relied upon petitioner misrepresentations including the representations in petitioner ticket contract and cruise answer book to their detriment.the second cause of action is brought under business and professions code section for false advertising.the third cause of action seeks damages and injunctive relief under the clra,et.the fourth cause of action alleges common law fraud and states in part that the wangs and the class members justifiably relied on the representations made by petitioner and as a result have suffered damages in an amount to be proven at trial.the final cause of action is for negligent misrepresentation and it alleges that the wangs reasonably believed that petitioner was not profiting from the sale of the shore excursions.
the wangs discovery responses 
in their depositions,the wangs admitted that prior to taking the cruise,neither one of them ever spoke with any officer or employee of petitioner and that they did not receive any written materials from petitioner,with the exception of the itinerary that was given to them by their travel agent who was not affiliated with petitioner.vivine wang answers were particularly explicit it was she who made the arrangements for the cruise.she stated she did not have any conversations with anyone from princess cruises prior to the cruise.when asked d id princess cruises make any representations to you regarding your cruise prior to the cruise,she answered no.as far as the excursions were concerned,vivine wang told her travel agent that she wanted to go on the same excursions that her traveling group had booked and i want to go on the shore excursion whatever it cost sic.it fine.
in her declaration filed in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,vivine wang attempted to backpedal from these concessions we set forth the pertinent part of her declaration in the margin the statement in her declaration that i did not tell my travel agent that i wanted to go on the shore excursions irrespective of the cost flatly contradicts her deposition testimony.a declaration that is inconsistent with previous deposition testimony may be disregarded for the purposes of a motion for summary judgment.board of medical examiners cal d.
the trial court ruling 
the trial court ruled that,as to the common law causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation,the wangs had not shown she vivine wang relied on any statements or representations made by petitioner and that this was fatal to these causes of action.the court also dismissed vivine wang declaration as inconsistent with her deposition testimony.
as to the ucl,fal and clra causes of action,the court ruled that there is no reliance requirement.the court went on to find as to the ucl cause of action there is a factual issue of whether petitioner practice of adding a surcharge on the onshore excursions is unfair.a trier of fact may decide that this is much ado about nothing,or it may decide that these practices are so deceptive so as to be worthy of relief.that is a question for the trier of fact,not this court at this time.
specifically as to the clra cause of action,the trial court ruled that summary judgment was barred by virtue of a provision to that effect set forth in subdivision c of civil code section 
the trial court filed its ruling on november.in re tobacco ii cases cal th,d,tobacco ii,which is central to these proceedings,was filed on may.in challenging the trial court ruling,petitioner initially relied on hall time,th,d a decision that held that a plaintiff stating a misrepresentation claim in a ucl claim had to show that the injury was caused by the plaintiff reliance on the misrepresentation.the parties have filed additional briefs that address the tobacco ii decision.
discussion 
the trial court erred in concluding that the clra cause of action was barred by civil code section,subdivision c 
although subdivision c of civil code section precludes a motion for summary judgment brought under the code of civil procedure section,subdivision c of civil code section empowers the trial court to determine that the action is without merit or there is no defense to the action.see fn,ante.
