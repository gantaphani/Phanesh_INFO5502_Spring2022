hunt transport,chose not to employ truck drivers who used prescription medications with side effects that might impair driving ability.the equal employment opportunity commission argued that under the americans with disabilities act,hunt decision violated the rights of job applicants using those medications.we disagree.
equal employment opportunity commission eeoc appeals from the february,decision of the united states district court for the northern district of new york norman mordue,judge granting defendant hunt transport hunt motion for summary judgment and denying plaintiff eeoc for summary judgment.the district court found that the applicants in question had been denied driving positions with hunt because of their use of medications with potentially harmful side effects,and not as a result of an actual or perceived disability or a record of disability as contemplated by the americans with disabilities act of,et.ada.on appeal,the eeoc argues exclusively that hunt regarded the rejected applicants as disabled,substantially limited from a major life activity,as defined by c because of their use of certain medications.because we find that hunt did not regard the applicants as disabled as defined by the ada,we affirm the decision of the district court.
hunt transportation,hunt is the nation largest publicly held motor carrier company.hunt operates property transport services in the contiguous states,the district of columbia,canada,and mexico.its fleet includes tractors,and it employs approximately individuals to drive the trucks.of these employees,approximately are the otr drivers whose positions are at issue in this case.these otr drivers operate vehicles weighing approximately pounds over irregular routes under particularly difficult work conditions,including sleep deprivation,irregular work and rest cycles,inclement weather,long driving periods,long layovers,irregular meal schedules,tight delivery schedules,en route delays,night driving,accumulated fatigue,stress,and extended periods of loud noise and vibrations.according to hunt,the large vehicle size and extreme driving conditions faced by its otr drivers warrant heightened safety evaluations of those otr drivers.
like other motor carriers,hunt is subject to federal regulation under the department of transportation federal motor carrier safety act regulations fmcsar,et.these regulations establish minimum qualifications for any person driving a commercial motor vehicle,as well as minimum duties for motor carriers using otr drivers.the regulations specifically allow an operator to require and enforce more stringent requirements relating to safety of operation and employee safety and health,d,and require operators to restrict drivers from operating vehicles while the driver ability or alertness is so impaired,or so likely to become impaired,through fatigue,illness,or any other cause,as to make it unsafe for to begin or continue to operate the commercial motor vehicle.id.at.a motor carrier is required to ensure that drivers do not operate unless they are in compliance with the dot regulations,b.
a.the drug review list 
between september and may,in an effort to comply with the fmcsar in its hiring processes,hunt created a drug review list drl of medications known to have side effects that might impair driving ability.the list,pages in length and including over medications,was compiled by hunt safety department director of compliance,david whiteside whiteside,based entirely on notations in the edition of the physician desk reference pdr.whiteside divided the drl into six columns labeled name,class,comment,restriction,treats,and pdr page number.in the restriction column,whiteside indicated the impact a particular drug might have on an applicant eligibility.whiteside designated five categories of restrictions rule out side e ffects,not permitted,unsafe e ffects,heart condition,and disqualifying condition.an applicant whose medication had a rule out side effects notation was required to obtain a release from the prescribing doctor certifying that the applicant could safely drive a tractor trailer truck while using the medication.an applicant taking a not permitted,unsafe effects,disqualifying condition,or heart condition medication could not drive for hunt while using the indicated medication the notation unsafe effects indicated either that the pdr cautioned users against operating heavy equipment or driving automobiles while taking the drug noted as warning on driving in the comment column or that the drug caused drowsiness,sedation,or a high incidence of dizziness.a rule out side effects notation indicated that a medication could cause side effects similar to,but less pervasive than,those warranting an unsafe effects label.finally,heart condition indicated that the medication was generally used for heart problems that could disqualify drivers under dot regulations.
b.the hunt hiring process 
upon receiving an application for a commercial driving position,hunt forwarded the application to its corporate driver personnel department in lowell,arkansas for screening of motor vehicle,criminal,and prior employment records and for a review of listed references.if an applicant passed this first level of screening and received a conditional employment offer,the applicant underwent medical screening,including questioning regarding the applicant use of prescription medication for the last five years.hunt used personnel to conduct these screenings.if the applicant indicated use of a prescription drug,the reviewing employee consulted hunt medical guidelines and the drl to determine the applicant medical eligibility.
c.the eeoc claim 
eeoc claims that hunt improperly rejected applicants in violation of the ada on the basis of a blanket exclusionary policy.eeoc admits,however,that hunt hired several applicants who were using drugs prohibited under the,two applicants using drugs labeled disqualifying condition and eleven using drugs labeled unsafe effects,and in and,one applicant taking a disqualifying condition drug and thirteen using drugs with unsafe effects.prior to commencing work,each of these new employees provided hunt with medical documentation from a treating physician or health care provider certifying that he or she did not suffer from the potentially problematic side effects and could operate a truck safely while taking the drug.
eeoc filed its complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of new york on october.both sides moved for summary judgment.eeoc alleged that hunt violated the ada by discriminating against individuals with disabilities or perceived disabilities.hunt alleged that the drl was a qualification standard addressing serious business concerns.the district court granted summary judgment for hunt and denied eeoc summary judgment motion based on its conclusion that ada protections did not extend to the excluded because the applicants were not,by virtue of their use of certain medications,disabled within the meaning of the ada,and its finding that the eeoc had failed to contradict hunt assertion that its use of the drl as a safety measure was reasonable within dot guidelines.equal employment opportunity comm hunt,d.on appeal,eeoc abandoned its argument that the excluded applicants were disabled under the ada,claiming only that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to hunt when the evidence supported the conclusion that hunt regarded the applicants as disabled because of their use of medications on the drl.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence presented below in the light most favorable to the party.manning utils.mut.ins,cir.while this court may affirm on any ground with adequate support in the record,we may not affirm summary judgment where any evidence in the record would support a reasonable inference in favor of the opposing party.see mccarthy am.int l group,cir vkk football league,cir.
a.the statutory framework and the definition of disability.
the ada provides a deceptively simple definition of disability 
the term disability means,with respect to an individual 
a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual 
b a record of such an impairment or 
c being regarded as having such an impairment.
eeoc regulations further develop this definition,explaining physical or mental impairment as 
any physiological disorder,or condition,cosmetic disfigurement,or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems neurological,musculoskeletal,special sense organs,respiratory including speech organs,cardiovascular,reproductive,digestive,hemic and lymphatic,skin,and endocrine or 
any mental or psychological disorder,such as mental retardation,organic brain syndrome,emotional or mental illness,and specific learning disabilities.
although eeoc initially challenged hunt reliance on the drl under all three prongs of the statutory definition of disability,on appeal,eeoc alleges only that the rejected otr driver applicants were regarded as disabled by hunt based on their use of certain medications,invoking the statutory definition of disability under c.as the supreme court explained in sutton united air lines,t here are two apparent ways in which individuals may fall within this c statutory definition a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,or a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual,nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities,d.
evaluating the evidence before the district court,this court agrees with the court below that eeoc failed to put forth evidence sufficient to demonstrate that the rejected applicants were disabled within the meaning of the ada.specifically,eeoc failed to set forth evidence sufficient to establish that hunt perceived rejected applicants as substantially limited in their ability to perform a major life activity.
b.the evidence is insufficient to support the inference that hunt regarded applicants as having a substantial limitation on a major life activity.
to qualify for ada protections,a person impairment must substantially limit a major life activit y.major life activities may include caring for oneself,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and,pertinent to this appeal,working.i.an activity is substantially limited when an individual can not perform the activity that an average person in the general population could perform or faces significant restrictions in the condition,manner,or duration under which the individual can perform the activity.j i ii.the activity of working is further defined by the regulations as follows 
with respect to the major life activity of working 
i the term substantially limits means significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training,skills and abilities.the inability to perform a single,particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.
j i.thus,unless hunt perceived the applicants in question as limited from a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs,the eeoc claim must fail.
driving,trucks over long distances for extended periods is neither a class of job nor a broad range of jobs within the meaning of the ada.
driving trucks over long distances for extended periods of time is neither a class of jobs nor a broad range of jobs,as the eeoc alleges,but rather a specific job with specific requirements.such a position requires specific abilities,especially the ability to stay alert over long hours under difficult conditions.a hunt otr driver alertness can not flag.he or she must be able to stay alert and withstand the mesmerizing affect of driving an vehicle for hours at a stretch,sometimes at night,with continuous vibration over long distances.given these demanding requirements,the fact that one may not be able to perform the specific job of a hunt otr driver does not mean that one could not successfully engage in other types of truck driving,let alone in other kinds of work.
in sutton,the supreme court considered the claims of pilots who had been denied positions as global pilots with united airlines.the supreme court held that the position of global pilot was a single job and,therefore,was not sufficiently broad to satisfy the major life activity requirement.sutton,at.the court reasoned that there are a number of other positions utilizing petitioners skills,such as regional pilot and pilot instructor to name a few.id.
like the limitation that united airlines placed on global airline pilots in sutton,the limitation that hunt placed on applicants for the position of otr driver was a limitation on a particular job within a larger group of jobs,and not a substantial limitation on working.see baulos roadway express,cir driving sleeper trucks is a specific job within the broader class of truck driving jobs.therefore,the applicants perceived unsuitability for the position of otr driver can not be characterized as a perceived inability to perform a broad range or a class of jobs.this is true even assuming that in general is a sufficiently broad range or class of jobs to constitute a major life activity,an issue we do not need to reach.as the dissent readily acknowledges,persons licensed to drive the types of vehicles driven by hunt otr drivers are also qualified to drive various types of small and large trucks,including,moving trucks,and cargo vans.dissent page.
accordingly,to show that hunt perceived applicants rejected under the drl as substantially limited in a major life activity,the eeoc must show that hunt viewed such applicants as limited from a broader range or class of jobs than merely otr positions at hunt.
the evidence is not sufficient to support a reasonable inference that hunt regarded applicants rejected under the not permitted and unsafe effects categories as substantially limited in a broad range or class of jobs.
the eeoc argues that hunt regarded applicants who took particular medications as incapable of driving trucks,which according to the eeoc constitutes either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs.the record,however,only shows that hunt saw the applicants as unfit to perform a job for which they were seeking applicants,driving.the supreme court has clearly stated that t he inability to perform a single,particular job,however,does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.sutton united air lines,d.here,hunt dismissed the applicants as unable to meet hunt own safety above and beyond the dot standards and unique from the requirements of other trucking companies.see compl.def.statement of material facts at see also adair dep.at hunt,d at noting drivers were employed by other trucking companies while taking same medications.
the evidence suggests that hunt found the applicants unsuited for driving of hunt trucks on irregular,stressful schedules,but does not indicate that hunt perceived the applicants as more broadly limited.the fact that hunt did not have another,less demanding driving position to offer the candidates does not indicate that hunt perceived the candidates as being unqualified for any driving position at all.giordano city of new york,cir finding inability of the new york police department to offer light duty,position to officer taking medication did not demonstrate that officer was substantially limited in working where other security and law enforcement jobs in the area had such positions see also baulos roadway express,cir concluding that truck drivers unable to operate sleeper trucks did not show that they were regarded as disabled where employer did not offer them less demanding,positions that were taken by drivers with more seniority.
eeoc references a few comments from hunt evaluators to candidates suggesting that certain candidates were not suited to any form of professional driving.these comments,made by people other than the ultimate hiring authorities,simply are not sufficient to indicate that hunt thought the applicants were more broadly limited given the heightened nature of hunt standards and the fact that hunt did hire some applicants on drl medications.although a few evaluators comments could be more broadly interpreted,there is no evidence that hunt reviewers,relying on hunt own drl and drug lists to make a judgment on qualification for a position at hunt,intended to make an evaluation beyond hunt specific guidelines.nor is there sufficient evidence to support a finding that hunt viewed the driving limitation as extending beyond hunt.furthermore,as the supreme court has clearly stated,i t is not enough to say that if the physical criteria of a single employer were imputed to all similar employers one would be regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working only as a result of this imputation.sutton,at.
in short,eeoc demonstrated only that hunt refused to hire certain applicants according to its own hiring criteria however,a finding of perceived disability may not rest merely on a single employer failure to hire a candidate.baulos,at courts have uniformly held that an employer does not necessarily regard an employee as handicapped simply by finding the employee to be incapable of satisfying the singular demands of a particular job.internal citation omitted.
thus,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of hunt as to the applicants rejected under at least the not permitted and unsafe effects categories because eeoc has failed to demonstrate that hunt mistakenly perceived that the rejected applicants had impairments that substantially limited a major life activity.accordingly,eeoc has failed to show that the applicants were disabled within the meaning of the ada.in so holding,we emphasize that this court will not presume a mistaken assumption of disability based only on an employer decision not to hire certain candidates.
the evidence is also not sufficient to support a reasonable inference that hunt regarded applicants rejected under the disqualifying condition and heart condition categories as substantially limited in a broad range or class of jobs.
as noted above,two of the categories in the drl appear,at least superficially,to refer to the condition causing the reliance on a drl drug,not merely the applicants use of a drl medication although the evidence suggests that these applicants were,like those in the other categories,often told that they were disqualified on the basis of the drug they were using rather than on the basis of the condition supporting their use of the drug,we briefly consider whether applicants using drugs from these two categories warrant a different legal conclusion.we conclude that they do not.
individuals suffering from the conditions treated with the heart condition or disqualifying condition drugs are potentially explicitly barred from truck driving by hunt therefore potentially regarded applicants using these drugs as substantially limited not just from driving hunt vehicles according to the rules of the drl and other company regulations,but as prevented from driving legally for any commercial trucking company.as with the other categories in the drl,however,the restrictions on the medications labeled disqualifying condition or heart condition were placed on applicants taking the drug,not on applicants with the underlying condition itself.even though in some cases,the company,under,could have created a policy excluding the applicant on the basis of the underlying condition,the basis for the exclusion from employment was the use of a listed drug,not any potential disability created by the treated disease 
we conclude,therefore,that any claims arising under the heart condition and disqualifying condition categories are not distinguishable from the claims under the not permitted and unsafe effects categories and so they must also fail.
although hunt admittedly rejected the applicants for its otr driving positions because of their use of certain prescription medications,the eeoc can not succeed in its ada claim on behalf the rejected applicants.the record only shows that hunt regarded the applicants in question as ineligible for a specific position within hunt,not that hunt regarded them as disabled within the meaning of the ada.the applicants,through the eeoc,therefore do not have a valid ada claim.
for the reasons set forth above,this court affirms the district court grant of summary judgment to defendant hunt and its denial of the by plaintiff eeoc.
the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
this case is quite straightforward.based upon a list of drugs and their potential side effects compiled by david whiteside,a hunt employee with no medical training,and a medical guidelines policy developed by michael gray,a former red lobster cashier with no medical training who was,nevertheless,hunt medical advisor,hunt determined that certain applicants were unfit to be truck drivers.the eeoc has provided substantial evidence that hunt believed that these individuals were unfit to drive a truck,or,for that matter,to drive at all and were incapable of performing the broad class of jobs that fall under the classification truck driving.based upon this showing,i would vacate the district court grant of summary judgment and hold that there is a genuine dispute of material fact with respect to whether the eeoc has established a prima facie case of disability discrimination.i therefore respectfully dissent.
i agree with the majority that the issue in this appeal is whether the applicants were denied truck driving positions at hunt because of their perceived disability within the meaning of the ada.ignoring significant evidence that hunt perceived the applicants as more broadly limited,however,the majority holds that the eeoc has only provided evidence that hunt perceived the rejected applicants as ineligible for a specific position within hunt.ante at.in doing so,the majority reasons that long haul trucking is not a sufficiently broad class of jobs such that a substantial limitation on an individual ability to be a long haul trucker would imply that the individual was disabled within the meaning of the ada.see ante at.the majority asserts that a limitation on an individual ability to be a long haul truck driver does not substantially limit his or her ability to engage in the major life activity of working,as many other truck driving jobs are available for these individuals.see ante at.the majority does not,however,hold that truck driving in general is such a specific class of jobs that a substantial limitation on truck driving would fail to imply a disability its holding relies solely upon an inappropriately narrow view that hunt perceived the applicants as limited only in their ability to work as long haul truckers for hunt.
contrary to the majority assertion,the eeoc has produced significant evidence that hunt regarded the applicants as substantially limited in the major life activity of working as truck drivers in general.an employer perceives an employee to be substantially limited in his or her ability to work if it believes the employee is 
significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training,skills and abilities.the inability to perform a single,particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.
j i see also bartlett state bd.of law exam rs,cir.factors that may be considered under this standard include the geographical area to which an individual has reasonable access the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training,knowledge,skills or abilities as the job from which the applicant has been disqualified and the number and types of jobs not utilizing similar training,knowledge,skills or abilities from which the applicant will also be disqualified.j ii.
if other jobs utilizing an individual skills are available,that person is not substantially limited in a class of jobs,even if this alternate employment would not allow the individual to showcase his or her special talents.sutton united air lines,d.in sutton,the supreme court determined that plaintiffs applying for p
