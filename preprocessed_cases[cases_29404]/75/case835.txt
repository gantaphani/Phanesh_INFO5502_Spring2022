facts and procedural history 
colorado law provides that any carrier operating a motor vehicle for purposes of transporting persons on public highways in intra state commerce must first obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity cpcn from the puc.see.although they do not possess a cpcn,some shuttle each of the plaintiffs in this transportation services to and from the denver international airport based on federal certificates,issued by the federal motor carrier safety administration.these certificates authorize transportation services along certain inter state routes.gibbons ogden,wheat.holding that a federal license to transport passengers in interstate commerce preempts state law prohibiting such transportation without a state license.each federal certificate contains a condition that the carrier is authorized to provide intrastate passenger transportation service under this certificate only if the carrier also provides substantial regularly scheduled interstate passenger transportation service on the same route.app.emphasis in original.
beginning in,the puc issued a series of penalty notices to some of these federally certificated carriers,alleging that they were conducting extensive intrastate business without providing the regularly scheduled interstate services,as required by their federal certificates.while review of those penalty notices was still pending in state court,a group of four carriers consisting of trans shuttle,hallelujah shuttle,ethio shuttle,and galaxy of which is a party to this suit in federal court against the puc and other defendants,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.the district court declined to exercise jurisdiction on younger abstention grounds,citing the pending proceedings in state court.see younger harris,d middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar ass n,d.in an unpublished order in november,this court affirmed the abstention decision.see trans shuttle,pub.utils.comm n.cir.
the state court proceedings culminated in a may decision of the colorado supreme court,which upheld the puc jurisdiction over carriers transporting passengers in intrastate commerce.see trans shuttle,pub.utils.comm n,trans shuttle.the court also affirmed the puc imposition of fines against the three carriers that were parties to the appeal trans shuttle,mo express,llc,and hallelujah shuttle.see id.at.in reaching its decision,the colorado supreme court considered and specifically rejected the federal preemption and jurisdiction arguments raised by the plaintiffs in this action.see id.at.
on august,the puc sent a letter to each of the thirteen plaintiffs in this action.the letters described the colorado supreme court holding in trans shuttle,and stated that the puc intends to go to court to ask for an injunction to halt the operations of any motor carrier transporting passengers to and from denver international airport dia on an intrastate basis without actual,substantial and bona fide interstate operations in full compliance with the carrier federal certificate.app.the letters also announced that the puc intends to go to court to ask for an injunction against the named plaintiff unless the named plaintiff provides proof to the puc of its interstate passenger transportation operations within days from the date of this letter.id.
in september,the plaintiffs commenced this federal action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the puc from going to court as threatened in its letters.they did not seek money damages.they argued,first,that the puc lacked jurisdiction to impose penalties because federal law authorized them to provide transportation services.according to the plaintiffs,only a federal a state jurisdiction to revoke their certificates for failure to satisfy the conditions.second,they argued that the puc actions reflected discrimination against businesses with minority and owners and operators.
one of the plaintiffs in this action,mo express,was also a losing party to the state court judgment in trans shuttle.with one possible exception,the other twelve states shuttle,colorado express airport shuttle,denver pro express,front range express,mile high express,denver city express,road runner express,flying j shuttle,ez transportation,advance airport shuttle,a airport shuttle,and american no involvement in the trans shuttle litigation 
the district court dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds,citing the doctrine.the plaintiffs had made it clear,according to the district court,that their intentions in filing in this court is sic to void the ruling of the colorado supreme court in trans shuttle,and thus to take a de facto appeal in federal district court from a judgment by a state court.order of dismissal.although it acknowledged that mo express is the only plaintiff in this case that was also party to trans shuttle,the district court found that the plaintiffs claims had been fully presented in the state court proceedings by the shuttle operators who were named in the state action.id.at.the court concluded that the identity of interest of all the operators has remained the same throughout.id.at.it also found that the plaintiffs have always been in privity with one another in their joint commitment to the same claims and arguments.id.it therefore applied the jurisdictional bar of against all plaintiffs,even those who were not parties to the state court action.

the doctrine does not reflect a constitutional limitation on the lower federal courts.see the federalist,at alexander hamilton clinton rossiter,i perceive at present no impediment to the establishment of an appeal from the state courts to the subordinate national tribunals and many advantages attending the power of doing it may be imagined.instead,it arises by negative inference from a,which allows parties to state court judgments to seek direct review in the supreme court of the united states,but not to appeal to the lower federal courts.crutchfield countrywide home loans,cir.precludes federal district courts from effectively exercising appellate jurisdiction over claims actually decided by a state court and claims inextricably intertwined with a prior judgment.kenmen eng g city of union,cir citing rooker,at,and feldman,at.
