on july,the plaintiff,united air lines,united brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking a declaratory judgment and recovery in breach of contract under its million property terrorism sabotage insurance policy with the defendant,insurance company of the state of pennsylvania isop.united sought indemnity for losses it suffered as a result of the september,terrorist attacks on the world trade center in new york city and the pentagon in arlington,virginia.
united ticket office located in the world trade center was destroyed.it is undisputed that united can recover from isop for any lost earnings that are attributable to this physical damage.its facilities at ronald reagan washington national airport the airport,in arlington,virginia,suffered no significant physical damage as a result of the attack on the nearby pentagon.the issue on this appeal is whether united can nonetheless recover for its lost earnings caused by the national disruption of flight service and the government temporary shutdown of the airport we agree with the district court that,because united can not show that such lost earnings resulted from physical damage to its property or from physical damage to an adjacent property,under the unambiguous language of the insurance policy,the losses are not covered.
background 
the first section of united property terrorism sabotage insurance policy with isop states in pertinent part isop will indemnify united for property damage,loss of gross earnings,and extra expense in excess of the deductible as later defined resulting from terrorism,and any ensuing fire damage,damage from looting,or other damage caused by an act of a lawfully constituted authority for the purpose of suppressing or minimizing the consequences of an incident of terrorism.property terrorism sabotage insurance policy between isop and united,set forth as exhibit a to aff.of jeffrey weinstein dated july,the policy.a subsequent section of the policy provides that the policy insures against loss resulting directly from the necessary interruption of business caused by damage to or destruction of united insured locations which include united facilities at both the world trade center and the airport resulting from terrorism.the policy then states that t his section is specifically extended to cover a situation when access to the insured locations is prohibited by order of civil authority as a direct result of damage to adjacent premises.id.
united seeks a declaratory judgment pursuant to a and an award of damages for breach of contract against isop.in this pursuit,it made two principal arguments to the district court to support its position that the cited provisions of the policy entitle it to compensation for the lost earnings at issue.first,it argued that section,quoted above,contains within it a suppression damages clause,which covers united lost earnings resulting from the terrorist attacks even in the absence of physical damage to its airport property.second,united argued that it is entitled to recover for lost earnings arising from the shutdown of the airport under the civil authority clause contained in section.of the policy because the closure was a direct result of physical damage to the pentagon,which was on adjacent premises.isop asserts seven counterclaims and seeks a declaratory judgment that it is not obligated to reimburse united for the disputed portion of its lost earnings.
on march,in a thorough and thoughtful opinion,the district court richard berman,judge granted isop motion for summary judgment and denied united for summary judgment.the court concluded that the plain and unambiguous terms of the policy did not cover the claims that united asserted.see united airlines,ins.of the state of,d.
first,the court reasoned,paragraph.of the policy states that the policy covers losses from business interruption caused by damage to or destruction of the insured locations.united could as both parties agreed therefore recover the amount of losses attributable to the destruction of its ticket office in the world trade center.but because the other loss of earnings was caused by the suspension of air service rather than damage to or destruction of a united location,united could not recover under the policy for earnings lost as a result of the disruption of air service.see united airlines,d at.
second,the court noted that under the policy civil authority clause in paragraph,united would not have been required to show physical damage to its property had it been seeking to recover for damages resulting from blocked access to its airport property as a direct result of damage to adjacent premises.but the district court rejected united argument that the pentagon qualified as an adjacent premise to the airport for purposes of this paragraph.the court further concluded that,even if the pentagon were adjacent to the airport,the closing of the airport and consequent lost earnings incurred by united were not direct results of the physical damage to the pentagon.see id.at.

ii.recovering loss of gross earnings under the suppression damages clause 
the purpose of business interruption insurance is to indemnify the insured against losses arising from an inability to continue normal business operations and functions due to damage sustained as a result of the hazard insured against.in other words,the goal is to preserve the continuity of the insured earnings.jur.insurance see also archer daniels midland hartford fire ins,cir regular insurance replaces profits lost as a result of physical damage to the insured plant or other equipment quoted in zurich am.ins.abm,cir.although the policy business interruption clause requires that the loss of earnings stem from physical damage to united property,a civil authority clause extends the policy coverage to instances in which united is unable to reach its property as a result of physical damage to an adjacent property.the complete provision reads 
iii.valuation 
business interruption 
gross earnings 
this policy insures against loss resulting directly from the necessary interruption of business caused by damage to or destruction of the insured locations resulting from terrorism,sabotage,mutiny,insurrection,rebellion,or coup.
this section is specifically extended to cover a situation when access to the insured locations is prohibited by order of civil authority as a direct result of damage to adjacent premises,not exceeding,however,two consecutive weeks.
to recover gross earnings under this language,united would be required to demonstrate that the business interruption at issue resulted from either physical damage to property at the insured location in question,the airport,or an order of civil authority as a direct result of physical damage to property adjacent to the insured location in question,united contends,the pentagon.as explained in part iii of this opinion,united is able to show neither.
united argues,however,that a third provision of the policy,contained in section it calls the suppression damages clause provides a separate basis upon which it may recover from isop its loss of gross earnings without having to establish either of the foregoing prerequisites.united argument in this respect fails because,simply put,there is no suppression damages clause.
