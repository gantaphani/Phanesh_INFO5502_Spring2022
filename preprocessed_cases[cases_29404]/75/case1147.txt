on appeal defendant argues its arbitration right was triggered by the sac reference to the purchase agreement for the civic defendant asserts it moved for arbitration at its very first opportunity to assess this claim,we summarize plaintiff allegations in her fac and her sac,and describe the discovery efforts undertaken before the court overruled defendant demurrer to the sac.
in her fac,plaintiff alleged she purchased services from defendant by transferring a ford escort to defendant pursuant to a bill of sale.defendant agreed to transfer to itself ownership of the escort and to take care of all dmv ownership transfer requirements,including submitting a notice of release of liability to the dmv.thereafter,on at least seven occasions over a period of three years,plaintiff notified defendant agents of parking tickets she had received for the escort after the date of sale,as well as a letter demanding towing and junkyard impound fees,and a tax offset notice threatening garnishment for monies owed on the ford escort for the outstanding traffic ticket defendant had promised to take care of.defendant agents admitted it was defendant fault and promised to take care of the matter.but as of the date of the fac,the escort remained registered in plaintiff name.
the fac contained four causes of action,including a claim under the clra.plaintiff alleged,inter alia,that defendant engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the clra by violating section,subdivision a section a.under that subdivision,a person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer engages in an unfair or deceptive act or practice by r epresenting that the subject of a transaction has been supplied in accordance with a previous representation when it has not.in the fac,plaintiff alleged that the subject of the transaction was the transfer of ownership of the ford escort from plaintiff to defendant,including filing the necessary documents with the dmv to release plaintiff from liability for the car.
demurrer to the fac 
in august,defendant demurred to the fac,inter alia,for failure to state a cause of action under section a,which prohibits a seller from representing that the subject of a transaction has been supplied in accordance with a previous representation when it has not.defendant argued that the subject of the transaction is the subject vehicle,not the transfer of ownership.the court sustained with leave to amend defendant demurrer to plaintiff clra cause of action.
plaintiff filed her sac on october.as relevant here,the sac was substantially similar to the fac,but contained changes to paragraph of the general allegations and paragraphs and of the clra claim.in paragraph of the sac plaintiff alleged she purchased a honda civic automobile from defendant,and that,as part of that purchase transaction,defendant agreed to take in plaintiff escort and apply its value as a down payment toward the purchase of the honda civic.in contrast,in paragraph of the fac plaintiff alleged she purchased services from defendant.in paragraph of the sac plaintiff alleged that,under section a,the subject of the transaction was effecting transfer of ownership of the ford escort from plaintiff to defendant,including obtaining a release of plaintiff from liability for the car,as performance pursuant to the purchase agreement for the honda civic.and in paragraph of the sac plaintiff alleged that defendant misrepresentations in the performance of its agreement were intended to result in the sale of the honda civic to plaintiff.in contrast,in paragraph of the fac plaintiff alleged that defendant misrepresentations in the performance of its agreement were intended to result in the sale of the service to plaintiff.thus,the consumer transaction described in the sac was defendant sale of a civic to plaintiff pursuant to a purchase agreement.the performance of that purchase agreement allegedly included defendant transferring the escort to itself.
demurrer to the sac 
on november,defendant demurred to the sac for failure to state a cause of action under the clra.on december,the court overruled defendant demurrer.
in august and september of,plaintiff propounded written discovery requests on defendant and noticed depositions of defendant personnel.defendant stalled the depositions.plaintiff served her first deposition notices on august.defendant counsel responded with a letter on august,stating that witnesses and defense counsel were unavailable on the dates noticed.instead of proposing dates on which the witnesses and counsel would be available,defendant counsel simply stated c onsequently,alternative dates will be proposed as soon as those dates have been ascertained.defendant counsel did not object to the depositions on the ground that arbitration would be sought.apparently,alternative deposition dates were never provided,despite plaintiff counsel asking for them at court appearances on september,october,and december,and defendant counsel saying she would do so.
written discovery did not go much better.on august,plaintiff served a set of form interrogatories,requests for admissions,and a demand for production of documents.after obtaining an extension,defendant responded to the written discovery on october,but the responses resulted in plaintiff counsel finding it necessary to write two meet and confer letters regarding asserted insufficiency of the responses.
defendant request for,and petition to compel,arbitration 
on the same day the court overruled defendant demurrer to the sac,december,and after the hearing,defendant wrote plaintiff asking for a stipulation to arbitrate the matter,enclosing for the first time the contract containing the arbitration clause,a contract which had been withheld from the earlier document production.on january,plaintiff declined defendant request to arbitrate the dispute.on january,defendant filed its petition to compel arbitration of all claims in plaintiff sac and to stay plaintiff lawsuit.
