this case arises out of a commission agreement entered into by logistics,and usa truck.following a jury trial,the district court awarded approximately million on its claims,as well as prejudgment interest and attorney fees.usa truck appeals,arguing that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury on an affirmative defense,awarding prejudgment interest,and awarding an unreasonable amount of attorney fees.we affirm.
works as an independent agent for freight carriers,soliciting loads of freight from shippers and then tendering the loads to carriers for transport.usa truck is a freight carrier.and usa truck entered into a commission agreement in.under the agreement,usa truck was to pay a five percent commission on freight that solicited and usa truck transported.brought several shipping accounts or books of business to usa truck,the largest of which were rheem manufacturing and grainger.the parties operated under the commission agreement without incident for more than two years.then in march,usa truck informed that services were no longer that commissions would no longer be the rheem account.usa logistics,a logistics division of usa truck,had begun contracting directly with rheem to arrange for usa truck to meet rheem transportation needs.usa truck continued to transport rheem freight but stopped paying a commission on that freight.repeatedly complained to usa truck about usa truck actions on the rheem account.the parties continued to operate under the commission agreement for other shipping accounts.in the fall of,usa truck began negotiating an arrangement with grainger whereby grainger would bypass as a shipping agent and deal directly with usa truck.in august,usa truck notified that usa truck was canceling the commission agreement.under the cancellation clause in the agreement,the cancellation became effective on october.
in may,filed suit against usa truck and usa logistics,alleging violations of arkansas contract law asserted that under the terms of the commission agreement,usa truck owed a commission on freight that usa truck transported through october,for the rheem account,the grainger account,and the other accounts solicited by.at trial,at the conclusion of the evidence but before submission to the jury,the district court entered judgment for on its claim for the grainger account and awarded damages in the amount of.the jury then returned a verdict for on its claim for the rheem account and awarded damages in the amount of.usa truck filed a number of motions,which the district court denied.the district court awarded about in prejudgment interest,in costs,and million in attorney fees.
on appeal,usa truck contends that the district court abused its discretion by failing to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of waiver of breach by acceptance of benefits,as it applied to the rheem account,awarding prejudgment interest to because the commission amount was unliquidated and speculative,and awarding attorney fees of more than million based,in part,on a arrangement.
usa truck first argument is that the district court erred when it refused usa truck proffered jury instruction on the affirmative defense of waiver of breach by acceptance of benefits.usa truck theory of defense was that waived usa truck breach of the commission agreement as to the rheem account by continuing to accept commission payments for shipments made on other accounts.the district court concluded that the facts of this case did not support usa truck theory and declined to instruct the jury on waiver.

usa truck proffered the following instruction based on arkansas model jury instruction ami 
of breach by acceptance of benefits 
usa contends that waived any breach of their contract regarding of commissions on freight relating to the rheem account and has the burden of proving two essential propositions 
first,that knew usa had breached their contract regarding payment of commissions on rheem freight and 
second,that continued to accept benefits in the form of commissions on other accounts under the contract and allowed usa to continue its performance of the commission agreement.
appellants br.add.at.usa truck asserts that the giving of this instruction was supported by the fact that after usa truck stopped paying commissions to on the rheem account in,the parties still performed under the commission agreement for other accounts.usa truck argues that by continuing to accept commission payments for other accounts,accepted benefits under the agreement and any breach related to the rheem account was waived.
the district court refused to give the proposed instruction because the court determined that the affirmative defense of waiver of breach by acceptance of benefits did not fit the facts in this case.while the question is a close one,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in holding that the waiver instruction did not apply.
the district court noted that the benefits accepted by following usa truck breach on the rheem account were not connected to that breach.the court reasoned that each book of business that turned over to usa truck gave rise to a separate and independent unilateral contract between the parties and that s performance as to one account did not entitle it to a commission on another,nor did usa breach by nonpayment as to one account create a cause of action for breach as to the others.postjudgment order of,at.essentially,the district court determined that the commission agreement was a severable contract divided into separate parts via the separate books of business that brought to usa truck,see ellison tubb,noting that a contract is severable,when,in its nature and purpose,it is susceptible of divisions and apportionment,and has two or more parts in respect to matters or things contemplated and embraced by the contract which are not necessarily dependent upon each other quoting d contracts,and that the defense of waiver by acceptance of benefits did not apply where,following breach of one part,benefits were accepted as to another part.
usa truck challenges the district court holding by arguing that whether the commission agreement was severable was a fact question that the court should have submitted to the jury.we recognize that in ellison,the supreme court of arkansas stated that severability is determined from the intention of the parties and that the intention of the parties was an issue of fact.at.significantly,however,the contract disputed in ellison was an oral agreement t here was no written instrument to be construed.id.it is a tenet of arkansas law that written contracts that are unambiguous are construed as a matter of law by the court.jet asphalt rock angelo iafrate,llc,cir artman hoy,see also oliver oliver.app,when a contract is unambiguous,its construction is a question of law for the court,and the intent of the parties is not relevant.because we determine,as explained below,that the written commission agreement was unambiguous in its treatment of different accounts as separate,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it did not submit the question of severability to the jury.
under arkansas law,the determination whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law.jet asphalt,at see also magic touch hicks.app.a contract is unambiguous when its terms are not susceptible to more than one equally reasonable construction.turnbough mammoth spring.app.in construing the commission agreement,we give words their ordinary meaning,viewing the subject of the contract as the mass of mankind would view it.coleman regions bank.we have reviewed the agreement and conclude that it is unambiguous in its treatment of commission payments for separate accounts solicited by the agreement clearly contemplates that multiple commission payments will be made,such that by its nature the contract is susceptible to division.see commission agreement at usa truck will exercise good faith in deciding all questions concerning the amount of any commission payable under this agreement.emphasis added ellison,at ruling that contracts are severable when by their nature they are susceptible of divisions.while the commission agreement might be subject to different constructions,it is not subject to equally reasonable ones.fryer boyett.app.we hold that the more reasonable construction of this contract is that it is divisible based on the separate shipping jobs secured by separate accounts.id.
even if we were to find that the district court erred in deeming the commission agreement severable as a matter of law,we would nonetheless affirm the district court finding that the waiver instruction did not apply based on an additional reason given by the court there can be no waiver when the injured party does not manifest an intent to waive the breach.arkansas law holds that the waiver of a breach must be voluntary,knowing,and intentional.bharodia pledger,see also sarah howard jenkins,corbin on contracts ed.without some statement or expression of an intent to discharge,merely proceeding with performance in spite of nonfulfillment of some condition precedent by the other party is not operative as a discharge of an existing right to damages for such nonfulfillment.richard lord,williston on contracts ed.t he general rule is that where a contracting party,with knowledge of a breach by the other party,receives and accepts payment or other performance of the contract,he or she will be held to have waived the breach however,a party will not be deemed,as a matter of law,to have waived a breach,where it issues numerous warnings emphasis added.as the district court noted and the parties do not dispute,immediately and repeatedly complained to usa truck about usa truck failure to pay commissions on the rheem account.there is no indication that assented to the breach of the commission agreement as applied to the rheem account.
usa truck asserts that when a party continues to accept benefits under a contract,arkansas law does not require an additional,affirmative manifestation of waiver.to be sure,a number of cases recite the general rule that one party to a contract who,with knowledge of a breach by the other party,continues to accept benefits under the contract,and suffers the other party to continue in performance thereof,waives the right to insist on the breach.pipe coating,spear wood,quoting clear creek oil gas brunk,see also lumber tie stave,jet asphalt,at.but these cases do not control our analysis.first,none involves the acceptance of benefits under a different part of a severable important fact in this case.even setting aside that fact,the cases cited by usa truck are distinguishable because in all of them,following the breach,the party made an affirmative indication that the breach was acceptable.see pipe,at the party coated pipe even after discovering that the correct machinery was not supplied for the job clear creek,at the party accepted additional compensation to account for the delay in promised services,at the party accepted payment for lumber cut on his land and sold to another and did not object to the breach jet asphalt,at the general contractor raised no objection to the failure to give work to a minority enterprise specified in the contract and led the to believe that the use of a different minority enterprise was agreeable.in contrast,as discussed above,adamantly complained,on numerous occasions,to usa truck about the cessation of commission payments on the rheem account.see mccourt rycroft,wl.june,finding no basis for waiver instruction where employee did not waive his right to unpaid commission by continuing to work for his employer.given these circumstances,the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the affirmative defense of waiver by acceptance of benefits did not apply in this case.
usa truck next challenges the district court award of prejudgment interest to.usa truck asserts that prejudgment interest may only be awarded when the amount of damages can be definitely ascertained at the time of the breach and argues that was unable to calculate damages with exactness on that date.we review the district court award of prejudgment interest for abuse of discretion.see ferrell bend mut.ins,cir.in so doing,we recognize that prejudgment interest is a substantive matter governed by arkansas law.see schwan sales,sig pack,cir.
the supreme court of arkansas recently described the state prejudgment interest standard as follows 
prejudgment interest is compensation for recoverable damages wrongfully withheld from the time of the loss until judgment.prejudgment interest is allowable where the amount of damages is definitely ascertainable by mathematical computation,or if the evidence furnishes data that makes it possible to compute the amount without reliance on opinion or discretion.this standard is met if a method exists for fixing the exact value of a cause of action at the time of the occurrence of the event that gives rise to the cause of action.
sims moser,emphasis added citations omitted.
the district court determined that prejudgment interest could be calculated with certainty based on the rate of five percent set in the commission agreement and the revenues that usa truck received on the rheem account from march through the october cancellation of the agreement.based on data that usa truck provided in discovery,cpa bruce engstrom ascertained the adjusted revenues received by usa,the dates they were received,and the commissions due each week throughout the contract period for which damages were sought and awarded.postjudgment order of,at.the district court ruled,there was,then,a method by which s damage could be calculated with certainty and without reliance on opinion or discretion.id.
usa truck argues that the district court erred in awarding prejudgment interest because the amount of damages was not ascertainable with reasonable certainty in march when usa truck told that it was going to stop paying commissions on the rheem freight.usa truck asserts that although the commission agreement set out a rate of five percent,had no idea in march what the would be multiplied against.appellants br.at.usa truck contends that the multiplier depended on how much freight usa truck would haul for rheem from that date until the cancellation of the agreement,a number that was unknown at the time of the breach.
we find no merit in usa truck argument.under sims,prejudgment interest must be awarded if a method exists for calculating the plaintiff damages at the time of the loss,the time of the occurrence of the event that gives rise to the cause of action.sims,at see also id.p rejudgment interest is always dependent upon the initial measure of damages being determinable immediately after the loss.the occurrence of the event giving rise to breach of contract action on the rheem account was usa truck refusal to pay the commissions when they became due.see second amended and substituted complaint at.only then did suffer a loss.on that date,the charge for the freight that usa truck had actually hauled and for which a commission was due what usa truck calls the multiplier was known.thus,the initial measure of damages a five percent commission based on the volume of freight be calculated with reasonable certainty.sims,at alter,affirming award of prejudgment interest where farmer damages were not capable of exact determination until harvest,even though farmer knew of crop injury months earlier.
