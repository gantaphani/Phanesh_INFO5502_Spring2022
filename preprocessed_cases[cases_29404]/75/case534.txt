miller aviation is a wisconsin partnership that owns and operates a corporate airplane hangar at general mitchell international airport.miller hangar is located on a parcel of land that it leases from milwaukee county,a political subdivision of the state of wisconsin.this lease prohibits miller from subleasing any portion of the premises without the express written consent of the county or using the hangar for commercial purposes.six months after executing this lease,miller sought the county permission to engage in various commercial activities at the hangar,and to sublease a portion of the facilities to third parties.the county refused to grant miller request due to the possible negative effects on the airport commercial fixed based operator.shortly thereafter,miller initiated the underlying civil action claiming that the county denial of its request constituted a violation of several federal and state laws,and was unreasonably withheld in breach of contract at the heart of miller complaint is its contention that,since at least,the county has treated general aviation lessees unequally,discriminating with regard to matters such as insurance coverage requirements,required size of leased property,duration of leases,and the right to perform minor and major maintenance in hangars.the county disputes these allegations,and contends that its reasons for denying miller request were reasonable and nondiscriminatory.
the procedural history of this case is lengthy,spanning over a period of five years.during this time,the district court held several hearings,considered numerous motions,oversaw a contentious discovery process,waded through countless briefs,and issued a host of of which are relevant to this appeal.
on november,the district court issued a detailed order partially granting the county motion for judgment on the pleadings.this order resulted in the dismissal of four miller claims on march,the district court issued an exhaustive memorandum and order that dismissed three more of miller claims on summary judgment but remanded the remaining five as well as the county state law counterclaims and claims to state court pursuant to c.the district court gave three reasons for remanding the remaining claims in this litigation when all federal claims are dismissed before trial,a district court should generally relinquish jurisdiction over pendent state law supplemental claims the resolution of these claims involves disputed factual issues and the claims involve issues of state law that are most properly resolved by the state courts.the county appeals the district court decision remanding the remaining claims in this case to state court.
the county argues on appeal that the district court erred in remanding the remaining claims in this litigation to state court pursuant to c.section c provides that a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a pendent state law claim if the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.the county contends that the district court erred in remanding these claims for four reasons one of miller remaining claims was a federal claim that the district court was required to exercise jurisdiction over the other,supplemental claims could not be remanded by the district court,pursuant to c without the court first disposing of the federal claim all of miller remaining claims are subject to dismissal as a matter of law and because the district court already expended a substantial amount of judicial resources,a remand of the remaining claims in this litigation forces the state court to unnecessarily duplicate this effort.we conclude that the district court erred in failing to retain jurisdiction over the remaining claims in this litigation,and in remanding them to state court.
a district court supplemental jurisdiction ruling under c is generally reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see,groce eli lilly,cir.we review de novo,however,the underlying basis of a c remand to the extent that question is a legal one.see,lazorko pennsylvania,cir,cert.denied sub,aetna healthcare lazorko,d engelhardt paul revere life ins,cir.
we begin our analysis in this case by addressing the county contention that miller claim for violation of,subject to constraints by federal law,is a federal claim over which the district court had original,not supplemental,jurisdiction.in bringing this claim,miller alleged the following 
that milwaukee is empowered by the sic wisconsin law to adopt regulations,and establish fees or charges,for the use of general mitchell international airport pursuant to.stat.or authorize an office,board or body to do so that milwaukee in setting such fees is subject to the constraints of.that,as such,milwaukee fees and charges must be reasonable rental charges for airport facilities of an airport owned and operated by that state or subdivision pursuant to e that,as a result,milwaukee has violated.stat.by charging the plaintiff unreasonable rental fees that as a result of the defendant conduct,the plaintiff has been damaged.
it is unclear from the face of the well pleaded complaint whether miller is attempting to allege a state or federal complaint is captioned as a state law claim but the key allegation is that the county violated a federal statute.miller confused the matter further with cryptic descriptions of the claim in the briefs it filed with the district court fortunately,we need not decide whether this claim is based on federal or state law because neither.stat.or provide miller with a private right of action upon which relief can be granted whether a statute contains a private right of action is a question of law that we review de novo.see resolution trust gallagher,cir questions of statutory construction are subject to de novo review.
stat.provides that t he governing body of a city,village,town or county may adopt regulations,and establish fees or charges for the use of an airport or landing field miller alleges that the county violated by charging it unreasonable rental fees.there is nothing in the text of,however,explicitly providing for a private right of action to challenge any fees or charges established by municipalities pursuant to this statute.therefore,miller claim under is viable only if the statute contains an implied private right of action.
under wisconsin law,a determination of whether a statute creates a private right of action is dependent on whether there is a clear indication of the legislature intent to create such a right.grube daun.the legislative intent to grant or withhold a private right of action for the violation of a statute,or the failure to perform a statutory duty,is determined primarily from the form or language of the statute.id.citation omitted.furthermore,t he nature of the evil sought to be remedied,and the purpose it was intended to accomplish,may also be taken into consideration.id.citation omitted.thus,the general rule is that a statute which does not purport to establish a civil liability,but merely makes provision to secure the safety or welfare of the public as an entity,is not subject to a construction establishing a civil liability.id.citation omitted.accordingly,an implied private right of action does not arise under wisconsin law unless the language or the form of the statute evinces the legislature intent to create a private right of action,and the statute establishes private civil liability rather than merely providing for protection of the public.id.
