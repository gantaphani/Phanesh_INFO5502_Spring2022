section of the labor management relations lmra provides a judicial forum to pursue damages resulting from certain unfair labor committed by a union.in rare cases,the union can commit a predicate unfair labor practice through its conduct in an arbitration proceeding.the plaintiff employer claim requires us to resolve whether section permits an action challenging the union conduct at the arbitration when the plaintiff has admittedly failed to challenge the arbitration award itself in court under section of the lmra.
the defendant union maintains that as a matter of policy,the interest in the finality of arbitration proceedings should require plaintiffs in these rare cases to first exhaust a petition to vacate the arbitration award before they can claim section remedy.but in the face of a statutory right to pursue damages,we can not place additional obstacles to enforcing that right without congressional authorization.because nothing in section precludes this action,even without exhausting a petition to vacate,we reverse the district court dismissal for lack of statutory standing.
this case places the courts in the middle of a longstanding dispute between plaintiff american president lines,apl,and the defendant,the international longshore and warehouse union the ilwu,over who may claim certain longshore work handling cargo at the port of seward,alaska.
apl operates container ships and marine terminals involved in transporting cargo throughout the world,including in and out of alaska.the ilwu represents longshore workers in specified alaskan ports,including the port of seward on the alaskan mainland.apl and one other steamship operator,horizon lines,form the bargaining group called the alaska maritime employers association amea,which is a signatory to the all alaska longshore agreement aala.the aala is a collective bargaining agreement covering dockside activity directed by the employers that applies to all ilwu longshore workers in all covered ports in alaska.
under the aala,apl has traditionally used ilwurepresented longshore workers in dutch harbor,apl deep water port at the tip of the aleutian islands and its main alaskan cargo handling location.because of their size,apl deep draft,cargo vessels can not call at small ports in remote areas of alaska,and apl does not own or operate in alaska its own tender vessels,such as barges,that can operate in these ports.so apl enters into connecting carrier agreements with local barge operators to bring export product,usually containers of frozen fish,for apl customers from alaskan mainland ports to the dutch harbor terminal.
this dispute was triggered by a separate carrier agreement with a barge company,samson tug barge,which operates out of seward.in,apl contracted with samson to move apl containers between seward and dutch harbor.under the agreement,apl employed ilwu longshore workers to load empty cargo containers onto samson barges in dutch harbor.when the barges reach seward the containers are onto seward public dock.apl customers then fill the empty containers with their product.once filled,the containers are loaded back onto samson barges,which then transport the product back to dutch harbor where they are by longshore workers and onto apl container ships.
the crux of the dispute is that samson employees who are not laborers perform all of the cargo handling of apl containers in seward.samson employees are represented by a different union,the marine engineers beneficial association meba.the ilwu balked at this arrangement and argued that the aala requires apl to give the seward work to members of the ilwu.
the ilwu believed that apl had violated section of the aala the work preservation clause,which provides 
in further consideration of the terms and conditions set forth in this contract,the employer hereby assures the union that it will use its best efforts and act in good faith in preserving as much as possible all of the work covered by this contract for the registered work force.
it is undisputed that prior to,the ilwu had performed the same longshore work at seward for a different employer,north star stevedore,when north star was a signatory to the aala.the parties dispute,though,whether any of the seward work previously performed for north star involved apl containers.compare appellant opening brief at apl first penetrated the seward market in july.with appellee answering brief at before ilwu alaska longshore longshore workers loaded and discharged apl containers at the port of seward for north star.meba has disclaimed any right to this work.
the ilwu brought a grievance against apl for breach of the collective bargaining agreement,claiming that apl failed to preserve the seward work for members of the ilwu.at the time,however,a new bargaining agreement was being negotiated,and the parties ultimately came to terms.in a letter of understanding incorporated in the renegotiated aala,apl agreed that it p robably will cease doing business in seward with samson.
apl attempted to contract with horizon lines,an amea member that uses trucks to move cargo from seward to anchorage and then transports containers to dutch harbor on ships.but horizon would not agree to take on percent of apl seward cargo,so apl continued to use samson,and its employees,to handle its seward customers containers.
in,the local seward constituent of the ilwu unit filed a grievance over apl refusal to have workers perform the and loading of apl containers in seward.the grievance alleged that the displacement of ilwu longshore workers in seward violated the aala.
the aala has a arbitration procedure for resolving grievances.the grievance first goes before an alaska arbitrator.once the alaska arbitrator reaches a final decision,and the award has been implemented,the parties can appeal to the coast arbitrator in california for a final determination.
in september,the alaska arbitrator conducted the initial arbitration based solely on the parties written submissions.the arbitrator determined that t he work in dispute was previously performed by apl using a stevedore signatory to the aala as required by the agreement prior to the work being performed by samson employees and apl conditions and controls the hiring of samson in violation of the agreement with the ilwu.the alaska arbitrator ordered apl to assign the seward work to unit.the alaska arbitrator also determined,as a matter of labor law,that the union was not violating section b of the national labor relations act by demanding the work.
apl appealed the decision to the coast arbitrator,who did not initially rule on the merits.the coast arbitrator remanded the matter and instructed the alaska arbitrator to hold a full evidentiary hearing and to refrain from making any conclusions regarding the legal impact of its decision.the coast arbitrator ruled that the initial alaska arbitrator decision would remain in effect in the interim.apl never gave the work to the ilwu instead,it paid in lieu of time cards to the ilwu,which essentially pays the union at contract rates for all hours of longshore work performed by samson employees in seward.
the alaska arbitrator,after a full hearing,then issued a new decision in which he once again required that the ilwu receive apl seward longshore work.he found that t he work that has historically been performed,now has been agreed is longshore work and l containers from samson barges was work previously performed by the ilwu through a signatory stevedore,north star.the arbitrator stated that apl could give the work to ilwu unit in several ways,including samson could sign a compliance agreement with the aala and hire the ilwu directly apl could have its own stevedore company which does not currently operate in alaska perform the work or the work could be done using a company that will work with the ilwu in seward.obviously this is an employer decision,the alaska arbitrator wrote,but in any event,ilwu longshore personnel must perform the work.the arbitrator ordered apl to give the work to unit,and in the interim pay in lieu of time cards for longshore work samson performed with apl containers.
apl refused to give the work to the ilwu,contending that the arbitrator interpretation of the work preservation clause rendered it a hot cargo prohibited by section e of the nlra so apl continued to pay in lieu of time cards.it attempted to appeal again to the coast arbitrator.the ilwu,though,objected and claimed that the alaska arbitrator decision would not be implemented as required for an appeal until apl actually gave the seward work to the ilwu.the alaska arbitrator agreed with the union.
the coast arbitrator refused to consider the second appeal t he alaska arbitrator determination concerning implementation of assigning the work in question to the ilwu,rendered as part of his retained jurisdiction,is required to be followed as a precondition to appealing his decision in this case.the coast arbitrator refused to comment on the merits and made it clear that apl was free to file an unfair labor practice charge with the national labor relations board if apl believed compliance with the arbitration award would cause it to violate the nlra.
apl proceeded to file its charge with the nlrb alleging that the arbitrator award violated section e of the nlra,and that the ilwu violated sections b ii a and b when it pursued its interpretation of the work preservation clause at arbitration.the nlrb general counsel division of advice investigated the charges and issued an advice memorandum advising the nlrb regional office in seattle to dismiss the charges because they lacked merit.the nlrb regional office dismissed the charges without an evidentiary hearing,and the central office of appeals denied apl appeal from that dismissal.
apl then filed this action in the district of alaska under section of the lmra.it asserted that the ilwu violated sections b ii a and b of the nlra when it advanced an interpretation at arbitration that forced apl to enter into a hot cargo agreement and to cease doing business with samson.it sought reimbursement of the wages it had paid the ilwu through in lieu of time cards.the ilwu,in its answer,raised nine different affirmative defenses but never challenged apl standing.the ilwu then moved for summary judgment on four grounds,none of which challenged apl standing.the district court,though,sua sponte ordered the parties to brief whether apl had article iii and section standing.
after receiving supplemental briefing,the district court held that apl had article iii standing but lacked statutory standing under section b because apl is attempting to litigate issues whether the seward work was fairly claimable by ilwu and whether apl had a right to control that work that have already been decided through arbitration which the parties agreed would be binding.it continued allowing apl to proceed under would undermine the national labor policy in favor of arbitration.the lawsuit was dismissed.
apl timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under.
apl brought this action as the last resort in its struggle to avoid giving its seward work to the ilwu.it has twice failed to convince an arbitrator that it has no duty under the aala to give this work to the ilwu it has failed to convince the nlrb general counsel that the ilwu interpretation of the aala has turned the agreement into a hot cargo agreement and it has also failed to file a timely petition to vacate the arbitration award.but none of these failures deprives apl of standing to bring this action under section.
we think the district court conflated the merits of this case with whether apl has statutory standing.as we read the statute,nothing in section bars an employer whether primary or neutral from seeking compensatory damages for a union alleged unfair labor practice,even if that practice occurs during arbitration.we reverse and remand so that the district court may consider the merits of apl claim,however questionable they may be in light of the arbitrator adverse findings.
section of the lmra provides a judicial forum for obtaining financial compensation for a union commission of an unfair labor practice.see.the statute establishes that it shall be unlawful for a union to engage in any activity or conduct defined as an unfair labor practice in section b of the nlra.id.a see also id.b.then it quite broadly confers standing to w hoever shall be injured in his business or property by reason o f any such unfair labor practice.id.b.
we have held that section requirement that an injury occurs by reason of a section b violation imposes standing limitations.fulton plumbers steamfitters,cir.in fulton,we held that a court must determine whether section standing exists by looking to the nexus between the injury and the statutory violation and the relationship between the injury alleged and the forms of injury that congress sought to prevent or remedy by enacting the statute.id.to determine the relationship between the injury and the statutory violation,we examine whether the plaintiff was within the target area of the defendant illegal practices and was not only hit,but also aimed at.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the nature of apl two alleged statutory violations and the alleged injury are important to this inquiry.under section b ii a,a union may not force or require an employer to enter into a hot cargo agreement prohibited by section e.see b,e.a union signatory clause,which prohibits the employer from subcontracting with all employers who are not union signatories,is one such agreement.nlrb hotel rest.emps.bartenders union,cir i t is well settled that union signatory clauses violate section e.apl posits that the ilwu interpretation of the aala,accepted by the arbitrator,makes the work preservation clause a hot cargo agreement because apl may only work in seward with subcontractors who are signatories to the aala.
second,under section b ii b,a union may not force an employer to cease doing business with other entities who do not employ the union members.under this section,the union may seek to preserve fairly claimable work that the employer has a right to control,but it may not exert its influence to acquire new work.apl argues that the ilwu interpretation of the aala,accepted by the arbitrator,forces apl to cease doing business with samson which does not use ilwu labor in seward without a valid work preservation justification.
because the arbitrator adopted the ilwu interpretation of the aala at arbitration,apl has paid in lieu of time cards for the work samson meba employees have performed for apl.therefore,this financial injury is directly tied to the nature of the alleged statutory violations.
apl has framed its complaint to position itself as a neutral employer which is to say that apl views the ilwu dispute as primarily with samson regarding the seward work.the law establishes that even neutral employers have statutory standing to sue a union for alleged violations of section b.see charvet int l longshoremen ass n,citing int l longshoremen ass allied int l.
but even if we were to categorize apl as a primary employer recognizing that the ilwu dispute lies primarily with apl it is generally understood that an action under section b may be brought by the primary employer as well.primary employers have standing to sue under section b because they are the direct objects of the union unlawful activity.charvet,at citing mead retail clerks int l ass n,local union,cir.because section b imposes a duty on an employer to resist agreeing to hot cargo agreements,i t is consistent with congressional purposes,and only fair,that an employer injured as a result of such obligatory resistance in the face of coercion prohibited by section b ii a should have a remedy under section.mead,at.there is no question that the ilwu has directed its activities during arbitration at apl,the only other party to that proceeding.
therefore,whether we consider apl as either a neutral or primary employer,we conclude that it has sufficiently alleged that it has suffered damages by reason of the ilwu alleged unfair labor practices.we hold that apl has satisfied every statutory requirement to establish standing under section.
we are left to determine whether apl failure to file a petition to vacate the alaska arbitrator award should have any e
