statutory background 
state statutes regulate the establishment or relocation of an automobile dealership franchise.a manufacturer must notify the new motor vehicle board board of its intent to establish or relocate a dealership,subd.a.
the manufacturer must similarly notify each existing dealership offering the same of vehicles within a radius of miles from the new dealership,subd.a.when it notifies the existing dealerships,it must also inform them of their right to file a protest with the board,subd.a.
if an existing dealer files a protest,the board must convene an administrative hearing to determine whether good cause exists for not permitting the new dealership.the manufacturer may not establish or relocate the dealership while the protest is pending,or afterward if the board finds good cause not to allow the manufacturer to proceed,subd.a.
a manufacturer need not comply with this notice and protest procedure where it seeks to reopen at the same location a dealership that has been out of operation for less than a year,or to establish a new dealership within mile of a dealership of the same that has been out of operation for less than days,subds.b,d.
until december,bear country dodge,not a party operated a jeep dealership on florin road and a dealership on street in sacramento.that month,both dealerships closed.daimlerchrysler motors company daimlerchrysler intended to replace those dealerships within the statutory time periods exempt from the notice and protest procedure.
at that time,lew williams,and keil enterprises owned daimlerchrysler dealerships within miles of the defunct bear country dealerships.lew williams,owned great valley great valley,and keil enterprises owned elk grove elk grove.we refer to these entities collectively as keil,as all are owned by the same entity.
in february,daimlerchrysler and keil entered into a letter agreement letter agreement by which daimlerchrysler agreed not to reopen or reestablish a dealership on or near the bear country sites for at least one year.for the next five years afterward,daimler chrysler would require existing dealerships not to protest the addition of a jeep line in the elk grove area.
in exchange,keil agreed not to protest daimlerchrysler establishment of a dealership anywhere in the south sacramento area.specifically,keil agree d to waive any and all rights on behalf of both great valley cp and elk grove cp that those dealers may have to protest or challenge such or after february,of a chrysler dealership before any court or administrative agency under any federal or state statute,regulation or rule including,but not limited to any right to protest before the california new motor vehicle board 
the following day,daimlerchrysler awarded a jeep sales and service agreement to great valley after obtaining an agreement not to protest from the one dealer within the statutory relevant market area who otherwise could have protested.also,daimlerchrysler deferred reopening or reestablishing any dealership in south sacramento as required by the letter agreement and beyond the statutory protest exemption time periods.
in early,daimlerchrysler met with sacramento area dealers,including keil,to discuss ways to accomplish its dealer network objectives reestablish chrysler and jeep on florin road,and have all chrysler and jeep outlets in a single location and owned and operated by the same dealer.all of the dealers understood they had to agree to the dealership location and ownership changes being proposed or else no changes could be made given the protest rights of some of those dealers.
as a result of these discussions,in december,daimlerchrysler entered into an agreement with keil awarding elk grove a jeep sales and service agreement on condition elk grove relocated to the elk grove auto mall.as part of that process,richard keil,president of keil enterprises,acknowledged in writing that the february letter agreement continues to bind keil enterprises,elk grove chrysler jeep and lew williams great valley chrysler jeep to the commitments therein.
in april,and also as a result of those same discussions,daimlerchrysler entered into a letter of intent agreement loi with the owners of lasher dodge lasher,plaintiffs in the underlying action but not parties to this appeal.daimlerchrysler and lasher agreed lasher would sell its jeep dealership located in woodland,move its dodge dealership from florin road to a new facility at the elk grove auto mall,and establish a dealership at florin road.daimlerchrysler had informed keil of this proposed agreement in before keil acknowledged in writing the continued validity of the letter agreement.
in,lasher completed its new dodge facility.daimlerchrysler gave notice to the board and sent out the notice required by vehicle code section of its intent to establish a dealership with lasher on florin road.a few days later,keil filed protests on behalf of great valley and elk grove challenging the establishment of lashers dealership.
daimlerchrysler subsequently withdrew its notice of intention and did not proceed to establish the new dealership with lasher.daimlerchrysler testified it would not have entered into the loi with lasher or otherwise agreed to award a franchise to any dealer candidate on florin road were it not for the letter agreement with keil.
procedural history 
in december,lasher filed the underlying action against daimlerchrysler and keil.in october,daimlerchrysler filed a against keil alleging five causes of action breach of contract,interference with the lasher loi,promissory estoppel,indemnification,and contribution.each claim was premised on keil breach of the february letter agreement where keil waived any right to protest the establishment or reopening of a daimlerchrysler dealership in south sacramento.lasher subsequently dismissed keil from its action.
on december,keil filed a motion to strike the pursuant to section,commonly known as the statute strategic lawsuit against public participation.the trial court denied the motion.it determined daimlerchrysler established a probability of prevailing on each of its causes of action.
