in this case the plaintiffs brought a breach of contract action against a san diego county transportation agency in the superior court of san diego county.in response the transportation agency filed a compulsory against the defendants,in which it alleged it overpaid the plaintiffs million.the plaintiffs then brought a motion to change venue under code of civil procedure section.
in general,when an action is initiated by a local agency in the county where it operates,section permits any defendant who is not a resident of the county to have venue transferred to a neutral county.finding that may bring a motion under section,the trial court granted the motion to change venue.the transportation agency filed a petition for a writ of mandate in which it alleges the trial court erred in granting the motion.
we issued an order to show cause because there is a conflict in the cases as to whether may bring a motion under section and there is no authority discussing the applicability of the statute when,as here,a local agency has brought a compulsory against a plaintiff.we conclude all,whether they are third party or plaintiffs who are the subject of compulsory or permissive,may bring motions under section.accordingly,we deny the petition.
factual and procedural background 
petitioner metropolitan transportation system mts,formerly san diego metropolitan transit development board,is,according to its petition,a regional governmental agency and is responsible,in part,for construction of portions of the san diego trolley system.according to mts petition,real party in interest balfour enterprises,bbo,is an unincorporated joint venture composed of balfour beatty construction,a delaware corporation,and ortiz enterprises,a california corporation.balfour beatty construction,principal place of business is located in solano county ortiz enterprises,principal place of business is located in orange county bbo has no offices of its own and no employees of its own,but instead uses employees and offices of the joint venturers.
bbo was one of the principal contractors on the la mesa extension of mts mission valley trolley line.bbo commenced these proceedings by filing a complaint against mts in the superior court of san diego county.the complaint alleged that because of design deficiencies for which mts was responsible and other failures of the agency,bbo was entitled to not less than million in additional compensation under its contract with mts.
in response to bbo complaint,mts filed an answer and a,in which it alleged that it overpaid bbo million.in addition to bbo,mts named balfour beatty construction,and ortiz enterprises,as.
bbo,balfour beatty construction,and ortiz enterprises,moved to change venue under section in general,section provides that where an action brought by a county,municipality or local agency has been initiated in the county where the plaintiff agency is situated,a defendant who is not a resident of plaintiff county may move to transfer the case to a neutral county.see san francisco foundation superior court cal d,ohio casualty ins.group superior court th,d ohio casualty.
prior to the hearing on the motion,mts dismissed balfour beatty construction,and ortiz enterprises,as.in opposing the motion to change venue,mts argued section provides no relief to litigants,such as bbo,who initiated an action and are the subject of a local agency compulsory.in addition,mts argued bbo in fact was a resident of san diego county for purposes of applying section and hence not entitled to relief under the statute.
the trial court granted the motion.mts filed a timely petition for a writ of mandate.because there is some conflict within existing authority and no case which deals directly with a local agency which has brought a compulsory,we issued an order to show cause 
discussion 
in westinghouse electric superior court cal d,westinghouse the court discussed the general principles which govern application of section.in westinghouse a local transportation agency,the bay area rapid transit district bart,sued one of its contractors,the rohr corporation rohr,whose principal place of business was in san diego county.rohr moved to change venue under section from alameda county,where bart conducted a large part of its operations,to a neutral county.bart argued that because it was a agency,it was not subject to the literal terms of section and because rohr performed a substantial amount of its work for bart in alameda county,rohr was not entitled to the benefits of the statute.the court rejected bart arguments and directed the action be transferred to a neutral county.
in considering bart argument that section did not apply to agencies,the court noted both bart interpretation of the statute and rohr were consistent with the manner in which the section was drafted.westinghouse,supra,cal d at.in adopting rohr interpretation,the court found rohr interpretation was more consistent with the fundamental purpose of the statute the purpose of section is to guard against local prejudices which sometimes exist in favor of litigants within a county as against those from without and to secure to both parties to a suit a trial upon neutral grounds.citation.as the statute is remedial in its purpose,it should receive a liberal construction which will promote rather than frustrate the policy behind the law.citations.westinghouse,supra,cal d at,italics added.
the court also rejected bart contention that rohr was doing business in alameda county within the meaning of section.in doing so the court found doing business for purposes of applying section had a particular meaning consistent with the fundamental purpose of the statute to protect litigants from local bias.the court stated the legislation is based on the premise that there is a substantial risk of prejudice in favor of a local governmental entity.it is also apparently the judgment of the legislature that any prejudice in favor of a governmental entity plaintiff will be so mitigated that a change of venue normally will not be needed when defendant corporation is doing business in the county.it is apparent that doing business,viewed in the perspective of guaranteeing a defendant a fair trial,relates to defendant image in the community.if defendant is viewed as an outside corporation,then diminution of the presumed prejudice is unlikely to occur.if,on the other hand,defendant is viewed as closely associated with the community,there is less likelihood of the local bias that section is designed to prevent.we therefore conclude that a corporation is doing business in a county for purposes of section only if its activities in the county are substantial enough that the corporation can reasonably be viewed as being intimately identified with the affairs or closely associated with the people of the community.under this standard,a corporation with its main place of business in the county in which it is sued can not invoke section.likewise,a corporation with a major branch office in the county would be denied the benefits of the statute.but a corporation with its principal place of business elsewhere and with only limited contacts in a county may obtain a change of venue in an action brought by a local governmental entity.westinghouse,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
in applying this standard to rohr,the court found that rohr performance of the bart contract,which involved considerable activities in alameda county,did not constitute doing business for purposes of applying section.services related to the subject matter of particular litigation are not normally the type of activities that constitute doing business within the purposes of section.a governmental entity,it will be remembered,has a presumptive prejudicial advantage in an action it brings in its own county.that advantage is normally presumed mitigated,if not eliminated,when the defendant does business in the county.thus,even though taxpayer jurors may be predisposed in favor of bart because of the potential effect on their taxes,they may overcome that understandable bias if they realize that unjustly favoring bart will injure a local business and its contribution to the community economy.however,when the defendant corporation has its principal place of business outside of alameda county and does business in the county only by virtue of its bart contract,no diminution of the presumed bias appears likely.if anything,jurors may be suspected of further bias against the corporate interloper brought in only to work on the bart contract.
moreover,to include in the definition of doing business in the county all activities relating to the subject matter of the litigation would prevent the use of section by a nonresident corporate defendant in almost any contract action brought by a governmental entity.a motion under section to transfer venue presupposes that the action was originally brought in a proper court.under section,the proper forum for a contract action against a corporation is the corporation principal place of business or the place where the contract is to be performed.if the suit is brought in the principal place of business of a corporate defendant,section will of course be inapplicable.if the suit is brought where the contract is to be performed and performance constitutes doing business in the county,then the defendant will have no recourse to section.the section must be construed to avoid such an untenable consequence.westinghouse,supra,cal d at.
although it was decided after westinghouse,the opinion in city of chico superior court d.city of chico did not cite westinghouse or consider its holding that in light of section remedial purpose the statute must be construed liberally.without extensive discussion,the court in city of chico held section did not apply to a for indemnity.id.at.in ohio casualty,supra,th at page,d,the court squarely rejected the holding of city of chico.in ohio casualty a school district was sued by a contractor the school district brought a against the contractor and the insurer which issued the contractor performance bonds.the insurer brought a motion under section,which the trial court denied.in directing the motion be granted,the court of appeal found that in using the words plaintiff and defendant in section,the legislature intended to encompass and.p laintiff is commonly understood by both the legal community and the general public to mean the complaining party in any litigation citations.citation.
a is generally considered to be a separate action from that initiated by the complaint.may set forth any cause of action against any party who filed complaint or against him,or any cause of action against a person not already a party to action if cause of action arises out of same transaction as original complaint or asserts claim,right,or interest in subject of that complaint citations see also cal.law revision com,west civ.proc.ed,joinder of person as,setting forth the general principle that a is to be treated as if it were a complaint in an independent action.thus,the common understanding of plaintiff,the complaining party in any litigation citation necessarily includes,a proposition which logically implies that defendant also includes.
moreover,the terms plaintiff and defendant have been construed to include and in a related venue statute,section transfer of case when filed in court lacking jurisdiction.citations.this judicial construction of these terms in section,to which the legislature has acquiesced,is a powerful argument for construing them the same way in section.citation.ohio casualty,supra,th at,d.
in finding a could make a motion under section,the court in ohio casualty also relied upon the remedial purpose of the statute as set forth in westinghouse.since local prejudices in favor of litigants within a county as against those from without may work as vigorously against as against defendants,the remedial purpose of section appears to be best served by a liberal construction which would extend the statute protection to.ohio casualty,supra,th at,d.
in consultants,superior court th,d,a city was sued by residents for flood damage caused by an allegedly faulty storm drainage system.the city brought a against a corporation which provided the city with storm drainage consulting services.the corporation brought a motion to transfer under section.the trial court denied the motion and the court of appeal,relying on ohio casualty,granted the corporation petition for a writ.we are compelled to follow ohio casualty ins.group,as we view its reasoning as more persuasive and consistent with this division prior recognition that section should receive a liberal construction that will promote rather than frustrate the policy behind the law.citation.ibid.
in light of the foregoing,we reject mts contention that as a bbo had no standing under section.as the court in ohio casualty pointed out,in a wide variety of contexts,including the related venue provisions of section,the cases have consistently treated the terms plaintiff and defendant as encompassing and.ohio casualty,supra,th at,d.of some additional significance is the the general principle that a is to be treated as if it were a complaint in an independent action,quoting cal.law revision com,west civ.proc.ed.these principles,considered in the context of the requirement that the statute be liberally construed,persuade us,like the courts in ohio casualty and consultants,superior court to adopt an interpretation of the statute which affords its remedial provisions to and as well as plaintiffs and defendants.
we understand that unlike the moving parties in ohio casualty and consultants,superior court,bbo was the initial plaintiff in this action,rather than a third party.we also accept that mts was compulsory.however,contrary to mts argument,these facts do not prevent bbo from availing itself of the protection otherwise provided by section.first,we note bbo had no choice with respect to the venue of its initial complaint.san diego,as the residence of mts and the place where the contract was made and performed,was the only appropriate venue for bbo complaint.see skidmore county of solano d,fn.the fact that as plaintiff bbo elected to bring this action and thus was not in a purely defensive position,as were the in ohio casualty and consultants,superior court,does not provide any rationale for excluding it from the scope of section.we are unaware of any reason a litigant who believes it has a valid claim against a local agency should be penalized for prosecuting that valid claim.in this regard there is nothing on the face of the statute or in its history which suggests a litigant with a valid claim against a local agency is required to forgo asserting that claim in order to avoid trial of the local agency in a biased venue.
in this regard we note that had mts initiated this action in san diego,as it could because this was the place the contract was made and performed,and bbo filed a compulsory,mts would not be able to question bbo right to transfer the action to a neutral county.as a defendant,bbo would have the express right to protect itself from local bias by moving for a transfer under section without losing the right to assert its substantial claims against mts.the risk of local bias,which is the subject of section,is not diminished by the fact that in fact bbo initiated this action and mts asserted its claims by way of a.thus to accept mts argument we would have to find that for no apparent reason,the legislature intended litigants prosecuting identical claims and facing precisely the same risk of local bias would not have the same protection under the statute.as the court in westinghouse noted,section must be construed to avoid untenable consequences.westinghouse,supra,cal d at.
mts reliance on dicta in partnership superior court th,d,is unpersuasive.in partnership plaintiffs brought an action against the defendant and it was transferred to the county where he was resident following the transfer,the defendant then brought a compulsory against the plaintiffs.arguing that the venue for the was improper,the plaintiffs then moved under the provisions of section,subdivision a,to transfer the action to the county where they resided.in general,section,subdivision a,gives a defendant the right to transfer an action when it has not been brought in the p
