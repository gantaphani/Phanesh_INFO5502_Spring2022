jing huang was injured boarding a shuttle bus provided by bicycle casino,bicycle casino or the casino,which transported passengers from monterey park to bicycle casino in bell gardens.huang sued bicycle casino for negligence.the trial court granted bicycle casino motion for summary judgment.we reverse.
facts and procedure 
huang alleged bicycle casino was a common carrier and had a duty and responsibility to ensure the safety and security of its patrons who took the shuttle bus.bicycle casino allegedly knew or should have known of the dangers associated with patrons boarding the shuttle bus and was negligent in failing to provide a safe passageway for its patrons to enter the shuttle.
the relevant facts reflected in the parties separate statements of undisputed material facts are as follows.according to the asian games manager at bicycle casino,the casino operated a free shuttle service for a select group of people to whom it disbursed advertisements.the shuttle picked up passengers at certain restaurants and other landmarks on public streets and took them to bicycle casino to gamble.
the shuttle picked up passengers in monterey park on garvey street.it had been picking up passengers at that location since march.the shuttle held people,including the driver.there were no shuttle stop signs.the shuttle driver typically stood at the top of the steps of the bus,and the waiting passengers would crowd onto the shuttle.the driver collected players cards that bicycle casino issued.huang filled out paperwork to receive the card,but she did not pay any money for it.the shuttle passengers had access to special promotions like gambling chips and free lunches when they arrived at bicycle casino,where a casino host would return their players cards as they disembarked the shuttle.this was the purpose of checking their players cards when they boarded the shuttle.but individuals could board the shuttle if they did not have a players card.in this event,the shuttle driver would ask for their identification.
on october,at around,huang was waiting for the bicycle casino shuttle along with a crowd of others.one witness estimated approximately to people were waiting,while another estimated to.the shuttle was supposed to pick up passengers at.the next pick up time was.when the shuttle arrived,it stopped approximately to meters from where the group was standing.the waiting crowd ran toward the shuttle,and huang rushed to the shuttle with everyone else.approximately people had already boarded the shuttle at the time huang tried to board.another person in the waiting crowed described the scene as complete disorder and chaos.huang was on the left side of the shuttle entrance,and with her left hand on the handrail,she put her right foot on the first step.the crowd on the right side surged,and she was pushed and fell.but according to the shuttle driver,e verybody else lined up,and huang cut in line.paramedics took huang to the hospital,where she had an.she had a broken bone in her left hip that required surgery the next day.
this was not the first instance in which a waiting crowd rushed the shuttle and pushed or shoved to board it happened all the time.the pickup time was popular.it also was not the first time there were more people waiting than there were seats on the shuttle,and the scene became chaotic.
bicycle casino had not given the shuttle driver any written policies or procedures to follow in operating the shuttle,nor did it give him any training in operating the shuttle.but the driver had more than years experience in driving buses,including for other casinos,and he had driven larger casino shuttles before.
when the driver first started driving the shuttle,he had a casino host accompanying him on the shuttle.the host would exit the shuttle and help the passengers line up and board.the host had the driver tell the waiting passengers in chinese that the shuttle would not leave until they formed a line.after approximately half a month,the casino host stopped accompanying the driver regularly,though the driver would occasionally ask the host to accompany him when he saw the passengers becoming disorderly.the host told the shuttle drivers to make sure the waiting passengers formed a line before they even opened the door because he had seen people shoving each other from t he very first.there was no bicycle casino host on the shuttle on the day in question,solely a driver.
prior to huang incident,bicycle casino had never received a report of an injury on or in connection with its shuttle service.huang never saw anyone fall,push,or shove others to get on the shuttle,prior to her incident.
huang proffered the expert witness declaration of augustine zemba,who had testified in more than depositions involving issues and testified in more than court trials.he had more than years experience managing and operating large bus fleets.zemba opined that bicycle casino was operating the shuttle as a common carrier.he further opined that bicycle casino was negligent in that it failed to properly train its bus drivers on the safe and orderly boarding of passengers and have established,written procedures.he also concluded that it was foreseeable a passenger trying to board the shuttle under the circumstances of this case would be pushed,shoved,or bumped and fall.bicycle casino should have had a host or second person from the casino assisting the driver and passengers in safely boarding the bus.according to zemba,this host should have made sure that the door to the shuttle remained closed until the passengers lined up several feet from the door to board one at a time.bicycle casino also should have provided a regular bus stop so that passengers knew where to wait,and it should have stopped the shuttle there instead of meters away,causing a rush to the shuttle.
bicycle casino objected to zemba entire declaration and to specific statements in it.it objected to the entire declaration on the grounds that it lacked foundation,zemba lacked personal knowledge,he failed to state the basis for his opinion,and he had no experience or expertise in casino shuttle buses.among other things,it also objected to the statements that bicycle casino was a common carrier that it was foreseeable a passenger trying to board the shuttle under the circumstances of this case would be pushed,shoved,or bumped and fall and that bicycle casino was negligent in failing to provide a host on the shuttle.
the court granted bicycle casino motion for summary judgment and sustained all objections to zemba declaration.it held bicycle casino was not a common carrier and owed only a duty of ordinary care to the shuttle passengers.but the scope of the ordinary duty of care did not extend to protecting huang from being bumped by other passengers as she boarded the shuttle.in light of the ruling on duty,the court declined to address bicycle casino additional argument that huang could not prove causation.
the court entered judgment for bicycle casino,and huang timely appealed.

discussion 
the elements of a negligence cause of action are a legal duty,a breach of the legal duty,proximate or legal cause,and a resulting injury.united states liab.ins.haidinger hayes,cal d.in this case,huang alleged bicycle casino was a common carrier,a type of entity that owes a heightened duty of care to its passengers under certain circumstances.bicycle casino argued it was not a common carrier and thus owed only a duty of ordinary care to its shuttle passengers.but even then,bicycle casino asserted the scope of the duty of ordinary care did not extend to preventing the harm huang suffered.
we address the common carrier issue first and then turn to the scope of the duty of ordinary care.we conclude the court erred in holding bicycle casino was not a common carrier as a matter of law,as there is a triable issue of material fact on the point.we further conclude that,even if the casino were a private carrier owing only a duty of ordinary care,there was no basis for establishing a no duty rule in this case.
common carrier 
a common carrier of persons includes e veryone who offers to the public to carry persons.civ.code.the civil code treats common carriers differently depending on whether they act gratuitously or for reward.gomez superior court cal th,gomez.a carrier of persons without reward must use ordinary care and diligence for their safe carriage.civ.code.but c arriers of persons for reward have long been subject to a heightened duty of care.gomez,supra,at.such carriers must use the utmost care and diligence for passengers safe carriage,must provide everything necessary for that purpose,and must exercise to that end a reasonable degree of skill.civ.code,accord gomez,supra,at.while these carriers are not insurers of their passengers safety,t his standard of care requires common carriers to do all that human care,vigilance,and foresight reasonably can do under the circumstances.squaw valley ski superior court th,squaw valley.
whether a party is a common carrier for reward may be decided as a matter of law when the material facts are not in dispute.squaw valley,supra,th at.when the material facts are disputed,it is a question of fact for the jury.gradus hanson aviation,d,gradus see caci status of common carrier disputed.
factors bearing on a party common carrier status include whether the party maintained an established place of business for the purpose of transporting passengers whether the party engaged in transportation as a regular business and not as a casual or occasional undertaking whether the party advertised its transportation services to the general public and whether the party charged standard rates for its service.gradus,supra,d at caci.the party need not have a regular schedule or a fixed route to be a common carrier,nor need the party have a transportation license.gradus,supra,at caci.
not all these factors need be present for the party to be a common carrier subject to the heightened duty of care.see caci ed.sources and authority,note that these factors may not be applicable in all cases.for instance,i t is now well established that commercial operators of elevators and escalators may be common carriers for reward gomez,supra,cal th at,even though stores do not maintain an established place of business solely for purposes of transporting escalator or elevator passengers.and a lthough a store does not charge for use of its elevators or escalators,it profits from the utilization of these devices to assist customers in shopping at the store.squaw valley,supra,th at.in other words,the reward contemplated by the statutory scheme need not be a fee charged for the transportation service.champagne hamburger sons,cal,reward does not necessarily import that there must be a fare paid for carriage.the reward may be the profit generated indirectly by easing customers way through the carriers premises.treadwell whittier cal.
also,the public does not mean everyone all of the time naturally,passengers are restricted by the type of transportation the carrier affords.citations.one may be a common carrier though the nature of the service rendered is sufficiently specialized as to be of possible use to only a fraction of the total population.citation.to be a common carrier,the entity merely must be of the character that members of the general public may,if they choose,avail themselves of it.squaw valley,supra,th at.hence,a common carrier for reward is any entity which holds itself out to the public generally and indifferently to transport goods or persons from place to place for profit.id.at.
applying these principles,we hold there is a triable issue of material fact on whether the bicycle casino shuttle was a common carrier.the shuttle was for reward in the same sense that department stores offer escalators or elevators for reward.bicycle casino reaped reward from the shuttle by transporting passengers to its premises,where they disembarked,gambled,and lost money to the casino.as to whether the casino held the shuttle out generally and indifferently to the public,bicycle casino asian games manager declared that it sent the advertisements for the shuttle to a select group of people.but there was no further evidence about how the casino selected this group,or evidence showing that it was,in fact,a small group.even if the advertisements targeted a particular sector of the public,evidence demonstrated the casino offered the shuttle indiscriminately to the public in the sense that anyone wishing to go to its premises could board the shuttle.the shuttle stopped on public streets.passengers could show the driver a players card to board or any other form of identification,if they did not have a players card.at the very least,there was a triable issue on whether bicycle casino held the shuttle out to the public generally and indifferently,and the casino was not entitled to summary adjudication on the common carrier issue.
bicycle casino relies on the fact that it does not maintain an established place of business solely for transporting passengers,but neither do department stores and ski resorts,and yet courts have found their escalators,elevators,and ski lifts to be common carriers for reward.champagne hamburger sons,supra,cal.at squaw valley,supra,th at.it is not dispositive that the casino primary business is something other than transportation.what ultimately matters is whether the casino indiscriminately offered the shuttle to the public and whether it offered the shuttle for reward 
bicycle casino moving papers attempted to demonstrate that its duty of ordinary care did not extend to preventing the harm huang suffered.but it never attempted to demonstrate that,assuming it was a common carrier,the duty of utmost care and diligence did not extend to preventing huang harm.we may reverse the summary judgment for bicycle casino on this basis alone.
scope of duty of ordinary care 
the trial court held bicycle casino was subject to a duty of ordinary care and had no such duty to prevent huang injury in this case,as a matter of law.even if we assume for the sake of argument that bicycle casino was not a common carrier,and therefore the duty of ordinary care applied here,we would decline to find an exemption from the duty of ordinary care as a matter of law.
california law establishes the general duty of each person to exercise,in his or her activities,reasonable care for the safety of others.civ.code,subd.a.cabral ralphs grocery cal th,cabral.whether a given case falls within an exception to this general rule,or whether a duty of care exists in a given circumstance,is a question of law to be determined on a basis.parsons crown disposal cal th,parsons.this is true whether we arrive at a holding or a holding merely limiting the scope of the duty.cabral,supra,at.
duty is not an immutable fact,but rather an expression of policy considerations leading to the legal conclusion that a plaintiff is entitled to a defendant protection.ludwig city of san diego th.in the absence of a statute establishing an exception to the duty of ordinary care,courts should create one only where clearly supported by public policy.cabral,supra,cal th at.
the primary factor in the duty analysis is foreseeability.pedeferri seidner enterprises th,pedeferri.we evaluate foreseeability at a relatively broad level of factual generality.cabral,supra,cal th at.thus,our task is not to decide whether a particular plaintiff injury was reasonably foreseeable in light of a particular defendant conduct instead,we must evaluate more generally whether the category of negligent conduct at issue is sufficiently likely to result in the kind of harm experienced that liability may appropriately be imposed on the negligent party.ibid.foreseeability involves three considerations the general foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,and the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered.parsons,supra,cal th at see pedeferri,supra,at.
foreseeability,while the primary factor,is not the end of the duty analysis.pedeferri,supra,th at.the next step is to assess whether other public policies militate against a duty notwithstanding the general foreseeability of the harm.ibid.these factors include the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,the policy of preventing future harm,the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach,and the availability,cost,and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.parsons,supra,cal th at.like foreseeability,we evaluate these factors at a broad level of generality,and ask not whether they support an exception to the general duty of reasonable care on the facts of the particular case before us,but whether carving out an entire category of cases from that general duty rule is justified by these clear considerations of policy.cabral,supra,cal th at.
our consideration of foreseeability and the other public policy factors at a general and categorical level is important,as explained by our supreme court in cabral by making exceptions to civil code section general duty of ordinary care only when foreseeability and policy considerations justify a categorical rule,we preserve the crucial distinction between a determination that the defendant owed the plaintiff no duty of ordinary care,which is for the court to make,and a determination that the defendant did not breach the duty of ordinary care,which in a jury trial is for the jury to make.cabral,supra,cal th at.this is why the court deciding duty assesses foreseeability from the general category of negligent conduct at issue.id.at.when the court decides the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of ordinary care,the jury then considers the foreseeability of the plaintiff injury in assessing whether the defendant breached the duty of ordinary care.ibid.an approach in which the court focuses its duty inquiry on facts would tend to eliminate the role of the jury in negligence cases,transforming the question of whether a defendant breached the duty of care under the facts of a particular case into a legal issue to be decided by the court ibid.in short,the legal question of whether to make an exception to the general duty of ordinary care,so that the defendant owed no duty to the plaintiff,or owed only a limited duty,is to be made on a more general basis suitable to the formulation of a legal rule,in most cases preserving for the jury the question of whether or not the defendant acted reasonably under the circumstances.ibid.
here,our first step must be to articulate the duty at issue.pedeferri,supra,th at.bicycle casino appears to acknowledge that it generally had a duty of ordinary care to its passengers.it asserts,however,that it did not have a duty to designate a bus stop so as to avoid a stampede because the passengers waited far from where the shuttle stopped,or to have a casino host or security personnel on board.bicycle casino articulation of duty is based too closely on the facts.we will instead frame the issue as whether a shuttle operator owes its passengers a duty to exercise ordinary care in deciding where and how to board passengers.see,cabral,supra,cal th at framing the duty issue as whether a freeway driver owes other drivers a duty of ordinary care in choosing whether,where and how to stop on the side of the road pedeferri,supra,at framing the duty issue as whether a commercial vendor owes a duty of care to persons on or near the roadways who are injured as a result of the vendor negligence in loading and securing cargo in a vehicle in a way that distracts the vehicle driver.we consider foreseeability first and then the other public policy factors.
foreseeability considerations 
to reiterate,we consider the general foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,and the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered.parsons,supra,cal th at.
we may generally foresee that a shuttle operator failure to try to direct or control the boarding of a large group the general category of negligent conduct at issue could result in the passengers jockeying for positions,jostling each other,and pushing or shoving each other.this is especially the case when the shuttle clearly is too small to hold all members of the waiting group.it is further foreseeable that passengers pushing or shoving to board first might knock someone to the ground,either intentionally or negligently the type of harm that occurred here.this chain of foreseeability is both short and direct.pedeferri,supra,th at.therefore,the connection between the shuttle operator failure to try to direct the boarding of a large group and the type of injury suffered by huang is not too attenuated,remote,or unexpected.cabral,supra,cal th at t he question of the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered citation is strongly related to the question of foreseeability itself.it is also certain on this record that huang suffered injury.
bicycle casino contends huang injury was not foreseeable because the casino had no prior reports of an injury suffered in this manner,and huang herself testified that she never saw anyone fall while trying to board the shuttle.these kind of facts might play into the trier of fact decision on breach of duty or causation,but they should not be the basis for a categorical rule here.cabral,supra,cal th at rejecting the defendant contention that circumstances made the plaintiff injury unforeseeable for purposes of the duty analysis,and noting that the circumstances probably played a role in the jury decision to assign the defendant a minimal share of responsibility for the collision,but they do not show lack of foreseeability for the entire category of negligent conduct at issue here.
we must distinguish between the separate questions of whether a duty exists and whether the casino breached that duty by the failure to use the care that a reasonable person would under the circumstances t he question of foreseeability in a duty context is a limited one for the court,and readily contrasted with the foreseeability questions bearing on negligence breach of duty and proximate causation posed to the jury or trier of fact.lopez mcdonald d.in the sense of foreseeability pertinent to duty,we focus on the general character of the event at issue and inquire whether it was likely enough in the setting of modern life that a reasonably thoughtful person would take account of it in guiding practical conduct.laabs southern california edison th.that a shuttle bus might not have enough seats for a large group of waiting passengers is likely enough in the setting of modern life that we can deem such an event generally foreseeable,and the scrambling for seats among the passengers likewise foreseeable.
even if we consider the facts here,the absence of any actual falls prior to this incident should not be dispositive.it was suffici
