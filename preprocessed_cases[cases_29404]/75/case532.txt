curtis smith is a truck driver with a two million mile driving record.unfortunately,his record for driving is considerably less impressive.smith pled guilty to one count of theft of interstate freight in violation of.he now raises several challenges to his sentence,and we vacate and remand for.
in early november,hirschbach motor lines hired curtis smith,a licensed commercial truck driver,to transport a load of toys from a hasbro toy distribution center in massachusetts to a store in iowa.on november,smith picked up more than worth of toys from hasbro distribution.because the value of the load and the is relevant to smith sentencing,we add that the toys were being transported in a,which was valued at approximately.smith hauled the trailer with a also owned by hirschbach,and valued at approximately.the cargo never arrived at its planned destination,however,because smith pulled off the road at various points between massachusetts and iowa and sold toys off the back of the truck.he used the money from this venture to buy crack cocaine for personal consumption.he was apprehended in bridgeview,illinois on november,after a local resident called police to report that a man was selling toys from the back of a truck at in the morning.at the time of his arrest,smith was more than two weeks late for the scheduled delivery at the iowa.hirschbach had tried to contact him along the way using the global positioning and system installed in the truck,but smith had disabled the system shortly after departing the hasbro distribution center.
smith was charged with one count of theft of interstate freight and entered a blind guilty plea after he was unable to agree with the government on the value of the theft loss.the court determined that the amount of the loss should include the value of the as well as the contents,a total of approximately.the court accepted the government recommendations to depart upward three levels because smith criminal history category of vi his criminal past and the likelihood for recidivism.the court enhanced smith sentence an additional two levels because the theft was facilitated by special skill and training,namely smith skill in driving trucks.smith was credited with a reduction in his sentence for acceptance of responsibility.the court imposed a special condition on smith period of supervised release,ordering him to relinquish his commercial driver license and refrain from being employed as a truck driver.finally,smith was ordered to pay in restitution,representing the value of the toys missing at the time the truck was recovered by law enforcement.all of this added up to months in prison and three years of supervised release,plus restitution.smith appeals.
on appeal,smith contends that the district court erred in including the value of the in the amount of the theft loss,that the court was obliged to grant a rather than a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under the circumstances,that the special condition of barring him from driving a truck was an excessive deprivation of liberty,and that the court erred in finding that truck driving is a special skill that significantly facilitated the crime.
smith complains that the court erred in including the value of the for ease,we will call this the truck in the amount of the loss because,he maintains,the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate an intent to steal the truck.although smith admitted that he intended to steal the contents of the truck,he made no such admission regarding the truck itself.he points to the fact that his own truck,a newer model,was being repaired at hirschbach facility while he was driving a hirschbach loaner truck.because his own truck was essentially serving as collateral for hirschbach truck,he contends it is to conclude that he intended to steal hirschbach truck.the district court determination of the amount of loss is a question of fact that we review for clear error,although the application of the sentencing guidelines is a legal question that we review de novo.united states mei,cir united states,cir.
although it is true that a rational person is unlikely to steal an older,loaner vehicle while the owner of the loaner is repairing his new vehicle,the court was not obliged to find that smith was acting as a rational person would act.smith,after all,was caught in the dead of night selling hot potato heads out of the back of a truck in order to support his crack cocaine habit.moreover,smith was more than two weeks late in delivering the truck and the goods to their intended destination,and he had disabled the truck global positioning device.having sold the contents of the truck,it was just as to assume that he would return the empty truck to his employer with no explanation about the missing load of toys.smith also fails to mention that he had only in equity in the truck he left behind for repairs at hirschbach,considerably less than the estimated market value of hirschbach truck.we can not find that the district court erred in concluding that smith intended to steal the truck as well as the contents.the amount of the loss was properly calculated to include the truck as well as the goods.
the court imposed an enhancement under section for the use of a special skill 
if the defendant used a special skill in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense,increase by levels.
the commentary to the guideline explains that a special skill is a skill not possessed by members of the general public and usually requiring substantial education,training or licensing.examples would include pilots,lawyers,doctors,accountants,chemists,and demolition experts,commentary at.the court imposed this enhancement because smith thefts and the delay in detecting the thefts were facilitated by smith training and licensing as an truck driver.sentencing tr.at.smith now argues that truck driving,although admittedly more difficult than driving a sedan,is not a special skill.he maintains that his crime could have been committed by anyone able to open the back of a trailer,remove toys and hawk them on the street.he also urges us to find that,even if truck driving is a special skill,he did not use that skill in a significant way to facilitate his crime.
the government argues that smith waived this objection,or at best forfeited it,and that we should review the enhancement for plain error.we believe smith adequately preserved his objection by raising it in a pro se letter to the court,and then indicating at the sentencing hearing through counsel that he had no more objections other than the ones already argued.although this was not an ideal method for preserving an objection,we believe both the court and the government were aware that smith contested this point.see,united states sumner,cir written objection to psr and argument at sentencing hearing sufficient to preserve issue for appeal,even in absence of objection to the sufficiency of the court findings.we therefore review the district court factual findings under section for clear error,and we determine de novo the legal meaning of special skill.united states lewis,cir.as smith concedes,we have previously held that the skills necessary to operate an justify enhancement under this section.lewis,at.an truck driver is required to have a special operator license.members of the general public would have more than a little trouble successfully maneuvering a loaded along roads and through parking lots.id.smith offers no real reason why we should reconsider that holding now.see also united states mendoza,cir driving an without any reported mishap over several years is a skill well beyond that possessed by the general public and constitutes a special skill under the guidelines.
the only question that remains then is whether smith special skill in operating an significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the crime.we can not find that the district court clearly erred in answering this question in the affirmative.first,by smith own admission,his extraordinary skill in driving a truck,including his record of two million miles of driving,gave him access to the load of toys.as smith himself
