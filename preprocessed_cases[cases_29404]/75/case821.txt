on may,a train owned and operated by the union pacific railroad company derailed when metal culverts beneath the tracks collapsed.the train had been traveling along the shoreline of lake eufaula,a lake in eastern oklahoma created as part of a united states army corps of engineers project the project.construction of the project had required the relocation of existing railroad tracks and rail facilities belonging to the railroad company,union pacific.under a contract the contract between the railroad and the government to execute the relocation,the railroad gave the government certain land and,and the government agreed to build new rails and rail facilities,including the culverts at issue in this case.a clause in the contract the exculpatory clause stated that the railroad would hold harmless and release the united states from any liability arising out of the construction,operation,or maintenance of the project.
in march union pacific filed suit against the united states in the united states district court for the eastern district of oklahoma under the federal tort claims act ftca,b,et.union pacific complaint blamed the government for the derailment.it claimed that the government negligently breached the contract by installing metal culverts,which were prone to erosion,rather than culverts made of more durable reinforced concrete and that the government had negligently failed to inspect and maintain the culverts,contributing to their collapse.the government moved to dismiss the suit,arguing that the case fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the united states court of federal claims under the tucker act,u.a,because the action sounded in contract rather than tort.the district court denied the government motion.
a bench trial was conducted in october.the district court ruled that because the government had constructed the culverts with metal rather than reinforced concrete,it had breached the duty established under oklahoma law which it owed to union pacific through its predecessor to perform the contract with due care and engineering skill.union pac.united states ex rel.army corps of eng rs,no,wl,at.it also ruled that the government owned the land on which the culverts were constructed and therefore had a duty to maintain the property it owned such that the railroad operation was not affected.id.at.it found that the government had breached this duty by failing to inspect or maintain the culverts.finally,the court held that the exculpatory clause was unenforceable because it violated oklahoma public policy,and it awarded union pacific in damages.
we reverse.the tucker act deprived the district court of jurisdiction over the claim because it was a contract claim under the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of federal claims.and the claim was barred by the exculpatory clause,which did not violate oklahoma public policy.
ii.discussion 
contract claim 
the united states is immune from suit except when it expressly consents.see united states mitchell.two specific waivers of sovereign immunity are relevant in this case the ftca,which waives the government immunity for tort claims,and the tucker act,which waives the government immunity for,among other things,contract claims.
union pacific contends that jurisdiction over its claims is proper under the ftca.the ftca permits the united states to be sued in federal district court for damages 
caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
b.there is no dispute about the exercise of ftca jurisdiction over union pacific claim.but the government asserts that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the claim.that claim,the government argues,must be brought in the court of federal claims under the tucker act.we agree 
the federal district courts and the court of federal claims have concurrent jurisdiction over claims up to against the united states founded upon any express or implied contract with the united states.id.a.but under the tucker act,the court of federal claims has exclusive jurisdiction over such claims exceeding.see id.a normandy apartments,dep t of hous.urban,cir.
because union pacific claim exceeds,the question before us is therefore whether union pacific claim is founded upon a contract in which case jurisdiction would be proper only in the court of federal claims or should be considered a tort claim coming under the ftca in which case jurisdiction would be proper in federal district court.union pacific has pleaded its claim as one of negligence,characterizing it as a tort claim.but we are not bound by union pacific characterization.see burkins united states,f d,cir the court of federal claims exclusive jurisdiction may not be avoided by artful framing of a complaint hall united states,cir plaintiff could not avoid the jurisdictional limits of the ftca by characterizing his claim as one for negligence when it was really a claim for misrepresentation,which is excluded from the ftca laplant united states,cir t he language of appellants complaint,which casts its claim for relief in terms of tort rather than contract,can not be determinative in our inquiry,withdrawn,replaced on reh g,cir putnam mills united states,cir per curiam plaintiff attempt to classify his cause of action as a prima facie tort does not suffice to avoid the jurisdictional inhibitions on claims in deceit or contract.
in close cases,whether to characterize a claim as one in tort or as founded on contract will depend on the purpose served by the characterization.our analysis in this case must therefore be informed by an understanding of how and why contract claims against the government are processed differently than tort claims in the federal courts.under the ftca not only are tort claims handled in the various federal district courts,but also the applicable law may vary widely because the government liability is determined under state law of the place where the act or omission occurred.b.in contrast,contract claims are handled in a more uniform manner.to begin with,state law is not relevant to the interpretation of a federal contract the court applies federal contract law rather than state law to determine the government liability.see united states city of las cruces,cir the obligations to and rights of the united states under its contracts are governed exclusively by federal law.quoting boyle united techs,charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed james moore et,moore federal practice ed.moreover,authority in contract disputes is more concentrated within the judicial system.all substantial claims those exceeding must be litigated in the court of federal claims.see a,a.and even though congress has permitted claims under to be brought in the federal district courts so that plaintiffs with these lesser claims are not burdened by having to litigate in the district of columbia where the court of federal claims sits,see united states hohri,those claims are reviewed on appeal only in the federal circuit,which also hears all appeals from the court of federal claims,see a,hohri,at.this centralization of judicial authority in tucker act cases has an obvious.see hohri,at noting congress strong expressions of the need for uniformity in tucker act claims.as a result,the federal government can use the same language in its contracts throughout this nation and be confident that it will have the same contractual rights and obligations everywhere.
with this understanding,we turn to the specific cause of action alleged by union pacific.it claims that the united states committed the oklahoma tort of negligent performance of a contract.the oklahoma supreme court has explained this tort as follows accompanying every contract is a duty to perform with care,skill,reasonable experience and faithfulness the thing agreed to be done,and a negligent failure to observe any of these conditions is a tort,as well as a breach of contract.keel titan constr.it is essential to recognize the intimate connection between the tort and the contract.as stated in keel,tortious negligent breach of contract is also a breach of the contract.if there is no breach of the contract,there is no tort.one can not say that a contracting party has committed the tort of negligent breach of contract by failing to perform a particular act if the contract,properly construed,does not require the party to perform that act.
given the nature of the tort of negligent breach of contract,it is apparent that recognizing this cause of action as a tort claim under the ftca would undermine the tucker act policy in favor of uniform construction of federal contracts.if one who contracts with the united states government can sue for negligent breach of contract under the ftca,which applies state substantive law,then the government duties under its contracts will be governed,at least in part,by state law rather than by uniform federal law.for example,under a particular contract entered into by the government,federal law may say that the government does not have to do x but if state law says that doing x is required as part of the government duty to perform the contract with care,skill,reasonable experience and faithfulness,then the private party to the contract could sue the government for negligent breach of contract under the ftca for failure to do of course,the government could then modify its contracts to specify explicitly that it need not do x and thereby avoid such a lawsuit in the future recall that there can be no tort suit for negligent breach of contract if there is no breach of the contract.but the whole point of having a uniform federal interpretation of government contracts is to avoid the necessity of having to consider disparate state laws when devising contract language.see woodbury united states,cir noting the long established policy that government contracts are to be given a uniform interpretation and application under federal law,rather than being given different interpretations and applications depending upon the vagaries of the laws of fifty different states.
the case before us well illustrates the point.the negligent breach of contract alleged by union pacific is the government failure to construct the culverts out of reinforced concrete rather than metal.a judgment under the ftca in favor of union pacific would necessarily be based upon a determination that oklahoma law would interpret the contract to require construction.perhaps application of federal law would result in the same interpretation of the contract.but perhaps it would require the contrary interpretation.if so,permitting union pacific to pursue its tort claim under the ftca would lead to a result that contradicts federal contract law.classifying union pacific claim as a contract claim avoids this result.
we find support for this analysis in decisions by other circuits that have similarly treated tort claims.the ninth circuit decision in woodbury is illustrative.woodbury corporation,which was constructing housing in alaska,obtained from the federal housing and home finance agency hhfa a construction loan guaranteed by woodbury.see woodbury,at.after hhfa initiated foreclosure proceedings,woodbury sued the government under the ftca for breach of fiduciary duty,a tort,alleging that the government had refused to adopt a strategy for the benefit of all parties with an interest in the project.see id.at.although the court assumed that the hhfa contracts created the asserted fiduciary duty,it said that the alleged tort was based entirely upon breach by the government of a promise made by it in a contract,so that the claim is in substance a breach of contract claim,and only incidentally and conceptually also a tort claim.id.at.the court observed that permitting woodbury to sue in tort under state law would defeat the policy of giving government contracts uniform interpretation and application under federal law,see id.at,and would defeat the policy of construing the entire statutory system of remedies against the government to make a workable,consistent and equitable whole,id.at quoting feres united states.because woodbury claim was essentially one for breach of contract,it had to be brought under the tucker act.see id.
the fifth circuit followed woodbury in blanchard paul fire marine insurance,cir.blanchard sued the government under the ftca on a claim that the government had negligently and tortiously interfered with his company performance of a contract to construct dormitories on a military base.see id.at.the alleged tortious acts included insisting on installation of certain materials in the latrines and requiring that metal lockers be installed in a certain way.see id.the fifth circuit held that the claim should have been brought under the tucker act.it observed that the sole relationship between blanchard and the united states was wholly contractual in character and that his claims relate d exclusively to the manner in which various government officials performed their responsibilities with respect to the execution of the contract.id.at.agreeing with woodbury,it said that i t is settled that claims founded upon an alleged failure to perform explicit or implicit contractual obligations are not deemed tort claims for the purposes of the division between tort claims act and tucker act jurisdiction.id.at.
similarly,the second circuit cited woodbury with approval in putnam mills,at.the plaintiff supplied nylon to a manufacturer of parachutes for the government.the manufacturer obtained a loan from the small business administration sba,and the plaintiff alleged that the sba had agreed to hold the loan funds in escrow to guarantee payment to the plaintiff in case the manufacturer defaulted.when the plaintiff was not paid,it sued under the ftca to have the sba declared escrowee of the loan proceeds to the extent of the amount owed the plaintiff and to have the sba pay the plaintiff the balance owed it.see id.the court,citing woodbury,concluded that the plaintiff could not circumvent the tucker act by characterizing its cause of action which might well entitle it to recovery in contract as one for prima facie tort.id.
the federal circuit is in accord.the plaintiff in wood united states,attended an auction of airplanes forfeited to the government.the auctioneers,who were agents of the government,assured the plaintiff that two of the airplanes had faa airworthiness certificates.see id.at.he won the bid on one of the planes and was assigned the winning bid on the other,but an airworthiness certificate was not provided for either plane.the plaintiff sued the government in federal district court,alleging,in addition to several contract claims,tort claims under the ftca for negligence,conversion,and replevin.the district court,relying on the tucker act,found jurisdiction lacking and transferred the case to the united states claims court the prior name of the court of federal claims,see delay gordon,cir.see id.at.on appeal from the district court,the federal circuit affirmed,noting that the tort claims arise from the same facts as the contractual claims and in fact,are mere surplusage,and that the primary thrust of the plaintiff claim was breach of contract.id.at.it adopted from woodbury the proposition that if a claim is essentially for breach of a contractual undertaking,and the liability,if any,depends wholly on the government alleged promise,the action must be under the tucker act,and can not be under the federal tort claims act.id.quoting woodbury,at.
more recently,the federal circuit took the same approach in awad united states.the plaintiff reached an oral agreement with the attorney to testify against a terrorist in exchange for citizenship and a u.passport.under the agreement the plaintiff gave up his passport and entered a program.after testifying,the plaintiff was unable to get his old passport back,and he obtained citizenship only later and largely through his own efforts.id.at.he sued in federal district court for breach of contract and on a number of tort causes of action,including false imprisonment because he could not leave the united states without his old
