presiding justice harold clarke of the georgia supreme court observed that t he law gives the towing company a great advantage over the owner of the towed car,and creates a great potential for unfair business practices and abuse of the public.porter city of atlanta.while that observation was made years ago and some miles away,justice clarke was talking about patrick servantes servantes,who over a period of years committed myriad unfair business practices and abused the public,towing hundreds of cars off private property in abject disregard of applicable california law and san francisco regulations.such practices included towing vehicles without a permit,towing vehicles from private property without authorization from the property owners,refusing to accept credit cards as payment for towing and storage charges to allow release of the vehicle,and imposing excessive towing and storage charges.
the city attorney of san francisco brought suit to curtail servantes practices,alleging a claim for unfair business practices bus,et and seeking a permanent injunction,civil penalties,and disgorgment of profits.prior to trial the city attorney obtained a preliminary injunction ordering servantes to refrain from such conduct.
following a trial at which the city attorney presented witnesses,the trial court found that servantes had committed hundreds of violations of state and local laws and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of,representing for each of the illegal tows,and further ordered him to disgorge his illegal profits of as restitution to the victims.the court also found that servantes had violated the preliminary injunction times,for which the court assessed an additional penalty of,calculated at for each violation.finally,the court permanently enjoined servantes from towing vehicles from private property within the state of california and imposed restrictions on consensual towing by servantes.
servantes appeals,asserting three arguments,one with two subparts federal law preempts the laws on which the trial court relied the judgment and fines a violate due process and b are not supported by substantial evidence and the injunction is void.we conclude that none of servantes claims has merit,and we affirm the judgment.
i.the regulatory scheme 
we begin our analysis with the pertinent regulatory scheme,starting with vehicle code section,by which the california legislature has undertaken to regulate the removal of vehicles from private property by a towing service that section provides,among other things,that the property owner must first notify the police,subd.a and that the towing company must have written authorization from the property owner or agent,who must be present at the time of the tow subd.l.section also provides that the towing company may not impose excessive charges for towing and storage subd.i,and requires that the owner of the storage facility to which the vehicle is towed accept a bank credit card or cash for the towing and storage charges subd.k 
the legislature has also delegated to local authorities the power to regulate the licensing and operation of towing services and tow truck drivers,subd.g.pursuant to that authority,the city and county of san francisco city has enacted ordinances which require towing companies and tow truck drivers to obtain a permit before removing vehicles from private property.police code.the permit scheme requires an application to the chief of police,payment of an application fee,and an investigation and hearing.police code.the ordinance requires the towing companies to notify the police tow desk within minutes of every vehicle removed from private property,providing the tow truck driver name and permit number and identification of the vehicle.police code.the ordinance further requires the towing companies to maintain records of each towed vehicle and to retain those records for three years.police code.another city ordinance requires towing companies removing vehicles from private property to prominently display a copy of their schedule of fees,prohibits charging excess fees,and requires acceptance of credit cards,cash,or checks for release of towed vehicles traffic code.
ii.servantes conduct 
servantes first became involved in towing in or and opened his own company,bayshore towing bayshore,in.on september,servantes was issued a tow operator permit from the city.within months,specifically in june,that permit was revoked based on findings that servantes had illegally removed vehicles from public streets and then reported them as private property tows,illegally demanded payment in cash,and charged excessive amounts to release the vehicles.
in april servantes applied for a new permit as a tow operator and owner of bayshore,but his application was denied based on his prior misconduct.however,bayshore was subsequently issued a permit when servantes reported that a new general manager,allen lawson,had taken over the company.later,in,lawson notified the police permit division that he was no longer associated with bayshore,and he surrendered his towing permit.
after that development,servantes and other bayshore drivers were stopped several times by the police and cited for towing vehicles without a permit and for driving without a valid driver license.servantes applied for a new permit,and in july the application was denied on the ground that servantes had continued to operate his towing business despite his lack of a permit by using false identification.the hearing officer further found that servantes had refused to accept credit card payments,overcharged for towing and storage,and towed vehicles onto public streets before towing them to his storage facility.
in the meantime,police investigations were undertaken of servantes and his towing operations based on numerous citizen complaints,which investigation eventually led to the police determination that servantes was conducting an unlicensed towing operation as part of the investigation,the police conducted a stakeout operation by placing a car in a private parking lot from which bayshore had been towing vehicles.within minutes,when no attendant was at the lot,servantes picked up the car and towed it to his storage lot.
at trial,the logs from the city police tow desk dated from january,to june,were introduced and showed that servantes was continuing to tow vehicles from private property despite the revocation of his permit.during that time bayshore had conducted tows,of which were reported as having been conducted by ernesto dealba,martin sexton,or allen lawson,at times when these drivers were not working for bayshore.as to this,the trial court found that servantes himself had conducted the tows and had falsely given another driver name.
during discovery servantes was asked to produce his business records including the written authorizations for towed vehicles,but he produced almost nothing.the trial court found that the few authorizations that were produced were inadequate in that they were missing vital information,such as the date of the tow,the vehicle license number,or the identity of the bayshore driver who did the tow.three police investigators testified at trial that in the course of their investigations they could find no evidence that written authorizations had been given for bayshore tows,illustrated,for example,by the fact that the space on the towing receipt form for the signature of the property owner was always left blank.
in addition,there was direct evidence of noncompliance with the law.one parking lot owner testified that he had contracted with servantes to have bayshore remove vehicles from his lot,but that many of the tows were unauthorized.another parking lot owner reported to the police investigators that she left the towing decisions to servantes.three vehicle owners who had returned to the parking lots just as their cars were being hooked up to the bayshore tow truck testified that no agent of the lot owner was present at the time.two vehicle owners testified that they contacted the lot owner after their cars were towed,and the lot owner agent was surprised the car had been towed.
the trial court further found that in all cases servantes had insisted on cash payment from the vehicle owners,refusing to accept credit cards or personal checks.luis jacques,a driver for bayshore,gave testimony that bayshore accepted only cash.none of the towing receipts produced by servantes indicated payment by credit card.during the police investigation,questionnaires were sent to all owners of vehicles towed by bayshore,and all who responded reported that bayshore accepted only cash.although servantes testified he did accept credit cards,he also testified that he kept no receipts of credit card transactions.servantes credit card account statements showed virtually no activity from to,and the little activity reflected was for an average charge in an amount less than the charge for a private property tow.eleven victims testified at trial that they were told by bayshore representatives that they had to pay in cash in order to retrieve their vehicles.
iii.federal preemption 
an unlawful business practice within the meaning of california unfair competition law bus,et is one that is forbidden by law,whether civil or criminal,federal,state,or municipal,statutory,regulatory,or.hewlett squaw valley ski th,d saunders superior court th,d.a defense to the underlying offense is a defense under california unfair competition law.people diagnostic laboratory,th,d.
here,servantes did not dispute that he operated without a towing permit.his principal defense at trial was that the state and local regulations governing towing operations are preempted by federal law and were thus unenforceable.the trial court rejected the argument,and servantes reiterates his argument on appeal.we review the issue de novo as an issue of law.southern cal.gas occupational safety health appeals bd.th,d.
congress enacted the federal aviation administration authorization act of faaa act,which expressly preempts state or local regulation related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.c.this preemption of state and local regulation had two apparent purposes first,to provide deregulation and eliminate nonuniform state regulations of motor carriers that were interfering with interstate commerce and second,to eliminate the advantage that had been enjoyed by air carriers,such as federal express,over the more heavily regulated shipping competitors.californians for safe dump truck transp.mendonca cir.
there seems little question that a towing company qualifies as a motor carrier,which is broadly defined as a person providing motor vehicle transportation for compensation.indeed,congress intent to include towing companies within the preemption clause is revealed in section c c,which provides a limited exception to allow state and local regulation of the price of nonconsensual towing services there would have been no need for congress to include this exception if congress had not intended to preempt state and local regulation of towing services generally.mayer of atlanta,city of atlanta cir,mayer see also ace auto body towing,city of new york cir,ace hott city of san jose d harris cty.wrecker owners city of houston.
under the faaa act,a state or local regulation is preempted if it is related to the price,route,or service of a motor carrier.the united states supreme court has interpreted analogous language in the airline deregulation act b to mean that a state or local law is preempted if it has a connection with,or reference to airline rates,routes,or services,but not if the effect is too tenuous,remote,or peripheral.morales trans world airlines,d see ace auto body towing,city of new york,supra,at californians for safe dump truck transp.mendonca,supra,at.two federal appellate courts have considered this language in the context of towing services and have reached parallel conclusions the general rule of preemption does apply to the towing laws in issue 
the first case is mayer of atlanta,city of atlanta,supra,where the eleventh circuit court of appeals held that atlanta licensing scheme for towing companies was related to the service of a towing company and was thereby preempted because the ordinances limit who is permitted to provide the services and require that individuals and companies satisfy various criteria before they provide the services.id.at see also harris cty.wrecker owners city of houston,supra.at.the second case is tocher city of santa ana cir tocher,in which the ninth circuit recently concluded that santa ana permit scheme had a direct effect on the towing market,as the permit scheme erects barriers to entry and these barriers can affect competition for towing services in the city.citation.the more applicants that are denied permits,the greater the effect on both the industry and its customers.id.at.furthermore,the tocher court held that the california vehicle code sections regulating the removal of vehicles from private property are related to a price,route,or service of a motor carrier in that the statutory provisions regulate how a company provides towing services.tocher city of santa ana,supra,at.we are persuaded by those authorities that vehicle code section and the san francisco ordinances related to towing operations are sufficiently connected to the service of a towing company that those laws fall within the general rule of preemption.but that does not end the inquiry.
the faaa act makes an explicit exception from the general rule of preemption for laws enacted pursuant to the safety regulatory authority of a state with respect to motor vehicles c a.in tocher,the court concluded that some sections of the california vehicle code at issue there escaped preemption under this safety regulation exception vehicle code section prohibits a police officer or other unauthorized person from removing any unattended vehicle from a highway without strict compliance with the vehicle code.vehicle code section requires a towing company to notify a property owner if it was necessary to cut,remove,or damage a fence in order to remove a vehicle.each of these provisions is designed to make the towing and removal of vehicles safer by insuring that only professionals tow vehicles and that the removal does not endanger the general public or the owner of the property where the vehicle was removed.tocher city of santa ana,supra,at.however,as to other sections of the vehicle code in issue in tocher,which included vehicle code section,subdivisions k and l,pertaining to acceptance of credit cards and written authorization by the property owner,the court concluded,without discussion,that those provisions were based on consumer protection rather than safety,and the safety exception is therefore inapplicable.tocher city of santa ana,supra,at.we conclude otherwise.
preliminarily we note,as we recently confirmed,that we are not bound by a federal circuit court opinion.roskind morgan stanley dean witter th,d.in the absence of a controlling united states supreme court decision on a federal question,we are free to make an independent determination of law.tully world savings loan th,d.an opinion from the ninth circuit is no more significant than one from another circuit.alicia county of los angeles d.debtor reorganizers,state bd.of equalization d.in the present case,we decline to follow the tocher court with respect to vehicle code section.
as noted,vehicle code section requires the owner of private property to notify the police before causing a vehicle to be towed and requires the towing company to obtain the written authorization of the property owner subds.a l it also requires that the storage facility accept a credit card for payment of the towing and storage charges subd.k.in our view,this statute offers far more than economic protection to the consumer.by ensuring that removal occurs only upon proper authorization,the statute obviously serves to protect vehicle owners and the public at large from both towing mistakes and outright theft of vehicles from private property.and by the requirement that the tow operator accept credit cards,the statute expedites recovery of the involuntarily towed vehicle.thus,we disagree with tocher that vehicle code section is merely a consumer protection statu
