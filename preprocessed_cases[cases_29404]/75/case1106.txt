the trial court enjoined the state department of transportation caltrans from removing an obstruction plaintiff william jamison placed against a ditch culvert within a state highway without an encroachment permit.the trial court erred in granting the injunction,as no evidence supported an exception to the statutory bar prohibiting injunctions that prevent the execution of a public statute by public officers for public purposes.we reverse.
plaintiff owns large parcels of land near sierraville in sierra county.this land is commonly referred to as alpers ranch.plaintiff grazes cattle on the land for about seven months each year.
state route sr runs across a acre parcel of plaintiff land in a direction.sr has been a public in the sierraville area for over years.sts.hy.code.caltrans controls and maintains the sr public by authority of prescriptive easements.the easements encompass the width of land between existing fences.plaintiff owns the underlying fee he purchased alpers ranch subject to the highway easements.
improvements within the sr include the highway,ditches that parallel both sides of the highway,and culverts that connect the ditches both underneath the highway and within the ditches.the ditches and culverts direct water away from the highway to prevent water from flooding and damaging it.in this area of sr,water in the parallel ditches flows from the southwest to the northeast.
lemon creek flows from the southeast to the northwest almost perpendicular to sr.it flows underneath sr at mile marker through a culvert.as the water exits the culvert,it can continue either northwest out of the and onto plaintiff land or northeast into the ditch parallel to sr.water in this parallel ditch flows northeast beyond the lemon creek culvert and into and out of another culvert that parallels sr.this ditch and its culvert are within sr.water in this parallel ditch spills onto plaintiff land about mile past the lemon creek culvert.
plaintiff owns rights to all the lemon creek water that runs through the highway culvert.he derives his rights from a judicial decree.he alleges that since he purchased alpers ranch in,he annually uses boards or blocks to stop the flow of water into the parallel ditch culvert.this raises the water level of lemon creek as it exits the sr culvert high enough to flood and irrigate his acre parcel.he alleges this parcel sits at the highest elevation of alpers ranch.he contends that unless he blocks the flow of water at the ditch culvert,his parcel can not be gravity irrigated by water from lemon creek due to its elevation.
in march,plaintiff went into the sr and set his blocks at the mouth of the ditch culvert to block the flow of water into that culvert,raise the water level of lemon creek,and gravity irrigate his property.caltrans removed the obstructions on two separate occasions.
plaintiff sued.he sought injunctive and declaratory relief prohibiting caltrans from interfering with his right to receive water from lemon creek and with his actions to block the ditch culvert to raise the water level.
the trial court issued a preliminary injunction in plaintiff favor.it ruled plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits of his action,and the interim harm he would suffer if the injunction were denied outweighed the harm caltrans would likely suffer if the injunction were issued.the court determined plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits because he was entitled to lemon creek water under the judicial decree,and the decree did not specify where he could divert that water.plaintiff was more likely to suffer harm because his cattle business would be harmed if his land were not gravity irrigated as he had done.the court found it was unlikely that plaintiff actions would cause flooding on sr,and caltrans had not provided evidence of any accidents that had occurred on sr due to plaintiff actions.the court also determined it was maintaining the status quo by issuing the injunction.
the preliminary injunction prohibits caltrans from interfering with plaintiff setting of blocks against the parallel ditch culvert from march until october of each year.the injunction requires plaintiff to remove the blocks if flooding occurs or has the potential of occurring.

discussion 
istandard of review 
the general purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending a determination on the merits of the action.citation.the granting or denial of a preliminary injunction does not amount to an adjudication of the ultimate rights in controversy.it merely determines that the court,balancing the respective equities of the parties,concludes that,pending a trial on the merits,the defendant should or should not be restrained from exercising the right claimed by him or her.citation.sb liberty,llc isla verde,th.
in deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction,a trial court must evaluate two interrelated factors i the likelihood that the party seeking the injunction will ultimately prevail on the merits of his or her claim,and ii the balance of harm presented,the comparative consequences of the issuance and nonissuance of the injunction.citations.common cause board of supervisors cal d,fn.omitted.the trial court determination must be guided by a mix of the and factors the greater the plaintiff showing on one,the less must be shown on the other to support an injunction.citation.butt state of california cal th.however,a trial court may not grant a preliminary injunction,regardless of the balance of interim harm,unless there is some possibility that the plaintiff would ultimately prevail on the merits of the claim.ibid.
ordinarily,appellate review is limited to whether the trial court abused its discretion in evaluating the foregoing factors.citizens to save california california fair political practices com.th.occasionally,however,the likelihood of prevailing on the merits depends upon a question of pure law rather than upon the evidence to be introduced at a subsequent full trial.this issue can arise,for example,when it is contended that an ordinance or statute is unconstitutional on its face and that no factual controversy remains to be tried.if such a question of pure law is presented,it can sometimes be determinative over the other factor,for example,when the defendant shows that the plaintiff interpretation is wrong as a matter of law and thus the plaintiff has no possibility of success on the merits.citations.hunter city of whittier d,see,king meese cal d.of course,such questions of law are subject to de novo review.sahlolbei providence healthcare,th.law school admission council,state th.
likelihood of success on the merits 
caltrans contends the trial court erred in granting the preliminary injunction because plaintiff is not likely to succeed on the merits.we agree.as a matter of law,plaintiff can not show he was entitled to an injunction against caltrans performance of its statutory duty to control any encroachment upon a state highway.
