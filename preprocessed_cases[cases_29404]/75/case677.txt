michael mcenry mcenry was convicted,on a plea of guilty,of serving as an airman without an airman certificate,in violation of b.he appeals from his sentence on the ground that the district court procedurally erred by sentencing him pursuant to,rather than.we have jurisdiction under and,and we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.
on january,mcenry landed a cessna aircraft at the eastern sierra regional airport in bishop,california.the circumstances of his landing were unusual he did not communicate with the airport by radio during his approach and landing,and he touched down significantly farther along the runway than would be the case on a normal landing.when the plane did land,it overran the runway.mcenry behavior on getting out of the plane was also unusual.he tied the plane down at its two wings,but neglected to tie down the tail,as one would normally do.he did not walk purposefully toward the terminal,but wandered about before approaching it.on arriving at the terminal,he asked where he was and claimed that he had flown through military airspace,during which time military aircraft flew alongside him and fired flares.someone at the airport called the police,reporting that mcenry might have been under the influence while flying 
at the time mcenry landed,another aircraft had been scheduled to take off,but the pilot delayed his launch because he saw mcenry plane coming in before he began his.on investigating mcenry,the federal aviation administration faa determined that he had no airman certificate,a pilot license.he had been issued a student pilot certificate in,which expired months after its issuance the faa also determined that the aircraft had not had a required annual inspection since october and had a number of mechanical problems,leading it to conclude that the plane should not be flown.before the plane was ultimately flown out of eastern sierra regional airport,the faa required some bare minimum maintenance that gave the faa agent some comfort in saying you okay to take this flight to a place where all the rest of the repairs could be done.an faa agent testified that there was a lot that needed to be done to make mcenry plane airworthy.
mcenry was charged with violating b,which prohibits knowingly and willfully serving or attempting to serve as an airman without an airman certificate authorizing such service and c,which provides for a higher statutory maximum if the violation is related to transporting a controlled substance by aircraft or aiding or facilitating certain controlled substance violations.he pled guilty,without a plea agreement,to violating b after the government agreed to move to dismiss the c charge however,the government reserved its right to present its evidence with regard to controlled substances at sentencing 
no sentencing guideline expressly applies to mcenry crime of conviction.b app x accordingly,the guidelines specify that the district court must apply the most analogous offense guideline or,i f there is not a sufficiently analogous guideline,sentence the defendant pursuant to.the probation officer recommended that the court apply a a,the guideline for interference with a flight crew member or interference with the dispatch,navigation,operation,or maintenance of a mass transportation vehicle,where the offense involved recklessly endangering the safety of an airport or aircraft.under this guideline,mcenry base offense level was.the government argued that this was the correct guideline,because the offense involved recklessly endangering the safety of an aircraft.mcenry contended that i t is questionable whether any guideline is sufficiently analogous,and argued that four other guidelines,including b,were more analogous to his offense.section provides for a base offense level of.section b establishes an enhancement for reckless risk of death or serious bodily injury this enhancement would raise mcenry offense level to.
following an evidentiary hearing,the court concluded that although a was not that suitable and not that analogous really,it was the only guideline that is particularly close in terms of conduct.the court gave mcenry a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility and found him to be in criminal history category determining that given the overall totality of the circumstances a sentence in the middle of the guidelines is a fair sentence and appropriate,the court sentenced mcenry to a month term of imprisonment.this appeal followed.
we review de novo the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines,and review the district court findings of fact for clear error.united states laurienti,cir 
the sole question in dispute is which section of the sentencing guidelines applies to mcenry offense,knowingly and willfully serv ing as an airman without an airman certificate authorizing him to serve in that capacity when the aircraft is not used to provide air transportation.b.the district court applied,which applies,inter alia,to interference with air navigation,interference with airport security screening personnel,and interference with flight crew members and attendants.the government contends that this was the correct provision.mcenry contends that the appropriate provision is,a general fraud and deceit guideline,which applies,inter alia,to knowingly and willfully serv ing as an airman operating an aircraft in air transportation without an airman certificate authorizing the individual to serve in that capacity.a.
it is undisputed that no guideline directly applies to the offense of conviction in this case.thus,it is also undisputed that the sentencing court must,under apply the most analogous offense guideline if one exists or,i f there is not a sufficiently analogous guideline,sentence the defendant pursuant to the core of the parties dispute is how a district court should determine which guideline is the most analogous offense guideline under.under our standard of review,this interpretive question is properly reviewed de novo.
although we have not previously had the occasion to consider in depth,we have addressed the broader question of how a district court must proceed in selecting an appropriate guideline.when deciding which guideline to apply,a district court must determine the guideline section in chapter two offense conduct applicable to the offense of conviction,the offense conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was convicted.a.to do this,the court is to refer to the statutory index,appendix a of the guidelines,to find the offense of conviction,or,if the offense is not listed in the statutory index,apply to find the most analogous guideline.id.applying the language quoted above,we have previously emphasized that it is not the defendant underlying relevant conduct,but the crime of conviction,that governs the selection of the appropriate guideline section.thus,in united states lawton,cir,superseded in part on other grounds,app x para,as recognized in united states barragan espinoza,cir,we noted that a district court may not use relevant conduct to select whatever guideline it wants relevant conduct may be considered only in the application of enhancements and adjustments once a guideline has been selected.
the court developed this line of reasoning in united states takahashi,cir,and united states crawford,cir.in crawford,multiple guidelines appeared to fit the circumstances of the defendant crime.the defendant was convicted of violating a,which is generally punished under.at see app x a.the selection of a guideline was complicated,however,by evidence that the defendant committed the crime within feet of a school,which,if charged under,would result in the defendant being sentenced under.crawford,at.although crawford plea agreement provided for dismissal of all counts charging the school proximity element,the district court nonetheless applied the latter guideline.id.we reversed,concluding that a admonition that the court d etermine the offense guideline section in chapter two offense conduct most applicable to the offense of conviction,the offense conduct charged in the count of the indictment of which the defendant was convicted generally requires selecting the guideline specific to the statute of conviction from the statutory index of the guidelines.crawford,at alterations in original quoting u.only after the correct chapter two guideline had been selected was the district court to select the appropriate base offense level and,after that,make the adjustments within that guideline section.id.because only was listed in the statutory table as an appropriate guideline for.a,that guideline was presumptively the guideline most applicable to the offense of conviction other relevant conduct could be considered only in ascertaining which adjustments to apply within the guideline section.id.at quoting a.
takahashi involved facts similar to crawford,but with one key distinction.in crawford,the defendant had been indicted on four counts,which were later dismissed,charging distribution of cocaine base within feet of a school.id.at.accordingly,there was no count of conviction for which was the appropriate guideline.in takahashi,by contrast,the defendant was convicted of violating,as well as a.see at.under,unlike under a,is listed as one of several appropriate guidelines in the statutory index.id.at.accordingly,we were required to consider the choice between multiple guidelines authorized by the statutory index.
as in crawford,we concluded that use of was improper.id.we noted that the guidelines provide that when more than one guideline section is referenced for the particular statute,courts should use the guideline most appropriate for the nature of the offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted.id.quoting app x a introduction alterations and emphasis in the original we also noted that a district court can not consider relevant but uncharged conduct at this stage of the guidelines process.id.some facts of a given case,however,may be necessary to select the relevant guideline.for example,a court must necessarily consider the object of the conspiracy when determining the nature of the offense conduct for conspiracy.id.quoting crawford,f d at.in takahashi,we looked to the indictment to determine what facts were necessary for the selection of the guideline offense,as opposed to relevant but uncharged conduct,to make that determination.id.we made clear that the factual inquiry at that stage was extremely limited,noting that r elevant conduct may not be used to select a guideline under.relevant conduct may be considered only in the imposition of guidelines enhancements and adjustments,once a guideline has been selected.id.quoting lawton,at.
shortly after we decided crawford and takahashi,the guidelines were amended in light of the issues addressed in those cases.see app x c para.the amendment,which was intended to emphasize that the sentencing court must apply the offense guideline referenced in the statutory index,unless the case fell into a single specified exception,confirmed our interpretation of the interrelationship of a and the statutory index.id.it removed an application note to that provided that in many instances it would be appropriate for the court to consider the actual conduct of the offender,even if such conduct did not constitute an element of the offense.id.amendment also revised the introduction to the statutory appendix and a,removing a sentence suggesting that in atypical cases the defendant offense conduct should be considered in selecting a guideline section from the former,and a sentence indicating that the statutory index merely assist s in the determination of the proper guideline from the latter see compare a app x a introduction with a app x a introduction see also united states johnson,cir t he sentencing guidelines have been amended to clarify that courts should deviate from the offense level provided by appendix a only in cases involving the stipulation exception in a,which does not apply here.footnotes omitted.
the amended guidelines,together with crawford and takahashi,establish the principles which govern the selection of the applicable guideline for a given offense.as relevant here,those principles are that the selection of a guideline is primarily a statutory question,and to the extent the court is required to look to the facts to select a guideline,the court is limited to the conduct charged in the indictment.
these principles necessarily govern the selection of a guideline under.section provides two basic means of selecting a relevant chapter two guideline the statutory index and.a we conclude that the general language interpreted by crawford and takahashi,which precedes the paragraph setting forth these two means,applies to both.not only does the structure of the provision suggest this reading,but the language we interpreted in crawford and takahashi is nearly identical to the language of.compare crawford,at d etermine the offense guideline section in chapter two offense conduct most applicable to the offense of conviction emphasis added quoting a with apply the most analogous offense guideline emphasis added moreover,we have previously looked to in the context.see united states van krieken,cir 
applying these principles to this case,we hold that the district court erred in selecting as the most analogous guideline.in concluding that was the appropriate guideline to apply to mcenry offense,the district court remarked that is directly applicable for the offense,which is operating without the airman certificate.explaining its choice,it noted that does,if you will,raise or track some of the kinds of risks that are raised.thus,the district court based its choice not on the elements of the offense or the facts alleged in the indictment,but on the defendant particular relevant conduct and the risk it created 
considering the statute of conviction and excluding relevant uncharged conduct,by contrast,we conclude that is the correct guideline in this case.mcenry offense is nearly identical to a federal offense that is listed in the statutory index.mcenry was convicted of violating b,which provides that a person shall be imprisoned for not more than years if the person knowingly and willfully serves or attempts to serve in any capacity as an airman without an airman certificate authorizing the individual to serve in that capacity.this section,however,applies only to aircraft not used to provide air transportation.a.another provision governs the same conduct in the context of providing air transportation an individual shall be imprisoned for not more than years if that individual knowingly and willfully serves or attempts to serve in any capacity as an airman operating an aircraft in air transportation without an airman certificate authorizing the individual to serve in that capacity.a.the most analogous offense to knowingly serving as an airman operating an aircraft not used to provide air transportation without an airman certificate is knowingly serving as an airman operating an aircraft that is used to provide air transportation without an airman certificate.united states carrillo hernandez,cir here,the offense most analogous to making false statements to a customs agent in the course of evading export restrictions is the making of false statements to a customs agent in the course of evading import restrictions.
because the statutory index provides that the only guideline section to be applied to violations of a is,see app x a,is also the most analogous offense guideline for b.crawford,at t he statutory index identifies section as the appropriate guideline for violations of section a thus,for crawford,section relating to drug trafficking and not section relating to protected locations or individuals is presumptively the guideline most applicable to the offense of conviction.quoting a.
united states fisher,cir,cited by the government,is not to the contrary.although fisher notes that t he most analogous offense will vary depending on the circumstances of a particular case,it addresses a different context from the present one.id.at.as a catchall provision,can apply in situations other than the initial selection of a chapter two guideline,a situation that is governed by crawford and takahashi.for example,it also
