on july,a burlington northern and santa fe railway company bnsf train derailed en route to long beach,california from chicago,illinois.the derailment resulted in extensive damage to cargo,including a containerized shipment of two engines owned by caterpillar,caterpillar.this case concerns bnsf right to limit its liability to for the loss and damage to the engines pursuant to the contracts governing the shipment.
background 
the shipment originated at caterpillar facility in morton,illinois and was destined for a caterpillar affiliate in singapore.caterpillar booked the entire shipment with danzas aei danzas,a freight forwarder.danzas,in turn,engaged g d transportation to carry the cargo from morton to chicago by truck and hapag lloyd container linie,gmbh hapag lloyd to ship the cargo from chicago to singapore,via long beach.hapag lloyd then hired matson intermodal systems matson to arrange the cargo shipment from chicago to long beach.matson contracted with bnsf to carry the cargo by rail from chicago to long beach.due to the derailment,the container carrying the two engines never reached long beach.
american home assurance company american home,as subrogee of caterpillar,brought this action against danzas,hapag lloyd,matson,and bnsf seeking to recover for the total loss of the engines.bnsf claimed,as an affirmative defense,that it was entitled to limit its liability under either its contract with matson or the express cargo bill ecb,the bill of lading pursuant to which hapag lloyd agreed to ship the engines from chicago to singapore.american home and bnsf filed competing motions for partial summary judgment concerning bnsf right to limit its liability.the district court granted bnsf motion for partial summary judgment,concluding that the agreement limits the rail carrier liability to per package.in doing so,the district court determined that it need not consider the limitation provision in the ecb,as that limit bnsf liability to the same amount.thereafter,the parties,without waiving their rights of appeal,consented to the entry of a final judgment against hapag lloyd and bnsf jointly and severally in the amount of,per engine for the reasons stated below,we conclude that the ecb limits bnsf liability to the same amount and affirm the judgment of the district court.

b.the agreement 
by incorporating the bnsf intermodal rules and policies guide,the agreement provides 
if a shipment moves under the terms of a through intermodal ocean bill of lading with bnsf as a participating rail carrier,the liability of bnsf will be no greater than the liability of the ocean carrier issuing the bill of lading.
clause of the ecb,in turn,limits hapag lloyd liability 
w here the carriage is to or from a port or final destination in the united states,the carrier limitation of liability in respect of the goods shall not exceed per package 
the district court concluded that these two provisions were applicable and operated together to limit bnsf liability to per package.in so holding,the district court made four determinations the ecb constitutes a through bill of lading the ecb had been issued insofar as it governed the rights of the parties caterpillar is bound by the ecb and the bnsf train originated at a was headed to a the united states.
on appeal,american home raises two points of error with respect to the district court factual determinations.first,american home contends that the district court improperly conflated two distinct concepts whether the ecb had been issued and whether its terms,nonetheless,governed the parties.american home concedes the terms of the ecb,but argues that the ecb had to have been issued in order for the agreement to limit bnsf liability to that of hapag lloyd.second,american home contends that the district court erroneously divided the shipment into two separate inland by rail and another overseas by ship.according to american home,clause of the ecb is inapplicable,because,when properly viewed as a single carriage from morton to singapore,the shipment was not to or from a port or final destination in the united states.we need not address these contentions,however,because bnsf is entitled to the same per package limitation pursuant to a separate provision of the ecb.
while the ecb contains several provisions,such as clause,related to hapag lloyd liability as the carrier,the parties agree that it also contains a himalaya clause at clause extending the application of the carriage of goods by sea act,stat.et.cogsa including its per package limitation on liability,see id.to certain downstream parties expected to take part in the shipment before the goods are loaded on and after they are discharged from hapag lloyd ship the himalaya clause states in relevant part 
the provisions set forth in cogsa shall except as may be otherwise specifically provided herein also govern before the goods are loaded on and after they are discharged from the vessel provided,however,that the goods at said time are in the actual custody of the carrier or any.
the sole factual point in dispute with respect to the applicability of the himalaya clause to bnsf on appeal is whether the rail carrier is a within the meaning of the ecb.in considering the issue,we are mindful of the supreme court recent admonition that there is no special rule for interpreting himalaya clauses.kirby,at.in other words,they must be construed like any other contracts by their terms and consistent with the intent of the parties.id.
the ecb defines s as 
o wners and operators of vessels other than the carrier,underlying carriers,stevedores,terminal and groupage operators,road and rail transport operators and any independent contractors employed by the carrier in the performance of the carriage.
american home concedes,as it must,that bnsf is an underlying carrier but contends that bnsf is not a,because it was employed by matson not hapag lloyd.therefore,american home argues that bnsf is a of hapag lloyd and,as such,is not entitled to cogsa per package l
