facts and prior proceedings 
emergency rule sfar 
the faa issued sfar as an emergency rule in september.air tour operators in the state of hawaii,codified at pts.the faa cited an escalation of air tour accidents as the reason for the rule,and stated that t he regulation is intended to enhance the safety of air tour operations within the state.id.accident data for the period between and,a time of substantial industry growth,established that there were eight air tour accidents in hawaii which resulted in a total of fatalities.for the period from july through july,the agency reported that the accident rate jumped to twenty air tour accidents with fatalities.id.at.
the faa was concerned about the substantial increase in the accident rate and the risks associated with air tours in hawaii sfar imposes special operating rules for airplane and helicopter air tours.section of the regulation requires operators who venture off shore to either use amphibious helicopters or helicopters equipped with floats or they must require passengers to wear approved flotation gear.id.at.section requires operators to file a helicopter performance plan before each air tour flight.section mandates that air tour operators maintain appropriate height and forward speed to allow the safe landing of helicopters in the event of an engine failure.id.at.
section imposes a minimum flight altitude of feet above ground level for all aircraft,and requires operators to maintain a standoff distance of feet from any person or property except when necessary for takeoff and landing,air traffic control compliance,or as otherwise authorized by the faa.section requires air tour operators to brief passengers on water ditching procedures,use of required flotation equipment,and emergency egress from the aircraft in the event of a water landing.id.the emergency rule became effective on october,and the public comment period ended on december.
the hawaii helicopter operators association hhoa promptly petitioned this court to challenge the validity of the emergency rule on the ground that it was issued in violation of the administrative procedure act apa notice and comment provision,c.in a published opinion,we held that the faa had properly invoked the good cause exception to c,and we rejected hhoa claim that the minimum altitude requirement in sfar was arbitrary and capricious.hawaii helicopter operators ass faa,cir 
interim rule sfar 
the faa extended sfar as an interim rule on october,with the stated goal of ensur ing that regulatory requirements for the safe operation of air tours in the airspace over the state of hawaii remain in effect.air tour operators in the state of hawaii,codified at pts.the faa also published a discussion of some of the more than public comments it received from entities including the ntsb,air tour operators,helicopter associations,and environmental groups.id.at.
many comments were critical of the minimum flight altitude requirement,including the concern that the requirement does not account for cloud cover and weather conditions in hawaii which affect visibility and may compromise a pilot ability to maintain the required distance from clouds.several commenters,including the hhoa,also warned that the minimum altitude requirement will cause air tour traffic to be concentrated at the same altitude,thereby increasing the risk of collisions and decreasing overall air safety.the ntsb expressed the concern that the altitude requirement may lead to increased operating time over water,difficulties in regulatory enforcement,and possible disregard of the faa regulation.
the faa agreed that the minimum operating altitude requirement was o ne of the most contentious aspects of sfar,but noted that after working closely with air tour operators,it had mitigated the problem by allowing selected deviations on a basis.id.at.since,the faa has granted deviations to the majority of air tour operators in hawaii.for instance,air tour operators of helicopters have been granted deviations to conduct air tours at a minimum of feet.these deviations are,and are only allowed over areas of raw terrain,areas devoid of persons,vehicles.safety is not compromised,the faa asserts,because of additional safety measures,including careful faa screening of operators before they are granted a deviation.id.
in response to comments regarding costs associated with complying with sfar,the faa states that it believes that the sfar has not had a direct impact on the viability of the air tour industry in hawaii.by granting deviations,the faa contends,it has mitigated the costs of the sfar and ensured that commercially viable air tours are still available to the public.finally,in response to comments that the faa promulgation of sfar was a response to residents complaints about noise pollution,the faa reiterates its strong statement that safety was the reason the agency promulgated the rule.
final rule sfar 
the faa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm on august,indicating an intent to extend interim rule sfar for another three years and soliciting comments on the extension of sfar as a final rule.air tour operators in the state of hawaii,codified at pts.in this nprm,the faa explained that the extension was necessary to provide additional time for the agency to issue an nprm regarding a national rule that would apply to all air tour operators.id.the deadline for comments on the proposed extension was september.
safari mailed its comments regarding the proposed extension of sfar on september,and the faa received them on september.in its statement,safari contended that the imprudent and unjustified specifications within sfar have claimed the lives of thirteen person sic in two fatal helicopter accidents the document goes on to detail how the foot minimum altitude requirement may have played a factor in two recent air tour helicopter accidents.
the faa nonetheless issued the final rule extending sfar for another three years on september.air tour operators in the state of hawaii,codified at pts.the faa again indicated its intent,in the near future,to promulgate a national rule to apply to all air tour operators,at which time sfar would be rescinded.id.in its discussion of the comments regarding the extension of sfar,the faa indicated that it had received four comments,all of which supported the extension.regarding the nprm published on august,the faa reported having received only one adverse comment,from blue hawaiian helicopters.this comment indicated that some air tour pilots believe the altitude restrictions may have contributed to the three accidents that have occurred since the sfar was adopted in.id.the faa did not review safari comments before issuing the final rule extending sfar.
the faa justified its promulgation of emergency final rule sfar on the grounds that a large number of accidents occurred in hawaii between and that the interim and final versions of sfar were needed to ensure the safety of all air tour operations in hawaii and that the forthcoming national air tour safety rule would soon replace sfar.as to the cause of the three accidents referenced by blue hawaiian,the faa declined to respond on
