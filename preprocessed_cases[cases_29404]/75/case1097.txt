statutory law allows a city to install at an intersection an automated traffic enforcement device that photographs a traffic law offender,who is then issued a citation,as was defendant,who went through a red light in culver city and was later convicted of violating the red light traffic law,subd.a all further undesignated statutory references are to the vehicle code.operation of such a device must be preceded by a public announcement and an initial day period during which warnings are given instead of citations,subd.b,hereafter section b.at issue here is whether those statutory requirements pertain only to the city first installation of an automated traffic enforcement device within a city,or,as defendant argues,also to each later installation of such devices at different intersections within the city.
defendant view finds support in the overall statutory scheme involving automated traffic enforcement.thus,unlike the court of appeal,we conclude that the public announcement and warning requirements apply to each installation of such a device.we nevertheless affirm the court of appeal,which upheld defendant conviction,because,like that court,we reject defendant argument that compliance with the statute requirement of a day period of warning notices is a precondition to issuing a valid citation for a red light traffic law violation.
in,the city of culver city the city installed its first automated traffic enforcement device,at the intersection of washington boulevard and la cienega boulevard,under the authority of section subdivision a.for convenience,we will refer to such devices as red light cameras,as that is the term used in popular discourse.in compliance with section b,the city made a public announcement concerning its initial red light camera,and it gave violators warning notices,instead of citations,for the first days that the camera was operational.thereafter,the city installed red light cameras at several other intersections without making new public announcements,and without giving violators warning notices,instead of citations,for the first days that a camera was operational at a new intersection.
in june,the city installed a red light camera at the intersection of washington boulevard and helms avenue,without a public announcement and without an initial day period of warning notices.more than two years later,in november,that camera photographed a car registered to defendant steven edward gray driving through a red traffic light,and a citation was issued,subd.a.
defendant pled not guilty and sought dismissal,asserting that the city had failed to comply with section b requirements of a public announcement and a day period of warning notices with respect to the camera that recorded his traffic violation.the trial court denied defendant motion to dismiss,ruling that the statutory requirements pertained only to a city first installation of a red light camera and not to later installations at different intersections.
at trial,defendant stipulated that he was the driver depicted in the photographic evidence recorded by the red light camera.in addition,the police officer in charge of the city red light camera enforcement program testified about the installation,functioning,operation,and maintenance of the device.
the trial court found defendant guilty of the charge of not stopping for a red light,subd.a and ordered him to pay a fine.defendant appealed to the appellate division of the los angeles county superior court,which upheld the trial court decision.the appellate division expressly disagreed with people park th supp,which held that a public announcement and day period of warning notices were required for each installation of a red light camera.
the court of appeal ordered the case transferred to itself.see code civ,cal.rules of court,rule.it then affirmed the decision of the superior court appellate division.we granted defendant petition for review.
section b provides prior to issuing citations under this section,a local jurisdiction utilizing an automated traffic enforcement system shall commence a program to issue only warning notices for days.the local jurisdiction shall also make a public announcement of the automated traffic enforcement system at least days prior to the commencement of the enforcement program.italics added.defendant here argues that a red light camera at any intersection is,by itself,a system because the equipment is capable of operating independently.therefore,he asserts,a new public announcement and day period of warning notices are required for each new intersection equipped with red light cameras.the city responds that the word system in section b refers to the entire citywide red light camera enforcement program.thus,the city argues,the statute requirements of a public announcement and a day period of warning notices apply only when the first red light camera was made operational at some intersection within the city boundary.as we noted earlier,a red light camera was first installed in the city in,whereas the camera at issue here was installed in.

section is one of several vehicle code sections that address the use of red light cameras.a look at how the legislature used the word system in those various statutes supports defendant argument here that the word system in section b was intended by the legislature to apply to each new camera installed at an intersection.
for example,subdivision a of section states that t he limit line,the intersection,or a place designated in section may be equipped with an automated traffic enforcement system italics added.as used there,the word system necessarily refers to the specific equipment in operation at a particular intersection,not to the entire citywide red light camera enforcement program.similarly,subdivision a of section requires a city to i dentif y the system by signs posted within feet of an intersection where a system is operating italics added.and that statute subdivision a requires cities to locate the system at an intersection,subd.a,italics added.in addition,section subdivision a imposes on a city certain obligations that apply to an intersection at which there is an automated enforcement system in operation.italics added.finally,subdivision c a of section states that p rior to installing an automated traffic enforcement system after january,the governmental agency shall make and adopt a finding of fact establishing that the system is needed at a specific location for reasons related to safety.italics added.these various statutory examples support defendant argument here that the word system in section b refers to the specific red light camera in operation at a particular intersection.
the city responds by noting that elsewhere in section,the word system appears to have a broader meaning,referring to the entire citywide red light camera enforcement program.as an example,the city points to section subdivision d,which permits cities to contract out operation of the system.the city argues that the legislature was referring to a single contract for the entire city,and therefore system as used in section,subdivision d does not refer mer
