david demay,an employee of the norfolk southern railway company norfolk southern,was injured while working in norfolk,virginia,at the lamberts point coal terminal lamberts point.a missouri resident,demay filed a lawsuit against norfolk southern in missouri state court under the federal employers liability act fela,to.norfolk southern removed the lawsuit to the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri,claiming the action was governed by the longshore and harbor workers compensation act longshore act,to.the district determined that the action was appropriately brought under the fela and remanded the case back to state court.norfolk southern appeals.for the following reasons,we affirm.
lamberts point is a facility that norfolk southern uses to load coal into oceangoing vessels.lamberts point is divided into four areas the ct yard,the barney yard,pier,and the empty yard.arriving loaded coal cars are stored in the ct yard.the loaded cars are then brought into the barney yard and secured by setting their manual brakes.once there,they are released one by one and roll down an incline onto one of two rotary dumpers.the dumpers rotate the cars and dump the coal onto conveyors,which move the coal to pier to be deposited into the holds of oceangoing colliers.once the cars are unloaded,they are moved to the empty yard to return to the coal mines for refilling.
demay,a railroad employed by norfolk southern,lives in huntsville,missouri.on october,he was temporarily working at lamberts point when he was injured.demay crew job was to place,spot the rail cars in the barney yard and set their handbrakes to keep them in place.other workers later would release the cars,sending them down the incline to the rotary dumpers.at the time of the injury,his crew was spotting rail cars loaded with coal in the barney yard.demay climbed onto the lead loaded car and directed the movement of the string of loaded cars into the barney yard while communicating by radio with the locomotive engineer at the other end of the moving cars.when the cars were in their proper place,demay told the engineer to stop the train.while climbing down off the car,demay fell and landed on the track,breaking several ribs.
demay filed a lawsuit in the circuit court of louis county,missouri,to recover for his injuries under the fela.a case filed in state court under the fela may not be removed to federal court by the defendant.see a a civil action in any state court against a railroad arising under to may not be removed to any district court of the united states.however,norfolk southern removed demay suit to federal court,claiming that demay claims are controlled exclusively by the longshore act because demay was engaged in maritime employment at the time of his injury.to be covered by the longshore act,an employee must be injured while working at a maritime situs and in a maritime status.ne.marine terminal,caputo.both parties agree that demay was working at a maritime situs.the district court held that demay was not working in a maritime status,and it found that his injury was covered by the fela,not the longshore act,and it therefore lacked removal jurisdiction to review the claim.the district court thus remanded the case to the state court.
norfolk southern appeals.on appeal,demay argues that we can not review the district court decision because we lack jurisdiction to review the district court order under d,which precludes a court of appeals from reviewing a district court order remanding a case to state court based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction.norfolk southern,however,argues that we have jurisdiction to review the district court order deciding the longshore act issue and the order of remand.it further argues that demay was injured while working in a maritime status and that we should issue a writ of mandamus directing the district court to dismiss the action without prejudice and permit the department of labor dol to resolve demay claim 
we must first address the question of our jurisdiction.congress has limited our power to review district court remand orders.filla norfolk ry,cir.the court ability to review the order depends on the district court basis for remand.a remand order based upon lack of jurisdiction is not reviewable on appeal.id.if a district court order is based upon a lack of jurisdiction,the erroneous or not and whether review is sought by appeal or by extraordinary stand.id.when determining the basis for remand,t his court reviews a lower court reasoning for remand independently and determines from the record the district court basis for remand.id.quoting lindsey dillard,cir.
according to c,i f at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,the case shall be remanded the state court may thereupon proceed with such case.section d states that,a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise in analyzing c and d,the supreme court has explained that they should be read together.see thermtron,hermansdorfer,holding that a remand was reviewable and ultimately improper when the district court remanded to state court based on the district court heavy docket,which was not provided for in c.
when a plaintiff files an fela complaint in state court,a defendant may not remove the lawsuit to federal court.see u.a a civil action in any state court against a railroad arising under to may not be removed to any district court of the united states.evans.pac,cir i f the employee chooses to bring an fela claim in state court,section a protects the plaintiff right to bring the action there and prevents removal to the federal district court by the railroad,cert.denied.after norfolk southern removed the case to federal court,the district court remanded the case to state court because a prohibited removal.
demay argues that because the district court remanded the case to state court based on the prohibition of removal in a,the district court effectively remanded based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction,which would preclude us from reviewing the remand order under c and d.norfolk southern,however,argues that the remand order was merely a straightforward application of a and that in remanding the case to state court,the district court made no determination regarding subject matter jurisdiction.
we have not previously addressed the issue of whether a is jurisdictional.however,we have implicitly held that c,which is parallel to a,is not jurisdictional in bloom metro heart group of louis,cir,a plaintiff filed a complaint against her employer,claiming violations of the family and medical leave act fmla,to,and workers compensation laws.the case was removed to federal court by the employer,and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer on the fmla claim.we affirmed and,in a footnote at the end of our opinion,stated that,in her brief,the plaintiff ask ed in passing that if this court affirms summary judgment on the fmla claim,it remand the workers compensation claim to state court,citing c.the plaintiff waived this argument when she did not timely move for remand in district court,on this ground.bloom,at emphasis added.like bloom,in phillips ford motor,cir,in discussing the procedural history of the case before resolving the merits,we stated that the plaintiff had filed a complaint against the defendants on a workers compensation claim,but that the defendants had removed the case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.we explained that a ctually,the district court lacked removal jurisdiction by operation of c civil action in state court arising under workers compensation laws of that state may not be removed.however,plaintiffs failed to timely move for remand.phillips,at emphasis added citation omitted.if truly involved subject matter jurisdiction,it could not be waived,as parties can not waive subject matter jurisdiction.see united states cotton,explaining that jurisdiction,because it involves a court power to hear a case,can never be forfeited or waived.
while a does involve a different subject matter than c,becaus
