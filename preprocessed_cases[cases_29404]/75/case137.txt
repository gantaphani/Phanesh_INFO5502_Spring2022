the panama county airport and industrial district the sponsor,a entity that owns and operates panama county international airport the panama city airport,proposes to close the existing airport at panama city,florida,and to construct a new airport in western bay county the west bay site.pursuant to the airport and airway improvement act aaia,the sponsor sought and obtained approval for the construction project from the federal aviation administration faa.petitioners natural resources defense council,defenders of wildlife,and friends of pfn collectively,petitioners challenge the faa decision as a violation of the aaia and the national environmental policy act nepa,and they request that this court enjoin the faa from implementing its decision.because the faa decision is not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a,we deny the petition for review and the relief sought therein.
background 
factual.the existing panama city airport 
the existing panama city airport occupies acres on the florida panhandle.the northwest end of the primary runway abuts the open waters of goose bayou,which is part of a system of bays extending inland into bay county.the remainder of the airport is surrounded by roads and commercial and residential development.any expansion of the existing airport,therefore,would entail highways,displacing homes,filling in the bay waters of goose bayou,or some combination thereof.
expansion of the existing airport is necessary to comply with the faa revised runway safety area standards.the runway safety area serves to reduce the risk of injury to passengers and damage to property in the event an aircraft undershoots,overshoots,or deviates from a taxiway or runway,june.by december,all airports receiving federal funding must conform to revised runway safety area standards,see transportation appropriations act,tit.i,stat,by enlarging the safety area to the requisite dimensions,deploying an engineered materials arresting system emas or declaring the runway to be a shorter length,see faa,airport design,advisory circular at,app,available at www.faa.gov follow advisory circulars hyperlink.these faa standards provide that the runway safety area should extend feet beyond the runway end.see id.at table see also town of stratford faa,describing methodology for calculating runway safety area.an airport that deploys emas,however,may require less than feet of runway safety area beyond the runway end to comply with faa standards.see faa,engineered materials arresting systems emas for aircraft overruns,advisory circular a at,available at www.faa.gov follow advisory circulars hyperlink.
the primary runway at the panama city airport is feet long,and the secondary crosswind runway is feet long.neither runway complies with the faa revised runway safety area standards.to be in compliance,the airport would need to extend the safety area an additional feet beyond the goose bayou end of the primary runway.the runway safety area at the southeast end of the primary runway meets an antenna at feet,an airport perimeter road at feet,and state road at feet.each of these barriers prevents extension of the safety area to an uninterrupted feet beyond the runway end.
the airport primary runway is also too short for larger commercial aircraft.the faa determined that a runway would be necessary to accommodate the regional and jets that could be expected to serve the airport through.the sponsor,however,wishes to expand the runway to receive aircraft arriving from overseas.to serve such larger aircraft,the sponsor determined that it would need to expand the existing primary runway to feet.see intervener br.at.extending the runway either to or to feet would run into the obstacles discussed above established homes,businesses,roads,and goose bayou.
the proposed west bay site 
the joe company joe,the largest private landowner in florida,has agreed to donate approximately acres in west bay county for construction of a new airport,contingent on the sponsor agreement to locate the airport within certain boundaries and the faa commitment of funds for the airport construction.letter from peter rummell,ceo,joe,to donald crisp,chairman,panama county airport and industrial district,at.joe owns most of the land surrounding the proposed site and,thus,would likely benefit from the new airport.see generally sierra club army corps of eng rs,d,noting joe regional land holdings and construction plans.to mitigate environmental damage that would be caused by the construction of a new airport,joe has committed to set aside of its acres as conservation easements.
anticipated effects of the proposed airport on natural resources 
about half of the site approximately acres consists of jurisdictional wetlands.these wetlands are a potential habitat for several species protected by the endangered species act,including the american alligator,the woodstork,the eastern indigo snake,and the flatwoods salamander.the first phase of the new airport construction would fill acres of the wetlands.the faa estimates that airport development over the next years would have a direct impact on a total of acres of the wetlands,with other development potentially affecting all wetlands within the site.these construction impacts and resulting loss of wetlands may adversely affect the eastern indigo snake and flatwoods salamander.
in addition,the proposed airport would be situated in a watershed between two tributaries,crooked creek and burnt mill creek,that empty into the west bay,a body of water containing potential essential fish habitat.the project would fill in feet of streams that eventually join the two larger tributaries.airport construction would also create nearly acres of impervious surfaces,such as runways and parking lots,that would channel runoff into the crooked creek and burnt mill creek watersheds and eventually into west bay.
procedural background 
project history 
as with many complex construction projects,plans for the west bay airport have evolved over a number of years.the sponsor completed an airport master plan update in,which identified a future need for longer runways and larger runway safety areas to service the bay county area.the sponsor initially proposed to extend the existing panama city airport primary runway into goose bayou,but it abandoned that proposal when the florida department of environmental protection florida dep expressed concern that such a runway extension would adversely affect class ii surface water suitable for shellfish propagation or harvesting,fill sovereign submerged lands in violation of florida law,and destroy protected seagrasses.see letter from virginia wetherell.dep,to cherie trainor.dep t of cmty.affairs july,see also letter from david struhs.dep,to virginia lane,faa,at,the issues and objections expressed in the letter have not changed or abated.having encountered such opposition,the sponsor explored other options,including the west bay site offered by joe.when the feasibility study for panama county international airport commissioned by the sponsor recommended relocation,the sponsor,pursuant to the aaia,sought approval from the faa to build a new airport at the west bay site.
the faa challenged approval 
in addressing the sponsor application to build a new airport at the west bay site,the faa,pursuant to nepa,prepared a draft environmental impact statement eis and,after receiving public comment,issued a final eis feis,which assessed,inter alia,the adverse effects of the sponsor proposed action and alternatives to the proposal.relying on findings in the feis,the agency issued its record of decision rod on september,approving those federal actions by the faa necessary for the proposed relocation of the panama county international airport pfn.rod at.
the rod explains the faa approval of the sponsor application.as discussed in greater detail below,the aaia does not permit the faa to approve an airport development project that has a significant adverse effect on natural resources unless there is no possible and prudent alternative to the project and every reasonable effort to mitigate the adverse effect has been taken.see c b discussed infra at part.while the faa found that a new airport at the west bay site would have a significant adverse effect on natural resources,it nevertheless approved the project because it found that no prudent alternative existed.see rod at.
petitioners timely sought this court review of the faa decision pursuant to.
petitioners motion to stay enforcement of the faa order 
on november,petitioners filed an emergency motion to stay the faa order pending review in this court,which a judge of this court granted.the sponsor responded with an emergency motion of its own to vacate the stay and to expedite oral argument on the merits.on december,a motions panel modified the stay to allow limited construction at the west bay site.the court heard oral argument on the review petition on january,and vacated the stay entirely on january,concluding that a balancing of the relevant factors favored the position of the faa and the sponsor.we now reach the merits and deny the petition.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction to review a petition filed by a person disclosing a substantial interest in an order issued by the faa,provided that the person resides or has its principal place of business in this circuit.a see also.although the faa does not contest jurisdiction,the intervenor sponsor argues that petitioners fail to satisfy the substantial interest,or standing,requirement of the statute.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d identifying standing as an essential and unchanging predicate to the court exercise of jurisdiction.we conclude that affidavits submitted by various members of petitioners organizations,including private pilots who use the existing panama city airport and persons who use and enjoy wetlands that will be eliminated by the proposed airport,suffice to demonstrate the requisite substantial interest in the challenged order.see generally summers earth island,d noting that harm that affects the recreational or even the mere esthetic interests of plaintiff organization members will suffice to establish particularized injury friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d same.
standard of review 
we review the faa application of law to fact under the administrative procedure act,and we will set aside the agency decision only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.southeast queens concerned neighbors,faa,cir quoting a.under this deferential standard of review,we can not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.see citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d.nevertheless,o ur inquiry must be searching and careful.national audubon soc y hoffman,cir quoting marsh or.natural res.council,d.the record must show that the agency examine d the relevant data and articulate d a satisfactory explanation for its action.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the,state farm mut.auto.ins.state farm,d see haven hosp.leavitt,cir.moreover,the agency decision must reveal a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.state farm,at.quoting burlington truck lines,united states,d see fund for animals kempthorne,cir.
c.the national environmental policy act challenge 
petitioners submit that the faa violated nepa when it decided to authorize the building of a new airport at the west bay site.to facilitate our discussion of this argument,we briefly outline the nepa provision at issue.
nepa requirement for an eis 
nepa requires a federal agency to prepare an eis before taking any major action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c see stewart park reserve,slater,cir citizens against burlington,busey.the purpose of an eis is to provide full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts and to inform decisionmakers and the public of the reasonable alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment.thus,nepa is a procedural statute that mandates a process rather than a particular result.stewart park reserve,slater,at.the agency overall obligation is to take a hard look at the environmental consequences before taking a major action.baltimore gas natural res.def.council,d.significantly,i f the adverse environmental effects of the proposed action are adequately identified and evaluated,the agency is not constrained by nepa from deciding that other values outweigh the environmental costs.robertson methow valley citizens council,d.
the scope of judicial review of an eis is narrow.sierra club army corps of eng rs,at.given the role of the eis and the narrow scope of permissible judicial review,a court may not rule an eis inadequate if the agency has made an adequate compilation of relevant information,has analyzed it reasonably,has not ignored pertinent data,and has made disclosures to the public.stewart park reserve,slater,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the faa did not violate nepa in authorizing construction of a new airport at the west bay site 
petitioners assert that the faa violated nepa in issuing an feis for the proposed airport that failed adequately a to evaluate alternatives to the proposed project,b to consider the indirect and cumulative effects of the proposed project in its comparison of alternatives,and c to disclose scientific evidence indicating that the sponsor mitigation efforts will likely not succeed in offsetting the loss of wetlands.petitioners further fault the faa for d declining to issue a supplemental eis evaluating the impact of the proposed airport on the endangered woodpecker.we address these objections in turn.
a.the feis analysis of alternatives 
under nepa,an agency discussion of alternatives to the proposed action,c iii,forms the heart of the environmental impact statement.thus,an agency must r igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives,and for alternatives which were eliminated from detailed study,briefly discuss the reasons for their having been eliminated.id.a see also citizens against burlington,busey,at council on environmental quality regulations oblige agencies to discuss only alternatives that are feasible or reasonable.
in this case,the faa did not evaluate in detail any alternative that did not substantially meet the purpose and need objectives of the airport project as described in the feis.rod at.the faa also rejected any alternative that would have an adverse impact on florida class ii waters,that would introduce fill materials or extensions into goose bayou.see rod at.after these alternatives were eliminated from review,seven remained for detailed consideration.each involved varying runway and runway safety area expansions with different materials at just two locations the site of the existing panama city airport the existing site alternatives and the west bay site.see id.at.
petitioners contend that the faa acted arbitrarily in screening out those alternatives that would affect the adjacent waters of goose bayou,including one referred to as emas scenario that,like emas scenario which was considered,would deploy specially engineered materials in the runway safety area to brake aircraft that deviate from the runway.see feis at.emas scenario,however,proposed to extend the runway and runway safety area into goose bayou on a pier,thereby affecting florida class ii waters.see id.at.it would also extend the runway and runway safety area to the southeast,displacing homes.see id.
we can not conclude that the faa abused its discretion in declining to consider alternatives that would affect goose bayou.as the faa noted,goose bayou included florida class ii waters,and the florida dep viewed projects affecting such waters as unacceptable,see feis at,a position confirmed by the florida dep in its amicus brief to this court,see florida dep br.as amicus curiae at.thus,the faa reasonably concluded that projects affecting goose bayou did not present workable alternatives because they were unlikely to secure permit approval from the florida dep.see vermont yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d observing that nepa does not require discussion of alternatives that,in view of basic changes required in statutes and policies of other agencies,would become available,if at all,only after protracted debate and litigation internal quotation marks omitted friends of airport faa,cir holding that faa was entitled to consider opinion of state government agency natural res.def.council,callaway,cir noting that there is no need to consider alternatives of speculative feasibility or alternatives which could only be implemented after significant changes in governmental policy or legislation islander pipeline mccarthy,cir noting that a single state agency effectively vetoe d an energy pipeline that ha d secured approval from a host of other federal and state agencies.
even if the florida dep had not opposed any airport development affecting goose bayou,we would not identify abuse of discretion in the faa decision to review emas scenario but not emas scenario as a possible alternative.the two scenarios are similar in that each would extend the existing primary runway to a length of feet and would comply with runway safety area standards by deploying emas around the lengthened runway.although emas scenario would displace only homes,while emas scenario would displace,see feis at,the similarities between the two alternatives,in both advantages and disadvantages,preclude us from concluding that the faa arbitrarily reviewed the latter alternative but not the former in order to reach a predetermined result.to the contrary,the agency complied with nepa procedural requirement that it briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating emas scenario,and it reasonably exercised its discretion to carry forward one,but not two,emas scenario alternatives for further detailed analysis.see friends of ompompanoosuc fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir it is that under nepa the range of alternatives that must be discussed is a matter within an agency discretion.citing vermont yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,at.
finally,we reject petitioners contention that the faa arbitrarily limited the geographic scope of its alternatives analysis to bay county.petitioners did not identify alternative sites outside bay county in their comments on the agency draft eis.moreover,the faa did in fact consider an alternative occupying part of gulf county,but reasonably concluded that it was located too far from the primary market base to constitute a reasonable option.feis at to.
feis indirect and cumulative impacts analysis 
in determining the scope of an eis,the agency shall consider types of impacts direct,indirect,and cumulative c.petitioners contend that the faa failed to consider the indirect and cumulative impacts of the proposed west bay airport.specifically,petitioners argue that the faa failed to consider the impacts of two major highway construction projects that would provide new routes to the proposed west bay site and the environmental impact of three million square feet of commercial and residential development that would be induced by the new airport.petitioners further allege that the agency arbitrarily limited the geographic scope of its cumulative impacts analysis to bay county.we reject these contentions as without merit.
related highway construction 
an existing road,county road,traverses bay county from east to west,passing near the proposed west bay site.in its rod,the faa forecast a marginal traffic increase on existing roads near the proposed site,but did not find any adverse effects attributable to new highway construction.indeed,the faa did not identify new highway construction at all except for turn lanes at cr and the new airport access roadway.rod at see also feis at to listing reasonably foreseeable major transportation projects in bay county.the faa modest forecast was soon proved wrong.on march,about six months after the faa issued its decision,the northwest florida transportation corridor authority nwftca issued its recommended corridor master plan.stat.a,which the nwftca formally adopted on april.the plan describes two new,highways,known as the bay connector and the west bay bypass,respectively,that would provide direct transportation to the proposed airport.see nwftca,master plan at.com html mp phase nftca master plan.pdf nwftca,master plan project priorities.
petitioners contend that the faa should have foreseen these developments and accounted for them in the september,rod because the nwftca discussed the west bay bypass and the bay connector at its board meeting six months earlier,on march.see pet rs br.at.the board meeting minutes identified m ajor projects,including a new connector from the gulf coast parkway at extending to the new airport and on into walton county.nwftca meeting minutes a,available at www.nwftca.com follow board meetings hyperlink.although the speaker referenced a freeway proposal different from the one about which petitioners now complain,the minutes nevertheless suggest that the nwftca intended to account for the new airport in its freeway development plans.the minutes do not indicate,however,that any representatives of the faa were present at the meeting,nor do they indicate any communication with the faa.in short,the record does not reflect that the faa had actual notice of the march,freeway proposal.
to the extent the nwftca made its proceedings public,the agency might be deemed to have had constructive notice of state highway projects related to the proposed airport.as the sponsor argues,however,petitioners had the same access to such public information but did not present their concerns about the effects of new highway construction to the faa during the public comment period,which lasted from may,to july.see intervener br.at.the absence of comments from petitioners regarding the indirect and cumulative impacts of the west bay bypass and the bay connector,together with the absence of evidence indicating that the agency was actually aware of the highway projects,preclude us from concluding that the faa failure to include the impacts of projected highway projects in its rod was arbitrary or capricious.while an agency bears the primary responsibility to ensure that it complies with nepa,department of transp.pub.citizen,d,p ersons challenging an agency compliance with nepa must structure their participation so that it alerts the agency to the parties position and contentions,in order to allow the agency to give the issue meaningful consideration,id.at.quoting vermont yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,at.alterations in department of transportation public citizen.for the same reasons,we also reject petitioners contention that the new highways should have been considered as c onnected actions.a.
induced growth 
petitioners argue that the faa erred in failing to consider the environmental impacts of induced growth,thereby precluding a true comparison of alternatives and exhibiting bias in favor of the west bay site.in fact,the agency did consider the effects of induced growth as part of its analysis of cumulative impacts.see rod at the effects of induced development are included in the summaries of cumulative impacts.it found that,within the designated west bay site,all acres of wetlands could be impacted based on the proposed ultimate scenario.rod at see also feis at.within the west bay sector plan area,the faa forecast that approximately percent of the be affected by regional development,while acres would remain protected within a conservation area.see rod at feis at to.based on these disclosures,we are not persuaded by petitioners argument that the agency decision to group induced impacts together with cumulative impacts hindered comparison between the existing site alternatives and the west bay site.even if the feis could have been improved by analyzing induced impacts separately from cumulative impacts,see letter from heinz muller,epa,to virginia lane,faa,at june,commenting to that effect,nepa does not require separate analyses.nepa requires only that the different types of impacts be considered,which the faa did.
petitioners further allege that the agency improperly omitted from its analysis the cumulative impact of the proposed airport on surrounding walton,washington,jackson,calhoun,and gulf counties.we disagree.the faa developed cumulative impact study areas based on a consideration of drainage basins,the sector plan boundaries,census boundaries,noise contours,drive time contours,and consultation with other agencies.see feis at to.this explanation is sufficient for us to conclude that its delineation of the cumulative impact study areas was not arbitrary or capricious.
petitioners argument that the feis narrowly focused its analysis on wetlands and failed to consider effects on west bay is also without merit.the agency did in fact identify the potential impacts of developing the new airport on west bay waters,noting that stormwater runoff may result in short and surface water quality impacts.feis at.although,as other agencies have pointed out,the faa might have improved its feis by including a complete watershed analysis for the west bay alternatives,letter from gail carmody,dep t of the interior,fish wildlife,to virginia lane,faa,at,its discussion of runoff impacts on the west bay watershed is not so lacking in detail that it fails to comply with nepa procedural requirements.see c see also custer county action ass garvey,cir observing that nepa requires agencies preparing environmental impact statements to consider and respond to the comments of other agencies,not to agree with them citizens against burlington,busey,at t he faa,not the epa,bore the ultimate statutory responsibility for actually preparing the environmental impact statement,and under the rule of reason,a lead agency does not have to follow the epa comments just has to take them seriously.
mitigation disclosures 
an eis must include a discussion of the m eans to mitigate adverse environmental impacts.h.petitioners argue that the agency mischaracterized the sponsor mitigation plans as bestowing environmental benefits on bay county,when the planned mitigation would only compensate for the extensive damage the project would cause.they contend that the agency failed to acknowledge scientific evidence that mitigation proposals,such as those put forth by the sponsor,frequently fail.
to the extent that petitioners seek to engage us in a battle of experts regarding the likelihood of success of the sponsor mitigation program,we decline to entertain their arguments,for our role is not to resolve scientific disputes.see environmental def.epa,cir stewart park reserve,slater,at.rather,we examine whether the eis adequately discussed mitigation efforts as required by nepa.see f,h see also robertson methow valley citizens council,at.noting that nepa requires only that mitigation be discussed in sufficient detail to ensure that environmental consequences have been fairly evaluated.because the feis here at issue includes a thorough discussion of mitigation measures,see,feis app.r,we conclude that it complies with nepa.
supplemental eis 
eleven days after the faa issued its rod,ornithologists from auburn university announced that they had detected woodpeckers in the wetlands of the choctawatchee river approximately miles northwest of the proposed west bay site.on october,petitioners asked the faa to reinitiate formal consultation with the united states fish and wildlife service usfws,the government expert agency with respect to endangered species,and to prepare a supplemental eis to consider the effect of the proposed airport development project on the woodpecker.the faa consequently conducted a biological assessment pursuant to c.on march,the faa transmitted its biological assessment to the usfws and asked that agency to concur in its conclusion that building the west bay airport may affect but would not likely adversely affect the woodpecker if its existence is subsequently confirmed by usfws.letter from jacqueline,faa,to gail carmody,usfws,at.on may,the usfws concurred.shortly thereafter,on may,the faa formally notified petitioners that it would not prepare a supplemental eis.the faa explained that it had shared its biological assessment with the usfws and that both agencies agreed that no further study was needed under the endangered species act or nepa.petitioners allege that the faa decision not to prepare a supplemental eis failed to comply with nepa.
nepa implementing regulations provide that agencies s hall prepare supplements to either draft or final environmental impact statements if t here are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.c.in determining whether to prepare a supplemental eis,the agency has an obligation to take a hard look at the new circumstances and information.see marsh or.natural res.council,at.we review the agency decision not to prepare a supplemental eis in two parts,asking whether the agency took the hard look that the new circumstances required and,if so,whether the agency decision,based on what it learned,was arbitrary or capricious.see village of grand view skinner,cir.
the record demonstrates that the faa took a hard look at the new information relating to the woodpecker and that its findings were neither arbitrary nor capricious.having ascertained the potential habitat types for the woodpecker,the faa examined field and aerial surveys of the west bay site and west bay sector plan for evidence of such habitats.it found small areas that would serve as potential habitat,but no areas sufficiently large to support the woodpecker within the surveyed region.see faa,biological assessment for the ivory billed woodpecker at.the agency further concluded,based on its review of the scientific literature,that overhead flight noise was unlikely to have an adverse effect on the woodpecker.see id.at nn.citing studies.
petitioners fault the biological assessment as arbitrarily circumscribed in scope because the faa did not consider the effects of secondary development in areas outside the west bay sector plan.the sector plan,however,is itself the product of a planning process for potential future development in the region.id.at.thus,it already takes into account many of the secondary effects about which petitioners express concern.to the extent that new roads and dwellings may adversely affect the woodpecker in areas beyond the west bay sector plan,such construction may itself become the object of an appropriate study under the endangered species act,nepa,or other relevant law at this time,however,we can not conclude that the faa forecast for future construction prompted by the development of a new airport at the west bay site was arbitrary or capricious.see citizens for balanced env t,volpe,cir rejecting challenge to agency forecast where it was evident that the agency gave careful consideration to the problem toward which the data was directed.
having concluded that the faa complied with nepa procedural requirements,we turn to the question of whether the agency challenged decision complies with the aaia.
d.the airport and airway improvement act challenge 
under the aaia,the secretary of transportation may approve an application for an airport development project that is 
found to have a significant adverse effect on natural resources,including fish and wildlife,natural,scenic,and recreation assets,water and air quality,or another factor affecting the environment,only after finding that no possible and prudent alternative to the project exists and that every reasonable step has been taken to minimize the adverse effect.
c b emphasis added.in this case,the faa found that building an airport at the west bay site would have significant adverse impacts in the categories of water quality,biotic communities,endangered and threatened species,wetlands,floodplains,and construction impacts.rod at.nevertheless,because it determined that none of the build alternatives can be deemed clearly environmentally superior and because only the west bay site foot alternative meets both the faa and the airport sponsor purposes and needs,the faa found that no possible and prudent alternative exists to the proposed project.rod at.
petitioners submit that the faa finding that there is no prudent alternative is arbitrary and capricious because the faa improperly considered social impacts in reaching its conclusion that no alternative was environmentally superior to the west bay site and deferred to the sponsor preference for an runway in short,petitioners object to the faa consideration of factors in its analysis of alternatives.thus,at issue is the scope of the term prudent in c b.
defining prudent for purposes of assessing alternatives 
faa orders define prudent to support consideration of both environmental and factors 
the aaia does not define the phrase prudent alternative,see definitions,nor has the faa promulgated regulations interpreting it.in,however,the agency issued order,which served as an instructional manual to guide faa officials and included a definition of prudent alternative as used in c b.see faa order,airport environmental handbook,order.the interpretive order explained that a prudent alternative reflects sound judgment and that an alternative may not be prudent because of safety,policy,environmental,social,or economic consequences.id.at.this definition remained unchanged when the faa issued order a in to amend the airport environmental handbook.see faa order a,airport environmental handbook b,order a.
subsequently,the agency substantially update d and revise d and cancel led order a by implementing order b,which became effective on april.faa order b,national environmental policy act nepa implementing instructions for airport projects at cover memorandum,order b.this order describes a prudent alternative as one reflecting rational judgment and lists the following factors to aid faa officials to decide if an alternative is prudent 
does it meet the project purpose and need 
does it cause extraordinary safety or operational problems 
are there unique problems or truly unusual factors present with the alternative 
does it cause unacceptable and severe adverse social,economic,or other environmental impacts 
does it cause extraordinary community disruption 
does it cause added construction,maintenance,or operational costs of an extraordinary magnitude or 
does it result in an accumulation of factors that collectively,rather than individually,have adverse impacts that present unique problems or reach extraordinary magnitudes 
all iterations of order thus interpret the term prudent to permit consideration of factors when assessing alternatives.we proceed to consider what,if any,deference is owed these interpretive orders 
b.the faa orders defining prudent to include factors merit skidmore deference 
the faa orders,as agency manuals without the force of law,are not afforded deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.nevertheless,we conclude that the definition of prudent found in these orders is entitled to deference pursuant to skidmore swift.see friends of airport faa,at according order a skidmore deference see also christensen harris county,d boykin keycorp,cir.under skidmore,the weight courts accord an agency interpretation depends on the thoroughness evident in the agency consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.at.
our analysis of the skidmore factors in this case leads us to conclude that the faa interpretation of the phrase prudent alternative has a great deal of persuasive weight.as already noted,the statute does not define the term prudent,nor does it limit the factors that the agency may consider in assessing whether an alternative is imprudent.the absence of statutory guidance provides the faa,which is charged with the statute administration,with flexibility to implement a broad interpretation of the term.see estate of landers leavitt,cir under skidmore,we construe the statute in the first instance,and where the text does not resolve the issue,we give effect to the agency nonlegislative interpretation to the extent we find it persuasive.moreover,the agency interpretation is longstanding.see id.at see also north haven bd.of educ.bell,d in construing a statute,this court normally accords great deference to the interpretation,particularly when it is longstanding,of the agency charged with the statute administration.the faa first defined prudent in,modifying that definition only once,in.see order b cover memorandum observing that order a has served faa well for over years.throughout,the agency has provided for a number of factors to be considered in determining whether an alternative is prudent.finally,the agency definition is the product of an interpretation that is relatively formal within the universe of informal interpretations.estate of landers leavitt,at.specifically,the faa interpretation of prudent for purposes of considering alternatives is set forth in a manual rather than,for example,a letter ruling.moreover,the interpretation is generally applicable and not an ad hoc position.see chauffeur training,spellings,cir observing that agency interpretation is entitled to greater skidmore deference when the interpretation in question is not merely ad hoc but is applicable to all cases.these circumstances all support skidmore deference.
petitioners argument that the faa interpretation is contrary to law is without merit 
on appeal,petitioners do not dispute that the faa interpretative orders define prudent to include factors.indeed,their opening brief makes no reference to these orders,and it is only in their reply brief that petitioners acknowledge the orders,which they note were brought to our attention by intervenor brief.pet rs reply br.at.in so doing,they assert that the orders support their contention that only the faa purpose and need,not those of the sponsor,are relevant to assessing prudent alternatives.we address that argument infra in part.b of this opinion.we first address petitioners arguments that the agency definition of the term prudent is not a valid interpretation of the aaia and contravenes the supreme court holding in citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d.
a.the aaia does not preclude consideration of factors in assessing prudent alternatives 
petitioners argue that the aaia unambiguous terms and structure both demonstrate that when analyzing section c b the secretary is to consider effects to the natural rather than the social environment.pet rs br.at.we disagree.petitioners argument conflates two separate inquiries mandated by c b first,whether the proposed project would have a significant adverse effect on natural resources,c b and second,where the answer is yes,whether a possible and prudent alternative to the project exists,id.
it is the first inquiry that must focus exclusively on natural resources.here,the faa found that the proposed construction of a new airport at the west bay site would have a significant adverse effect on such resources.rod at.having made that determination,the faa was required to conduct a second inquiry whether a possible and prudent alternative to the proposed project exists.as discussed above,the statutory text does not direct the agency to consider effects only on natural resources in conducting this inquiry.thus,we identify no textual obstacle to according skidmore deference to the broader definition of prudent reflected in faa orders a and 
b.the agency definition of prudent to include factors is not precluded by the supreme court decision in overton park 
petitioners argue that congress intended the word prudent in c b to be construed in light of the supreme court decision in citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d,which interpreted that term as used in the department of transportation act dot act and the highway act.those provisions are similar to c b,providing that the secretary of transportation shall not approve any program or project that requires the use of any public parkland unless there is no feasible and prudent alternative.a c prudent and feasible alternative see also at.in overton park,the supreme court held that an alternative was prudent unless there were truly unusual factors present in a particular case or the cost or community disruption resulting from alternative routes reached extraordinary magnitudes.at.
we conclude that overton park interpretation of prudent as used in the dot act and the highway act does not constrain the faa in its
