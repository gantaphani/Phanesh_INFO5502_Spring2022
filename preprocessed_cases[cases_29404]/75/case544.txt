in,the city of minneapolis the city amended its taxicab ordinance to uncap the number of transferable taxicab licenses it issues,thereby opening a previously restricted market.the minneapolis taxi owners coalition the coalition,a group comprising holders of approximately transferable taxicab licenses,sued the city,asserting federal and state constitutional violations,including violations of the coalition members rights to just compensation and due process.before trial,a new star limousine and taxi service new star intervened and filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the case.the coalition appeals.we affirm.
the members of the coalition hold transferable taxicab licenses issued by the city.although originally purchased from the city for a relatively small fee roughly,the transferable licenses sold on the secondary market for as much as to.the city required administrative approval of all such license transfers,but it routinely granted the required approval.
before the enactment of the ordinance amendments at issue,section a of the minneapolis code of ordinances required that the city council conduct a hearing at least once every months to consider whether public convenience and necessity warrant additional licenses.minneapolis,code of ordinances tit,art.ii,ch,repealed.in determining whether additional licenses were warranted,section a required the city council to consider 
the level and quality of service being provided by existing taxicab operators whether additional competition would improve the level and quality of service or the degree of innovation in delivery of services the impact upon the safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic the impact on traffic congestion and pollution the available taxicab stand capacity the public need and demand for service the impact on existing taxicab operators and such other factors as the city council may deem relevant.
id.a designated city council committee held open public convenience and necessity hearings on may,and june,to gather relevant information.evidence presented at the hearings included general testimony both in favor of and against issuance of additional licenses testimony that coalition members would suffer an economic loss by such an increase evidence that there was inadequate business for current taxicab operators evidence of complaints regarding the level and quality of current service economist testimony that removing the cap on licenses would increase jobs and the level of service provided testimony that there was an untapped market for bilingual drivers,particularly for the hispanic community evidence that the number of vehicles may have been insufficient and evidence that a number of taxicabs were operating without licenses.
after the hearing,the city department of licenses and consumer services division submitted a document to the committee,stating that there was insufficient availability of taxicabs,especially taxicabs and,during peak hours,taxicabs generally.the submission discussed two possible plans.plan a did not increase the number of licenses,with the advantage that current license holders would retain substantial value in their licenses.plan b increased the number of licenses by every year until,when the cap would be completely lifted.this plan required that new licensed service companies dedicate at least of their fleets to vehicles and at least to vehicles.plan b also required that existing licensed service companies dedicate at least of their fleets to vehicles and at least to vehicles by,with the minimums increased to by.plan b perceived advantages included spurring service through the use of increased numbers of vehicles and vehicles.its acknowledged disadvantages included the likely diminishing of the monetary value of existing taxicab licenses to zero.
the committee recommended to the city that it increase the number of taxicab licenses pursuant to plan b 
the committee,upon weighing the received evidence and while recognizing that the issuance of additional licenses could likely produce a negative initial impact on existing operators,finds that such prospective impact is outweighed by the potential to improve the level and quality of taxicab service to citizens and visitors in minneapolis through a more open and free market structure as has been accomplished in other jurisdictions,thereby positioning minneapolis as a more viable destination for entertainment,business,convention and other beneficial economic pursuits,and pursue innovations in delivery of taxicab service in the areas of environmental sustainability while addressing underserved communities including the disabled,bilingual and speaking populations.
in october,the city revised the city ordinance code to lift the cap on licenses per plan see minneapolis,code of ordinances tit,art.ii,ch.
in march,the coalition sued the city in minnesota state court,arguing that the new ordinance reduced the value of the existing licenses to zero.relying on the and minnesota constitutions,the coalition claimed that the city deprived coalition members of their property interests without just compensation the city deprived coalition members of their business licenses without due process the and requirements constituted an unconstitutional exaction and coalition members were denied equal protection because the ordinance was amended,in part,to better serve the hispanic community.
the city removed the case to the district court because the complaint asserted federal constitutional claims.see c.in may,new star moved to intervene,and the district court granted the motion.in june,new star moved to dismiss the coalition complaint under federal rule of civil procedure rule b for failure to state a claim.
in october,a magistrate judge recommended granting the motion to dismiss,concluding that coalition members did not have a protectable property interest in the value of their licenses and that therefore the coalition had no takings claim the coalition due process claim similarly failed because the city did not deprive coalition members of any property the coalition did not have standing to bring an claim based on the taxicab fleet requirements because the requirements applied to licensed service companies,not taxicab license holders and the equal protection claim failed because the ordinance survived rational basis scrutiny.in december,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation and granted new star motion to dismiss.the coalition appeals and repeats its takings,due process,and arguments before this court 
we review de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under rule b,accepting the facts as alleged in the complaint and granting all reasonable inferences in favor of the coalition as the party.neighborhood,city of louis,cir.
the coalition argues that removing the cap on the number of taxicab licenses is a taking of private property requiring just compensation under the fifth amendment to the constitution.see const.amend the coalition does not contend that the city revoked or somehow vitiated existing licenses or that opening the market destroyed the ability of the license holders to use their licenses to do business.the coalition only the city does not removing the cap on the number of licenses destroyed the market value of the licenses.the elimination of the market value of the taxicab licenses,however,can be considered a taking under the fifth amendment only if there is a protected property interest in that market value.see lucas coastal council,d.property interests are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings.bd.of regents of state colls.roth,d.
those existing rules include relevant state law,and the coalition relies on several minnesota cases to argue that the holder of a license does have a property interest in that license.see state saugen,holding that a liquor license was assignable and transferable and as such can be construed as a property right rather than a privilege cup foods,city of minneapolis,finding a property interest in a realtor business license bird dep t of pu
