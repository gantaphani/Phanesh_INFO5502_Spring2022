lola camp brought this diversity action against tnt logistics tnt and trelleborg ysh,trelleborg,seeking to recover damages for injuries she sustained as a result of their alleged negligence in connection with the shipment of a pallet of automobile parts.the district court granted summary judgment for the camp appeals.we affirm,although on partially different grounds than those relied upon by the district court.
background 
during the relevant time period,mitsubishi motors north america,mitsubishi manufactured automobiles using an efficient and inventory system.under this system,automotive parts from suppliers were delivered to plants just in time to be used on assembly lines.tnt provided logistics services to mitsubishi,coordinating the purchase and transportation of automobile parts from suppliers as mitsubishi needs arose.tnt contracted with dekeyser express,dekeyser,a motor carrier service provider,to transport the parts.camp worked for transport leasing company tlc.tlc leased camp services as a driver to dekeyser.
on january,tnt directed dekeyser to transport some parts from several suppliers one of which was trelleborg to mitsubishi factory in normal,illinois.dekeyser dispatched camp to make the and delivery.the next day camp arrived at trelleborg facility,which was the final stop on her route.at trelleborg loading dock,camp noticed that the three pallets of parts scheduled for would fit inside the trailer only if the third pallet was stacked on top of one of the other two pallets.camp was concerned that the load would not ride,that the unsecured pallet might shift due to the vacant space next to it and be damaged.she told trelleborg personnel of her concern and contacted dekeyser dispatcher ken kasprzak and tnt transport supervisor alan marten to advise them of the problem.marten contacted dave finck,tnt liaison at mitsubishi normal,illinois factory.after the conversation with finck,marten advised camp and kasprzak that tnt wanted the entire load delivered and directed camp to write on the bill that tnt was aware of the situation and was releasing the shipper trelleborg and the driver camp from responsibility for any cargo damage.camp then wrote the following on the bill of lading shipper and driver released of liability for any product damage as called tnt and told them did think would ride.ship anyway per dave fink sic.after trelleborg loaded the three pallets,camp drove to tnt facility located across the street from the mitsubishi plant.before backing up to tnt dock,camp stopped in the parking lot and opened the right trailer door when she did,the unsecured third pallet began to fall.when she attempted to close the trailer door to prevent the pallet from falling out,camp injured her shoulder and arm.
camp filed suit against tnt and trelleborg in illinois state court,asserting a negligence claim against each defendant based upon their alleged acts and omissions in connection with the transport of the unsecured pallet.the defendants removed the action to the united states district court for the central district of illinois by invoking the court diversity jurisdiction.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on camp negligence claims.in doing so,the court rejected camp claim that she could hold tnt liable under two provisions of the federal motor carrier safety regulations fmcsr and found that camp had not presented sufficient authority in support of her common law standpoint argument to survive tnt motion for summary judgment.the district court also held that trelleborg was not liable to camp under the fmcsr and that trelleborg owed no duty to her in light of illinois open and obvious doctrine.camp appeals.

statutory duty 
on appeal,camp first claims that tnt and trelleborg are liable for negligence based on two provisions of the fmcsr,and a,which are explained in detail below.parts and among several others of the fmcsr are adopted by reference into the illinois vehicle code by ilcs b part of the illinois motor carrier safety law.people blackorby.in a common law negligence action,a violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect human life or property is prima facie evidence of negligence the violation does not constitute negligence per se.abbasi ex rel.abbasi paraskevoulakos.to recover damages based upon a defendant alleged statutory violation,a plaintiff must show that she belongs to the class of persons that the statute was designed to protect her injury is of the type that the statute was designed to prevent and the violation proximately caused her injury.first springfield bank trust galman.we consider the application of and a to tnt and trelleborg separately below.
initially we must determine whether the relevant safety regulations apply to tnt,for if they do not tnt could not have violated them.under a,a driver may not operate a commercial motor vehicle and a motor carrier may not require or permit a driver to operate a commercial motor vehicle unless the commercial motor vehicle cargo is properly distributed and adequately secured as specified in through of this subchapter.according to,a motor carrier is a motor carrier or a private motor carrier.emphasis added.the same regulation defines a motor carrier as a person engaged in the transportation of goods or passengers for compensation.a person includes a corporation like tnt id.
camp argues that a applies to tnt because tnt had a motor carrier license and was acting as a motor carrier.more particularly,camp contends that the following facts demonstrate that tnt maintained de facto control over the cargo shipment and thus acted as a motor carrier tnt planned the configuration of the load with its software,determined the supplier stops camp made,and mapped the route she took tnt employee dave finck made the decision that all three pallets had to be transported and tnt decided that the trailer would not have the bracing equipment that helps to secure the cargo.tnt,on the other hand,maintains that its mere possession of a motor carrier license is not dispositive and asserts that it was acting as a broker rather than a motor carrier.in addition,tnt argues that it did not provide motor carrier services for mitsubishi and that dekeyser was the motor carrier because it was contractually obligated to supply the driver,truck,and equipment.
we agree with tnt that the fact it possessed a motor carrier license is not determinative of the applicability of a instead,the crucial inquiry is in what capacity tnt was acting during the transaction.see,paul arpin van lines,universal transp,cir schramm foster,d.only if tnt was functioning as a person engaged in the transportation of goods or passengers for compensation does a apply.transportation is defined as 
a a motor vehicle,vessel,warehouse,wharf,pier,dock,yard,property,facility,instrumentality,or equipment of any kind related to the movement of passengers or property,or both,regardless of ownership or an agreement concerning use and b services related to that movement,including arranging for,receipt,delivery,elevation,transfer in transit,refrigeration,icing,ventilation,storage,handling,packing,unpacking,and interchange of passengers and property.
tnt did not engage in the actual movement of the automobile parts under the first prong of the transportation definition.indeed,the contract between tnt and dekeyser provides that dekeyser was responsible for supplying the truck,driver,and associated equipment for the movement of the cargo,and there is no question that dekeyser not tnt provided the driver and truck that moved the auto parts.
camp argues that tnt provided services related to th e movement of the cargo under the second prong of the transportation definition.we disagree.although tnt determined the stops camp made and the route she took,rather than being services pertaining to the movement of the automobile parts these actions were merely details upon which tnt insisted to ensure that the delivery of the parts by dekeyser would be on time.the same was also true of tnt decision that the third pallet had to be delivered despite its instability.tnt determination that the trailer would not have bracing equipment was also not a service germane to the movement of the cargo but was instead a condition under which the actual movement of the goods by dekeyser was to take place.that tnt planned the configuration of the load on the trailer with its software might,at first glance,seem to be a service by which tnt arrang ed for the movement of the cargo however,this configuration scheme is more accurately viewed as a detail pertaining to the positioning of the cargo on dekeyser trailers upon which tnt insisted in order to facilitate the smooth operation of mitsubishi system.for these reasons,tnt actions did not rise to the level of providing services related to the movement of the parts and thus tnt was not acting as a motor carrier.rather,tnt was a logistics company whose main focus was the timely and efficient procurement of auto parts for mitsubishi.tnt role was that of a broker who,on behalf of mitsubishi,negotiat ed for transportation by dekeyser that would satisfy the demands of the system.therefore,a does not apply to tnt and thus it owed no duty to camp under this provision.the district court correctly granted summary judgment for tnt on this issue.
the district court also held that camp could not hold tnt liable under because she would be suing tnt for aiding and abetting her own violation of the fmcsr.under,n o person shall aid,abet,encourage,or require a motor carrier or its employees to violate the rules of this chapter.camp argues that tnt violated when it encouraged her to transport the third pallet in an unsecured state as proscribed by a.camp is correct that the plain language of applies to a person regardless of its function,and not just persons acting as drivers and motor carriers as with a.however,like the district court,we conclude that illinois case law precludes camp recovery under.
specifically,under illinois law,a plaintiff can not recover from a defendant for the defendant aiding and abetting the plaintiff own tortious conduct.the case of hudkins egan,d,established this principle of law.in hudkins,a driver lost control of a car and died in the accident,at.the decedent administratrix sued one of the decedent friends who was riding in the car for encouraging the decedent to drive recklessly.id.the illinois appellate court held that the decedent as the direct tortfeasor could not have recovered as a victim from the friend who encouraged her to drive dangerously,the indirect tortfeasor.id.at.camp aiding and abetting claim is controlled by this principle from hudkins camp,as the person who operated the with the unsecured pallet contrary to a,can not recover from tnt as a victim under for its role in encouraging her to violate a.therefore,the district court properly granted tnt summary judgment on this theory as well.
trelleborg 
on appeal,camp conceded that trelleborg was acting as a shipper rather than as a motor carrier and that a does not apply to it.however,camp maintains that she may hold trelleborg liable under for aiding and abetting her own violations of the fmcsr.the principle from hudkins which we discussed above applies equally to trelleborg.accordingly,camp can not recover from trelleborg for its part in aiding and abetting her own violations of the fmcsr,and thus the district court properly granted trelleborg summary judgment.
camp also challenges the district court award of summary judgment for tnt based upon a traditional duty approach.the court determined that camp failed to support this theory with any authority and that her bare statement that tnt is liable from a common law standpoint was not enough to survive summary judgment.camp accurately points out that she did in fact offer some authority albeit at the very end of her response and in the section in which she opposed trelleborg motion for summary judgment in support of her position that tnt owed her a duty of care and stated that tnt breached that duty.we will assume without deciding that the authority which camp mentioned was sufficient to preserve and advance her argument that tnt owed her a duty.
camp says that tnt mistakenly scheduled the third pallet,failed to arrange for bracing equipment in the trailer when it knew there would be an unsecured pallet,failed to expedite the pallet by another truck,failed to suggest that the pallet could be broken down into smaller pieces,and failed to advise her and trelleborg that the pallet should be on the right side of the trailer.according to camp,these facts indicate that tnt breached the duty of care it owed her.
in illinois,t he existence of a duty depends on whether the plaintiff and the defendant stood in such a relationship to each other that the law will impose upon the defendant an obligation of reasonable conduct for the benefit of the plaintiff.bajwa metro.life ins.this question turns largely on public policy considerations,informed by consideration of four traditional factors the reasonable foreseeability of the injury the likelihood of the injury the magnitude of the burden of guarding against the injury and the consequences of placing that burden on the defendant.city of chicago beretta.whether these factors create a duty is a question of law for the court.iseberg,at.
after considering these factors,we conclude that tnt did not owe camp a duty of care.as evidenced by her expressions of concern to trelleborg,dekeyser,and tnt personnel,there is no question that camp was aware of the risk that the third pallet might shift during the trip.moreover,camp testified at her deposition that she knew that there was a possibility the unsecured pallet had shifted in transit,that it might have been leaning against the trailer doors,and that it might fall out if the trailer doors were opened.under these circumstances,tnt could not have reasonably foreseen that camp would open the trailer doors in a way that would cause her harm.
camp asserts that she was under economic compulsion from tnt to encounter the danger posed by the pallet and that therefore her injuries were foreseeable she points to the following language in the master agreement between tnt and dekeyser as evidence that tnt had control over her or her employment status when directed by tnt,dekeyser shall cause any dekeyser employee to be removed from providing services hereunder.assuming that camp qualifies as dekeyser employee,all this quoted passage demonstrates is that tnt could prevent camp from providing carrier services to tnt.camp ignores the provision from the same section of the contract which states tnt shall have no authority to,on behalf of dekeyser or otherwise,discharge,promote,suspend or otherwise discipline any dekeyser employee providing services for tnt hereunder.thus,tnt could not have taken any employment action against camp at most it could have directed dekeyser not to lease camp services as a driver from tlc when providing future services to tnt.this part of the master agreement
