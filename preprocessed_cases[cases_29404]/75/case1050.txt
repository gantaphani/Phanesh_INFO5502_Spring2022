this case is before the court for a second time.in the first appeal,the court reversed in part the grant of summary judgment to tdc management corporation,and its president,theodore monts.the court held that the decision of the department of transportation board of contract appeals the board on tdc appeal from cost disallowances collaterally estopped the government from relitigating the accuracy of tdc monthly progress and expenditure reports,but did not estop the government from bringing false claims act charges based on information that was omitted from those reports.united states tdc mgmt,tdc i.in this second appeal,from the grant of summary judgment to the government,tdc contends correctly that the district court erred by granting preclusive effect to factual findings by the board.this contention is waived,however,because tdc did not raise it in the district court and no occasion is presented for the exercise of our discretionary review in order to prevent a manifest injustice.accordingly,because tdc other challenges are unpersuasive,we affirm.
the background to this appeal appears in tdc suffice it to say,the litigation arose in connection with a demonstration bonding program program of the urban mass transit authority umta of the department of transportation.the program was designed to assist minority enterprises in securing bonding from sureties when bidding on large transportation construction projects.tdc i,at.tdc agreed to identify private investors willing to provide collateral and management assistance to the minority enterprises in return for a share of the profits for its part,umta agreed to match the collateral that investors provided.id.by the terms of the program,tdc was to serve as ombudsman between the parties,with no financial interest in program operations.id.on july,tdc and umta entered into a contract in which tdc was to use its best efforts to locate investors and sureties and obtain their tentative agreement to participate in the program.id.at.
when the program failed to progress as expected,umta terminated the contract for convenience and disallowed nearly half of tdc claimed expenses,which totaled.id.at.tdc appealed to the board.before the board rendered its decision,the united states in may sued tdc under the false claims act,for misrepresenting its actual progress in its monthly reports to umta and concealing deviations from the program terms.id.the board ruled in tdc favor and reversed the disallowances,finding that tdc had not breached the contract for nonperformance and that its monthly reports had notified umta of the categories and types of expenses that umta sought to disallow.id.viewing its jurisdiction under the contract dispute act,as limited to the costs that had been disallowed by the contracting officer,the board declined to consider umta claim that tdc was not entitled to any monies under the contract due to fraudulent omissions.id.at.the board decision was affirmed by the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit.skinner tdc mgmt,unpublished order.
based on the collateral estoppel effect of the board findings,tdc moved on april,for summary judgment on the false claims act charges.tdc i,at.the district court granted the motion on august.following a partial reversal by this court in tdc i on june,the district court on remand granted the government motion for summary judgment on march,and on february,awarded the government damages.on april,the district court denied tdc motion and granted the government,pursuant to,to clarify or correct the judgment.
on appeal,tdc challenges the grant of summary judgment on several grounds,only one of which requires extended discussion.that contention is that the district court relied on an erroneous application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.
on remand,the district court ruled that collateral estoppel prevented tdc from relitigating factual issues decided by the board with regard to omissions in tdc monthly reports because the issue of omissions was squarely addressed by the board in its prior review of the contract termination.remand opinion at.relying on the board findings,the district court concluded there were no genuine issues of fact with regard to the alleged omissions.id.at.the district court recited at length the board findings that tdc had departed from the terms of the program by,inter alia planning to use interest generated by investment of the umta contribution to underwrite the costs of providing services to disadvantaged business enterprises proposing to investors that such businesses be charged a fee for management services and intentionally failing to disclose to umta its plans to hold a financial stake in program operations in order to keep umta from learning of activities that it would insist be terminated and that with such investment tdc could no longer act objectively as ombudsman for the program.on the basis of the board findings,the district court concluded that the omissions were either intentional or resulted from reckless disregard of the program terms,causing the monthly reports submitted by tdc in support of its invoices for payment to be false.in granting summary judgment to the government on liability,the district court also relied on the unrebutted declarations of umta officials,including that of umta administrator ralph stanley stating that had he known that tdc or monts tried to obtain an equity stake or other financial interest in the program,he would have directed that the contract be immediately terminated for cause.the district court thus found that the omissions were material because had umta known of the omitted information,it would have either required tdc to cease those activities or terminated the contract for cause.id.at.
in tdc i,this court explained that a party is not collaterally estopped from relitigating a disputed issue of fact unless that issue was actually litigated and necessarily decided by a final disposition on the merits.at see also nasem brown,charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure id.at.or,as stated in the restatement second of judgments,a prior determination can only preclude relitigation of the same issue if it was essential to the prior judgment.tdc prevailed before the board and was awarded for expenses incurred under the contract.tdc i,at.the board found that t here was no evidence in the record that the program failed for any reason other than umta electing not to fund the balance of the contract,but to terminate tdc performance.board opinion at.thus,tdc maintains,the board findings regarding the omissions in tdc progress reports were not necessary to the result that the board ultimately reached,and a factual finding by the board that is adverse to the prevailing party can not be essential to the judgment because by definition it could not have affected the outcome of the case.tdc contends,therefore,that in considering tdc to be bound by the board findings regarding the omissions,the district court plainly erred.
in tdc i,this court stated that the board expressly reserved for the district court the legal determination of whether tdc failure to report its financial stake in program operations constituted fraud,and that i n disposing of tdc contract claim,the board made no necessary findings about umta reliance on tdc reports.tdc i,at.notwithstanding the instruction in tdc i and what tdc now correctly contends is clear error by the district court,tdc did not alert the district court to its error.on remand,tdc never argued that it should not be precluded from relitigating umta reliance on the omissions because those findings were not necessary to the board decision.rather,as the district court noted,in opposing the government motion for summary judgment tdc fail ed to address,let alone dispute,the collateral estoppel effect of the board opinion with regards to omissions from its monthly reports to umta.instead,tdc suggest ed that the false claims act claim based on omissions wa s a new claim which require d further discovery.remand opinion at.nor in its motion for clarification under rule did tdc argue that the district court collateral estoppel ruling as
