section c of the urban mass transportation act of umta,now codified at b,requires state and local governments seeking federal financial assistance for transit operations to have in place fair and equitable provisions for the protection of employees.each time an applicant requests funds from the federal transit administration fta under umta,the secretary of labor must certify that c is satisfied.
since,the city of colorado springs,colorado the city has been a party to a labor agreement with amalgamated transit union,local the union pursuant to c the agreement.the city wishes to be relieved of provisions of the agreement that it contends go beyond c requirements.in connection with a certain grant application,the dol rejected the city objections to the agreement and certified the agreement for purposes of that grant.the city then brought suit under the administrative procedure act apa.the district court affirmed,see city of colorado springs chao,d,and the city appeals.we have jurisdiction under.concluding that the dol did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in rejecting the city objections,we affirm.
background 
a.the urban mass transportation act 
under umta,governmental entities may seek federal financial assistance for acquiring,improving,running public systems.congress enacted umta to respond to the increasingly precarious financial condition of a number of private transportation companies across the country because it feared that communities might be left without adequate mass transportation.jackson transit auth.local div,d.at the same time,however,congress was aware that public ownership might threaten existing rights of unionized transit workers employed by private companies.id.in response to this concern,congress included c in umta t o prevent federal funds from being used to destroy the rights of organized workers.id.thus,c sets forth minimal standards that a governmental transit authority must satisfy before it may receive federal funding.burke utah transit,cir.
specifically,c requires that the interests of employees affected by the assistance shall be protected under arrangements the secretary of labor concludes are fair and equitable.b.such arrangements must include six specified types of provisions,including provisions for the continuation of collective bargaining rights and provisions protecting employment rights.id.b.agreements entered into between governmental bodies and unions to satisfy c commonly are called c agreements.the agreement is the city c agreement.it is undisputed that the agreement contains the provisions c requires.city of.springs,d at.
certification of c agreements 
each time a governmental body seeks financial assistance from the fta under umta,the dol must certify to the fta that c is satisfied.effective january,the dol implemented the current administrative guidelines for issuing such certifications the guidelines.see.where employees are represented by a labor organization,as in this case,controls.
once the dol receives an application for fta assistance and a request for certification of employee protective arrangements,it refers the application to the labor organization and notifies the applicant of the referral.id.b.for applicants with previously certified arrangements,the referral will be based on those terms and conditions.id.b.following referral and notification parties will be expected to engage in good faith efforts to reach mutually acceptable protective arrangements through within the regulatory timeframes.id.c.within fifteen days of the referral and notification,parties may submit objections to the referred terms.id.d.the parties are encouraged to engage in during this period with the aim of arriving at a mutually agreeable solution to objections any party has to the terms and conditions of the referral.id.
if a party objects,the dol has ten days from the response deadline to determine whether the objection is sufficient.id.d i.under the regulations,the dol 
will consider an objection to be sufficient when 
i the objection raises material issues that may require alternative employee protections under b or 
ii the objection concerns changes in legal or factual circumstances that may materially affect the rights or interests of employees.
if the dol determines that there are no sufficient objections,it will issue a certification.id.d.but if the dol determines that an objection is sufficient,it will direct the parties to engage in negotiations regarding the issue.id.d.if such negotiations produce an agreement that,in the dol view,satisfies c,then the certification will be based on the terms of the parties agreement.id.d.if the negotiations are not successful,the dol will issue an interim certification based on terms and conditions that it has set which are no less protective than the terms and conditions included in the referral.id.even after issuing an interim certification,however,the dol will oversee further proceedings to resolve the dispute.id.e.ultimately the dol will issue a final determination,based either on an agreement by the parties or the dol resolution of the dispute.id.g.
in adopting the guidelines,the dol departed from its previous practice.the prior guidelines did not require objections to be sufficient for the dol to oversee negotiations of a new c agreement.see,discussing guidelines effective may.instead,we are informed,any objection would trigger renegotiations.
c.the administrative proceedings 
in april,in an application assigned grant number,the city applied for fta assistance to purchase two new buses to replace aging vehicles.the agreement has no termination provision,so it was still in effect when the city applied for grant.noting that t he department has previously certified protective arrangements that are appropriate for application to the instant project,the dol referred the application and the agreement to the union.aplt.app.at.both the city and the union filed timely objections.
the city objected to the following five provisions of the agreement a provision requiring interest arbitration a clause regarding the filling of new jobs created as a result of a federal project a provision that any new terms must have economic value equal to or greater than existing terms a paragraph that provides guarantees of continued employment in the event the transit system is acquired and a paragraph concerning renegotiation of unenforceable terms,which omitted the city as a negotiating party.citing numerous cases and prior dol rulings,the city contended that the first four provisions were not legally required to satisfy c.it further argued that the provision was contrary to colorado law.thus,the city urged the dol to conclude that there were material issues requiring alternative employee protections and that there had been changes in legal or factual circumstances,which would allow the city to force renegotiation of the provisions using the procedure.
in its objection,the union argued that a recent colorado order raised material issues relative to the rights and interests of the local employees.aplt.app.at.the union indicated the court had held that the city was not obligated to arbitrate differences between it and the union.as thus construed by the state court,then,the agreement fails to satisfy the minimum requirements of the umta,which the department has long concluded mandate the availability of arbitration over any section c disputes.id.
by letter dated may,the dol concluded that neither the city nor the union objections were sufficient because neither party had made a sufficient showing of material issues or changes in legal or factual circumstances.id.at.with regard to the city objection regarding the provision,the dol added,should the colorado courts,at some time in the future,rule that interest arbitration is not available to the private sector employees of the management company represented by atu local or that the interest arbitration provision of the city c agreement is unenforceable upon the city,the department will consider the circumstances then presented.id.at.accordingly,the dol issued its c certification for grant.
on july,the city wrote to the dol,indicating that it objected to the may decision and certification.the city informed the dol that it was filing a complaint under the apa in the federal district court to challenge the decision.the city then set forth a proposal regarding the handling of future grants during the pendency of the lawsuit.that proposal included a request that the department rescind its final certification for fta grant and issue an interim certification for that grant on the basis of certain standard c terms the dol has promulgated,so that grant and future grants would proceed under those standard terms during the pendency of the lawsuit.id.at.by letter dated july,the union opposed the city request.the dol responded by letter dated august.rejecting the city proposal,the dol stated 
in order for objections to be deemed sufficient to warrant negotiations regarding previously certified protective arrangements,parties objections must raise material issues that may require alternative employee protections under the statute,d i,or changes in legal or factual circumstances that may materially affect the rights or interests of employees,d ii.
before the department directs the negotiation of a particular term or provision under d,a party must show that a particular provision no longer meets the statutory requirements for employee protection,b,and therefore an alternative provision must be substituted in order for the arrangement to meet those statutory criteria under either d i or ii,an objection is considered sufficient only if it concerns a provision of a previously certified protective arrangement that no longer meets the statutory criteria of b.thus,an objection is not considered sufficient under either standard when it is based on an assertion that the provision exceeds the level of protections required by the statute.these guidelines,as applied by the department,properly recognize that negotiated protective arrangements may contain terms not specifically required by the statute.because such arrangements are the product of bilateral,or in some cases multilateral,negotiations between the parties for which mutual consideration was provided at the time of initial negotiations,the department will not direct unnecessary negotiation of one provision extracted from the entire agreement,a result that would upset the equilibrium struck in the agreement as a whole.
d.the district court proceedings 
contemporaneously with sending its july letter to the dol,the city filed its complaint in the district court.the complaint alleged that the may decision was arbitrary and capricious because the dol failed to explain the decision the dol failed to follow its own precedents,thereby treating the city differently than other regulated entities and the decision imposed interest arbitration on the city,in violation of the colorado constitution.the complaint also challenged as arbitrary and capricious the dol failure to relieve the city of each of the other clauses the city considered excessive,as well as the clause excluding the city from renegotiations.further,the complaint alleged that the decision was arbitrary and capricious because the dol misused the guidelines to avoid the application of existing law.id.at.the city requested a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.
the district court allowed the union to intervene as a party in the action.thereafter,the parties filed a number of documents concerning the contents of the administrative record.ultimately,the district court allowed the parties to supplement the record with letters from the union and the city that predated the may decision and a copy of the agreement.but the court granted the city motion to strike the july,july,and august letters from the administrative record.the court stated that the letters clearly were not among the documents and materials the dol considered in connection with the may denial,and rejected the dol contention that they were part of the whole administrative record.instead,the court held that the july letter was not a motion for reconsideration,and that the august letter is simply a post hoc rationalization for the dol may,decision,developed and generated in response to the allegations contained in the complaint.id.at.
after briefing,the district court reached the merits of the parties claims.the court held that the four provisions identified by the city clearly exceed c requirements.city of.springs,d at.but in light of c narrow transit workers collective bargaining dol was not required to invalidate overly protective terms in a c agreement.see id.neither the statute nor the guidelines provide a means for a transit entity to modify the terms of a section c agreement unless the disputed terms materially impact employee s collective bargaining rights.id.the district court further held that the dol explanation for its decision was adequate for review,and that the dol did not impermissibly depart from its precedents in denying the city objections.see id.at.while colorado springs points me to past decisions showing the provisions exceed the statutory minimum,the city points me to no prior decisions in which dol determined that an objection to provisions that exceed the statutory minimum considered sufficient under the guidelines.id.at.concluding that the dol decision was not arbitrary and capricious,the district court affirmed.see id.at.the city appeals.
ii.analysis 
reviewability under the apa 
both appellees allege that the may decision is judicially unreviewable.the union argues that review is not available under the apa because the decision is one committed to agency discretion by law.see a.and the dol argues that the decision was not a final agency action as the apa requires.see id.we address each argument in turn.
the decision is not unreviewable as a decision committed to agency discretion by law.
the apa does not apply to the extent that agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.a.invoking this subsection,the union suggests that the dol decision is unreviewable because the determination whether particular protective arrangements are fair and equitable is committed to agency discretion by law.
the supreme court has recognized that the apa embod ies a basic presumption of judicial review.lincoln vigil,d quotation omitted.but that presumption can be rebutted even where congress has not affirmatively precluded review,review is not to be had if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion.heckler chaney,d.in such a case,the statute law can be taken to have committed the decisionmaking to the agency judgment absolutely.id.in short,there is no judicial review of an agency decision where there is no law for the court to apply.thomas brooks chartered burnett,cir 
the union relies on cases concluding that a precludes review of the secretary decision that protective arrangements are fair and equitable.see local div.metro.atlanta rapid transit,cir kendler wirtz,cir city of macon marshall,see also amalgamated transit union int l donovan,distinguishing kendler and city of macon.but it is the guidelines which underlie the city appeal.w hile the determination of whether there is law to apply often focuses on the controlling statute,we have previously recognized that the law to apply can also be derived from the agency regulations where the agency is acting pursuant to those regulations.mcalpine united states,cir see also thomas brooks chartered,at affirmative agency action is reviewable where the agency purports to act pursuant to its own rules,rather than a statute.the failure of an agency to follow its own regulations is challengeable under the apa.while acknowledging that t here is no statutory authority to issue regulations under section b,the dol has stated that t he guidelines are intended to be binding.see also jacob stein et,administrative law w hen an agency issues a binding interpretation of its organic statute,it has issued a rule,regardless of whether or not the agency calls it a rule.in light of the guidelines,the supreme court decision in citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d,provides the most appropriate authority for measuring reviewability in this appeal.
in overton park,the supreme court held that a did not preclude judicial review of the secretary of transportation decision to authorize the expenditure of federal funds to construct a highway through a park.id.at.noting that the agency discretion provision is a very narrow exception,the court held that the provision is applicable only in those rare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.id.quoting.because the applicable statutes set forth clear and specific directives to guide the secretary discretionary decision,there was law to apply for the purposes of judicial review.id.at.where appropriate,this court has relied on overton park rationale in declining to apply a.see.envtl.coal.wenker,cir per curiam payton dep t of,cir mcalpine,at thomas brooks chartered,at.
there is law to apply in this case because the guidelines supply clear and specific directives to guide the dol in determining whether an objection is sufficient.see d i ii.we conclude that a does not preclude review.
the may,letter was final for purposes of judicial review.
the apa provides for judicial review of final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.the dol argues that the may decision was not a final agency action because the city,through its july letter,sought reconsideration of the decision at the same time it filed its complaint in the district court.therefore,the dol contends,when the complaint was filed,the decision was not final and ripe for judicial review.
section states except as otherwise expressly required by statute,agency action otherwise final is final for the purposes of this section whether or not there has been presented or determined an application for any form of reconsideration but this provision does not mean that a petition for reconsideration can not affect the finality of an agency action.that language has long been construed by this and other courts merely to relieve parties from the requirement of petitioning for rehearing before seeking judicial review but not to prevent petitions for reconsideration that are actually filed from rendering the orders under reconsideration nonfinal.of locomotive eng rs,d.accordingly,in most circumstances a case is not ripe for judicial review where a petition for reconsideration has been filed within a discretionary review period specifically provided by the agency.id.at.
as construed in locomotive engineers the apa embrace s a tolling rule the timely filing of a motion to reconsider renders the underlying order nonfinal for purposes of judicial review.in consequence,pendency of reconsideration renders the underlying decision not yet final,and it is implicit in the tolling rule that a party who has sought rehearing can not seek judicial review until the rehearing has concluded.
but the tolling rule is not applicable in this case because the dol has not established a rehearing or reconsideration procedure for c certifications.thus,there is no discretionary review period specifically provided by the agency of which the city could avail itself.further,as the district court noted in granting the city motion to strike,it is not clear that the july letter intended to seek reconsideration of the may decision,as opposed to suggesting a procedure for moving forward during the pendency of the city challenge to that decision.accordingly,we conclude that the dol may decision was a final agency action subject to judicial review.
standard of review 
we take an independent review of the agency action and are not bound by the district court factual findings or legal conclusions.utah envtl.cong.bosworth,cir quotation omitted.informal agency action is reviewed under the standard set forth in a,requiring agency action be set aside if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.see overton park,at.mcalpine,at.the critical question in answering this inquiry is whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.mcalpine,at quoting overton park,at.although this inquiry into the facts is to be searching and careful,the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one.the court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.id.quoting overton park,at.
merits analysis 
the city contends that the certification decision was arbitrary and capricious because the dol failed to follow its precedent and did not explain its departure from prior decisions the dol decision provided absolutely no discussion,explanation,or rationale for its conclusion that the city objections were not sufficient,aplt.br.at and the guidelines should not be interpreted to require,for an objection to be sufficient,that the objection address employee protections,rights,or interests 
the dol did not impermissibly fail to follow its precedent.
the city argues that the agreement provisions concerning interest arbitration,new jobs,minimum economic value,and successor employers are not required by c.in its administrative objections,the city cited numerous proceedings in which the dol upheld objections to,and allowed parties to renegotiate,such provisions.the city complains that the dol failure to deem the city objections sufficient resulted from a failure to follow such precedent,and the dol then compounded its offense by failing to explain why it was departing from its precedent.thus,the city contends,the dol is requiring the city to continue shouldering burdensome obligations from which it has relieved other municipalities.for these reasons,the city argues that the dol decision was arbitrary and capricious.
as the district court recognized,it appears that the city is correct that c does not require the provisions to which the city objects.city of.springs,d at.further,we agree with the city that a gencies are under an obligation to follow their own regulations,procedures,and precedents,or provide a rational explanation for their departures.big horn coal temple,cir quotation omitted see also midwestern,interstate commerce comm n,cir t he court must require the agency to adhere to its own pronouncements or explain its departure from them an agency must apply criteria it has announced as controlling or otherwise satisfactorily explain the basis for its departure therefrom.but the other basic premises of the city argument are flawed for at least two reasons.
first,the dol did not depart from its applicable precedents without explanation.with only one exception,the dol decisions upon which the city relies were issued before the adoption of the guidelines.as discussed above,in lieu of the prior procedure,the guidelines implemented a requirement that objections be sufficient to trigger the negotiation process.in light of the adoption of the guidelines,and the implementation of a new,more stringent standard,the dol was not necessarily bound by decisions rendered under the more lenient standard.and given the obvious change in the legal landscape,the dol is not required to provide a particularized explanation for its failure to follow decisions.see midwestern,at holding that any departure from prior criteria was adequately supported and justified by newly enacted statute and policy.
the city did cite one decision in which the dol directed negotiations over interest dispute procedures because an interest arbitration procedure was not enforceable under state law.see metro.tulsa transit,no.dep t of labor,final certification.but the dol may letter effectively distinguished that precedent by indicating it was not convinced that interest arbitration was unavailable under colorado law.
second,the city fails to recognize the narrow scope of the c certification procedure.as the dol states on appeal,
the city seeks to enlist dol in the city effort to extricate itself from provisions to which the city agreed when,in,it concluded an agreement to which the parties did not attach an expiration date.apparently,the union has been unwilling to renegotiate them.and,understandably,the city is frustrated.
