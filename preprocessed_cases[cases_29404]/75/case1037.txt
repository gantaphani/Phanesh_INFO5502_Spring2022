bfi waste systems of north america,bfi,petitions for review of a federal aviation administration faa decision,see appendix for petitioner ja at affirmation,affirming the faa earlier determination that bfi proposed expansion of a landfill near denver international airport dia would be a hazard to air navigation,see id.at hazard determination or determination.bfi claims,inter alia,that the affirmation and determination are arbitrary,capricious and otherwise unlawful and that the substantive findings underlying them are unsupported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.we agree and therefore grant the petition for review.
the following factual recitation is divided into two first explaining the regulatory regime of the faa and the second detailing how bfi landfill proposal was or was not processed within that regime.
under the federal aviation act of act,the faa is authorized to determine whether a proposed construction or alteration project will present a hazard to air navigation.the act states that the faa b y regulation shall require a person to give adequate public notice of the proposed construction,alteration,establishment,or expansion,of a structure or sanitary landfill when the notice will promote safety in air commerce and the efficient use and preservation of the navigable airspace and of airport traffic capacity at airports.a.pursuant to its statutory authority,the faa has promulgated regulations requiring a project sponsor to notify the faa when the sponsor proposes,inter alia,any alteration resulting in a sanitary landfill of more than feet in height above the ground level at its site.a.under the regulations,e ach person who is required to notify the faa under a shall send to it one executed form set four copies of faa form,notice of proposed construction or alteration.a.the information contained in the form is meant to provide the faa with a basis for determining the possible hazardous effect of the proposed construction or alteration on air navigation.b.
in addition to setting out notice requirements,the regulations provide the standards by which alteration proposals are evaluated.for instance,subpart c of the regulations establishes standards for determining obstructions to air navigation and applies to existing and proposed manmade objects,objects of natural growth,and terrain.a.subpart c states that a proposed manmade object,like a landfill,is an obstruction to air navigation if it is feet above ground level at the site of the object,a,or if it is feet above ground level within nautical miles of the established reference point of an airport,excluding heliports,a.under faa order d,procedures for handling airspace matters,faa handbook a binding set of faa guidelines,see afonso realty trust garvey,faa handbook is controlling a proposed object that exceeds the standards of subpart c is presumed to have a substantial adverse effect on the use of airspace and is therefore presumed to be a hazard to air navigation unless an aeronautical study determines otherwise.faa handbook b.
the act and the regulations require the faa,in certain circumstances,to conduct an aeronautical study to determine the extent of any adverse impact on the use of airspace.the relevant provision of the statute provides that 
u nder regulations prescribed by the secretary of transportation,if the faa decides that constructing or altering a structure may result in an obstruction of the navigable airspace or an interference with air navigation facilities and equipment or the navigable airspace,it shall conduct an aeronautical study to decide the extent of any adverse impact on the safe and efficient use of the airspace,facilities,or equipment.
b.pursuant to this statutory authority,the secretary has prescribed subpart d,which provides that 
t he regional manager,air traffic division of the region in which the proposed construction or alteration would be located conducts an aeronautical study that may include the physical and electromagnetic radiation effect the proposal may have on the operation of an air navigation facility 
to the extent considered necessary,the regional manager s olicits comments from all interested persons e xplores objections to the proposal and attempts to develop recommendations for adjustment of aviation requirements that would accommodate the proposed construction or alteration and c onvenes a meeting with all interested persons for the purpose of gathering all facts relevant to the effect of the proposed construction or alteration on the safe and efficient utilization of the navigable airspace.
a,b.once an aeronautical study has been initiated,the faa applies all of its operational,procedural and electronic standards including those pertaining to radar coverage to determine if the object being studied would actually be a hazard to air navigation.faa handbook b see id.an object to be considered for adverse aeronautical effect must first exceed the obstruction standards of subpart c be found to have physical or electromagnetic radiation effect on the operation of air navigation facilities.upon the study conclusion,the regional manager issues a determination.see c.in order to issue a hazard determination,the regional manager must find by a clear showing that the object in question will have a substantial adverse effect on air navigation.afonso,at citing faa handbook to,see also faa handbook.the regional manager determination is final unless the faa grants discretionary review.see.
a determination has no enforceable legal effect.aircraft owners pilots ass faa.the faa lacks authority to prohibit a construction or alteration it believes to be hazardous to air navigation see id.at.nonetheless,a hazard determination can hinder the project sponsor in acquiring insurance,securing financing or obtaining approval from state or local authorities.see id.
bfi is a waste disposal company that operates solid waste landfills in colorado,including the tower road landfill at issue here.the tower road landfill is located approximately two miles west of dia in commerce city,colorado.before bfi had permission from state and local authorities to extend the landfill vertically to feet above ground level agl at its tallest point.in february bfi obtained state and local authorization to increase the landfill height by feet to feet agl over a period of years.thus,as of march,the faa regulatory approval was the final approval needed in order to expand.
on march,bfi representatives met with an official from the faa denver airports district office ado.at the meeting,bfi submitted a preliminary faa form to the faa and the attendees discussed the proposal potential impact on airport traffic and radar operations.emphasizing the need to perform analysis before drawing conclusions,the ado informed bfi that t he degree of impact to the airport surveillance radar line of sight will need to be studied and no commitments are being made at this time.ja.on april bfi formally submitted a form to the faa northwest mountain region regarding the alteration proposal.the faa received the form,at the earliest,on april.on april the faa northwest mountain region issued a notice that it intended to conduct an aeronautical study to determine the effect of the landfill expansion on air navigation.at no time did the faa circularize the aeronautical study notice to interested parties or even to bfi on may tower road landfill officials met with ado representatives who briefly toured the landfill.although the record recites that potential radar effects were currently being reviewed,id.at,it does not state that radar issues were in fact discussed at the meeting.
on august,the faa northwest mountain region issued the hazard determination,which consisted of a form cover letter and a summary of findings.the determination identified five adverse impacts on the safe and efficient use of navigable airspace at dia birds attracted to the landfill could interfere with aircraft large dump trucks and other heavy equipment operating on the landfill could block or reflect radar signals the increased size of the landfill could cause interference with radar coverage for aircraft executing missed approaches on runway at nearby jefferson county airport the increased size of the landfill could cause interference with radar coverage of the missed approach points for dia runway and,during certain weather conditions,dia runways and and the increased size of the landfill could cause interference with radar coverage for lifeguard,police,media and business helicopters operating in downtown denver,miles southwest of the landfill.because dia currently handles more than million aircraft operations a year,the determination stated,the impacts,taken individually or cumulatively,have a substantial adverse effect on the use of airspace and are determined to be hazards to air navigation.id.at.on september,bfi filed a petition for administrative review of the hazard determination.on march,the faa granted review.the faa notice of review invited interested persons to submit comments to the faa and bfi did so.
on july,the faa affirmed its initial hazard determination.the affirmation first abandoned several of the findings made in the determination,concluding that neither bird problems nor interference with radar coverage of jefferson county airport or of dia runways,or would result from bfi landfill alteration.the affirmation did,however,affirm two of the determination five findings of adverse effect vehicles on top of the landfill at its maximum height could cause radar reflections and radar coverage of helicopters could be limited.furthermore,the faa based its affirmation on two adverse effects not mentioned in the determination,the possibility that bfi proposal would affect radar coverage of dia runway and proposed but unbuilt dia runway.
on september,bfi timely petitioned for review.
on march,we ordered the parties to submit simultaneous briefs addressing the question of bfi constitutional standing to pursue its claims in light of the advisory nature of the faa hazard determination and affirmation.we now conclude that on the record before us bfi has satisfied article iii standing,it has shown that it has suffered or will suffer an injury in fact which is concrete and particularized,actual or imminent,fairly trace able to the challenged action and redress able by a favorable decision,lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotations omitted see afonso,at.
pursuant to colorado law,see,bfi applied to the city council of commerce city for a certificate of designation permitting it to expand the tower road landfill.under,the colorado department of public health and environment cdphe provided commerce city with a required report on bfi proposal,stating that the expansion would comply with applicable environmental laws,provided that a ny restriction of elevation imposed by faa under applicable federal law is honored.ja.relying on the cdphe report,the city council approved bfi expansion proposal with the express caveat that if the faa determined there is a problem,the council has authority to review the certificate of designation to determine if the approval needs to be reconsidered,and changes made as necessary.id.at.because,as we noted earlier,an faa hazard determination itself has no enforceable legal effect,aircraft owners pilots ass n,at,it does not function as a restriction on landfill elevation in the same way that a binding federal statute or regulation would.nonetheless,a hazard determination is the only means by which the faa can restrict,within the meaning of the cdphe report,the elevation of the tower road landfill.accordingly,we conclude that the cdphe report,which was incorporated into the city council approval,expressly conditioned bfi certificate of designation on the faa of a hazard determination.we therefore credit bfi by the declaration of its regional in charge of the tower road it faces a concrete,imminent injury from the reopening and modification of the state and local approvals as a result of the hazard determination.plainly,the injury is fairly trace able to the challenged action that is,the faa alleged arbitrary and capricious it is redress able by a favorable decision,one vacating and remanding the determination and affirmation.lujan,at.at.
having determined that bfi petition for review is properly before us,we now turn to the faa determination and affirmation to determine whether,based on the administrative record,they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.the faa determinations are arbitrary and capricious if,inter alia,they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.motor vehicle mfrs.ass ruckelshaus,see c.we address bfi two major claims in turn.
first,bfi contends that the determination and affirmation were arbitrary,capricious and otherwise unlawful because the faa violated its own standards in conducting an aeronautical study without circularizing notice thereof and without negotiating with bfi to identify mitigation measures that could eliminate purported adverse effects and failing to give bfi notice of the two new issues it relied on in affirming the determination.both prongs of bfi first contention are meritorious.
when the faa conducts an aeronautical study,it must 
t o the extent considered necessary s olicit comments from all interested persons e xplore objections to the proposal and attempts to develop recommendations for adjustment of aviation requirements that would accommodate the proposed construction or alteration and c onvene a meeting with all interested persons for the purpose of gathering all facts relevant to the effect of the proposed construction or alteration on the safe and efficient utilization of the navigable airspace.
b emphasis added.here,the faa performed none of these tasks nor did it explain its reasons for declining to do so.the government argues that the to the extent considered necessary language of section gives the agency discretion not to perform the tasks.its argument,however,ignores the act,the faa handbook and the relevant case law.as the eighth circuit has held,section must be interpreted to require the faa to provide interested persons with an opportunity to comment upon proposed construction where notice would promote air safety and efficiency.white,faa,cir emphasis added.the white holding is unsurprising given that the faa authority derives from its statutory mandate to insure the safe and efficient use of airspace.id.emphasis added see.the handbook states that n ormally,any propos al that would affect an airport or require a change in aeronautical operations or procedures should always be circularized and it then enumerates six specific circumstances,not applicable here,in which c ircularization should not be necessary.faa handbook emphasis added.because circularization helps e xplain the probable effects of a proposal in sufficient detail to assist interested persons in formulating comments on how the proposal would affect aeronautical operations,id,it is an essential step in determining how to tailor the sponsor proposal to strike a proper balance between safety interests and efficiency interests.see greater orlando aviation auth.faa,cir faa obliged to do more than just pay lip service to comments endorsing potential uses of navigable airspace.
the faa unexplained failure to solicit comments as directed by the handbook was arbitrary and capricious,see afonso,at t he requirement that agency action not be arbitrary and capricious includes a requirement that the agency adequately explain its result.quotations omitted,especially in light of the fact that faa staff members themselves believed it would be helpful if bfi suggested possible solutions to the agency radar coverage concerns,see ja.the brief march,occurred before bfi formally filed its proposal and before the faa decision to conduct an aeronautical not substitute for an opportunity,open to all interested parties,to submit written comments on the proposal.
moreover,the faa acted arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to negotiate with bfi,pursuant to b,a compromise accommodat ion plan that would resolve anticipated impacts of the proposal.the handbook explicitly requires the faa,in circumstances where the proposed structure may create harm
