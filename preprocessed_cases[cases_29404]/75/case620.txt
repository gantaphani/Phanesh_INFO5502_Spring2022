the present dispute stems from a dealer sales and service agreement between franchisor general motors corporation gm and franchisee stone motor company stone motor.in,after two years of disappointing vehicle sales,stone motor elected to sell its dealership and franchise.according to stone motor,the dealership failed because gm provided an insufficient number of vehicles and withheld models.in,approximately two years after the sale,stone motor instituted the present suit against gm alleging fraud,breach of contract,prima facie tort,and violation of the missouri motor vehicle franchise practices act.stat.et.mvfpa.
gm originally moved to dismiss all claims under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted gm motion to dismiss regarding the fraud,tort,and statutory claims.thereafter,gm filed an answer in which it asserted a defense based on a written release.stone motor referenced the release in the original complaint,but gm did not have a copy of the release when filing the answer.following receipt of the release through discovery,gm moved for judgment on the pleadings.before the district court ruled on gm motion for judgment on the pleadings,gm filed a motion seeking summary judgment on the remaining claim for breach of contract.gm reasserted the release defense in its summary judgment motion.the district court granted summary judgment without addressing the validity of the release.
stone motor appeals the district court dismissal of the statutory claims and grant of summary judgment,but not the dismissal of the fraud or prima facie tort claims.for the reasons discussed below,the grant of summary judgment and dismissal of statutory claims are reversed,and the case is remanded to the district court to conduct the factual findings necessary to determine the validity of the release.
in stone motor purchased a cuba,missouri,dealership and franchise.prior to the purchase,stone motor received inflated historical sales data from the selling franchisee.stone motor purchased the dealership in reliance on this inflated data and based sales projections for its franchise application on this data.gm received and approved the franchise application without notifying stone motor that the historical figures were inflated.the failure to correct stone motor own sales projections served as the foundation for stone motor fraud claim.although stone motor did not receive notice regarding the inflated data,gm did send a letter to stone motor advising that the dealership facilities were substantially larger than facilities for area dealerships having similar sales volume.in the letter,gm further advised that this heightened capacity would not create an entitlement to extra inventory.
on september,gm and stone motor executed an agreement and a separately signed,preamble document.the preamble document contained recitations that described the parties general goals and objectives.the agreement recognized that gm had a duty to allocate vehicles among its various dealers and reserved to gm broad and sole discretion in the selection and allocation of vehicles to stone motor.the agreement did not articulate any quotas or impose on gm a duty to provide any particular mixture of vehicle models.
after commencing operations under the agreement,gm provided more vehicles to stone motor than it had provided to the prior franchisee.however,gm did not provide as many vehicles as stone motor desired.further,as a percentage of the vehicles provided,gm did not provide trucks and sport utility vehicles at the levels desired by stone motor.finally,stone motor identified instances wherein gm delayed in filling orders,refused to fill an order,or advised stone motor to refer a customer to a different gm dealer.as a result of the dealership poor economic performance,stone motor elected to sell the dealership and franchise to a dealer in a nearby town.gm approved the sale of the franchise.
on july,at the closing for the sale of stone motor dealership and franchise,virgil stone,individually and in his capacity as the president of stone motor,signed a release of all claims against gm.the release recited as consideration the sum of one dollar in hand paid by general motors corporation,chevrolet motor division,a delaware corporation,receipt of which is hereby acknowledged and other good and valuable consideration.virgil stone was accompanied at the closing by two attorneys,his personal attorney as well as counsel for stone motor.stone motor alleges that no gm representative was present at the closing.the record is unclear regarding how the release arrived at the closing.
it is undisputed that stone motor executed the release and that all of stone motor allegations relate to events that occurred prior to execution of the release.as such,there is no dispute that the release bars all of the present claims if the release is a valid contract.stone motor disputes the validity of the release based on theories of lack of consideration and economic duress.
stone motor asserts via affidavit that the recited peppercorn was never paid and that no other valuable consideration was exchanged.gm argues that the parol evidence rule prevents the introduction of evidence to contradict the release unambiguous recitation of consideration.gm further argues that,even if parol evidence were admissible,the approval of stone motor sale of the franchise to the subsequent franchisee served as the other good and valuable consideration alluded to by the release.stone motor counters that the approval was granted prior to closing and comprised past consideration incapable of supporting the release.
missouri contract law provides an exception to the parol evidence rule that allows parties to introduce extrinsic evidence to rebut recitations of consideration if the recitation is a mere recitation of fact,such as the acknowledgment of payment received,and is not a part of the terms of the contract itself.in cit,lark,the missouri court of appeals stated 
c onsideration,or lack thereof,may always be shown by extrinsic evidence in a controversy between the original parties to an agreement even if the evidence tends to vary the consideration stated in the agreement.this exception applies only to contracts in which the named consideration is a mere recital of a fact of something done,such as the acknowledgment of the receipt of a payment.
id.at quoting rose howard,other citations omitted.this court has previously recognized and discussed missouri exception to the parol evidence rule 
when the recital of a consideration in a written contract can be fairly regarded as a mere recital,or a statement of the receipt of money,then such recital may be explained by parol,and the actual consideration for the contract shown even though to do so may apparently contradict the recital in the contract.in this class of cases the recital as to the consideration is regarded in the same light as a receipt for money and may be explained,or even contradicted by parol but,if the statement in a written contract in relation to the consideration shows upon its face that the expressed consideration is a part of the terms of the contract itself,then that part of the writing stands as any other part,and it can not be contradicted,added to,nor subtracted from,by parol.

gm argues that the present recitation is not a mere recitation but rather comprises a part of the contract itself.we disagree.the present recitation is precisely the type of inattentive mere recitation envisioned by the missouri courts that fashioned the exception.ezo louis smelting refining,refusing to apply the exception but stating,the statement in an instrument,without more,of a certain amount of money as the consideration for the execution of the instrument is indeed frequently to be regarded as but the inattentive recital of valuable consideration not intended to be specifically and accurately expressed.here,gm and stone motor literally employed a mere recital by executing a release without specifically identifying the true value exchanged or the actual forbearance exercised by either party.
by contrast,in cases where the missouri courts refused to apply the exception,the recited consideration was not analogous to a receipt for money,roberts,at.for example,in meyer weber,the missouri court of appeals refused to apply the exception to the parol evidence rule because the recitation of consideration was a promise of future,ongoing payment in exchange for the services of certain musicians.such a recitation of consideration was a contract term rather than a mere recitation.id.at.similarly,the missouri court of appeals refused to apply the exception to a computer equipment lease where a plaintiff sought to introduce parol evidence to show that the agreement was intended to relate to certain software not listed within the written instrument detailed recitation of leased hardware and software.cit,at.in the present case,the present recitation of one dollar and other good and valuable consideration does not reflect any attempt by the parties to identify the true nature of the value exchanged or forbearance exercised as such,missouri exception applies and parol evidence is admissible to test the veracity of the recitation.
the only evidence in the record regarding the payment of consideration is contradictory.the contract recites payment and virgil stone affidavit rebuts the contract.regarding other valuable consideration,gm argues that the release was signed as a part of the overall sale of the franchise and is therefore supported by the consideration involved in the transfer of the franchise.virgil stone did sign the release as a part of the sale of the franchise to the subsequent owner.however,the record indicates that gm provided some type of approval for the sale prior to virgil stone execution of the release.stone motor argues that the timing of the prior approval demonstrates that the approval was already in hand and could not serve as consideration for a later contract.stone motor then asserts that the release was signed as required by gm.through this assertion,stone motor appears to contradict itself by conceding that gm approval was still pending or uncertain at the time of closing.suffice it to say,the record is not clear regarding the closing of stone motor sale and the signing of the release.accordingly,an evidentiary hearing is required to determine whether the release is supported by consideration.
stone motor argues in the alternative that the release must fail because it was signed under a state of economic duress caused by gm.stone motor argument lacks merit.virgil stone was accompanied by two attorneys when he signed the release,his personal attorney and the attorney for stone motor.stone motor,through its representative virgil stone,was not deprived of its free will.stone motor faced a choice sign the release and sell the franchise or retain the franchise and seek available legal remedies.it is undisputed that stone motor was represented by counsel and had ample opportunity to understand its rights.under such circumstances,the eighth circuit and the courts of missouri have uniformly rejected attempts to void contracts under a theory of economic duress.see schmalz hardy salt,where an experienced business man takes sufficient time,seeks the advice of counsel and understands the content of what he is signing,he can not claim the execution of the release is the product of duress.see also anselmo manufacturers life ins,cir although he surely confronted a difficult the termination perks or pursuing his legal rights under the employment fact that the choice was difficult does not mean that he lacked the requisite free will to make the decision.see also landmark north county bank national cable training,to constitute duress,the victim must have been so acted upon by threats of the person claiming the benefit of the release as to deprive the victim of the mental state essential to the making of the contract.
gm argues that,even if the release is infirm,stone motor ratified the release by waiting two years after execution to bring the present action.gm identified no claims,accounts,or liabilities that it waived or refrained from asserting against stone motor due to the release.the mere passage of time,without demonstration of a benefit received due to reliance,can not serve to bind a party to an agreement through ratification.see,diffenderfer heublein,cir finding employee had ratified agreement naming corporate subsidiary as employer after employee received salary and expense payments from subsidiary,borrowed funds from subsidiary without interest,and applied for country club membership listing subsidiary as employer long marine boyland,finding ratification where purchaser of boat dealership acted in accordance with contract by using facilities and selling retained inventory schmalz,at finding former employee ratified release through acceptance of continued employment for finite term following execution of release and acceptance of negotiated sum.the only alleged benefit to stone motor identified by gm is the underlying consideration for the release.if this consideration,in fact,was exchanged,then gm ratification argument is release would have been valid from its inception.on the other hand,if this consideration was not exchanged,then stone motor received no benefit under the release and gm ratification argument fails.in either event,the validity of the release depends upon an evidentiary analysis before the district court.
having determined that outstanding questions of fact preclude disposition of this appeal based on the release,it is necessary to review the district court dismissal of stone motor statutory claim and grant of summary judgment.
missouri,like many states,has a motor vehicle franchise practices statute.stat.the purpose of the mvfpa is to level the contractual playing field between local franchisees and motor vehicle manufacturers.imports subaru,cir in drafting the franchise act,the missouri legislature intended to alter the relative bargaining positions of the new motor vehicle franchisor and franchisee by subordinating express contractual language to notions of reasonableness.stone motor alleges various violations under the mvfpa,specifically,that gm conduct violated section in that gm conduct was capricious,in bad faith,and unconscionable section in that gm unreasonably refused to deliver new motor vehicles in reasonable quantities and within a reasonable time after receipt of orders for vehicles which,as ordered,were publicly advertised by gm to be available for immediate delivery and section in that gm imposed unreasonable standards of performance upon stone

in light of this standard,we can not agree with the district court that stone motor failed to allege facts which,if proven,would support its claims.stone motor allegations identified delays in association with the delivery of specific vehicles,the refusal by gm to process orders,and the refusal by gm to supply stone motor with more popular models in comparable numbers to those supplied to other dealers of the same or similar size in the same geographic region.gm argues that stone motor did not draft its allegations with sufficient specificity.we disagree.to require more of stone motor under a rule b analysis would be to ignore the minimal standards inherent in our system of notice pleading.see fed.civ.a.
