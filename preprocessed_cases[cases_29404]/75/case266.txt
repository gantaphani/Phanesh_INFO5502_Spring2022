the federal highway administration fhwa and the virginia department of transportation vdot collectively,the agencies are planning improvements to virginia interstate corridor using a tiered review process.appellants a group of environmental and preservation organizations challenged the agencies execution of the tiered process,alleging various constitutional and statutory violations.the district court rejected these challenges and granted summary judgment in favor of the agencies.
on appeal,appellants claim that the agencies are attempting to foreclose consideration of environmentally friendly alternatives for specific sections of i by choosing a improvement concept in the first stage of the review process.appellants,however,misapprehend the agencies position.as confirmed at oral argument,the agencies plan to comply with the stipulation in this case and the national environmental policy act nepa,et,by considering alternatives to the concept in subsequent stages.because there is no actual dispute here,and because appellants can not show any injury or imminent threat of injury,this suit is not justiciable.accordingly,we must dismiss the appeal.
nepa requires federal agencies to prepare a detailed statement on the environmental impacts of any major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.the resulting environmental impact statement eis must describe any adverse environmental effects which can not be avoided and rigorously explore alternatives to the proposed action.see.nepa does not mandate substantive results,hughes river watershed conservancy glickman,cir,but it does require agencies to take a hard look at environmental consequences and to disseminate information that allows the public to participate in the decisionmaking process,robertson methow valley citizens council,citation omitted.
agencies are encouraged to conduct a tiered or multiphase analysis when contemplating large or complex projects.see c.at the first tier of major transportation actions,agencies consider broad issues such as general location,mode choice,and areawide air quality and land use implications of the major alternatives.g.the agencies then address details at the second tier.id.this approach allows agencies to eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues and to focus on the actual issues ripe for decision at each level of environmental review.

interstate a major trucking corridor extends miles from tennessee to new york at the canadian border,connecting markets in the northeastern united states and canada to the states.by any measure this highway,and especially some segments of it,bears heavy traffic.in virginia,the i corridor includes many priceless natural and historic properties,including national parks,civil war battlefields,historic landscapes,and main street historic districts.as a spokesman for the national trust for historic preservation noted,m any small towns in the shenandoah valley have worked for many years to preserve their historic character and to revitalize their downtown commercial districts by capitalizing on their historic properties.
fhwa and vdot are upgrading virginia i corridor using a tiered nepa review.in a streamlining agreement,the agencies agreed to make broad,decisions in tier and then evaluate proposals in subsequent stages.the streamlining agreement set forth the decisions that would be made at the conclusion of each tier,established timelines,and explained that the tier process would require the agencies to select a improvement concept,such as adding highway capacity,adding rail capacity,or segregating commercial truck traffic from general purpose traffic.in tier,the agreement stated,the agencies would settle on conceptual design features of the improvements for the components indentified in tier.
fhwa issued a final tier eis on march.the tier eis identified a wide range of approaches for improving i,including a no build concept in which the only projects that would be completed are those that are fully funded through construction a transportation system management tsm concept that included safety improvements,truck climbing lanes,and advanced transportation management systems four different rail concepts involving rail line improvements five roadway concepts involving the addition of vehicle lanes for the entire length of i in virginia five combination concepts that combined rail and highway improvements and five separated lane concepts involving the separation of lanes in the same direction of travel.
the eis analyzed how well each concept would meet i projected capacity and safety needs and the potential impact of each concept on social,economic,and environmental resources.it concluded that the no build concept,a standalone tsm concept,and a rail concept would all fail to satisfy the heavy transportation demands on the i corridor.moreover,the eis determined,no concept that added a uniform number of new lanes separated or not along the entire corridor would satisfy i needs in certain sections without providing more lanes than necessary in other sections.accordingly,the eis settled on a concept that adds a variable number of lanes,based on traffic demands,to individual segments of the corridor.
on june,fhwa issued a tier record of decision rod,which announced that the concept that fhwa was advancing into tier involves constructing no more than two general purpose lanes in each direction,where needed,to address traffic demands.along with this concept,the rod reported,fhwa would advance to tier several,independent safety and operational improvements.importantly,the rod also declared that fhwa would divide virginia i corridor into eight sections of independent utility for analysis at tier.
following issuance of the tier rod,fhwa published a notice of final agency actions in the federal register on june.the notice advised the public of the specific decisions made at the conclusion of tier,that the tier decisions would form the basis of subsequent tier proceedings,that the decisions were final,and that pursuant to l judicial review of the tier decisions would be barred unless sought within days.
appellants filed a complaint in the district court for the western district of virginia within the day period of limitations on december,and amended the complaint on february.count i of the amended complaint charged,among other things,that improvement concepts such as the tsm alternative should have been advanced to tier.count ii alleged that the agencies violated nepa by prematurely approving the tier rod without waiting for the completion of an i freight rail study to fully assess the feasibility of rail as an alternative improvement concept.
finally,count iii entitled violation of due process,charged that the agencies publication of the tier statute of limitations notice will effectively bar appellants from challenging any failure by the agencies to consider alternatives when specific i projects are considered in the tier nepa documents.consequently,count iii asserted,the notice violates appellants right to judicial review of those decisions.
on october,the parties filed a joint stipulation and agreement in order to narrow counts in the pending litigation.the agreement included a stipulation of dismissal in which the parties agreed to dismiss count i with prejudice.the parties expressly disagreed,however,about the impact of the tier rod and limitations period on future claims challenging the scope of alternatives to be considered at tier.appellants described their position as follows
