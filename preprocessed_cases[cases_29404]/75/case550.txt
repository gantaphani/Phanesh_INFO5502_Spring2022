yellow transportation,yellow,terminated ronald mcnamara employment after more than years of service.mcnamara filed suit against yellow alleging retaliation,gender discrimination,and a violation of the family and medical leave act fmla.yellow moved for summary judgment or,in the alternative,for an order to compel arbitration.the district court denied these motions,and yellow appeals.
we hold that mcnamara was not a transportation worker exempted from the federal arbitration act faa.we also hold that mcnamara dispute was subject to a valid arbitration agreement and that yellow did not waive its right to arbitrate by failing to move for arbitration during eeoc proceedings prior to mcnamara filing of this suit.accordingly,we reverse the district court denial of yellow motion to compel arbitration and remand to the district court with directions to enter a stay holding the case in abeyance pending arbitration.
background 
yellow hired mcnamara in january.over the years,mcnamara worked in several different capacities for yellow.he served as a customer relations manager in a call center in sioux falls,south dakota,at the time of the events relevant to the present claims.
on october,yellow instituted a mandatory arbitration program.according to an unrebutted affidavit that yellow submitted with its motions to the district court,yellow circulated a arbitration agreement agreement to its employees via email and via interoffice mail mcnamara does not deny that he received the agreement by either method of delivery.the agreement stated that the arbitration process would become a condition of your employment,effective november,and mcnamara continued as yellow employee after that date.he did not dispute the applicability of the agreement at any time during his employment.
on june,yellow distributed to its employees,including mcnamara,a document entitled yellow,a matter of respect,policy guide to workplace conduct policy guide.the policy guide contained descriptions of yellow policies applicable to union and workers on a wide variety of topics.the policy guide included a copy of the agreement.the first page of the policy guide was a disclaimer with a large font,header stating disclaimer.the balance of the page was in all caps and underlined 
following the disclaimer,every page of the policy guide included a header that stated,this information applies to all employees.in addition,every page included a footer that stated policy guide.pages and of the policy guide contained a reproduction of the agreement.the only difference between the language set forth on pages and of the policy guide and the agreement,as distributed in,was language concerning an effective date and the consequences of remaining an employee after the effective date.in the policy guide,this language was truncated and stated only,the dispute resolution process is a condition of your employment.
yellow required its employees to sign a form acknowledging receipt of the policy guide.mcnamara signed the acknowledgment form on june.he then remained yellow employee until his termination on june.
while we do not purport to assess the merits of mcnamara substantive claims,we describe both his version and yellow version of the termination for context.according to mcnamara,he criticized his manager during yellow review of the manager,stating that the manager had harassed people within the office and showed favoritism to women.mcnamara asserts that the manager discovered the criticism through a violation of mcnamara rights,targeted mcnamara for termination,and eventually hired several women to work as customer relations managers following mcnamara termination.according to yellow,it terminated mcnamara for violating its policy and for a long history of disregard for yellow rules and procedures.yellow alleges in its brief that it provided mcnamara extensive coaching regarding his multiple violations of yellow rules and procedures and issued him a notice of corrective action for purportedly creating a hostile work environment.
mcnamara submitted a claim to the eeoc,and yellow did not raise the issue of arbitration during the eeoc proceedings or prior to mcnamara filing of the present suit.after mcnamara filed suit,yellow moved for summary judgment or for an order compelling arbitration.yellow supported its motions with an affidavit,copies of the agreement,and copies of an email message distributing the agreement.yellow arguments in support of arbitration relied upon the agreement as the contract requiring arbitration.mcnamara,in contrast,directed a competing affidavit and his arguments in opposition to yellow motions exclusively towards the policy guide,making no reference to the agreement and failing to dispute any of yellow evidence regarding the agreement or mcnamara receipt of the agreement.the district court also focused on the policy guide,making no reference to the agreement.the district court resolved yellow motions on the briefs and did not hold a hearing.in its order denying the motions,the district court stated,the question on arbitration is whether or not the defendant policy guides are contracts.the court held the policy guide was not an enforceable arbitration agreement.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion to compel arbitration as an interlocutory appeal within the scope of a.nordin,cir the order has an injunctive effect,and a denial of a motion to compel arbitration can only be effectively challenged on immediate appeal because the advantages of arbitration will be forever lost if the appeal is delayed.therefore,we have jurisdiction over the court denial of the motion to compel arbitration pursuant to a.we review de novo a district court order compelling arbitration,when the decision is based on contract interpretation.berkley dillard,cir.however,to the extent that the district court order is based upon factual findings,our review is guided by the clearly erroneous standard.nordin,at.here,the district court order was not based on any factual findings material to our analysis,and,as such,our review is de novo.see berkley,at.
the questions we must address include whether mcnamara was a transportation worker exempted from the faa.if not,we must determine whether the agreement is a valid arbitration agreement that encompasses mcnamara claims.finally,if mcnamara claims are otherwise subject to a valid arbitration agreement,we must decide whether yellow waived its right to arbitrate mcnamara claims by participating in the eeoc process before first asserting its right to arbitration.
transportation worker 
the faa does not apply to contracts of employment of seamen,railroad employees,or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.the supreme court has interpreted this exemption narrowly,agreeing with the majority of circuits that it is limited to transportation workers,defined as those workers actually engaged in the movement of goods in interstate commerce.circuit city stores,adams,d quoting cole burns int l sec.in lenz yellow transportation,cir,we applied circuit city and determined that a customer service representative for yellow who worked at a call center was not a transportation worker.
it is undisputed that mcnamara job title was customer relations manager and that he was a manager or supervisor over customer service representatives at yellow sioux falls,south dakota call center.yellow submitted a description of mcnamara duties via affidavit stating that the call center where mcnamara worked was distinct from a nearby freight dock that yellow described as a completely separate facility with a separate manager.yellow described mcnamara duties as follows 
as a customer relations manager,mcnamara primary responsibilities included assisting customer service representatives in identifying and resolving customer issues managing resources and staffing needs assisting teams in setting objectives,goals,performance standards and expectations and maintaining effective communications with employees and other managers.mcnamara had little,if any,interaction with the customers themselves.he did not handle g
