captain ronald mcwhirter,represented by the air line pilots association alpa,appeals an order by the district court reversing the reinstatement order of the system board of adjustment sba,a creature of the collective bargaining agreement cba between his employer,continental airlines,continental and alpa.he claims that the district court failed to give the proper deference owed to the decision of the sba and that the sba decision does not contravene public policy.concluding that the district court was without a statutory basis for its reversal and that its order can not be sustained on grounds of public policy,we reverse the district court reversal of the sba and remand with instructions to vacate a portion of the sba order and remand the matter to the sba.
facts and proceedings 
mcwhirter was hired by continental as a pilot in.he was discharged on february,for refusing to take a alcohol test.at the time of his discharge he was on disability status and was not qualified to fly.
mcwhirter trouble with alcoholism first came to continental attention in when he sought voluntary assistance from continental peer pilot program.after fits and starts toward sobriety,he tested positive during a alcohol test on september,a day on which he was scheduled to fly.pursuant to the cba between continental and alpa he entered into a last chance agreement lca on october.in addition to other requirements,such as submitting to evaluation and rehabilitation treatment by continental employee assistance program eap,the lca required mcwhirter to agree to submit to testing as often as continental directed for five years after he completed formal rehabilitation.he was reinstated to flight status in june or july of,but was placed on disability status in late march or early april of for hypertension.
on february,while still subject to the lca testing provisions,mcwhirter refused a alcohol test.after continental discharged him,alpa filed a grievance on his behalf and the case wound its way though the cba review process.ultimately,his he was discharged without just heard by the sba.
at a two day hearing in january,at which both parties presented evidence to the sba,mcwhirter claimed that he refused the february,test because,inter alia,he was upset that continental had not told him the results of a test from january.that test had been ordered after continental received an allegation that mcwhirter had been drinking with a fellow pilot.at the meeting after which the january test was ordered,mcwhirter was threatened with termination if the test came back positive.he testified that he had become extremely frustrated not to have been promptly informed of the results.the test results were supposed to be available in a week at the time of mcwhirter refusal to be retested,almost a month had passed.as it turns out,continental had received a negative result on the alcohol test a week before his refusal to be retested but had not so informed him.
after considering the other explanations offered by mcwhirter,for example,that he did not believe that he was subject to testing based on his leave status,the sba concluded that mcwhirter knowingly refused to take the test.the sba also concluded that under the mitigation provisions of the cba in particular,section part,b,mcwhirter refusal was an understandable,if not entirely rational,response to continental dropping the ball on the january test results.the sba ordered mcwhirter reinstatement,conditioned on his participation in continental eap and peer pilot program for two years.continental was ordered to reinstate him to the status he held prior to discharge,under either disability leave or the family medical leave act.
continental commenced suit in district court to vacate the sba order.after the parties for summary judgment,the district court granted continental motion and reversed the sba reinstatement order.this timely appeal by alpa on mcwhirter behalf followed.
ii.analysis 
mcwhirter contends that the district court failed to defer to the sba decision as required by the railway labor act the rla and that no judicially enforceable public policy precludes his reinstatement.we address each contention in turn.
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo summary judgment is appropriate when the 
record indicates no genuine issue of material fact,and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.in considering summary judgment,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.yet,the nonmoving party must set forth specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue concerning every essential component of its case 
applicable law 
this is a dispute over a grievance that involves the interpretation and application of the cba and of the lca entered into by mcwhirter and continental.as such,it is classified as a minor dispute under the rla minor disputes must be resolved through compulsory and binding arbitration before the sba judicial review of sba decisions arising from the terms of a cba is narrowly limited,and courts should afford great deference to arbitration awards.the standard for this review is among the narrowest known to the law and flows from the rla preference for the settlement of disputes in accordance with contractually arbitration procedures.we will defer to an sba decision based on any reasonable ground presented by the parties,even if not relied on by the sba in its decision 
we may decline to defer to a decision of the sba only if the sba failed to comply with the rla,there is evidence of fraud or corruption in the sba,or the order by the sba did not confine itself to matters within the scope of the sba jurisdiction.absent one of those exclusive grounds,or a judicially created exception for public policy concerns,we must defer to the sba decision continental does not contend that the sba failed to comply with the rla or that there is evidence of fraud or corruption in the sba.accordingly,only continental contention that the sba failed to conform or confine itself to its jurisdiction is at issue.
the jurisdiction of the sba and the limits of that jurisdiction arise out the cba the sba therefore fails to conform or confine itself to its jurisdiction if it issues a decision that is contrary to an unambiguous provision of the or an lca an lca is a supplement to the cba,and its terms are just as binding on an arbitrator as those of the cba unambiguous provisions of an lca may not be ignored 
this is a narrow exception,however,and a court should not reject an award on the ground that the sba misread the contract s.the sba decision need only draw its essence from the contracts s and not simply reflect the sba own notions of industrial justice,so that the decision is grounded in the contracts.that is,as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract s and acting within the scope of his authority,that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.the sba may look beyond the written contract when interpreting a collective bargaining agreement if the instrument is ambiguous or silent upon a precise question.
if we determine that the sba has exceeded its authority,we are empowered to vacate or modify the sba ruling,or to remand to the sba for further proceedings even in the very rare instances when sba procedural aberrations rise to the level of affirmative misconduct,as a rule the court must not foreclose further proceedings by settling the merits according to its own judgment of the appropriate result to do so would improperly substitute a judicial determination for the sba decision that the parties bargained for.t he court should simply vacate the award,thus leaving open the possibility of further proceedings if they are permitted under the terms of the agreement or remand when this step seems appropriate.
it is clear from the foregoing that we must defer to the sba decision if it may be supported by any analysis of the lca and cba,whether or not relied on by the sba,that arguably construes those agreements.even if the chain of reasoning is not correct,and the sba decision appears to us to be a serious error,we must defer as long as no step in the reasoning process ignores an unambiguous provision of the lca and cba.
continental asserts that the sba exceeded its jurisdiction in three ways the sba should not have considered mcwhirter explanation for his refusal to take the test the sba was without power to order mcwhirter reinstatement based on his explanation and the sba was without power to order mcwhirter continued participation in continental eap.we address each in turn.
mitigation evidence 
if the lca unambiguously excludes any explanation of mcwhirter refusal to be tested,then continental first contention would be correct the sba would have acted out of conformity with the jurisdiction conferred on it by the parties.but the lca not only fails unambiguously to reject inclusion of the mitigation provision of the cba,its structure and brevity essentially compel incorporation of the cba mitigation provisions.
the relevant portions of the lca are 
pursuant to section of the collective bargaining agreement between continental and alpa,we have agreed that your employment is subject to the following terms and conditions 
as a condition of continuing employment,you agree to undergo evaluation by the employee assistance program eap director or designee and to complete any rehabilitation recommended by eap 
your continuing employment shall be conditional upon your compliance with all of the following conditions 
c.you shall agree in writing to be subject to no notice alcohol testing at the direction of the company as frequently as the company may decide for a period of five years from the completion of the formal rehabilitation program.following the five year period during which you shall be subject to no notice testing,you shall be obligated only to submit to such further testing as may be required by applicable federal regulations or the collective bargaining agreement 
the lca preamble to all of the conditions on mcwhirter continued employment makes clear by its terms that continental and mcwhirter agreed to those conditions p ursuant to section of the cba.accordingly,continental can not plausibly maintain that,using the terms of section of the cba,the sba analysis of mcwhirter refusal to be tested was not just seriously wrong,but a failure even arguably to construe the language of the contracts.
the district court recognized that the cba mitigation provisions must have been included in the lca.it concluded that the lca does not say mcwhirter will be fired for not taking a test.this is likely because circumstances could arise that would prevent him from doing it.common sense compels this conclusion.it is quite unlikely that at the time that it entered into the lca,continental believed that it could fire mcwhirter for refusing to take an alcohol test if,say,his doctor concluded that his blood volume was so low that it was medically dangerous for him to give a blood sample.the parties must have contemplated that there would be some acceptable excuses for refusing to take a test when they entered into the lca.
that observation makes the point that the lca must have incorporated some parts of the cba.continental offers no reason why the sba implicit because a must have been incorporated,b must also have been not at least an arguable construction of the cba and lca.we deal with continental arguments about the propriety of applying b to mcwhirter case below here we only make the point that if a must have been incorporated into the lca,it was a perfectly reasonable construction for the sba to conclude that b must have been similarly incorporated.incorporation is a question logically prior to application.the p ursuant to section language in the preamble to the section containing the testing requirement makes the provisions of section an obvious choice to provide content to this issue on which the lca is silent.
continental itself seemed to recognize as much when it wrote to mcwhirter that he had failed to offer a sufficient explanation for refusing the test.the district court relied on that letter to conclude that continental thought itself obliged to consider explanations and to excuse mcwhirter refusal for at least some subset of those explanations.the sba has the ability to look beyond the lca when faced with an ambiguous term or silence it could have considered continental letter evidence of the parties intention that some reasons proffered for refusing to test must be acceptable under the lca.
the brevity of the lca and its failure to define testing also belie continental argument that the lca did not incorporate the mitigation provisions of the cba.the lca is obviously intended to supplement the cba,not replace it.for example,what is testing the practices of the parties appear to have conformed to the testing procedures set out in section of the cba,something else the sba could have considered when deciding whether reference to section of the cba was appropriate in interpreting the lca.
finally,according to the sba decision,continental relied primarily on part of section,albeit a different part than did mcwhirter,during the sba proceedings that is evidence that continental considered section to be incorporated by reference into the lca,or,at the least,that such a reading was arguable.
some of the above arguments may not be the most natural reading some may be incorrect some may even be serious errors of interpretation.none of that matters under the rla,however,because the existence of such arguments in favor of reading the lca and section of the cba in pari materia compels the conclusion that the sba the lca incorporates or does not displace the cba mitigation provisions draws its essence from the agreements between continental and mcwhirter 
turning to those provisions,section,part,b of the version of the cba that the parties agree governs this dispute states 
a pilot who refuses or fails to cooperate in any drug or alcohol test as mandated by this agreement,or who misses a test without a valid reason shall upon request have his circumstances reviewed by the company.the company shall consider such mitigating circumstances as the pilot may offer,and give those circumstances fair consideration.
this provision,combined with the sba jurisdiction over all disputes arising out of the cba entitled the sba to consider whether continental gave fair consideration to the mitigating circumstances that mcwhirter offered.
first,b refers to testing,but a the provision that continental insists is applicable,does not.b therefore appears to be the most obvious provision to consult concerning mcwhirter refusal to be tested.second,b applies when a pilot misses a test without a valid reason.continental reasoning that b countenances only medical excuses because it only allows consideration of valid reason s is flatly contradicted by the plain text of b.third,continental assertion that misses may not embrace a refusal to test is arguable.continental contrasts misses in the second clause with refuses or fails to cooperate in the first clause.rather than treating misses without a valid reason as a reformulation of refuses or fails to cooperate,continental reasons that,because mcwhirter refused his test but did not miss it without a valid reason,he was required to have a medical excuse.even if it were possible to miss a test without a valid reason without having refused or failed to cooperate with the test at least a plausible construction,as was conceded at oral argument mcwhirter test was mandated by this agreement as well,because it was ordered pursuant to an lca entered into under the scheme of the cba and,refusals or failures to cooperate in tests mandated by the cba and an lca entered into pursuant to it are not subject to a requirement that any excuse be valid.finally,even if the cba requires that the reasons for failing to cooperate,refusing,or missing a test be valid,it would not contradict the plain language of the parties agreements to construe valid reason to embrace excuses.
again,this construction could be seriously wrong.for example,a might limit b in some way,the treatment of refusals to be tested as required by this agreement and a test missed without a valid reason the same might be incorrect,a s testing provisions may be the correct section on which to rely,or such mitigating circumstances might refer to something other than being upset at the company.these possibilities are irrelevant.the sba construction is not so contrary to an unambiguous term that it fails to construe arguably the cba two sections that could address mcwhirter refusal to take a alcohol test.a and b,and the relationship between them,admit ambiguity and multiple interpretations.as such,the sba was free to choose among arguable constructions of them.
accordingly,the part of the sba decision that considered mcwhirter excuse for refusing to be tested draws its essence from the parties agreements and was an action within its jurisdiction.therefore,we now turn our attention to the jurisdiction of the sba to order mcwhirter reinstatement.
reinstatement 
if the sba authority to hear disputes is to mean anything,the cba must bestow the power to order reinstatement of a grievant.nothing in the cba,lca,or practices of the parties of which we are aware precludes the sba from asserting that power continental nevertheless insists that once the sba found that continental did consider the putatively mitigating circumstances that mcwhirter offered,the matter was at an end the requirements of the cba were satisfied.continental contends that the sba was therefore without authority to order reinstatement under the unambiguous language of the cba.
that is not,however,the only arguable construction of b.the sba could have read b to require fair consideration.by concluding that continental should have given more weight to the circumstances mcwhirter presented,the sba also could have concluded that continental did not fairly consider that which mcwhirter presented.by ordering reinstatement,it could have concluded that fair consideration of mcwhirter excuse would reveal no just cause for his termination if the sba interpretation of the cba to permit mitigation evidence was within its jurisdiction,it would read the give fair consideration requirement out of the cba to conclude that an order of reinstatement based on the sba consideration of the merits of such evidence was outside of its jurisdiction.the fact that no express provision of the cba or lca forbids an order of reinstatement by the,several sections contemplate means that we must defer to the sba interpretation of the justiciability of the requirement and the proper remedy.
continental also argues that the plain terms of the lca require that mcwhirter be fired for refusing a test,and that those terms override any cba requirement to consider mitigating evidence.this argument is without merit.the testing provisions of the lca do not say that mcwhirter will be terminated for refusing,missing,or failing to comply with a order to be tested.instead,they condition mcwhirter employment on his agreement in writing to be subject to no notice alcohol testing at the direction of the company as frequently as the company may decide for a period of five years.one construction of this language would require mcwhirter termination for refusing a test.another interpretation would,as demonstrated above,require continental to take account of certain mitigating factors.even continental,if only as a argument,seems to did the district at the very least a valid medical excuse for refusing,missing,or failing to comply with a test would not be grounds for immediate termination without further consideration.in contrast,and as an example of what qualifies as an unambiguous provision,the lca says upon release by eap to return to work,you will be required to complete a drug and alcohol test.a positive result for any drug or alcohol test shall be cause for your immediate termination.emphasis added.had mcwhirter tested positive on his return to work,the sba would not have been free to order his reinstatement.the difference in the clarity of the two provisions testing requirement and the consequences of a positive obvious.
the cba has better language to support continental position.section,part,d f provides if the pilot fails to comply with the provisions of the conditional reinstatement,termination will result.if the company terminates the pilot,the only matter that may be grieved is whether or not the pilot has violated the provisions of the conditional reinstatement.on one reading,this provision would preclude the sba from considering anything other than whether mcwhirter refused the test.on another reading,particularly in pari materia with the reference to testing in b,whether mcwhirter violated the provisions of the conditional reinstatement depends in part on the existence of mitigation whether medical or.the conflict between d f and b allows the sba to pick any arguable construction of the two,which it did.
we repeat for emphasis our cases make clear that when a cba or lca is not unambiguous,any arguable construction by the sba is owed deference.with this in mind,we next turn our attention to the power of the sba to order mcwhirter continued participation in continental eap.
c.the eap condition 
the sba requirement that mcwhirter participate in the eap program for two years can not be the result of an arguable construction of the lca and cba.the best argument in favor of the sba authority to order the eap condition,which nevertheless fails even on this deferential standard of review,is that cba section,part,a recognizes that the sba may order alcohol testing.testing,unlike the eap,is not committed to the discretion of the eap director and protected by federal regulations further,the sba power to order it is clear from the text.in contrast,both agreements appear to commit the length of time spent in the eap to the discretion of its director with even clearer language,a vests sole discretion in a department of transportation dot accredited substance abuse professional sap to make treatment evaluations of,or recommendations for assistance about,an employee who has violated dot drug and alcohol regulations it states in relevant part 
n o one,an employer,employee,a provider,any service agent may change in any way the sap evaluation or recommendations for assistance.for example,a third party is not permitted to make more or less stringent a sap recommendation by changing the sap evaluation or seeking another sap evaluation.
there can be no dispute that the sba qualifies as a third party and is swept into the regulation scope by the no one language.there are,however,a few ambiguities around the applicability of this regulation to the subject case.for example,the title of the regulation refers only to initial evaluations by a sap,and an initial evaluation is not at issue here.next,even though the plain language of a is not limited to an initial evaluation,it is limited to the sap evaluation or recommendations for assistance.
there may be an argument that the sba order does not alter a recommendation or evaluation.for example,mcwhirter argues that the eap condition simply requires that,in addition to whatever else mcwhirter compliance with the lca and so the eap might require of him,he must stay in the eap for at least two years.if,however,the sap were to recommend that mcwhirter be released before two years,that would be an evaluation or recommendation,and the sba order would interfere with that decision by the sap.further,the plain language of the regulation says that a third party is not permitted to make more or less stringent a sap recommendation.only if continental sap should decide independently that mcwhirter must remain in the program for two additional years would the sba order not change in any way the sap evaluation.
we can not see how interfering with a sap recommendation to discharge mcwhirter from the eap before two years would not serve the purposes of the dot regulations governing the return to work of employees.after all,that would be forcing more treatment and longer observation than the dot regulations require.further,mcwhirter does not challenge this provision of the sba order or ask to be relieved of additional eap participation,and he is the party that the regulation is likely intended to protect by its prohibition against more stringent recommendations for assistance.continental nevertheless urges that we reverse this condition,and the plain terms of a do not countenance any interference with a sap evaluations or recommendations,even if that interference results in more stringent conditions.
having established that an applicable federal regulation does not permit the sba to interfere with a sap treatment recommendation,continental urges that the sba can not issue a decision in contravention of that regulation and claim that the decision draws its essence from the cba the cba by its terms purports to be in compliance with federal regulations in reply,mcwhirter points out that interference with a sap discretion does nothing more than take mcwhirter rehabilitation out of compliance with the dot provisions.under the regulations cited by continental,there does not appear to be a reason why the company could not do as it wished with mcwhirter eap participation.if mcwhirter is to be returned to work,flying,the dot regulations must be observed the inverse is not obviously untrue,and continental has not invited our attention to anything in the cba,lca,or dot regulations that requires it to assign mcwhirter to tasks.
nevertheless,to permit the sba to order mcwhirter to participate in the eap for two more continental to enroll mcwhirter in the eap for that duration regardless of the sap professional so close to directly contravening a controlling federal regulation that,if such a decision were not outside of the sba jurisdiction,it would be a violation of public policy.we hold that by vesting the eap director with the discretion to prescribe mcwhirter course of treatment,the cba and lca can not be construed to vest that power in the sba.united paperworkers international union misco,teaches that the proper remedy in this case is a vacatur of the eap condition and remand for further proceedings,and this is what we order.
we have been presented with no are aware of on remand the sba is prevented from ordering mcwhirter to comply with whatever period of additional eap participation continental sap might recommend.section a speaks only to the impermissibility of chang ing in any way the sap evaluation or recommendations for assistance.accordingly,the sba is free on remand to order mcwhirter to comply with the sap recommendations for assistance.
public policy 
mcwhirter second contention is that his reinstatement and the eap condition do not violate public policy.continental contends that the district court correctly concluded that concerns about safety compel reversal of the sba reinstatement order and the eap condition.
we concluded above that the sba exceeded its jurisdiction by ordering mcwhirter continued eap participation.the correct remedy for that error is to vacate the eap condition and to remand rather than reverse.but,if reversal,rather than vacatur,of any condition is required for reasons of public policy,we could prevent two unnecessary remands by resolving the question now.therefore,in the interests of judicial economy,we address continental objections to any eap condition on public policy grounds we address the reinstatement order and the eap condition in turn.
standard of review 
as with the district court resolution of continental rla claim,we review de novo its grant of summary judgment on the basis of public policy 
applicable law 
to understand the result that we must reach in this case,a healthy dose of background is necessary.the most recent incarnation of the public policy exception for arbitration awards began with the supreme court labor management relations act the lmra case,grace local union,international union of united rubber,cork,linoleum plastic workers there,the company was in an awkward position it could either follow the mandate of a district court to obey a conciliation agreement in a case,risking liability for breaching the cba as interpreted by the arbitrator,or avoid liability under the cba by flouting the mandate of the district court,risking title vii liability and contempt.the company claimed that the arbitrator award violated public policy by creating an incentive to disobey the district court order and by chilling voluntary compliance with title vii through the eeoc conciliation process.the court first established that such claims are cognizable,saying that i f the contract as interpreted by the arbitrator violates some explicit public policy,we are obliged to refrain from enforcing it.the court next claimed for the judiciary,not the arbitrator,the power to determine questions of public policy the theory behind this and exception to deference is the same as for the refusal of courts to enforce any contract that violates public policy a court will not assist a party violation of public policy by using its powers to enforce an agreement contrary to the public interest 
the limiting portions of the opinion,however,have proved to be much more important.the court took a very narrow view of the public policy exception,and,even though it acknowledged the in which the company found itself,the court held that the arbitrator award did not violate public policy,observing that public policy must be well defined and dominant,and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.the potential liability of the company for violating the cba by complying with the district court order did not implicate public policy as thus defined.
cases in the circuits after grace employed the public policy exception somewhat liberally to strike down arbitrators decisions that reinstated employees who had abused drugs or alcohol for example,in amalgamated meat cutters butcher workmen,local union great western food,we said in a nation where motorists practically live on the highways,no citation of authority is required to establish that an arbitration award ordering a company to reinstate an truck driver caught drinking liquor on duty violates public policy.
one case in particular is instructive.in misco,united paperworkers international union,we concluded that an order reinstating a manufacturing employee who was caught smoking marijuana in his car in the plant parking lot violated public policy the supreme court,however,would have none of it.reversing us,it said 
as we see it,the formulation of public policy set out by the court of appeals did not comply with grace the court of appeals made no attempt to review existing laws and legal precedents in order to demonstrate that they establish a and dominant policy against the operation of dangerous machinery while under the influence of drugs.although certainly such a judgment is firmly rooted in common sense,we explicitly held in grace that a formulation of public policy based only on general considerations of supposed public interests is not the sort that permits a court to set aside an arbitration award that was entered in accordance with a valid agreement 
several portions of the misco opinion are instructive.first,the supreme court invigorated grace requirement that an sba decision,not the underlying conduct of the grievant,must violate some explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant,and that is ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.second,lest there be any doubt,the court cautioned that it is apparent that grace does not otherwise sanction a broad judicial power to set aside arbitration awards as against public policy.third,the court pronounced that 
t o conclude from the fact that marijuana had been found in cooper car that cooper had ever been or would be under the influence of marijuana while he was on the job and operating dangerous machinery is an exercise in factfinding about cooper use of drugs,a task that exceeds the authority of a court asked to overturn an arbitration award.the parties did not bargain for the facts to be found by a court 
finally,the court noted that t he issue of safety in the workplace is a commonplace issue for arbitrators to consider in discharge cases,and it was a matter for the arbitrator in the first instance to decide whether cooper alleged use of drugs on the job would actually pose a danger.
undeterred by these remonstrations,we took up the challenge of satisfying grace,and,after misco,we have refused to enforce at least two arbitration awards reinstating a employee discharged for drug or alcohol abuse subsequently,however,the supreme court has again addressed the issue.in eastern associated coal united mine workers of america the fourth circuit had concluded that an arbitration award that reinstated a dot employee who had failed a drug test while under an analogue of an lca because he had previously tested positive for drugs violated public policy.the supreme court reversed,saying 
regarding drug use by persons in positions,then,congress has enacted a detailed statute and n either congress nor the secretary who issued rules under the statute has seen fit to mandate the discharge of a worker who twice tests positive for drugs.we hesitate to infer public policy in this area that goes beyond the careful and detailed scheme congress and the secretary have created.
we recognize that reasonable people can differ as to whether reinstatement or discharge is the more appropriate remedy here.but both employer and union have agreed to entrust this remedial decision to an arbitrator.we can not find in the act,the regulations,or any other law or legal precedent an explicit,well defined,dominant public policy to which the arbitrator decision to reinstate a drug user runs contrary.
several important principles emerge from eastern associated coal.first,an sba decision might in theory violate public policy without directly contravening positive law,but the public policy exception is narrow and must satisfy the principles set forth that require,at a minimum,reference to applicable laws and legal precedents second,courts should be particularly chary when divining public policy from some laws,for example,those in which two political branches have created a detailed regulatory regime in a specific field.finally,the court pronounced that 
t he award violates no specific provision of any law or regulation.it is consistent with dot rules requiring completion of treatment before returning to work,for it does not preclude eastern from assigning smith to a position until smith completes the prescribed treatment program.it is consistent with the testing act and driving license suspension requirements,for those requirements apply only to drivers who,unlike smith,actually operated vehicles under the influence of drugs.the award is also consistent with the act rehabilitative concerns,for it requires treatment and testing before smith can return to work.
the fact that smith is a he has failed drug tests not sufficient to tip the balance in eastern favor 
continental has cited no cases after eastern associated coal,nor are we aware of any,in which we have set aside an arbitration award on the grounds of public policy implicated by reinstating a employee who habitually abuses drugs or alcohol.as this saga demonstrates,we and other circuits have repeatedly attempted to protect what seems to us a common sense notion of public safety dot employees who habitually abuse drugs or alcohol should not be reinstated by arbitrators.in measure equal to the vigor that courts of appeal have applied to reversing awards of reinstatement,the supreme court has reversed.our ability to set aside decisions like that of the sba in this case is severely circumscribed.it is with this overarching limitation firmly in mind that we now examine that award and the applicable regulations.
reinstatement 
continental has identified no positive law that expressly precludes mcwhirter reinstatement to status.yet it does cite a number of different faa and dot provisions that embody a strong public policy against alcohol abuse by pilots and a strong public policy in favor of continental protecting safety we therefore must consider whether that positive law establishes a sufficiently explicit,defined,and dominant public policy.
we assume without deciding that if a public policy is explicit and defined in this case,it is dominant.the problem with continental position is that we perceive no sufficiently explicit and defined policy against mcwhirter reinstatement.one explicit and defined public policy that we identify from our cases,although eastern associated coal calls it into question,is a prohibition against reinstating employees who engage in substance abuse while actually performing a task.the cases on which continental relies establish only that because they involve almost exclusively employees caught on work sites with drugs in their system although whether the employees were actually at work under the influence is not clear in every case.further,our opinion that rejected a public policy rationale for declining to enforce an arbitrator award of reinstatement focused on the fact that the employee drug use prior to the arbitration different issues were presented by possible drug use subsequent to that arbitration had occurred and was unlikely to hinder her job performance 
even if we assume that mcwhirter had been drinking when he refused the test,an assumption called into question by the negative test a month earlier,there is absolutely no evidence that he was discharged for drinking while engaged in a task.in fact,he could not have was on leave and lacked the requisite credentials to fly an aircraft.reinstating mcwhirter,even though he almost flew after drinking the incident that resulted in the lca,does not fall within this narrow category of cases that precludes enforcement of a reinstatement order for an employee who engaged in substance abuse while actually engaged in a task,not least of all because mcwhirter was not discharged for that,but for refusing a test.
next,we consider whether a refusal to be tested is equivalent to being drunk or stoned on the job.it appears that it is not.the cba denies an lca arrangement to pilots who are discovered to be under the influence while engaged in tasks.the same is not true for other violations of the cba drug and alcohol policy,such as a refusal to be tested.it thus appears that even the parties agreement recognizes a difference between actually being impaired at work and refusing to be tested.further,continental claims that the test that mcwhirter refused was not mandated by faa regulations.rather,it was directed by the sap and implemented by continental.the failure of the faa and dot to mandate the test that mcwhirter refused is an indication that continental is accorded wide latitude in designing testing practices.if continental need not have ordered this particular test as a matter of positive law,it is unclear how mcwhirter refusal to be tested contravenes an explicit and defined public policy flowing from positive law.as continental discretion to protect safety increases,the definition of any public policy emerging out of that general concern decreases.
we next consider continental contention that because mcwhirter could resume flying if the sba decision stands,public policy is implicated.based on our review of the faa and dot provisions,it does appear that mcwhirter could someday fly an aircraft again that is true,however,whether or not continental continues to employ him.misco requires that the arbitration award,not the underlying conduct of the grievant or actions of third parties such as the possibility that the faa and dot might one day clear mcwhirter to fly again,violate public policy.even were that not the case,we would be engaging in an exercise in factfinding that the misco court prohibited if we were to attempt to discern the relative probabilities that mcwhirter will fly again,with or without reinstatement,and the probability that he would do so in a way that implicates public policy,while under the influence i t was a matter for the arbitrator in the first instance to decide whether mcwhirter refusal to be tested would actually pose a danger.
finally,if we nevertheless assume that the arbitration award itself plays some additional role in risking safety,cont
