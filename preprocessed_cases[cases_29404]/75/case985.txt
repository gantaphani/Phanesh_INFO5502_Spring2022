eleven days after the terrorist attacks of september,congress enacted the air transportation safety and system stabilization act.the act directed the president to compensate air carriers up to five billion dollars for direct losses caused by orders halting air traffic and for incremental losses directly caused by the terrorist attacks and incurred between september and december.compensation was not to exceed those losses proved to the satisfaction of the president.a cost savings rule promulgated by the secretary of the department of transportation established a presumption that t he department generally does not accept claims by air carriers that cost savings should be excluded from the calculation of incurred losses.the federal express corporation challenges the rule as being contrary to the act and the secretary rejection of sworn affidavits in support of some of its claims as arbitrary,capricious,and contrary to law under the administrative procedure act.we deny the petition for review.
at on the morning of september,the federal aviation administration issued a ground stop order to bring all aviation in the united states to an immediate halt.see comm on the terrorist attacks upon the,the commission report.in response to that order and the decline in air traffic following september,congress passed the air transportation safety and system stabilization act,which the president signed on september.see,stat.codified at note act.section a of the act provides that the president shall 
c ompensate air carriers in an aggregate amount equal to five billion dollars for a direct losses incurred by air carriers as a result of any federal ground stop order and b the incremental losses incurred beginning september,and ending december,by air carriers as a direct result of such attacks.
an incremental loss does not include any loss that the president determines would have been incurred if the terrorist attacks had not occurred.id.for any loss to be compensable,it must be demonstrate d to the satisfaction of the president.id.a.
the secretary of the department of transportation promulgated a series of regulations to carry out the act.see,see also.in order to fulfill congress intent to expeditiously provide compensation to eligible air carriers,the department would make an initial payment of roughly fifty percent of a carrier estimated losses,and two later installments to reach full compensation.at.as a starting point in determining the amount of a carriers compensation,the department would compare the difference between forecasts and the updated forecasts or actual results.at.the resulting difference would provide an approximation of the incremental losses that are a direct result of the attacks,and that approximation,without more,would give effect to the language of the statute.id.this methodology was based on two assumptions the differences between a carrier forecast and its actual results are primarily due to september and it is extremely difficult if not impossible to distinguish,on a line item by line item basis,individual revenue and expense items that were affected directly by the terrorist attacks from those that were affected indirectly,or those that were partially affected,or not affected at all.id.
the regulations left room,however,for adjustments to address items of significant relative financial impact that were extraordinary or and unrelated to september.id.at.for instance,an adverse million judgment that occurred during the compensation period as a result of operative facts before september could not be included as a compensable net loss.id.the regulations also contemplated that there would be situations in which carriers experienced a reduction in actual versus forecast expenses.id.to address those situations,the cost savings rule provides 
the department generally does not accept claims by air carriers that cost savings should be excluded from the calculation of incurred losses.consequently,the department will generally not allow such claims to be used in a way that has the effect of increasing the compensation for which an air carrier is eligible.
b.the rule reflected a general presumption against such adjustments because cost reductions unrelated to september would be expected to have been included in forecasts it is highly likely that expense reduction efforts undertaken after september were attributable,implicitly if not explicitly,to changed expectations regarding revenues after the attacks cost savings in fact reduce an air carrier losses,and the calculations required under the rules may not be manipulated to exclude actual reductions in expenses,thereby generating a basis for increased compensation and congress intended that carriers not receive compensation for cost savings,which they have an independent obligation to their managements and shareholders to achieve,and which it is reasonable to expect them to undertake to mitigate the need for compensation under the act.at.carriers were instructed to submit their calculations of revenues and expenses on department form along with sworn financial statements reviewed by an independent public accountant.see,id.pt,app.
fedex sought compensation under the act,and based on fedex initial loss estimates,the department paid it just over million in the first round of payments.in subsequent applications fedex recalculated its projected losses.when fedex closed its books for the compensation period,however,instead of comparing its forecast with its actual revenues and expenses during the compensation period on form,fedex adjusted its actual results to account for cost savings that it describes on appeal as variances in its fixed expenses that were not a result of the attacks,because those expenses would not automatically decline with reduced business.petitioner br.at.
the secretary,upon fedex appeal,upheld,with some modifications,the initial decision of the assistant secretary for aviation and international affairs generally rejecting fedex attempt to obtain compensation for cost savings.noting that the act provided compensation for losses incurred,the secretary understood fedex as essentially seeking additional compensation in this appeal for expenses that were never actually incurred.final decision at.in the secretary opinion,fedex would receive a windfall were its appeal granted because it would end up with profits greater than those it had forecasted before september.id.upon examining fedex claims for adjustments due to cost savings,however,the secretary granted some and denied others.some he allowed because fedex had shown that the cost savings had originated before september and thus could not have been related to the terrorist attacks others he rejected because adjustment would effectively be a double payment to fedex for expenses that were not incurred,and which are not properly compensable because fedex would not incur them until after the compensation period still others he rejected because fedex had failed to show the cost savings were unrelated to september.in all,the secretary determined that fedex was entitled to receive just under million in compensation for lost profits as a result of the september attacks.fedex petitions for review.
an earlier challenge to the cost savings rule was dismissed by the court as unripe.see federal express mineta,fedex i.now that the secretary has issued a final decision on fedex compensation claims,the question whether congress use of the term losses incurred forecloses the secretary adoption of a methodology that generally denies adjustments when a carrier expenses are lower than it forecasted prior to september is properly before the court.in fedex i,the court concluded,upon applying the first step of the familiar analysis of chevron natural resources defense council,d,that the meaning of incurred in section a is ambiguous,with the only metric in the act being the satisfaction of the president fedex i,at.use of that metric,the court observed,vests the executive with broad discretion to determine appropriate criteria for the award of compensation to an air carrier with results for the period september.id.quoting natural res.def.council,epa.given
