the nuclear information and resource service,committee to bridge the gap,public citizen,and redwood alliance collectively nirs challenge the nuclear regulatory commission nrc rulemaking,which revised regulations governing the exemption standards for the transportation of radioactive material.nirs argues that nrc failed to comply with its obligations under the national environmental policy act nepa,by not preparing an environmental impact statement eis and making a finding of no significant impact fonsi without basis.we are obligated before reaching the merits of nirs nepa challenge to determine whether nirs has standing to bring its complaint in federal court.we conclude that it does not,and we therefore dismiss nirs petition for review.
nrc and the department of transportation dot the transportation of radioactive material in the united states.nrc is authorized to regulate the use and possession of nuclear materials,which it does by prescribing regulations for its licensees packaging and transport of such materials.see b.dot is authorized to designate material as hazardous and to prescribe regulations for the safe transportation of such material.a,b.under this authority,dot has promulgated its hazardous materials regulations hmr,which regulate the shipment of radioactive materials,including packaging,labeling,and notification,and which apply in addition to nrc requirements for the shipment of nuclear materials.a memorandum of understanding mou governs the respective responsibilities of nrc and dot.transportation of radioactive materials memorandum of understanding.july.as nrc summarizes the mou,dot is responsible for regulating safety in transportation of all hazardous materials,including radioactive materials,whereas nrc is responsible for regulating safety in receipt,possession,use,and transfer of byproduct,source,and special nuclear materials.thus,dot adopts regulations for all shippers and carriers of hazardous materials,including safety standards for shipping and packaging radioactive material nrc develops safety standards for packaging certain radioactive materials and regulates its licensees and dot issue s complete and comprehensive federal regulations for the packaging and transportation of all radioactive materials as part of its overall body of federal regulations.id.
the united states is a member of the international atomic energy agency iaea which,in,adopted international regulations for the safe transportation of radioactive material.the iaea regulations were published in regulations for the safe transport of radioactive materials,iaea safety series.as a member state,the united states harmonized its domestic regulations with the iaea standards.the iaea periodically has revised with substantial input from dot,and,following each revision,dot and nrc have amended domestic regulations to make them compatible with the iaea standards.the latest significant revision to the was published in december,and redesignated in june.the principal change from the prior iaea regulations to at issue in this case involves radionuclide exemption values.
following the iaea revisions,nrc and dot began the rulemaking process for revising domestic regulations on exemption values to make them compatible with the new iaea with its iaea compatibility amendments and nrc with conforming amendments to its part regulations.see compatibility with iaea transportation safety standards and other transportation safety amendments final rule,to be codified at pt.nrc final rule hazardous materials regulations compatibility with the regulations of the international atomic energy agency final rule,to be codified at pts.dot final rule.exemption values are the standards adopted for determining whether nuclear material is subject to regulation during transport if the radioactivity of the material is below the exemption value,then the material is exempt and not subject to regulation.nirs here challenges nrc change from an activity concentration to a standard for setting exemption values.nrc final rule.at,id.at setting forth the exemption provisions see also dot final rule.at.
before adopting the regulation,nrc and dot applied a uniform activity concentration standard to exempt transportation of material from regulation.activity concentration refers to the number of nuclear disintegrations per second in a gram of material and is commonly measured in becquerels.a becquerel is one radioactive disintegration per second.this prior standard,which was also the iaea standard,established per gram as the uniform activity concentration standard radioactive material with fewer than disintegrations per second in a gram was exempted from nrc regulation during transport.
in,the iaea determined that there was no technical justification for the single activity concentration value of and concluded that the technically sound approach was a standard,which it adopted.dose depends not only on the number of disintegrations per second but also on the type and energy of the radiation emitted by a nuclear disintegration.dose limits are expressed in rems or millirems mrem.to develop the approach,the iaea used safety standards from a iaea bss study,safety series,international basic safety standards for protection against ionizing radiation and for the safety of radiation sources.the bss study used a approach in fixed facility exposure scenarios,as opposed to transport scenarios,and it calculated for each radionuclide an exemption threshold that would limit an effective annual dose to mrem or less per year the iaea researchers performed calculations on a subset of bss scenarios and calculated the activity concentration for each of twenty radionuclides that would result in a dose of mrem per year to transport workers in transportation scenarios.they concluded that d ue to differences in radionuclide radiation emissions,exposure pathways,the resulting activity concentrations varied widely.at.in other words,to obtain the mrem per year dose level,the activity concentrations for radionuclides are less than,but others are much higher.instead of an standard,the new standard is set forth in a chart that states the allowable activity concentrations for various,commonly shipped radionuclides.
the iaea found that the activity concentrations required in transportation scenarios to limit the effective annual dose to mrem were less than the bss fixed facility values but not by more than one to two orders of magnitude.this meant that to meet the mrem criteria,the transportation specific levels would have to be more protective than the generic bss levels.the iaea determined that the difference in dose between and transport scenarios did not justify imposing a different set of standards for fixed facilities and transportation exemptions,so it adopted the bss values for transport in.the iaea calculations showed that using the bss exemption values for transport would yield a dose exceeding mrem for some radionuclides and that the average annual dose using the bss exemption values would be approximately mrem per year,in excess of the mrem per year target in comparison,the average annual dose for a transport worker under the value was about mrem per year.
after the iaea moved to regulations,nrc and dot began the rulemaking process to harmonize domestic standards with the iaea standards by adopting,radioactivity levels for each of about radionuclides.in july,nrc published an issues paper discussing its proposal to adopt the iaea exemption standards and it solicited written comments and input at three public meetings.major revision to cfr part compatibility with iaea transportation safety other transportation safety issues,issues paper,and notice of public meetings proposed rule,july.among other things,commenters responded that there was no safe radiation dose,that the scientific materials iaea used as a basis for its decision were not publicly available,and that there was a growing scientific consensus that radiation may be more harmful than previously thought.
following this preliminary process,in april,nrc published a notice of proposed rulemaking and a draft environmental assessment ea as required by nepa.nrc allowed days for public comment on the proposed rule and held two public meetings.it received about twenty comment letters addressing the proposal to adopt the iaea methodology for calculating exemption thresholds,most of which opposed the change.these commenters,including nirs,objected to the dose levels in the proposed rule and to nrc reliance on unchallenged assumptions from the international commission on radiological protection icrp on the health risks of exposure to low doses of radiation.
nrc received two comment letters regarding the draft ea,and comments from two speakers during the public meetings about the draft ea.one commenter objected to any exemption of radionuclides,and the others argued that the ea should have developed more quantitative data,particularly with respect to exempt shipping volumes.
nrc issued a final ea that found no significant environmental impact,and on january,nrc published a final rule adopting the iaea exemption values.the final ea was substantially identical to the draft ea with respect to the radionuclide exemption values.the ea explained that t he nature of the change makes it difficult to quantify the safety impacts or benefits.because nrc lacked data on exempt shipments,the ea analyzed data pertaining to regulated shipments contained in a report by sandia national laboratories,which estimated the number of regulated,packages shipped for various nuclides.the ea concluded that of the six most commonly shipped nuclides,two would have a higher exemption level under the new rule and four would have a lower exemption level,meaning that the latter four would be more strictly regulated.the ea also addressed isotopes with exemption levels that were much higher under the new rule,and concluded that only two of those isotopes contribute percent or more of the total curie amount transported and that those two were unlikely to be shipped in exempt packages.the ea addressed plutonium and transported isotopes affected by the rule noted that the new exemption levels for both were or lower,making previously exempt packages subject to regulation.the ea summarized the projected effect of the new exemption values as follows 
c hanging the existing level in cfr a for exempting any radionuclide from the part requirements to activity limits would result in mixed,although overall minor,effects.for radionuclides with new exemption values that are lower than the current limit,there could be a decrease in the number of exempted shipments and a commensurate slight increase in the level of protection.for radionuclides with new exemption values that are higher than the current limit,there could be an increase in the number of exempted shipments and a commensurate slight increase in associated radiation exposures.however,iaea has judged that this change would not significantly increase the risk to individuals.
in its final rule,nrc similarly concluded because the annual doses estimated to result from the use of the exemption values are low,and on average are lower than the dose estimates for the current activity concentration,nrc staff believes that changing from the value to the exemption values will result in no adverse impact on public health and safety.at.based on this fonsi,nrc did not prepare an eis under nepa.see e providing that the agency shall p repare a finding of no significant impact,if the agency determines on the basis of the environmental assessment not to prepare a statement defining a fonsi as a document briefly presenting the reasons why an action will not have a significant effect on the human environment.
on the same day,dot issued a final ruling adopting compatibility amendments to the hmr to harmonize the regulations with the iaea standards.see dot final rule.as a result of the amendments,the hmr now defines radioactive material to mean any material containing radionuclides where both the activity concentration and the total activity in the consignment exceed the values specified in the new tables.in preparing its final amendment to the hmr,dot relied on the issued by nrc.dot final rule.at see a permitting a lead agency to supervise preparation of an eis if multiple agencies are involved in a group of actions directly related to each other because of their functional interdependence.
on march,nirs timely filed a petition for review of the nrc rulemaking in this court as permitted by the hobbs act.see providing for direct review in the court of appeals.
on november,nirs filed an action in the united states district court for the northern district of california seeking review of dot rulemaking.on november,nirs sought transfer of the nrc review proceedings to the district court for consolidation with the dot case.we denied that motion on april,without prejudice.on january,dot filed a motion to dismiss under.b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to c,which the district court granted.nirs appeal from the district court dismissal was consolidated with this case for purposes of oral argument and is resolved in a separate opinion,nuclear information resource service department of transportation,wl cir.
as the supreme court recently reiterated,w e have an obligation to assure ourselves of litigants standing under article iii.daimlerchrysler cuno,d quoting friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.accordingly,we begin by addressing nirs claim that it has standing to challenge nrc alleged with nepa.
to determine whether a litigant has standing,we undertake two distinct inquiries.first,a plaintiff must meet article iii requirement,which provides a fundamental limitation on a federal court authority to exercise jurisdiction.see daimlerchrysler.at emphasizing the critical importance of the requirement.the court has recognized that the core component of standing is an essential and unchanging part of the requirement of article iii.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.put simply,i f a dispute is not a proper case or controversy,the courts have no business deciding it,or expounding the law in the course of doing so.daimlerchrysler.at see also steel citizens for a better env t,d.article iii standing requirements are familiar 
a plaintiff must show it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
laidlaw,at.citing lujan,at.see also allen wright,d.
the injury nirs asserts is nrc failure to comply with the requirements of nepa.we have recognized that our analysis of article iii standing is not fundamentally changed by the fact that a petitioner asserts a procedural,rather than a substantive injury.city of sausalito,cir.in a procedural injury case 
to show a cognizable injury in fact,a plaintiff must allege that the agency violated certain procedural rules these rules protect a plaintiff concrete interests and it is reasonably probable that the challenged action will threaten their concrete interests.
id.quoting citizens for better forestry of,cir alterations in original.a cognizable procedural injury exists when a plaintiff alleges that a proper eis has not been prepared under nepa when the plaintiff also alleges a concrete as an aesthetic or recreational is threatened by the proposed action.id.citing sierra club morton,d.the concrete interest test has been described as requiring a geographic nexus between the individual asserting the claim and the location suffering an environmental impact.ashley creek phosphate norton,cir,petition for cert.filed,quoting cantrell city of long beach,cir.
to establish article iii standing,a plaintiff must also show causation and redressability however,o nce a plaintiff has established injury in fact under nepa,the causation and redressability requirements are relaxed.cantrell,at see also hall norton,cir holding that a plaintiff seeking to enforce a procedural requirement the disregard of which could impair a separate concrete interest of theirs,can establish standing without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.quoting lujan,at.instead,they need only establish the reasonable probability of the challenged action threat to their concrete interest.id.at quoting churchill county babbitt,cir,amended by cir.
if nirs members meet the test for constitutional standing,nirs has organizational standing to represent their interests.defenders of wildlife epa,cir.an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right,the interests at stake are germane to the organization purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.laidlaw,at.citing hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d.
the second inquiry,if a plaintiff meets the constitutional standing requirements,is whether the plaintiff meets the or prudential standing requirements this inquiry is whether a particular plaintiff has been granted a right to sue by the statute under which he or she brings suit.city of sausalito,at.because nepa does not provide for a private right of action,plaintiffs challenging an agency action based on nepa must do so under the administrative procedure act apa.ashley creek,at citation omitted.to meet the statutory requirements for standing under the apa,a plaintiff must establish that there has been a final agency action adversely affecting it,and that,as a result,it suffers legal wrong or that its injury falls within the zone of interests of the statutory provision the plaintiff claims was violated.churchill county,at quoting lujan wildlife fed n,d.it is well settled that the zone of interests protected by nepa is environmental.ashley creek,at.
nrc argues that nirs fails to meet the requirement of standing because nirs complains in only the most general terms that nrc new regulation may expose members of the public to excessive radiation,but it points to no concrete harm to particular persons.in response to nrc challenge,nirs addressed standing for the first time in its reply brief.nw.envtl.def.ctr.bonneville power,cir holding that petitioners were entitled to establish standing anytime during the briefing phase,where standing was not at issue in earlier proceedings.nirs members claim standing by virtue of their status as members of the public with a common interest in protecting public health from radioactive sources and practices.this interest,nirs argues,gives rise to concerns that the public,including transport workers,will be exposed to excessive levels of radiation as a result of nrc rulemaking proceeding,which relied upon nrc faulty environmental investigation.nirs contends that it asserts a cognizable procedural injury because nrc failed to adhere to its nepa obligations.further,nirs asserts that it has established a geographic nexus because the exemption rules authorize unregulated transport of radioactive waste on public roads nationwide.
lujan holds that t he party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing the standing elements,at,and that each element must be supported with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation,id.nirs submitted five brief declarations in support of its standing.the first declaration states in full 
my name is gary brown.i am employed as a truck driver by brown and son trucking,in san francisco,california.i have been a truck driver since.
i am a member of nuclear information and resource service.
in the course of my employment,i have regularly transported waste material from industrial sites to disposal sites by truck.i have transported hazardous materials during the past six years.i have transported hazardous materials,including radioactive materials,to disposal sites using public roads and highways in the states of california and nevada.
i am concerned that allowing the unregulated transportation of radioactive material may expose me,as well as other members of the public,to adverse health consequences without knowledge or consent and without an ability to avoid or reduce these consequences.
the four remaining declarations were submitted by another member of nirs,and a member of public citizen,committee to bridge the gap,and redwood alliance.each of these declarations contains four initial paragraphs stating the declarant name,membership in one of the organizations,the organization purpose,and the fact that the organization participated in the rulemaking at issue.the next paragraph of each states something substantially similar to i regularly use public streets and highways in the state of california.the final paragraphs are nearly identical i am concerned that allowing the unregulated transportation of radioactive material may expose me to adverse health consequences without my knowledge and without my ability to avoid or reduce these consequences.these five declarations are the only evidence nirs offers in support of its standing.
we turn first to the inquiry,which is dispositive of this appeal.nirs claims that nrc failed to follow nepa procedural rules that required it to prepare an eis.this type of procedural injury can form the basis of standing.ashley creek,at recognizing that allegations that an agency failed to comply with nepa procedural requirement that an eis consider alternatives could suffice as procedural injury citizens for better forestry,at holding that standing may hinge on the failure of an agency to allow public input into the process citing west sec y of dep t of,cir see also lujan,at.noting that a plaintiff assuredly can enforce procedural rights.
in addition to a procedural violation,for article iii purposes,the plaintiff must assert a concrete as an aesthetic or recreational is threatened by the proposed action.city of sausalito,at see also lujan,at.requiring not only a threat to a listed species but also affidavits or evidence showing,through specific facts that one of the organizations members would be directly affected apart from their special interest in th e subject alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted quoting sierra club,at.a assertion of a procedural violation,without a concrete link to the interest protected by the procedural rules,does not constitute an injury in fact.ashley creek,at see also lujan,at nn.as we explained in citizens for better forestry,environmental plaintiffs must allege that they will suffer harm by virtue of their geographic proximity to and use of areas that will be affected by the agency policy.at emphasis added.for example,in a case where the plaintiff averred that his respiratory discomfort would be aggravated by emissions from developments on former bureau of land management lands,we held that evidence of a credible threat to the plaintiff physical from airborne pollutants falls well within the range of injuries to cognizable interests that may confer standing.hall,at noting that credible threats included increased traffic,pollution,and noise,as well as increased auto emissions internal quotation marks omitted.
to show a geographic nexus,petitioners claiming a violation of nepa must allege that they will suffer harm as a result of their proximity to the area where the alleged environmental impact will occur.we have defined the geographic nexus requirement broadly to permit challenges to actions with geographic effects where the petitioners properly allege,and support with affidavits,that they use the impacted area,even if the impacted area is vast.see citizens for better forestry,at holding that citizens need not assert that any specific injury will occur in any specific national forest that their members visit,where they properly alleged,and supported with numerous affidavits their members use and enjoyment of a vast range of national forests see also defenders of wildlife,at holding that the requirements were met in a clean water act case affecting the state of arizona where petitioners mentioned specific subareas within the state and noting that alleging an covering large areas within the state simply reflects the relatively broad nature of the potential harm res,robertson,cir holding that the plaintiffs had standing to sue to challenge a
