in,plaintiff purchased an african tribal carving known as the baga serpent in new york city for.shortly thereafter,trepel arranged to have the defendant,roadway express,transport the object to phoenix,arizona,where it would become part of the decor of the plaintiff home.during transport,the serpent was broken into three major pieces and several minor pieces.plaintiff filed a claim with the defendant for the damages to the baga serpent.defendant did not contact trepel about any alternative dispute resolution forum or initiate proceedings in such a forum.plaintiff filed suit in federal court.
at the jury trial in,plaintiff called a number of witnesses,many of whom came from outside the state of ohio.the plaintiff witnesses included fredrick lamp,curator of african,american and oceanic art for the baltimore museum of art robert koestler,a research scientist and instructor in biodeterioration at the nyu institute of fine arts dennis stevenson,director of the harding laboratory at the new york botanical gardens leonard kahan,owner of an african art gallery in new york michael chisolm,a teacher,scholar and appraiser of african art and joann hahn a resident of phoenix,arizona who went to the roadway express terminal to take delivery of the baga serpent for trepel.
plaintiff also called three rebuttal witnesses michael oliver,an african art dealer brian douglas newton,former chairman of the department of art of africa,oceania and the americas at the metropolitan museum of art and francine ndiaye,former curator of african art at the musee de in paris.kahan estimated that the fair market value of the undamaged baga serpent was million dollars.chisholm stated that the fair market value was million dollars.
the jury found for the plaintiff and set damages at.judgement in this amount was entered on july.on september,plaintiff moved for attorney fees under section of the household goods transportation act,d repealed,which was in effect when the baga serpent was shipped in.on september,plaintiff filed a bill of costs.plaintiff bill of costs sought to tax the travel costs of his witnesses from new york koestler,stevenson,kahan,chisholm,newton,oliver baltimore lamp paris ndiaye and phoenix hahn.trepel claimed that the total amount of these travel costs was.he also requested an order compelling defendant to reimburse him for in expert witness fees that he paid lamp,stevenson,koestler,rosenburg,kahan,and chisholm to appear at depositions taken by the defendant.the district court referred the motion for attorney fees and the motion for costs to magistrate judge gallas.
the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation in which he recommended denying plaintiff attorney fees on the ground that plaintiff was not entitled to recover attorney fees because the item involved is an object of art that is exempt from the provision of d.regarding the witnesses travel expenses,the magistrate judge proposed that the plaintiff only be allowed to recoup travel costs for travel within miles of the courthouse miles total for each witness and recommended that these transportation costs be limited to per mile.based on the distance and rate limitations,the magistrate judge recommended granting the plaintiff in travel costs for each of his nine witnesses.finally,the magistrate judge proposed that plaintiff request for deposition expenses be denied on the grounds that it was not authorized by statute.the magistrate judge findings were adopted by the district court in toto 
ii.discussion 
attorney fees 
as noted above,the district court adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation denied trepel motion for attorney fees on the ground that there was no statutory basis for such an award on appeal,trepel contends that the district court erred because he is entitled to attorney fees under the household goods transportation act.d repealed.the denial of attorney fees is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion.see cramblit fikse,cir.however,when the denial of attorney fees is based on the construction of a statute,we exercise de novo review.see columbia gas system united states.
background 
in,congress enacted the household goods transportation act,et,to remedy problems in the interstate shipping industry.one of the problems apparently faced by shippers of household goods was that common carriers refused to recognize their claims because the carriers knew that few household goods shippers would engage in an expensive lawsuit to recover for damage to common household items of relatively little value in order to rectify this problem,the household goods transportation act proposed that shippers provide arbitration and dispute resolution programs so that customers could recover damages without going to court.see,at,reprinted in,the new section establishes minimum requirements for informal dispute settlement programs to be established by household goods carriers for the purpose of resolving shipper disputes in a fair,expeditious,and inexpensive manner.
in order to encourage carriers to make dispute settlement programs available,the household goods transportation act stipulated that common carriers who did not make a dispute resolution program available would be liable for attorney fees if a customer prevailed on his claim.see d the shipper shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees if no dispute settlement program approved under this section was available for use by the shipper to resolve this dispute.however,the act did not make attorney fees available to all successful litigants.according to f,the attorney provision only applied in the case of transportation of those types of household goods described in section a of this title.f repealed.
provided the definition of household goods.this provision described three categories of household goods.
a personal effects and property used or to be used in a dwelling when a part of the equipment or supply of such dwelling but not property moving from a factory or store,except such property as the householder has purchased with intent to use in his dwelling and which is transported at the request of,and the transportation charges paid to the carrier by,the householder 
b furniture,fixtures,equipment and the property of stores,offices,museums,institutions,hospitals or other establishments except.the of any establishment,whether consignor or consignee,other than used furniture and used fixtures,except when transported as incidental to moving of the establishment,or a portion thereof,from one location to another and 
c articles,including objects of art,displays and exhibits,which because of their unusual nature or value require specialized handling and equipment usually employed in moving household goods except that this subparagraph shall not be construed to include any article,whether crated or uncrated,which does not,because of its unusual nature or value,require the specialized handling and equipment usually employed in moving household goods.
repealed.as noted above,the shifting provisions only applied to personal effects and property used or to be used in a dwelling described in part 
on appeal,trepel argues that he is entitled to attorney fees because the baga serpent that he shipped is a personal effect to be used in a dwelling under a.in response,defendant roadway express sets forth two different arguments as to why trepel is not entitled to attorney fees under this statute.
shippers covered 
first,roadway argues that it is not required to pay attorney fees under d because it is not a member of the household moving industry.in support of this argument,roadway points to legislative history which it argues indicates that the household goods transportation act was intended to apply to the household goods moving industry apart from the rest of the trucking industry,at,reprinted in at.roadway argues that it is clearly not part of the household goods moving industry because it is not certified to carry household goods it does not go to any shipper home and transport his or her household contents to a new residential location it does not have specialized equipment and trained personnel and it does not hold itself out as a mover of household goods.accordingly,roadway concludes it is not subject to the provisions of the household goods transportation act,and therefore is not required to pay trepel attorney fees.we disagree.
first,the legislative history does not clearly indicate that congress intended the provision of section d to apply solely to the household goods moving industry.rather,the house report only suggests that various factors prompted the committee on public works and transportation to consider the household goods moving industry apart from the rest of the trucking industry.id.at,reprinted in at.this language does not take any position on the ultimate scope of the household goods transportation act.
moreover,section d explicitly states that the provision applies to any motor common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the commission under subchapter ii of chapter of this title d repealed.since roadway undisputedly falls within this description,the plain language of the statute indicates that the provisions apply to roadway express.given that the statutory language is unambiguous,and there is no clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary,we find that the language of the statute is conclusive.see bradley austin,cir if we find that the statutory language is unambiguous,then that language is regarded as conclusive unless there is clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary.citing united states premises known as old brownsville road,shelby county,tennessee,cir.
household goods covered 
roadway express also argues that this statute does not apply to the baga serpent because it is an object of art.as noted above,section describes three categories of household goods a personal effects and property used or to be used in a dwelling,b furniture,fixtures,equipment and the property of stores,offices,museums,and c objects of art,displays and exhibits.repealed.however,the provisions of section d only apply to personal effects and property described in section a.according to roadway express,the three subsections of are mutually exclusive.the defendant contends that since that the baga serpent is clearly an object of art as described in c,it can not be a personal effect or property under a,and is therefore not covered by the provisions.
in support of this interpretation,roadway asserts that congress intended this statute to give shippers redress when the cost of the item damaged was too small to justify the expense of litigation.based on this intent,it argues that the provisions were not meant to cover objects of art because the owners of these expensive objects would already have a sufficient incentive to sue.alternatively,roadway express argues that trepel serpent should fall exclusively within subsection c because the rules of statutory interpretation dictate that the specific provision governs over the general one.see morales trans world airlines,d.
we are not persuaded by either of these arguments.roadway argument that congress intended to preclude customers who shipped objects of art from using the provisions because they have sufficient incentive to sue is not convincing because it overlooks the fact that many objects of art that people ship are of little monetary value.roadway interpretation would have the ridiculous effect of precluding owners of inexpensive art from making use of this statute just because the item is an object of art and not some other household property we do not believe that congress intended such a scheme.if congress wanted to exclude expensive objects from coverage under a,it could have easily done so by implementing a dollar cap.however,it did not.
furthermore,we do not believe that the maxim that the specific provision should govern the general one is applicable in this case.the rule that a specific provision should govern a more general one is a helpful rule of thumb to apply when it is necessary to reconcile two conflicting statutory provisions.however,we see no reason to apply this rule in the instant case since there is no inherent conflict between provisions and there is nothing to reconcile.see gallenstein united states,cir the general rule that the specific governs the general does not apply when the plain language of the two subsections can be reconciled without need for the application of a general rule.
finally,and most importantly,we find that roadway argument is not supported by the plain language of the statute.section f simply states that the attorney fees provisions of the statute apply only to the types of household goods described in a.that section in turn refers to personal effects and property to be used in a dwelling.the baga serpent plainly falls within this section because it is a personal effect that trepel planned to use in his dwelling in arizona.while it is true that the serpent is an object of art and also falls under subsection c there is nothing in the plain language of the statute to indicate that this fact precludes it from also being part of subsection a.accordingly,we find that the district court erred when it adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation and held that the baga serpent is not covered by the provision of d.see austin,at in determining the meaning of legislation,we must first look to the plain language of the statute itself.
before the magistrate judge,roadway argued that even if trepel is entitled to attorney fees under d,he waived his right to attorney fees by failing to claim them in his complaint and by failing to file a motion for attorney fees within days of the entry of judgment.since the magistrate judge denied trepel attorney fees on the grounds that,plaintiff was not entitled to them under the household goods transportation act,he never reached the question of whether trepel had waived his right to attorney fees.given that the district court adopted the magistrate judge report in toto,it did not reach the waiver issue either.in light of our holding that trepel is entitled to attorney fees under d,we remand this case to the district court to determine whether trepel waived his right to attorney fees.
taxed costs 
travel expenses 
on september,plaintiff filed a bill of costs.plaintiff bill of costs sought to tax the travel costs of his witnesses from new york koestler,stevenson,kahan,chisholm,newton,oliver baltimore lamp paris ndiaye and phoenix hahn.trepel claimed that the total amount of these travel costs was.
after reviewing the plaintiffs bill of costs,the magistrate judge recommended limiting trepel witnesses travel expenses to per mile.the magistrate judge stated that this limit was justified because trepel only submitted demands for payment from his witnesses,and did not supply the witnesses actual receipts.he indicated that g iven the weakness of the supporting documentation the reasonableness of the plaintiff demands for payment,which included over for cab fare,was seriously in question.
citing the supreme court decision in farmer arabian am.oil,d,the magistrate judge also proposed that since trepel had not obtained the trial court approval to bring witnesses to testify,he should not be awarded costs for any travel that was not within miles of the courthouse.the magistrate judge did not spe
