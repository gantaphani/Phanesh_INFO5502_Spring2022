between and,plaintiffs jose and maria elena chavez operated a shuttle service between sasabe,arizona and tucson,arizona.plaintiffs allege that border patrol agents stopped their shuttle repeatedly and in violation of their fourth amendment rights.based on these allegations,the plaintiffs bring claims not only against the agents who stopped them,but also against supervisors who they claim reviewed and directed the stops.we hold that plaintiffs conclusory allegations fail to state a claim against all of the supervisors but one,a direct participant in the stops.
factual allegations 
in december of,jose and maria elena chavez filed a bivens action alleging,among other things,that border patrol agents had violated their fourth amendment rights.according to the complaint,the plaintiffs operated a shuttle service that,beginning in the fall of,made two or three round trips each day between sasabe,arizona and tucson,arizona.the shuttle never crossed the border with mexico.both plaintiffs and the majority of their passengers are hispanic.plaintiffs have no training in identifying illegal aliens,and the border patrol,in response to an inquiry plaintiffs filed with their congressman,allegedly informed the plaintiffs through their congressman that the plaintiffs had no responsibility for assessing their passengers immigration status.
plaintiffs allege that,beginning in,roving border patrol agents stopped their shuttle on almost a daily basis.they allege that,because they traveled at speeds of up to miles per hour,border patrol agents could not possibly have discerned particular features of individual vehicles or their occupants reasonably probative of drug trafficking,alien smuggling or related wrongdoing,except,perhaps,in a small percentage of exceptional cases,and so the agents had no basis for making the stops.instead,plaintiffs allege,the stops were based principally on the latin,hispanic or mexican appearance of drivers other occupants of vehicles.plaintiffs allege that agents occasionally referred to passengers as wetbacks and used profanity.an agent also allegedly told plaintiffs that plaintiffs should be able to identify illegal aliens by their uncleanliness and offensive odor.the average stop,according to the complaint,lasted five to thirty minutes.
plaintiffs also allege that the agents have threatened plaintiffs,demanded that plaintiffs refund their passengers fares,required plaintiffs to reverse course,confiscated plaintiffs van,and removed personal property from it.according to plaintiffs,agents became angry if they did not find illegal aliens aboard the shuttle.agents allegedly did not ask for consent before searching the shuttle,and plaintiffs never gave such consent.
in addition to suing various border patrol agents,the plaintiffs also bring claims against supervisors within the border patrol,specifically,james ziglar,the acting commissioner of the immigration and naturalization service ins,david aguilar,the chief border patrol agent for the tucson sector,and ralph hunt,alvaro obregon,felix chavez,and michael campbell,who all hold supervisory positions in the border patrol collectively,the supervisory defendants.plaintiffs allege that ziglar,by virtue of his position as acting commissioner,bore responsibility for overseeing and supervising border patrol functions at the sector level.in the course of such supervision,ziglar allegedly reviewed and approved each chief border patrol agent enforcement program before allowing its implementation.as for aguilar,as chief border patrol agent for the tucson sector,he had direct responsibility for the ongoing activities of border patrol agents in that sector.
plaintiffs allege that,at various times,they complained about the frequent stops to hunt,obregon,felix chavez,and campbell.because the stops continued despite their complaints and the supervisory defendants responsibilities,the plaintiffs allege that the supervisory defendants personally reviewed and,thus,knowingly ordered,directed,sanctioned or permitted the allegedly unconstitutional stops.
finally,plaintiffs allege that hunt and obregon personally participated in stops.first,after a border patrol agent arrested maria elena chavez,obregon allegedly interrogated her for four to five hours.next,plaintiffs claim that hunt personally stopped them on at least two occasions.during one such stop in the winter of,hunt allegedly required jose chavez to refund the passengers fares.during another stop in august of,hunt allegedly took the keys to plaintiffs van after discovering that passengers did not have appropriate documentation.in connection with this same stop,a different border patrol agent allegedly transported jose chavez to the three points area and left him there.
procedural background 
in august of,the district court dismissed the claims against ziglar,aguilar,hunt,obregon,felix chavez,and campbell,concluding that plaintiffs had failed to specifically allege that any defendant supervisor was personally involved or linked to any of plaintiffs alleged constitutional deprivations.this court reversed.chavez united states,cir.we concluded that 
the complaint adequately alleges the personal involvement of the supervisors in the unconstitutional patrols.specifically,it alleges that the defendants personally reviewed and,thus,knowingly ordered,directed,sanctioned or permitted the roving patrol s.the complaint also alleges that the unconstitutional patrols were exacerbated by a lack of reporting requirements,and that the chavezes complained to hunt,obregon,chavez,and campbell about the allegedly unlawful stops.furthermore,the complaint alleges that aguilar knew of the roving patrols and deliberately sanctioned them.
an unconstitutional policy and practice can be inferred from the complaint description of directed and repeated roving patrols,the allegation that the supervisors sanctioned them,and the allegation that the agents had supervisory authority.
id.quoting cmplt.
after the ninth circuit reinstated plaintiffs bivens claims against the supervisory defendants,the supreme court decided ashcroft iqbal,d.in light of iqbal,the supervisory defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure c.the district court denied the motion,finding that the supervisory defendants failed to provide a plausible nondiscriminatory explanation for the alleged stops.moreover,the district court held that plaintiffs did not need to allege that the supervisory defendants directly participated in constitutional violations.instead,citing larez city of los angeles,cir,the district court held that the plaintiffs had plausibly alleged that the supervisory defendants had either knowingly refused to terminate a series of acts they reasonably should have known would cause constitutional violations,acquiesced in constitutional deprivations by subordinates,or displayed reckless or callous indifference to others rights.
the supervisory defendants now appeal from that decision.we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal because a district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law,is an appealable final decision within the meaning of notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.mitchell forsyth,d.while the district court here did not address the issue of qualified immunity,the supervisory defendants raised qualified immunity as a defense in their answer to the complaint,and both their motion under rule c and their objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation made frequent reference to qualified immunity.thus,by failing to address the question of qualified immunity,the district court denied the supervisory defendants defense sub silentio.
where an appellate court has jurisdiction to review the denial of a qualified immunity defense,it also has jurisdiction to review predominantly legal issues,such as the sufficiency of a complaint,that are inextricably intertwined with and directly implicated by the issue of qualified immunity.ashcroft iqbal,d quoting hartman moore,d swint chambers cnty.comm n,d.accordingly,we have jurisdiction to review both whether the supervisory defendants have qualified immunity which turns on legal issues such as whether they allegedly violated clearly established rights,behrens pelletier,d and whether the complaint adequately alleges any claim against the supervisory defendants.we review both issues de novo.lyon chase bank usa,cir act up portland bagley,cir.
discussion 
under federal rule of civil procedure c,a fter the pleadings are closed but early enough not to delay trial a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.judgment on the pleadings is properly granted when,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true,there is no issue of material fact in dispute,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fleming pickard,cir.analysis under rule c is substantially identical to analysis under rule b because,under both rules,a court must determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint,taken as true,entitle the plaintiff to a legal remedy.brooks dunlop,no.c crb,wl,at.
on a motion to dismiss under rule b,a court must assess whether the complaint contain s sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.iqbal,at.quoting bell atl.twombly,d.mere conclusory statements in a complaint and formulaic recitation s of the elements of a cause of action are not sufficient.twombly,at.thus,a court discounts conclusory statements,which are not entitled to the presumption of truth,before determining whether a claim is plausible.iqbal,at.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will be a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.id.at.
applying this standard to a claim alleging invidious discrimination in violation of the fifth amendment,the supreme court in iqbal noted that officials violate the fifth amendment only when they act with a discriminatory purpose.id.at.moreover,the supreme court acknowledged that bivens claims can not proceed on a theory of respondeat superior,but must instead plead that a supervisor,by her own individual actions,violated the constitution.id.putting these requirements together,the supreme court noted that,to state a discrimination claim against a supervising official under the fifth amendment,a complaint must allege that the supervisor acted with purpose rather than knowledge.id.at.because the complaint at issue alleged only that the supervisors had approved a policy of detaining thousands of arab,muslim men,it failed to plausibly suggest that they had acted with a discriminatory purpose.id.at.instead,the court held that an obvious alternative explanation existed for approving the policy,namely a nondiscriminatory intent to detain aliens who were illegally present in the united states and who had potential connections to those who committed terrorist acts.id.at.quoting twombly,at.thus,the supreme court dismissed the complaint under rule b.id.at.
relying on iqbal,the supervisory defendants invite the court to hold that the fourth amendment,like the fifth amendment,requires plaintiffs to allege that supervisors acted with a discriminatory purpose.this argument,however,misreads iqbal.in iqbal,the supreme court did not require allegations of discriminatory purpose in order to render supervisors liable for any constitutional violation by their subordinates.rather,the supreme court noted that plaintiffs can not base a claim against supervisors on a theory of respondeat superior,and must instead show that the supervisors,through their own individual actions,ha ve violated the constitution.id.at.because a plaintiff claiming invidious discrimination under the fifth amendment must allege facts showing that officers acted with a discriminatory purpose,allowing that fifth amendment claim to proceed against a supervisor in the absence of a particularized showing of such a purpose would,in effect,render the supervisor vicariously liable for her subordinates intent.id.at.the requirement that a plaintiff allege a discriminatory purpose,then,derived from the fifth amendment rather than from the fact that the plaintiff pled claims against supervisors.we see nothing in iqbal indicating that the supreme court intended to overturn longstanding case law by adding a discriminatory purpose requirement to a fourth amendment claim against supervisors.see starr baca,cir reaching same conclusion for an eighth amendment claim.
the fourth amendment,unlike the fifth amendment,does not require a plaintiff to allege that an officer acted with any subjective motivation.brigham city,utah stuart,d.an officer conducting a roving patrol near the border violates the fourth amendment if she stops a vehicle in the absence of an objectively reasonable suspicion that the particular vehicle may contain aliens who are illegally in the country or is involved in some other criminal conduct.united states brignoni ponce,d.even if an officer makes a stop that violates the fourth amendment,qualified immunity protects the officer from liability unless it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.saucier katz,d,overruled in part on other grounds by pearson callahan,d.
because iqbal requires courts to apply an equivalent standard to supervisors and subordinates,we hold that,taking qualified immunity into account,a supervisor faces liability under the fourth amendment only where it would be clear to a reasonable supervisor that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.a lower standard would impose vicarious liability on supervisors based on their subordinates clearly unlawful conduct.because the plaintiffs complaint,as described below,does not come close to meeting this standard except with respect to defendant hunt,who faces liability for his direct participation in the stops,we leave to future cases the determination of what conduct by supervisors may qualify as clearly unlawful.
judged under the standard described above,plaintiffs complaint fails to state a fourth amendment claim against any supervisory defendant except hunt.turning first to the supervisory defendants other than hunt,even assuming arguendo that the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that border patrol agents conducted stops without reasonable suspicion,plaintiffs have not alleged facts that would allow a court to draw a reasonable inference that a reasonable supervisor in these defendants situations would have found their conduct to be clearly unlawful.the court discounts,as it must,the plaintiffs wholly conclusory allegation that the supervisory defendants personally reviewed and,thus,knowingly ordered,directed,sanctioned or permitted the allegedly unconstitutional stops.having done so,the remaining allegations do not plausibly suggest that these supervisors clearly should have regarded their conduct as unlawful.
first,the plaintiffs allege as to defendant james ziglar only that commissioner ziglar,by virtue of his position,reviews and must approve operation plans and enforcement programs developed by the chief border patrol agents immediately in command of sector forces.nonetheless,plaintiffs do not suggest that the relevant plan and program for the tucson sector indicated anything that would have informed commissioner ziglar that allegedly unconstitutional stops occurred,much less that his own conduct was,at least in the eyes of a reasonable supervisor,clearly unlawful.in the absence of any explanation of how ziglar review and approval of the tucson sector plans and programs something he apparently did for each sector in the country would have alerted him to the allegedly unconstitutional searches,the court holds that there is no plausible suggestion that a reasonable supervisor would have found it clear that ziglar conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.
second,the plaintiffs allege as to defendant david aguilar only that aguilar had line authority over and direct responsibility for the ongoing activities and operations o
