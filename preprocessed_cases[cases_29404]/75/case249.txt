opinion of the court 
the commonwealth of pennsylvania and arlen specter,one of the united states senators from pennsylvania,joined by various interested unions petition this court for review of the decision of the surface transportation board stb or board rejecting their petition to cancel the planned shutdown by norfolk southern ns of its hollidaysburg car shops hcs located outside altoona.
before the board,petitioners relied primarily on the representations condition that the board had imposed on ns requiring it to adhere to all of the representations ns had made during the course of the proceeding by which it received approval to acquire conrail properties,including the hcs.it will be evident to anyone who reviews the record that in the course of seeking the board approval of ns acquisition of a portion of conrail,which included the hollidaysburg car shops,ns had represented before the board and to various affected constituencies that it would keep the hcs open,that as a result ns was able to garner support from the commonwealth,senator specter and others,that these supporters understood that the hcs would remain operational for more than two years,but that ns announced plans to close the hcs in less than that time,and that only the stay imposed by this court pending decision on this petition for review has kept the hcs open.although the board found that ns had represented that the heavy repair shop at hollidaysburg would continue to be utilized,the board declined to cancel the shutdown,concluding that ns representations did not require continued operation in the face of deteriorating economic conditions.it is from this order that petitioners seek review.we regret that on this record this court is powerless to grant the petitions.
facts procedural posture 
the surface transportation board is the independent federal agency established by congress within the department of transportation and has the responsibility for the economic regulation of the country railroads the board has exclusive authority over the approval and supervision of railroad mergers.see,union united steelworkers of america,cir.
congress has prescribed a number of factors for the board to consider in the exercise of its authority to approve mergers.those factors include the merger effect on the adequacy of transportation available to the public,the impact on the public interest of the inclusion or exclusion of other carriers,the total fixed charges from the merger,the interest of the railroad employees affected by the merger,and the effect of the merger on competition between rail carriers.b.thus it was to the board that the prospective acquirers of conrail looked for ultimate approval.
initially,two railroad companies,norfolk southern corporation and norfolk southern railway company collectively ns and csx corporation and csx transportation,collectively csx,had battled over the extent to which either entity would acquire conrail,with each company publicly insisting its acquisition of conrail would better serve the interests of influential constituencies.for example,both csx and ns suggested they would consider moving their headquarters to philadelphia.henry holcomb,norfolk southern launches hostile bid for conrail,phila.inquirer.according to commentators,winning the congressional support of the pennsylvania delegation was a key component of ns strategy.see,don phillips,norfolk southern tops csx bid for conrail billion offer is likely to start a messy battle.post,at el.bud shuster,altoona congressman,and of the house transportation and infrastructure committee,announced he would launch a bloody,bruising legislative battle if need be to protect the jobs at conrail shops.tom gibb,bud shuster vows to fight to protect railroad jobs,pittsburgh,at.
during this period and after it joined forces with csx to seek approval of the conrail transaction,ns made a number of representations regarding the hollidaysburg car shops,located near altoona,pennsylvania.ns ceo,david goode,publicly stated that conrail locomotive and car repair shops,which make up the lion share of the economy of altoona,would grow under norfolk southern.holcomb,supra.ns bought advertising in the new york times representing that norfolk southern is committed to continuing to operate conrail hollidaysburg car shop and will promote employment there.app.at.ns issued a press release to the same effect.in a fact sheet issued around the time ns filed its conrail application,ns indicated its intent to invest an e stimated million in capital improvements at the hollidaysburg shop.csx transp.csx,stb fin.docket,slip op.at stb may,hereinafter decision alterations in original.
however,when goode testified before a subcommittee of the senate committee on appropriations,he stated only that we are in a position of not only being able to give assurances that we will keep the hollidaysburg and altoona shops and keep them operating,we are going to need them.conrail merger implications hearing before a subcomm.of the senate comm.on appropriations,cong.statement of david goode,president and ceo,norfolk southern.but representative shuster reported that he had received strong verbal reassurances that the shops will remain at least at the current level.gibb,supra.
in its application before the stb,ns observed that the shops were excellent,while ns comparable facilities are in roanoke,virginia.app.at.according to ns,important efficiencies can be gained by concentrating different types of mechanical work at each location.id.ns concluded by noting that insourcing provides another opportunity to maximize utilization of the system shops at and roanoke csx plans to use ns services at for at least a portion of its conrail car and locomotive fleets.id.ns indicated it would market the services offered by the hcs in order to expand the opportunities there.decision,slip op.at.in the operating plan ns submitted as part of the merger approval process,ns again represented it would invest four million dollars in capital improvements to the hcs.

the board approv ed the primary application in its entirety,decision,slip op.at,observing the application was endorsed by more than parties,including more than shippers,more than public officials,and more than railroads,id.at.the board found that the merger,as conditioned by its decision approving the transaction,is consistent with the public interest b the transaction will not adversely affect the adequacy of transportation to the public c failure to include other railroads will not adversely affect the public interest and e the interests of employees affected by the proposed transaction do not make such transaction inconsistent with the public interest,and any adverse effect will be adequately addressed by the conditions imposed.id.at.
the statute gives the board the authority to impose conditions governing merger authorizations.c.the board has extraordinarily broad discretion under that section to fashion conditions to such transactions to ensure that the public interest standard is satisfied.pac.transp.icc,see also grainbelt surface transp.
in approving the merger,the board imposed a number of conditions on ns and csx.the condition of relevance here provided that applicants must adhere to all of the representations they made during the course of this proceeding,whether or not such representations are specifically referenced in this decision.decision,slip op.at.the board reiterated this condition a number of times in its decision.see,id.at certain parties seeking the imposition of conditions ask that we note for the record the settlement agreement they have entered into with ns.as we have noted elsewhere in this decision,we are requiring applicants to adhere to any representations made to parties in this case.id.at csx and ns have made,both in their written submissions and also at the oral argument numerous representations to the effect that certain issues will be addressed,certain services will be provided,and so on.some of these representations are specifically referenced in this decision many however,are not specifically referenced.we think it appropriate to note,and to emphasize,that csx and ns will be required to adhere to all of the representations made on the record during the course of this proceeding,whether or not such representations are specifically referenced in this decision.
on june,following the approval by the board of the conrail split,ns began operating various conrail lines.in november of,less than a year and a half after it began operating the hcs,ns announced its intention to close that facility.congressman shuster,who asserted that he had been given personal assurances by ns that the hcs would be retained,scheduled hearings on the matter.ns ceo then advised shuster via letter that it would not continue with the planned closure.shortly thereafter,in january,shuster resigned,saying he did not want to serve after being removed as chairman of the powerful transportation committee because of gop term limits.shuster name will remain in congress,lewistown sentinel may,at.on february,ns announced the closure of the hcs,effective approximately september.
promptly thereafter,the unions and the commonwealth of pennsylvania filed petitions to the board seeking an order barring the closure.the board ultimately issued three decisions in response to the petitions.first,the board issued decision on may,directing ns to show why the board should not order ns to cancel a proposed of its hollidaysburg car shops and to keep them open at least at present capacity for a significant period of time beyond september,in view of representations made in the conrail proceeding,or made elsewhere,upon which involved parties clearly relied in formulating positions of support for the conrail transaction.decision,slip op.at.
the board found that ns had indicated that the heavy repair shop at hollidaysburg would continue to be utilized.id.at.according to the board,t hroughout the course of the conrail proceeding,ns indicated on numerous occasions that it was committed to operating the hollidaysburg car shops.id.the board found that ns representations the hollidaysburg car shops were intended to be relied upon,and were relied upon,in connection with the positions taken by various parties in the conrail proceeding.id.at.thus,the board observed,in the present circumstances,the customary flexibility that we accord the projections of merger applicants must give way to the representations by ns to keep the hollidaysburg car shops open and upon which people clearly relied in formulating positions of support for the conrail transaction.id.at.the board concluded by stating that t he board takes very seriously statements and comments made by parties in all matters that come before us.we will continue to be vigilant in doing what we can to ensure that representations made by parties to our proceedings are actually honored.id.
petitioners rely particularly on the following statements in decision.first,the board observed,w e agree that ns never committed to keeping the shops open in perpetuity,but it is now only years since the date on which conrail assets were divided between csx and ns.id.at.the board also suggested that the representations condition would not be waived based on new events that were foreseeable to ns at the time it made its representations regarding ns claim that it now has excess freight car repair capacity,if ns does indeed have excess freight car repair capacity today,this is an excess that could have been considered in when commitments were made.id.at.
commissioner burkes dissented from the board decision,complaining that the board had never before strictly enforced a representations condition.id.at.commissioner burkes cited examples where,notwithstanding a similar condition,the board had not required former merger applicants to strictly comply with their earlier representations to make certain investments.he noted that the board encouraged ns to deviate from its operating plan in buffalo,new york by changing its operations there and making the considerably greater investment of million than that it had originally anticipated.indeed,burkes observed that,in retrospect,perhaps,the board should have only allowed ns to spend only million in buffalo and require it to spend million in hollidaysburg.id.in another proceeding,the board had not required union pacific to make investments it had represented it would make because the board recognized there is no requirement that a merger applicant actually make investments in the exact places or at the precise dollar amount that it predicts it will spend in its application.see also union pacific,stb fin.docket,slip op.at,same.
commissioner burkes could discern no difference between the enforcement of investment representations and the enforcement of a representation to maintain hcs.burkes concluded that strict enforcement of the representations condition would be a new standard that should not be applied retroactively to ns or to any other railroad if the board intends this to be a new standard,then it should be addressed in our new railroad merger rules which will be issued shortly by the board.decision,slip op.at 
four months later,in decision,issued september,the board denied the petition to order ns to keep the hcs open.csx transp.csx,stb finance docket,slip op.at,stb,hereinafter decision.the board observed that deteriorating economic conditions had forced ns to scale back its ambitions on a number of fronts,including a reduction in its dividend for the first time in its history,a reduction in its management workforce,and a contraction of its fleet by rail cars.id.at.furthermore,the board noted ns contention that,when analyzed as a facility,the hcs was losing up to seven million dollars annually.id.at.keeping open the hcs might also require ns to shut down other facilities.f avoring the hcs and its employees could work to disfavor other ns employees and locations.id.at.
on the other hand,the board observed that ns had presented nothing here to change our prior conclusion that the carrier representations both before and during the merger process could not help but reasonably lead state and local interests to believe that ns would keep the shops open and to rely on that commitment in determining how they participated in the merger process.id.at.in light of the reliance on ns representation to keep the hcs open,the board supplement ed the labor protective conditions imposed in decision.id.at.
in its final decision,decision,issued on october,the board rejected the request by the commonwealth and the unions for a stay pending judicial review.csx csx transp,stb fin.docket,slip op.at stb,hereinafter decision.there,the board observed that in decision,we determined that ns did not represent that it would keep the hcs open indefinitely,without regard to business and economic conditions.id.at.
the petitioners filed this petition for review.they sought,and we granted,a stay.at ns request,we expedited the proceeding.
jurisdiction 
this court has jurisdiction to review the board decisions pursuant to.the petition for review was timely filed.
discussion 
petitioners raise two issues in this case.they contend that the board decision under review was arbitrary and capricious,and that the board decision was unreasonable and standardless constituted an abuse of its discretion.the standard of review is established by the administrative procedure act apa,a,which provides that the reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.
petitioners do not,nor could they reasonably,argue that the board decision not to enjoin ns from closing the hcs is not in accordance with law.congress committed to the board the exclusive authority to approve and authorize consolidations or mergers of rail carriers,and this authority encompasses supervision of those mergers.
there is no contention that the board failed to follow the required procedures.instead,petitioners argue that the board decision was arbitrary and capricious.they list six reasons why it should be so characterized.they are that the decision fails to show a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,the board relied on irrelevant factors,it failed to articulate a standard governing when railroad merger applicants will be held to their promises,it failed to explain why the adverse events cited were not foreseeable,it failed to treat its decision as to the hcs as a departure from its earlier policy holding ns and other merging railroads to all of their promises and representations,and it failed to consider relevant and important factors.
where the board is interpreting and applying conditions it has promulgated according to its statutory authority,its action is accorded the highest deference.see,csx,surface transp,the board decision interpreting the conditions that it announced in oregon short line is entitled to considerable deference,even greater deference than when an agency interprets a statutory term.citation omitted motor freight traffic ass icc,we accord particular deference when,as here,the subject of review is the agency interpretation of its own order.notably,the board imposition of conditions to mergers has been characterized as the kind of judgmental or predictive conclusion with respect to which judicial deference to agency expertise is especially appropriate.pac.transp.icc,citation omitted.given the board extraordinarily broad discretion to impose conditions pursuant to a merger the courts have appropriately given the board selection of such conditions great deference.id.at.in determining whether the board was arbitrary and capricious in its interpretation of such a condition,our review is particularly deferential,implicating,as it does,both the board expertise in imposing the condition and our customary deference to an agency interpretations of directives which it has itself promulgated.
it is evident that at the heart of the petitioners argument is their position that the representations condition that the board imposed on ns in decision bound ns to the representations it made to keep the hcs open.therefore,before considering the petitioners contention that the board failed to apply the representations condition,it is necessary to determine the nature of ns representations.although the representations condition in decision by its terms covers only representations made on the record during the course of this proceeding the conrail acquisition,neither the board nor the parties have suggested that there is a significant distinction between the representations and the representations made by ns in public statements and advertisements in the course of its campaign to seek board approval of the conrail acquisition.
petitioners conceded at oral argument before us that ns never said that it committed to operate the hcs in perpetuity.transcript of oral argument february,at hereinafter tr.nor have they pointed us to any commitment to operate the hcs for any defined time.instead of identifying any specific statement or representation,petitioners counsel referred us to the body of statements made by ns referred to above.edelman,counsel for the unions,stated 
i t the press release.it the statement to senator specter.it the statements to the governor.it the statements to congressman shuster.it newspaper ads all over the state that they took out,dear employees,you know.
the board has accepted both the contentions that ns made representations and that these representations were covered by the representations condition that the board imposed.in decision,which required ns to show cause why the board should not cancel the announced hcs,the board referred to ns representations the hollidaysburg car shops.however,the board did not describe the nature of ns representation or its commitment other than in vague terms.for instance,it observed that in the present circumstances,the customary flexibility that we accord the projections of merger applicants must give way to the representations by ns to keep the hollidaysburg car shops open and operating.decision,slip op.at emphasis added.in addition,the board used language that appeared to reject ns proffered explanations for the,stating,w e can not accept,without further explanation,the implicit argument that ns commitments vis the hollidaysburg car shops were intended to remain in effect only as long as the economy remained as it was at that time.regarding ns claim that it now has excess freight car repair capacity,if ns does indeed have excess freight car repair capacity today,this is an excess that could have been considered in when commitments were made.id.at.
in response to the direction to show cause in decision,ns argued that deteriorating economic conditions forced it to rethink its operations and to take various steps to reduce costs,increase efficiency,and restructure the company to enable it to perform profitably.among those steps,but far from the only one,was the closure of the hcs,which ns reported had lost almost seven million dollars in the year.
referring to these changed economic conditions,the board,less than four months after decision,issued decision,in which it held it would not require ns to keep the hcs open after the announced closing date of october.in so holding,the board did not backtrack on its prior acknowledgment that ns had made representations.after reviewing the petitioners arguments which are substantially the same as those before us and the positions of other interested entities,the board began its discussion section with the statement 
it is evident that,during the course of and in connection with the conrail proceeding,ns made a general commitment to the area and to the employees of the hcs and the jls nearby juniata locomotive shop that it would make these shops an important part of its operations.
decision,slip op.at.the board described the commitment as follows 
this commitment was,in essence,both a commitment to the future economic of the area and a commitment to the of the individual employees of the hcs and the jls,and it is supported by statements in the record and confirmed by other representations made by ns officials at the highest levels.ns has presented nothing here to change our prior conclusion that the carrier representations both before and during the merger process could not help but reasonably lead state and local interests to believe that ns would keep the shops open and to rely on that commitment in determining how they participated in the merger process.decision at.
id.citation omitted.finally,on the nature of the commitment the board concluded that ns kept its commitment by operating the hcs and the jls for more than two years.id.
petitioners sought a stay pending judicial review.in decision,which was the board final word on the subject of the representations made,the board described decision as determin ing that ns had indeed made commitments to the area and to hcs were relied upon by various local and statewide interests in determining how they would participate in the merger ns would make the hcs and the nearby juniata locomotive shop jls important parts of its operations.decision,slip op.at.significantly,the board stated that the sole issue before us in decision was whether ns violated our condition that the carrier adhere to its representations,and we found no indication in the record of the conrail proceeding,or elsewhere,that ns had represented that it would continue hcs operations irrespective of changing business conditions.id.at emphasis added.
our review of the record leads us to the same conclusion.although officials of the commonwealth,the local communities,the employees,and influential public figures,such as senator specter,may have been led to understand otherwise,we can find no representation by ns that it intended to operate hcs indefinitely without regard to business conditions.a careful parsing of the statements by
