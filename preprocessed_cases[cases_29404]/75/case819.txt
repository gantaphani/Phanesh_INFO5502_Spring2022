in this appeal the appellant,swift transportation,raises ten issues based on various rulings by the district court leading up to and during the course of a jury trial in which swift was found liable on claims brought by the appellees,terry and donna frederick.swift argues these rulings,individually and considered together,resulted in an unfair trial and we should grant a new trial as to both liability and damages.the fredericks,in turn,the district court denial of their motion for prejudgment interest 
on the morning of march,a yellow freight collided with a swift transportation as the swift was attempting to enter a rest stop off of highway in new mexico.terry frederick,who was in the sleeping berth of the yellow freight at the time of the accident,and his wife,donna,subsequently brought this action against swift for the injuries he sustained following a trial on the merits,the jury returned a verdict in favor of the fredericks for a total of.after a reduction for comparative fault,the court entered judgment against swift in the amount of.on appeal,swift challenges the court rulings on several jury instructions,as well as the court rulings on the admissibility of certain witness testimony and evidence.the fredericks,in their,argue the court denial of prejudgment interest was contrary to the evidence and new mexico law.we address each issue in turn

course and scope of employment 
at the close of the fredericks evidence,the court ruled as a matter of law that swift driver,who tested positive for methamphetamine on a drug test several hours after the accident,acted within the scope and course of employment.the court then instructed the jury that swift is liable for any negligence of its driver.appellant app.at.on appeal,swift argues the court erred in giving this instruction because whether its driver consumed methamphetamine before or after the accident is a disputed fact thus,the jury could have found that the driver ingested the methamphetamine before the accident and that this action removed her from the course and scope of her employment.
in new mexico,whether an employee was acting within the scope of his employment is generally a question of fact for the jury.ovecka burlington ry.however,when no facts are in dispute and the undisputed facts lend themselves to only one conclusion,the issue may properly be decided as a matter of law.id.new mexico uniform jury instructions provide that 
a n act of an employee is within the scope of employment if 
it was something fairly and naturally incidental to the employer business assigned to the employee,and 
it was done while the employee was engaged in the employer business with the view of furthering the employer interest and did not arise entirely from some external,independent and personal motive on the part of the employee.
uji nmra.while this rule seems simple,because of the facts of each particular case,it must nevertheless be applied variably,tinley davis,with reference to the time,place,and circumstances under which the injury occurred,ovecka,at internal quotation marks omitted.in order for swift to escape liability,it must be shown that its driver,when the wrongful act was committed,had abandoned h er employment and was acting for a purpose of h er own which was not incident to h er employment.hansen skate ranch,n.
the undisputed facts in this case show that swift driver was specifically employed to drive swift and,at the time of the accident,swift driver was on duty,driving on her assigned route under swift direction,and attempting to meet the deadline swift established for the delivery of goods while it is true that the exact time swift driver ingested she did in reality ingest disputed,this fact is immaterial.driving a while under the influence of methamphetamine is a negligent act,but this does not mean that the negligent act was outside the scope of the driver employment.nichols united states,cir quoting hansen,at.at the time of the accident,swift driver was engaged in her employer business with the view of furthering her employer interest.uji nmra.indeed,even if the actual act of consuming methamphetamine were to constitute an abandonment of the driver employment,swift driver resumed her employment as soon as she recommenced driving swift on the assigned route.see ovecka,at recognizing that an employee may return to her employment after previously abandoning it.nor has swift argued there was evidence its driver was so severely impaired by methamphetamine that a jury could find she had not returned to her employment even after she had resumed driving,as new mexico law would require in order for swift to avoid liability.see id.while we certainly do not hold that ingesting illicit drugs can never remove an employee from the course and scope of employment,we conclude that,under these facts,the district court instruction was proper.indeed,as counsel for the fredericks argued,to hold otherwise would be to hold that a professional driver who consumes narcotics can be considered as acting outside the scope of her employment for hours at a time,even if she has continued to drive her employer vehicle on its prescribed route and in furtherance of her employer interests.
negligence per se under the federal safety regulations 
at trial the court instructed the jury that if it found swift driver violated any one of several federal motor carrier safety regulations,including fmcsr a,a,or a,then the driver conduct constitutes negligence as a matter of law.appellant app.at.swift argues this instruction was given in error because these regulations only apply to drivers and not employers as such,swift argues,a driver violation is not a proper basis for holding the employer liable.however,as the trial court noted in its order denying swift motion for a new trial,this argument conveniently overlooks that the court found as a matter of law that swift driver was its employee and acting within the course and scope of her employment when the accident occurred.appellant app.at.under the doctrine of respondeat superior,swift is liable for all the negligent behavior of its employee,which includes violations of the federal motor carrier safety regulations.the court committed no error in providing this instruction.
claims for negligent hiring and negligent retention 
swift claims the district court erred by instructing the jury as to its potential liability under the theory of negligent hiring or retention after it had already found,as a matter law,that swift was liable for its driver negligent acts under the doctrine of respondeat superior for support,swift points to a line of cases from various jurisdictions holding that when an employer admits the applicability of respondeat superior,it is entitled to summary judgment on claims for negligent entrustment,hiring,and retention.durben am.materials.the reason for this rule is the view that,since the employer would be liable for the employee negligence under respondeat superior,allowing claims for negligent entrustment,hiring,and retention would not entitle the plaintiff to a greater recovery,but would merely serve to prejudice the employer.id.despite this limitation,however,those courts that have adopted this rule have also generally recognized an exception to the rule whereby a plaintiff may bring a claim based on negligent hiring or retention along with its claims under respondeat superior when the plaintiff has a valid claim for punitive damages against the employer based on its independent negligence in hiring and retaining the employee.see also,coville ryder truck rental,mchaffie bunch,tindell enderle.
new mexico courts have expressly avoided ruling on this theory,see ortiz new mexico state police,and,because we can affirm the district court decision on this issue without considering swift proposed rule,we will not speculate as to whether the new mexico supreme court would adopt it.the fredericks complaint alleged valid claims for punitive damages against swift based on swift independent actions.thus,even if new mexico were to adopt swift proposed rule,the court instruction would have been proper in light of the rule exception for punitive damages.gillingham reliable chevrolet,holding that in order to impose punitive damages against an employer,its conduct must be found to be willful,reckless,or wanton,apart from the conduct of its employee,overruled on other grounds by fernandez espanola pub.sch.
promotion to the fleet 
prior to the accident at issue,swift driver was transferred to a new fleet,the route.at trial the court gave the following instruction,in relevant part,regarding that transfer to establish negligence on the part of swift,plaintiffs have the burden of proving at least one of the following swift failed to use ordinary care in promoting its driver to the transcontinental fleet.appellant app.at.swift argues there was not substantial evidence its driver was promoted rather,according to swift,the evidence showed its driver reassignment was merely a lateral move within the company.thus,swift argues,this instruction was both misleading and not supported by the evidence.
the record indicates this new assignment was more difficult,involved important clients,and would result in more pay for swift driver.indeed,swift driver manager described the route as having the best miles and being really a good deal for the teams.appellees supplemental app.at.given this evidence,we can not say the district court abused its discretion when it provided this instruction.as the court stated,the fredericks could have used some other buzz word to describe the driver transfer to the fleet,but the meaning would have been the same,the driver was advanced to the fleet,not demoted.appellant app.at.
admissibility of expert testimony 
having addressed the jury instructions,we now turn to swift contentions concerning the admissibility of certain expert testimony.
admissibility of expert testimony from sperry and atkinson 
swift argues the trial court erred by denying its motion to exclude the testimonies of kris sperry the fredericks toxicology expert and arthur atkinson the fredericks trucking safety expert because their testimonies did not meet the reliability standards of rule of the federal rules of evidence and daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals.w e review de novo the question of whether the district court applied the proper standard and actually performed its gatekeeper role in the first instance.we then review the trial court actual application of the standard in deciding whether to admit or exclude an expert testimony for abuse of discretion.dodge cotter,cir.we will not,however,disturb a district court ruling absent our conviction that it is arbitrary,capricious,whimsical,manifestly unreasonable,or clearly erroneous.bitler smith,cir.on review we are concerned with the trial court performance of its obligation under rule and daubert,not upon the exact conclusions reached to exclude or admit expert testimony.id.
first,as to the court gatekeeper function,the record shows that for both witnesses the district court considered preliminary briefing,which included legal argument as well as deposition transcripts and full copies of the experts reports.the court then held daubert hearings where the witnesses were subjected to examination by both sides,and,as concerned sperry,the court considered additional briefing following the hearing.finally,the court issued detailed opinions as to each witness containing specific findings on the record,dodge,at emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted,concerning the reliability and relevance of the proffered testimony.after a careful review,we conclude there was no error in the manner in which the district court performed its role as a gatekeeper under rule and daubert.we also conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to admit those portions of atkinson and sperry expert opinions ultimately presented at trial.
partial exclusion of robert reed testimony and proffer of evidence 
prior to the trial,the district court granted,in part,the fredericks motion to strike the proposed expert testimony of robert reed,swift designated expert on trucking safety and regulatory compliance.specifically,the court held that several exhibits,including a turning study conducted at the scene of the accident and a perception study showing what a driver could have seen on the night of the accident,fell within areas outside the scope of reed expert designation.see.c.during the trial,the court also refused to allow swift to make a proffer of the excluded portions of reed proposed testimony.
after reviewing the record,we hold the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding portions of reed testimony.see woodworker supply,principal mut.life ins,cir reviewing a rule c ruling for abuse of discretion.swift argues these studies are not reconstruction because they were meant to determine possibilities,not realities.appellant first br.at.however,reed proposed studies feature reed behind the wheel of a substantially similar to those involved in the accident and doing actions substantially similar to those that swift driver and the driver of the yellow did,or attempted to do,leading up to the collision.these studies clearly go beyond mere trucking safety or regulatory compliance and into the realm of accident reconstruction,an area beyond reed expert designation.
additionally,the district court did not err in denying swift proffer of evidence.rule of the federal rules of evidence states,in part,that e rror may not be predicated upon a ruling which excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected,and the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer.a.essentially,the proponent must explain what it expects to show and the grounds for which the party believes the evidence to be admissible.polys airlines,cir internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,a proffer of evidence at trial is not needed to satisfy the rule if the excluded evidence was previously discussed with the trial judge,for example at the conference,so that during trial the judge is well aware of the content and purpose of the evidence.id.at.in this case,the evidence swift sought to proffer at trial had already been submitted to and considered by the court in the context of the fredericks motion to strike reed testimony.any further proffer at trial would have been duplicative.
admissibility of other evidence 
we next consider swift arguments concerning several of the district court evidentiary rulings.we review a court evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion,according deference to a district court familiarity with the details of the case and its greater experience in evidentiary matters.mgmt.mendelsohn.this is particularly true with respect to rule since it requires an balancing of probative value and prejudice,potentially to exclude as unduly prejudicial some evidence that already has been found to be factually relevant.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we review de novo the district court interpretation of state law.see salve regina coll.russell.
evidence of the of the sleeper berth safety restraints 
at trial,the district court excluded evidence tending to show terry frederick was not using the safety restraints in the sleeper berth at the time of the accident.the court based this ruling on its reading of new mexico safety belt use act.see stat.ann.a failure to be secured by a child passenger restraint device or by a safety belt as required by the safety belt use act shall not in any instance constitute fault or negligence and shall not limit or apportion damages.on appeal,swift argues that
