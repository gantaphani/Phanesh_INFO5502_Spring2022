surface transportation board 
reversing the district court judgment in favor of the state of oregon department of state lands,which sought to enforce a state environmental law in connection with railroad repair work,the panel held that the federal surface transportation board has exclusive jurisdiction over railroad repair work done at the direction of a federally regulated rail carrier but performed by a contractor rather than the carrier itself.
the plaintiff,a operator of tourist trains,had entered into an agreement with the port of tillamook bay,a federally regulated railroad,to repair a railroad track.the plaintiff alleged that the oregon law,known as a law,was preempted by the interstate commerce commission termination act,which governs federal regulation of railroads.
the panel held that the repair work done by the plaintiff under its agreement with the port fell under the board jurisdiction because the work was done under the auspices of a federally regulated rail carrier and was sufficiently related to the provision of transportation over the interstate rail network.the oregon law therefore was preempted as applied to this work.the panel reversed the district court judgment and remanded for further proceedings with respect to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and declaratory relief.
thomas,chief judge 
this case presents the question whether the federal surface transportation board the board has exclusive jurisdiction over railroad repair work done at the direction of a federally regulated rail carrier but performed by a contractor rather than the carrier itself.we conclude that it does,and we therefore reverse and remand.
the oregon coast scenic railroad oregon coast is a corporation that operates tourist trains on a portion of track in oregon that is owned by the port of tillamook bay the port.the port is a federally regulated railroad authorized by the board.the port operates freight trains it formerly ran trains on the portion of the railroad used by oregon coast,but in part of the track was damaged by a winter storm and freight traffic ceased on that portion of the track.
in,oregon coast and the port entered into a agreement under which oregon coast would continue leasing this portion of the track,but instead of paying the port for use of the track,oregon coast would instead use those funds for deferred maintenance and upgrading of the port rail line and.the agreement provided that oregon coast would be solely responsible for rehabilitation of the railway,track maintenance,and compliance with federal and state safety and maintenance requirements.the agreement contemplated that the repair work might reestablish the track connection to a mainline carrier providing service,and freight traffic might resume at some point.if and when that happened,the parties agreed to negotiate a modification to the agreement that would allow oregon coast to continue to run tourist trains alongside the port anticipated freight traffic.
oregon coast began repair work under this agreement in early.on march,after approximately five weeks of work had been completed and two to four weeks of work remained,the state of oregon department of state lands the state sent oregon coast a cease and desist order.the order alleged that oregon coast repair work was violating a state law,which,among other things,requires a state permit for the removal of any amount of material from waters designated as essential salmonid habitat.the state alleged that oregon coast was engaging in unpermitted activity in or near an essential salmonid habitat section of the salmonberry river,and it contested oregon coast assertion that federal law preempted application of this state law to railroad repair work.
oregon coast filed a complaint in federal district court the following day,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.oregon coast argued that the law is preempted by the interstate commerce commission termination act iccta,et,which governs federal regulation of railroads.oregon coast sought a permanent injunction and a determination that application of the state law is federally preempted that enforcement of the law constituted an impermissible burden on interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause and that enforcement of the law violated oregon coast federal rights under.oregon coast also immediately moved for a preliminary injunction against the law enforcement.
the district court held a hearing on the preliminary injunction in april.at the state request,the district court consolidated the preliminary injunction hearing with a hearing on the merits it then issued a single order on all of oregon coast requested relief.the court concluded that the law was not preempted because oregon coast tourist train activities were not sufficiently related to interstate commerce to bring oregon coast within the exclusive federal jurisdiction provision of the iccta.the court also concluded that oregon coast agreement with the port was insufficient to establish federal preemption as to oregon coast on the basis of the port status as a federally licensed carrier.having concluded that oregon coast claims failed on the merits,the district court denied oregon coast requests for preliminary and permanent injunctions and for declaratory relief,and it dismissed the case.
oregon coast appeals,challenging the district court conclusion that federal preemption does not apply to the repair work done by oregon coast its conclusion that oregon coast was not acting as an agent of the port and its denial of oregon coast requests for preliminary and permanent injunctions and declaratory relief.oregon coast presents a federal question by alleging that enforcement of the state law is preempted by the federal iccta thus the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under.see indep.training apprenticeship program cal.dep t of indus.relations,cir.citing shaw delta air lines.we have jurisdiction over the appeal under.

because it is a question of law,we review de novo a district court conclusion about the extent of federal preemption.in re korean air lines,cir.here,because the district court decisions on the preliminary injunction,permanent injunction,and declaratory relief all relied on the same analysis of the preemption question,a legal error in that analysis would affect the court decision on all three forms of requested relief.we therefore focus our analysis on the district court conclusion as to the federal preemption question.
the iccta was passed in,in part with the purpose of expanding federal jurisdiction and preemption of railroad regulation.see at c hanges are made to reflect the direct and complete preemption of state economic regulation of railroads.in order for federal preemption to apply under the iccta,the activity in question must first fall within the statutory grant of jurisdiction to the surface transportation board,one of several federal agencies charged with railroad regulation.a.as modified by the iccta,a provides in relevant part 
subject to this chapter,the board has jurisdiction over transportation by rail carrier that is 
a only by railroad or 
b by railroad and water under specified circumstances.
jurisdiction under paragraph applies only to transportation in the united states between a place in 
a a state and a place in the same or another state as part of the interstate rail network
