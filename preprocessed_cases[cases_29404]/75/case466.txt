backgrounda.
the department of transportation dot regulates,inter alia,the number of hours a commercial truck driver may drive in a given period.in,the dot establishes the maximum number of hours that a driver may drive during any given day,as well as the maximum number of hours that a driver may drive during any given week it also mandates the minimum number of consecutive hours that must be observed between shifts of driving.at the time relevant to this appeal section prohibited a motor carrier from requiring any driver to drive m ore than hours following consecutive hours off duty,or for any period after h aving been on duty hours in any consecutive days or hours in any period of consecutive days.in addition to these driving limitations,establishes minimum reporting requirements.during each period,the driver must record in a driving log his status,the date,the starting time,the carrier,the truck number,the number of miles driven that day,and the total hours spent driving and on duty.id.d,f.
despite the dot numerous regulations,however,in the early,the united states experienced an increasing number of deaths,injuries and property damage due to commercial motor vehicle accidents.see cong.rec,remarks of danforth and summary of proposed statute quoted in brock roadway express,d.random inspections by law enforcement officials in various parts of the country uncovered significant and widespread violations of safety regulations.id.quoted in brock,at.congress hypothesized that,although employees in the transportation industry often are in the best position to detect safety violations,fears or threats of discharge for cooperating with enforcement agencies were preventing these employees from reporting these violations.see brock,at.
accordingly,in,congress enacted the staa,an act intended to provide employees with express protection against retaliation for reporting noncompliance with safety regulations.id.the staa makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge an employee,or discipline or discriminate against an employee regarding pay,terms,or privileges of employment,for refusing to operate a commercial vehicle because the operation violates a regulation,standard,or order of the united states related to commercial motor vehicle safety,health,or security.a b i.
an employee who believes that he has been retaliated against for engaging in an activity protected under the staa may file a complaint with the department of labor.id.b.osha then investigates the claim and orders relief if it finds reasonable cause to believe that the staa has been violated.id.b a.either party,however,may object to osha findings and request a de novo proceeding before an alj.id.b b.the alj may hold a hearing alternatively,it may issue a summary decision for either party if the pleadings,affidavits,material obtained by discovery or otherwise,or matters officially noticed show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that a party is entitled to summary decision.d.
once the investigating body has recommended a decision,the parties may submit briefs to the board.c.the board then makes a final determination and,if warranted,orders relief.a party aggrieved by the final decision of the board may petition for review in the appropriate court of appeals.c.
at all times relevant to this case,crete,an trucking company,operated at least two distinct fleets of trucks a fleet dedicated solely to shipments of goods for a single customer,general the dedicated fleet,and a fleet the national fleet.for the dedicated fleet,crete guaranteed that a certain number of tractors,trailers and drivers would be used exclusively to haul general mills goods it also guaranteed that it would pick up and deliver freight at specific times designated by general mills.general mills tightly enforced the timing requirements for its pickups and deliveries.any pickup or delivery that occurred outside the designated time window was considered a service failure,which resulted in penalties to crete.in return for these timing guarantees,general mills paid crete a premium rate and allocated to crete a certain percentage of its daily freight.
in contrast with the dedicated fleet,equipment and drivers in crete national fleet were not assigned to particular customers.because premium payment was not contingent upon compliance with scheduled pickup and delivery times,proper scheduling was not as critical for national fleet drivers.therefore,national fleet drivers were dispatched on a more basis than those assigned to the dedicated fleet.
in late august or early september,crete hired bettner as a truck driver and assigned him to the dedicated fleet.in that position,he was tasked with performing pickups and deliveries for general mills,each to be completed within certain windows of time.crete dispatchers compiled the pickup and delivery time windows into planned dispatches for its drivers from these dispatches,however,the individual driver was responsible for planning his specific route,driving time,breaks,maintenance checks and all of the other details of his trip in order to comply with both general mills schedule and the dot hours of service regulations.
on october,a crete dispatcher provided bettner with a dispatch consisting of three separate pickups and deliveries.bettner was to pick up a load at geneva,illinois that evening and deliver it in atlanta,georgia on the morning of october.later on october,he was to pick up another load in lavergne,tennessee this load was to be delivered to a facility in geneva,illinois on october,between noon and finally,he was to pick up a third load in kankakee,illinois at on october,and deliver it in joplin,missouri by the following day.the dispatch read as follows 
atlanta,pm 
lavergne,pm 
kankakee,pm 
geneva to atlanta dispatch 
bettner picked up his first dispatch in geneva on the evening of october,within the pickup window designated by general mills.he then went off duty until on october,when he began his drive to atlanta.he logged hours of driving on october.
on october,beginning at,bettner drove the remaining hours to atlanta,taking a lengthy break around.he arrived in atlanta around,which was within the specified to delivery window.because of delays at the atlanta facility,however,his trailer actually was not unloaded until,almost one hour after the delivery window had closed.accordingly,the load was considered late by general mills.bettner testified in his deposition that he knew that waits in the atlanta depot were not uncommon,and he acknowledged that his truck might have been unloaded within the delivery window had he arrived earlier,ex.a at.
lavergne to geneva dispatch 
bettner left atlanta around on october and drove approximately hours toward lavergne.he then contacted the customer in lavergne to see if his next load was ready to be picked up,but he was told that the load would not be ready until later that night.because that load was delayed,he went off duty for a few hours and then completed the drive to lavergne.he arrived in lavergne at he picked up his second load and then drove for approximately hour toward the delivery point in geneva,before going off duty for the night at.bettner logged a total of hours of driving on october.
after an rest,bettner went on duty at on october.he inspected his truck,and then he resumed the drive to geneva.sometime around,when he was scheduled to pick up his next load in kankakee,bettner sent crete a message stating that his pickup time in kankakee needed to be rescheduled because he had not yet completed his geneva delivery.crete later sent bettner a message informing him that the kankakee load had been rescheduled and could be picked up early the next morning.
bettner dropped off his load in geneva at on october,within the to delivery window.kankakee,illinois,was miles from geneva via state highways.he had driven hours already that day,and he did not believe that he could complete the trip to kankakee without exhausting his permitted number of hours under the dot regulations.accordingly,he drove for one hour to a truck stop in morris,illinois,where he entered his sleeping berth at and stayed overnight.bettner logged a total of hours of driving on october.
while stopped in morris,bettner sent a qualcomm message to crete inquiring about the rescheduled pickup time in kankakee.crete responded that he had a new pickup appointment for.bettner sent a message to crete stating will not be able to be shipper,out of hours.at.
at on october,approximately hours after he had ended his shift the night before,bettner inspected his truck and resumed driving.he arrived in kankakee,illinois at,hours after his original pickup time and hours after his rescheduled pickup time.
kankakee to joplin dispatch 
at on october,after his trailer was loaded,bettner left kankakee,illinois and began his drive to joplin,missouri.he stopped for a minute lunch break and,later,an unexplained hour break from to.during that break,bettner sent another qualcomm message to crete will not be able to get to receiver by end of day,will be out of hours for one thing,will be there first thing in morning id.at.bettner drove until,stopping in doolittle,missouri to sleep.he logged a total of hours of driving on october.he did not reach joplin,missouri in time for his delivery window.
while in doolittle,bettner received another dispatch from crete.it indicated that his next shipment would be from joplin,mo to kalamazoo,mi,and it would be loaded in joplin at on october.crete then sent a message to bettner requesting his estimated time of arrival in joplin as well as an update on his service hours from the previous day.bettner responded that his break would not be complete for another half hour,and he was still or hours away from his delivery destination in joplin.
crete and bettner then exchanged several qualcomm messages regarding bettner late loads.as part of this conversation,crete stated 
pplan info was sent to u last friday showing u it live loaded tuesday afternoon which wld have allowed u to be on time last night to joplin,plse keep close attn to pplan times.
id.at.bettner sent the following response 
i send in my hours every day so you should be aware of my hours it is nice to have loads,but i am one person and not a team.
id.at.a crete dispatcher sent a reply,stating 
its up to you to keep track of your hrs,i am planning loads based on approx a day and when a load is picked up late it throws the rest of the week off.
id.at.bettner answered 
i do keep trak of my hours and i know when you load and unload times a week,fuel up,vi and other things that take on duty time i will run up against the clock.short runs run a driver right into the ground,there is no getting around that.
id.at.crete dispatcher then stated 
last fri u pick up il to ga,showed u pplans,mon tn to il,then tues live ld in il to dlv joplin yesterday.u picked up load u have now late it had to be reset,now u are delivering it late,now we will be late picking up your pplan out of joplin today 
load that dlv to ga this past monday shld have been dropped early mon morning rather than around,this put the whole week behind did allow u to pick up tn ld till monday night then did allow u to dlv to il to tues night which missed the pick up time for ld u are on now.
bettner responded that he had picked up his loads in atlanta and lavergne within the specified window of time he also noted that the load in lavergne had just been loaded when he got there,so an earlier arrival would have made no difference in his ability to meet the for his later shipments.id.at.crete,in turn,replied that bettner needed to plan properly for contingencies.id.at.
accordingly,after conducting a vehicle inspection,bettner resumed his driving at on october.he took a brief lunch break,and he arrived in joplin to deliver his shipment at,hours after the original delivery window had closed.he asserts that the drive from morris,illinois to kankakee,illinois,to joplin,mo took hours therefore,he submits,he could not have completed it within a single day under the dot regulations.see.
subsequent events 
because bettner was late dropping off his load in joplin,he also was unable to pick up his next load at the previously scheduled pickup time.instead,he picked up his new load at in joplin he then began driving to kalamazoo.
on october,after he also missed the delivery window in kalamazoo by a significant amount of time,crete sent bettner a message indicating that it was transferring him from a position with the dedicated fleet to a position with the national fleet.the next day,bettner spoke with a manager,who told him that he was being transferred because he routinely failed to pick up and deliver his loads on time.
bettner returned to crete terminal on october,to have his assigned truck serviced he was informed that his truck would not be ready until the next day.the next morning,when he arrived to pick up his truck,bettner was informed that the remainder of his dispatch on the dedicated fleet had been reassigned to another driver.based on this information,bettner assumed that he had been fired.he removed his belongings from his truck and sent crete a qualcomm message indicating that he believed that he had been fired when he was switched from the dedicated fleet to the national fleet.bettner did not report to work again.
bettner filed a complaint with osha on december.he claimed that crete transferred him to the national fleet in retaliation for his refusal to violate dot hour restrictions,in violation of the staa.in his view,the position with the national fleet was inferior to the position with the dedicated fleet because national fleet drivers are away from home for greater periods of time than drivers for the dedicated fleet,dedicated fleet drivers carry a greater number of loads than the national fleet drivers,and therefore they spend less time in the terminals loading and unloading trailers and more time driving,and a number of the national fleet deliveries require the driver to help load and unload,a physically difficult task.bettner requested reinstatement to his former position on crete dedicated fleet.
osha investigated the claim and,on february,found that it lacked merit.bettner then requested that the matter be assigned to an alj.on october,after reviewing the pleadings and the evidence,the alj also recommended that bettner complaint be dismissed,finding that bettner had failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact relevant to his staa claim.specifically,it found that bettner had failed to establish that he engaged in protected activity he suffered an adverse employment action and crete legitimate,justification for transferring him was mere pretext for retaliation.
the parties filed supplemental briefs with the board.on may,the board accepted the alj recommendation and dismissed bettner complaint.the board noted that crete had presented unrebutted evidence that it had transferred bettner to the national fleet,where proper timing of deliveries was not as critical,because of its belief that bettner had difficulty in planning his timing and routes in order to complete his dispatches on time.because bettner failed to adduce any evidence that crete proffered reason for transferring him to the national fleet was pretextual,the board concluded that there was no question of fact as to crete legitimate,justification.it did not address the other issues addressed by the alj bettner then timely filed a petition for review.
