on the morning of october,christopher zaffer was driving his westbound on interstate in jefferson county,tennessee,when his rig began experiencing mechanical problems and became disabled zaffer drove the vehicle into the emergency lane of the interstate and there is no dispute between the parties that both zaffer tractor and trailer were completely within the breakdown lane with no portion of the rig protruding into or overlapping onto the travel lanes of the interstate 
zaffer placed the warning devices required by tennessee statute and federal regulation behind the to signal to approaching traffic that his rig was disabled.the weather conditions were clear and the roadway was dry.the section of on which zaffer rig became disabled provided three lanes for motorists traveling either east or west.according to record testimony the could be seen by approaching westbound motorists from a distance of at least feet.
zaffer was under or near the,shortly before,when diane rupe was driving westbound on in a ford truck with a cargo box,rented from budget car truck rental,budget.behind the ford truck,rupe towed a minivan.in the passenger cab,along with rupe,were her grandsons michael kellner and shawn june,ages and respectively.
tragically,the budget truck driven by rupe left the far right travel lane of traffic,moved into the emergency lane,and collided with zaffer parked.as a result of the collision,michael kellner,rupe and zaffer were killed,while shawn june sustained injuries requiring hospitalization.

as the forum state,tennessee precedent provides that a plaintiff bringing a negligence action must prove a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff conduct falling below the applicable standard of care amounting to a breach of that duty an injury or loss causation in fact and proximate,or legal cause.bennett putnam county,quoting mcclenahan cooley.see also mccall wilder,bradshaw daniel.recovery in a negligence action may occur only if the plaintiff can prove that the defendants conduct was negligent and was the proximate cause of plaintiffs injury.tennessee trailways,ervin,lancaster montesi.tennessee courts have repeatedly stated that negligence is not presumed from the mere fact of an accident or injury.williams jordan,de glopper nashville ry.light,armes hulett.
in the instant case,the district court determined that as a matter of tennessee law a reasonable jury could conclude that zaffer had breached his duty by not moving the rig to a safer location in the five hours prior to the accident.however,in granting the motion for summary judgment the court concluded that,as a matter of law,none of the,mdts,or the proximate cause of the accident.
based upon the undisputed facts that zaffer rig rested completely off the active traffic lanes of the interstate and was plainly visible for a distance of over feet,the district court reasoned that a reasonable jury would have to conclude rupe could see the rig prior to the accident.consequently,the court concluded that rupe actions in leaving the travel lanes and crashing into zaffer rig were the proximate cause of plaintiffs losses.in so deciding,the court relied upon carney goodman,which concluded that the negligence of one in obstructing the highway by a standing vehicle was superseded by another negligence in running into such vehicle,and that the latter negligence was the proximate cause of the accident.see also dunnivant nafe.thus,in the instant case,while the district court concluded that a reasonable jury could find zaffer negligent in not removing his rig from the shoulder of the interstate before the accident occurred,the court nevertheless held that plaintiff rupe had provided the proximate cause pursuant to the standard determined in carney did the driver running into the standing vehicle see it in time to enable him,by use of due care,to avoid the collision if he did not,his negligence is merely a contributory cause if he did,his negligence is the proximate cause.carney goodman,at.
further,the district court stated that through carney tennessee has adopted a special rule about proximate causation in standing vehicle cases such as the present one.while the general rule in tennessee,that the foreseeability of an intervening,superseding act presents a jury question,the carney court adopted a special rule in standing vehicle cases,which the district court applied in the present case,noting that u nder this rule it is unforeseeable as a matter of law someone would drive into a plainly visible standing vehicle.the carney opinion noted that t he operator of a vehicle that crashes into a vehicle negligently left standing in an unsuitable stopping place provides the proximate cause of any resulting injuries if she could see the standing vehicle in time to avoid a collision.id.
on appeal,the plaintiffs aver that summary judgment is inappropriate in the instant case where facts regarding the foreseeability requirement of proximate causation are in dispute.specifically,the appellants maintain that zaffer negligence was the proximate cause of the tragic accident because,by parking his disabled vehicle on the shoulder of the interstate and not moving it during the five hours preceding the accident,zaffer could foresee through the exercise of reasonable diligence that injury or loss could or would occur.however,appellants reliance upon such a broad definition of foreseeability fails to comport with tennessee negligence law and,consequently,fails to prove that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to appellees.
pursuant to tennessee negligence law,once it is determined that the defendant owed the plaintiff a legal obligation to conform to a reasonable person standard of conduct,a question becomes whether defendant failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances,whether defendant breached the duty.in a negligence action,the standard of conduct is always the same.it is a standard of reasonable care in light of the apparent risk.see pittman upjohn,as in all cases,there is a duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances.bradshaw daniel,at all persons have a duty to use reasonable care to refrain from conduct that will foreseeably cause injury to others.if defendant does not exercise reasonable care,defendant has breached the duty.doe linder const.
upon this court review,the record evidence indicates that,contrary to the district court determination,zaffer did not breach any duty of care.tennessee has codified the standard of care for parking a disabled vehicle by making certain cond
