edwin david brought this action on the basis that the procedures used by the city of los angeles after a car has been towed and stored for an alleged parking violation do not comport with the demands of due process.see const.amend.xiv.the district court granted summary judgment against david and in favor of the city.we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.
background 
on august,david had a doctor appointment at an office on olympic in the city of los angeles.he found a parking place on that street and parked his car there at approximately.he expected to get back fairly quickly,but,as it turned out,he did not return to the place where he expected to find his car until alas,his car was not there he had parked it in an area where parking was not permitted between and,and an officer of the city department of transportation had ordered it towed.
while there were signs posted which gave notice of the restriction and warned that vehicles in violation of the restriction could be towed,david says he did not see the signs,one of which was just five feet away from his car.he claims that there were other vehicles in the way and tree limbs that blocked his vision from inside the car when he parked,and that he was distracted by a person who commented upon his automobile after he got out of it.
at any rate,david went to the impound station that very day,paid to spring his car,and asked for a hearing.he was given a form,which he took to the department of transportation building forthwith.five days later,david was sent another request form,and promptly returned that form to the department of transportation.thereafter,he was notified that a hearing was scheduled for september.
before he left to go to the hearing,he was called,told that the officer could not be there,and informed that he could have an extension if he desired.he did not so desire.instead,david went to the hearing hoping to confront the officer or get the case dismissed,but,as he had been warned,the officer was not there.david was told that he could either proceed without the officer,or have the hearing continued to a later date when the officer could be made available.david chose to proceed.
the hearing examiner,an employee of the department of transportation,took notice of the report of the officer,who had ordered the towing of david vehicle,and listened to david explanation.david did not actually dispute that his car had been parked in the restricted zone beyond the deadline,but offered certain explanations.the examiner found probable cause to tow the vehicle and no viable defense to what the officer had ordered.thus,the examiner ruled against david,who was told that he could file a claim with the city clerk if he was not satisfied with the result.david did that,but his claim was rejected.he then commenced this action under on the basis that the procedure used by the city violated his federal constitutional rights in a number of respects.the district court granted summary judgment against him,and this appeal followed.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see delta sav.bank united states,cir,cert.denied,d.we also review de novo the claim that the procedures used violated david constitutional rights.see dittman california,cir martinez city of los angeles,cir.
discussion 
david does not claim that he was not overparked.what he does assert is that his procedural due process rights were violated in a number of particulars.he argues that the hearing was delayed too long that he was denied the right to the officer who ordered the towing and storage that the hearing examiner was biased as a matter of law because he works for the department of transportation,as did the officer who ordered the towing that the burden of persuasion was improperly shifted to him that evidence was not delivered to him and that he did not receive a proper notification regarding his appeal rights.we will consider each of these,although only the first of them requires extended discussion.
a.the hearing delay 
it is apparent,as david argues,that the city set a hearing for a number of weeks after his car was towed on august,despite david insistent and immediate demand that he be given a hearing forthwith.that appears to be in violation of state law more importantly,it is a violation of the united states constitution.
we faced this issue years ago in a case where the city of san francisco towed and stored the plaintiffs automobiles,and they objected to the lack of an expeditious procedure to attack those actions.see stypmann city county of san francisco,cir.the city had attempted to deflect that attack by providing that certain people,those who could not afford towage fees,could get a hearing within five days after notifying the city of that fact.id.at.we were not impressed with that limited concession we did take note of its limited applicability,see id.at,but declared 
seizure of property without prior hearing has been sustained only where the owner is afforded prompt hearing at which the person seizing the property must at least make a showing of probable cause 
an early hearing,on the other hand,would provide vehicle owners the opportunity to test the factual basis of the tow and thus protect them against erroneous deprivation of the use of their vehicles we conclude,therefore,that the state statute does not comply with due process requirements.
nor is the statute saved by the san francisco ordinance.a delay in justifying detention of a private vehicle is too long.days,even hours,of unnecessary delay may impose onerous burdens upon a person deprived of his vehicle.
id.at footnotes omitted.in stypmann,we were most concerned with the fact that the automobile itself would be held unless and until the fees were paid,but did not declare that the payment of those fees would elide the requirement of a prompt hearing.rather,we spoke more generally.
california thereafter adopted a statute that responded to our concerns.it provides that once a vehicle is ordered stored by an authorized member of a public agency,the agency shall provide the owner with the opportunity for a poststorage hearing.cal.a.the agency must give the owner notice within hours,cal.b,and the owner may request a hearing.cal.b.the poststorage hearing shall be conducted within hours of the request,excluding weekends and holidays.the public agency may authorize its own officer or employee to conduct the hearing if the hearing officer is not the same person who directed the storage of the vehicle.cal.c.it should be noted that this statute also speaks generally,and does not limit its protections to those who have not put up the fees necessary to release their vehicles from storage.
we returned to the fray in,when another irate citizen,whose automobile had been impounded by the city of los angeles,sued.see goichman rheuban motors,cir.goichman car had been towed and stored at the direction of an officer.goichman went to the storage facility to demand its return,but was told that he had to pay towing and storage fees.he paid them,his car was released,and he brought a civil rights action.id.
we did not reject goichman claim out of hand on the basis that he had paid the fees and obtained release of the vehicle.rather,we saw the question before us as whether the hearing provided by section of the california vehicle code and the los angeles ordinance is sufficiently prompt to satisfy due process requirements.id.at.we answered that question in the affirmative and opined balancing the governmental and private interests at stake,we hold that provision for a hearing within hours satisfies the requirements of due process.id.at.while this does amount to a ruling that the state statute is constitutional,it does not help the city,which did not follow the statute.
nevertheless,the city takes the position that it need not adhere to the statute,or to our opinions about due process.it comforts itself with the reflection that goichman refused to pay the towing fees,and brushes the case aside on that basis.it adds,t he court there held that the challenge to the towing must be conditioned upon the payment of the impound fees.that is
