appellants sharon dina and david and joann whiteley appeal from a judgment entered in favor of the people of the state of california acting by and through the department of transportation department.appellants brought separate complaints alleging inverse condemnation,nuisance and negligence by reason of noise,vibrations,air pollution and property damage they claimed to have suffered as a result of the extension of the freeway adjacent to their residences.after the case had been pending for one and years,the department moved to dismiss pursuant to code of civil procedure section,which permits parties in an eminent domain proceeding to move for a ruling when there is a dispute between plaintiff and defendant over an evidentiary or other legal issue affecting the determination of compensation code civ,subd.a.the trial court granted the motion on the grounds that appellants failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that their properties suffered peculiar and substantial damage or that the freeway construction or operation was unreasonable.appellants contend that section does not allow the trial court to weigh evidence to summarily resolve an action and that substantial evidence does not support the trial court resolution of the case.
we affirm.the language and legislative history of section permit a trial court to determine the legal issue of liability.in view of the summary nature of the procedure,we evaluate the evidence as we would on a motion for nonsuit,accepting it as true and viewing it in a light favorable to appellants.applying this stringent standard of review,we conclude the trial court properly ruled that appellants could not maintain their causes of action for inverse condemnation,nuisance and negligence.
factual and procedural background 
appellants own residential property in the city of la verne city.between and,the department constructed an extension of the freeway in close proximity to appellants property.according to appellants,as a result of that extension they experienced noise exceeding acceptable levels set by state and federal law,audible vibrations which were negatively affecting the properties beams and causing erosion beneath the properties foundations,and increased levels of air pollution.in addition,they contended that their properties suffered from structural damage including subsidence,settling and cracks in the patio and garage floors.
appellants filed their initial complaints in october,alleging causes of action for inverse condemnation,nuisance and negligence against the department and the city after demurrers by the department and the city,appellants filed the operative second amended complaint on may,which alleged causes of action for inverse condemnation,nuisance and negligence against the department only.the same day they filed a dismissal with prejudice as to the city.the department filed its answer in june,generally denying the complaint allegations and asserting multiple affirmative defenses.
as relevant here,on march,the department filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to section on the grounds that appellants inverse condemnation claim lacked merit and that their nuisance and negligence claims were barred as a matter of law.the department asserted in the motion that appellants inverse condemnation cause of action failed for lack of evidence that appellants suffered any individualized or particularized detriment as a result of the freeway.the department further asserted that governmental immunity barred the nuisance claim and that government code section barred liability for a common law negligence claim.the department attached several exhibits and expert declarations in support of the motion to dismiss.
more specifically,the department submitted the declaration of sanford fidell,a psychologist specializing in the study of environmental noise effects on individuals and communities.after monitoring the noise levels at the subject properties,fidell concluded that the high noise barrier that was erected along each of the properties is performing as expected to reduce noise levels at these properties and that the noise levels in plaintiffs backyards are characteristic of those which can be reasonably expected according to chapter highway traffic noise abatement of the caltrans highway design manual.he further concluded that the plaintiffs homes are not exposed to more highway traffic noise than those of many other similarly situated homes.also relating to appellants excessive noise claim,the department offered a noise attenuation report that was prepared in connection with the final environmental impact report eir for the freeway extension.
with respect to claims of erosion and structural damage,the department submitted the declaration of engineering geologist james ashby,who inspected the subject properties and opined that cracking of these rear patio slabs was caused by the settlement of fill soils via hydroconsolidation,and was exacerbated by the lack of adequate placement of reinforcement both presence and position within the slab itself,and generally represent normal signs of aging,and wear and tear.the construction related with the nearby freeway is simply too far away to have adversely affected these patio slabs,or to have caused their settlement.the ashby declaration summarized t hese homes do not evidence those types of distress which indicate or in any way suggest that they have suffered any physical damage related to geotechnically related phenomena such as soil subsidence expansive soils as a direct or indirect result of freeway construction.it also submitted the declaration of registered structural engineer gregg brandow,who examined two of the subject properties and on that basis opined that the cracks he observed were cosmetic in nature and neither threatened the structural integrity of the homes nor required structural repairs or strengthening.
appellants opposed the motion.though the focus of the opposition to the motion to dismiss was on the procedural impropriety of the motion,appellants attached their own reports in an effort to challenge the factual bases for that motion.they submitted a draft noise impact assessment prepared for the city of claremont,dated january,which indicated that noise levels at various points along the extension of the freeway exceeded decibels at certain times and that these levels could be abated by repaving,enforcing speed and weight restrictions,and improving existing sound walls.they also submitted a letter report from george hernandez,who stated he inspected the subject properties,observed major cracks in the backyard concrete slabs and opined that the damages were the cause of an event that happened recently.though the letter bore the caption health care engineering services,it did not identify hernandez education,occupation or experience.they also submitted a newspaper article entitled noise still annoys.
at an april,hearing,the trial court granted the motion to dismiss as to the negligence claim.with respect to dismissal of the inverse condemnation and nuisance claims,the trial court set a briefing schedule and directed the parties to file supplemental briefs and declarations regarding the issues of noise,dust and causation issues related to the cracking of plaintiffs patios and set a further hearing for june.
appellants submitted expert and their own declarations,together with reports,photographs and drawings,in response to the court order.addressing noise impact,they submitted a staff report prepared for the city of la verne city council city council concerning a freeway noise impact assessment prepared by urban crossroads.that assessment indicated that noise levels resulting from the freeway were greater than anticipated by the eir and recommended repaving as a means to mitigate the problem.city council minutes also submitted indicated that at a march,meeting the city council directed staff to look into several possible means of mitigation and noted that there were far more pervasive problems that need to be addressed.
with respect to the issue of air pollution,appellants submitted a september air monitoring study at felton and lloyde schools prepared by the south coast air quality management district.according to that study,samples taken at the school locations indicated that levels of toxic air contaminants were at or below average levels,with the exception of carbonyls compounds which were slightly above the average.they also submitted a broader march multiple air toxics exposure study of the south coast air basin.
to address the issue of structural damage,they submitted the declaration of registered civil engineer faustin gonzalez,who participated in a site inspection of the subject properties in may.he observed cracks in the backyard concrete patios as well as hairline cracks in portions of the houses exterior and interior.he also discussed the condition of the properties with the homeowners,and on the basis of his inspection and those discussions rendered the following opinion the construction which was done within the homeowners property,the sound wall construction,was done with very large construction equipment appropriate to freeway construction but improper for use in the immediate vicinity of homes.the reckless use of this heavy equipment to bang and force out large and heavy steel shoring doubtless caused the patio cracks in these homes.they were there before this occurrence and according to the owners had been fine for years prior to the freeway.as a result of my observation and analysis,it is my considered professional opinion that all of the five homes belonging to the plaintiffs and all of the rear yards for these homes exhibit clear and indisputable evidence of recent differential settlement and impact movement almost certainly caused by the prolonged and construction of the freeway practically on top of the homes.gonzalez also challenged ashby opinion that the floor slabs were level in that they were not out of level by more than one inch in feet by noting that ashby did not know how level the floors were when originally constructed.
on the basis of their personal observations and experiences,certain homeowners declared that the expert opinions submitted by the department were inaccurate.appellants additionally submitted a letter from an associate real estate broker,david brighton,who opined that the freeway extension negatively affected the value and salability of homes next to the freeway.
in connection with its reply,the department submitted the declaration of hanns baumann,a registered civil engineer and licensed structural engineer.accompanied by the homeowners,he inspected the five subject properties in may and reviewed water manometer surveys conducted on the slab portion of each home he thereafter opined b ased upon my structural engineering expertise and experience,combined with my inspections,and in view of the vibration monitoring results,it is my professional opinion that there is no evidence of structural damage caused by vibration from construction or traffic.in addition,there is no potential source of vibration of sufficient intensity which could affect the structural integrity of these five homes.the minor cracks that i did see were everywhere cosmetic in nature,to be expected in homes of similar construction and vintage,are not a threat to the structural integrity of the buildings.
the department also provided a supplemental declaration from geologist ashby,who supervised further inspections of the properties in may and june.ashby concluded that none of the properties exhibited any evidence of having been adversely affected by construction or vibration from the freeway.rather,he concluded that the cracked patio slabs were the result of improper reinforcement,inadequate concrete mixtures and varying thickness within each slab,inadequately compacted and expansive soil beneath the slabs.
in june,the trial court continued the hearing because appellants asserted that there was outstanding discovery that would bear on the issues raised by the motions.thereafter,the parties submitted supplemental expert declarations and photographs as well as supplemental points and authorities.more specifically,appellants submitted a letter denying a claim brought by one of the homeowners against yeager construction company,which stated that yeager performed its freeway construction operations properly and according to plans and that,therefore,we believe these damages to be the result of an improper design of the highway.they also offered discovery responses showing that the department declined to produce any documents relating to ashby until his deposition was noticed pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
at the july,hearing,the trial court issued a tentative ruling granting the motion.appellants challenged the procedural aspects of the motion,arguing section was limited to the resolution of discrete legal issues and did not permit the court to weigh competing evidence in order to resolve liability.the trial court disagreed,pointing out that,except for the amount of compensation,all elements of an eminent domain or inverse condemnation claim involve legal issues for the trial court resolution.the trial court ruled that appellants had failed to meet their burden to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the elements of peculiar and substantial damage or unreasonable operation of the freeway necessary to support their claim.it granted the department motion and directed the department to prepare an order to that effect.
on october,the trial court filed its order granting the department motion to dismiss in its entirety.in the order,the trial court expressly rejected appellants argument that section was limited to the resolution of evidentiary issues and did not permit the court to resolve the legal issues raised by the motion.the trial court attached and incorporated by reference its analysis of the legislative history of section.on the merits of appellant inverse condemnation claim,the trial court ruled that plaintiffs have clearly failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that their properties suffered from peculiar and substantial damage from the freeway involving,noise or.the trial court found that the weight of the evidence on all issues was in the department favor.with respect to the nuisance claim,it found that appellants failed to demonstrate that the freeway construction or operation was improper or unreasonable,and that they thus failed to overcome the immunity afforded by civil code section.within the order,the trial court further ruled that appellants supplemental letters and photographs were not properly authenticated,that hernandez letter was hearsay and lacked foundation,that hernandez declaration lacked foundation and specificity,and that gonzalez declaration lacked foundation.as a result of its findings,the trial court ordered the complaint dismissed with prejudice.
appellants filed an objection to the trial court order,asserting that they were denied their right to a trial.the trial court entered judgment in accordance with the order of dismissal,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
appellants challenge the judgment on the ground that section does not authorize the trial court to resolve the entire action and,in particular,does not permit the trial court to weigh evidence in doing so.appellants further contend that even if section can be employed in the manner utilized by the trial court,substantial evidence does not support the trial court determination.we find no merit to these challenges.
i.the trial court properly employed code of civil procedure section.
section provides a if there is a dispute between plaintiff and defendant over an evidentiary or other legal issue affecting the determination of compensation,either party may move the court for a ruling on the issue.the motion shall be made not later than days before commencement of trial on the issue of compensation.the motion shall be heard by the judge assigned for trial of the case.b notwithstanding any other statute or rule of court governing the date of final offers and demands of the parties and the date of trial of an eminent domain proceeding,the court may postpone those dates for a period sufficient to enable the parties to engage in further proceedings before trial in response to its ruling on the motion.c this section supplements,and does not replace any other pretrial or trial procedure otherwise available to resolve an evidentiary or other legal issue affecting the determination of compensation.this provision applies to actions commenced on or after january.stats,ch.assem.bill.
the trial court analyzed both the text and legislative history of section to conclude that the statute affords a manner of case disposition by motion,which encompasses the right to weigh evidence to adjudicate issues affecting compensation.it further reasoned that the statute comports with due process by providing the parties with requisite notice and an opportunity to be heard.the proper interpretation of a statute is a question of law which we review de novo.burden snowden cal th,d.
a.the intent of code of civil procedure section.
the objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent,giving the words of the statute their usual and ordinary meaning.when the statutory language is clear,we need go no further.if,however,the language supports more than one reasonable interpretation,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,legislative history,the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part,contemporaneous administrative construction,and questions of public policy.citation.moran murtaugh miller meyer nelson,llp cal th,d.
we turn first to the words of a statute because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th.the words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in their statutory context.citations.these canons generally preclude judicial construction that renders part of the statute meaningless or inoperative.citation.in addition,words should be given the same meaning throughout a code unless the legislature has indicated otherwise.citations.id.at.we examine statutory language in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine the scope and purpose of a particular statute and harmonize it with the various parts of the statutory scheme.coalition of concerned citizens,city of los angeles cal th.american liberty bail bonds,garamendi th.
section is among the statutes comprising part,title,chapter of the code of civil procedure,which is a comprehensive scheme designed to cover eminent domain proceedings et the statute permits either party to move for a ruling on an evidentiary or other legal issue affecting the determination of compensation,subd.a.it is certainly reasonable to construe this language as permitting the trial court to adjudicate the question of the department liability for inverse condemnation.as the department has repeatedly posited throughout these proceedings,what could affect the determination of compensation more than whether or not the plaintiffs have a valid cause of action but it is equally reasonable to construe the statute as providing a more limited procedure,given that it is silent with respect to the trial court ability to weigh evidence or enter judgment on the basis of its ruling on the evidentiary or legal issue.a statute is considered ambiguous if it is capable of two or more reasonable interpretations.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d,in re john th,d.in the event of an ambiguity,we must ascertain legislative intent by examining a variety of extrinsic aids,including the history and background of the statute,the statutory scheme of which the provision is a part,and the apparent purpose of the statute.hughes board of architectural examiners,supra,at,d.
the history and background of section provide some insight into legislative intent.see in re john,supra,th at,fn,d legislative committee reports,bill reports,and other legislative records are appropriate sources from which to ascertain legislative intent.through the enactment of assembly bill reg.sess.assembly bill in,the legislature added section to the code of civil procedure.added by stats,ch.assem.bill.the california law revision commission sponsored assembly bill.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.it broadly propose d in this recommendation a number of revisions of the law intended to facilitate resolution of eminent domain cases without the need for trial.cal.law revision,recommendation early disclosure of valuation data and resolution of issues in eminent domain cal.law revision com.recommendation.acknowledging that existing statutes provided certain incentives for parties to resolve eminent domain actions without the need for trial,the law revision commission sought to improve pretrial procedures for resolving legal disputes affecting valuation by recommending the addition of a general provision for early resolution of disputes over legal issues affecting valuation.recommendation at.the only qualification expressed by the law revision commission was that t he procedure should be limited to resolution of legal issues that may affect compensation,such as what constitutes the larger parcel,or the probability of a zoning change it should not be used to ascertain just compensation.recommendation at,fn.omitted.
citing the law revision commission recommendation,the senate judiciary committee described assembly bill as amend ing eminent domain law to facilitate resolution of condemnation cases without trial.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.with respect to the addition of section,legislative analyses provided existing law provides for the resolution by the court of disputes on matters of law,such as the plaintiff right to take the subject property,prior to jury trial on the issue of just compensation.this bill would provide that,if the parties dispute an evidentiary or other legal issue affecting the determination of compensation,either party may move the court for a ruling on the issue no later than days before trial.a court that issues a ruling on such a motion may postpone other statutory deadlines in the action for a period sufficient to enable the parties to engage in further proceedings in response to the court ruling on the motion.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,accord,com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.
code of civil procedure permits the trial court to resolve by motion the legal issue of liability in an inverse condemnation action.
against this backdrop,we construe section to authorize the department to move for a ruling on liability,as that was a legal issue affecting the determination of compensation.legislative history demonstrates that assembly bill was intended to revise procedures in eminent domain proceedings.assem.conc.in amends.to assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.if section were construed in a limited fashion to apply only to preliminary matters preceding trial,then the statute would not constitute a revision,but rather,merely a restatement of existing procedures.see permitting court to determine whether the plaintiff has the right to take in an eminent domain proceeding.the legislature added section to supplement existing procedures,and it was one of the provisions described under changes to existing law,subd.c com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.because the legislature expressly amended eminent domain law through the enactment of assem.bill,we presume that this indicates that it thereby intended to change the original act by creating a new right or withdrawing an existing one.citation.therefore,any material change in the language of the original act is presumed to indicate a change in legal rights.citations.garrett young th,d.
construing section broadly to permit the court to determine the legal issue of liability in an inverse condemnation action further comports with the purpose of assembly bill to facilitate resolution of condemnation cases without trial.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.given this stated purpose,it would be contrary to legislative intent not to permit a party to move for a ruling on the legal issue of liability in an inverse condemnation proceeding.when the legislature has stated the purpose of its enactment in unmistakable terms,we must apply the enactment in accordance with the legislative direction all other rules of construction must fall by the wayside.speculation and reasoning as to legislative purpose must give way to expressed legislative purpose.citation.scheffield medical group,workers comp.appeals bd.th.the trial court interpretation of section as a powerful statute,unique to eminent domain law,which allows evidentiary issues and issues affecting compensation to be adjudicated by motion is in conformity with the expressed legislative purpose of the enactment.
on the other hand,appellants arguments as to why we should adopt a more limited construction of section are contrary to legislative intent.appellants contend that the statute can not be construed to operate to terminate an action because it does not contain language suggesting that it was intended to allow the trial court to adjudicate liability or enter judgment.but neither does the statute contain any limiting language indicating that the resolution of an evidentiary or legal issue can not dispose of an action.we will not read into the statute a restriction that is not there.see lewis clarke th,d we can not insert what has been omitted,omit what has been inserted,or rewrite the statute to conform to a presumed intention that is not expressed san francisco unified school dist.san francisco classroom teachers d.same.section permits either party to move for a ruling on a legal issue affecting the determination of compensation and requires that the motion be brought before the judge assigned for trial of the case,subd.a.an application for an order is a motion.here,the department sought an order of dismissal on the ground that appellants claims were legally without merit.nothing in the language of section or its legislative history bars a party from seeking an order on a legal issue that disposes of an inverse condemnation action.
appellants further contend that the trial court ruling on the motion denied them their right to a jury trial.article,section of the california constitution provides private property may be taken or damaged for public use only when just compensation,ascertained by a jury unless waived,has first been paid to,or into court for,the owner.construing this provision,the court in hensler city of glendale cal th,d,clarified that the right to jury trial applies in inverse condemnation actions,but that right is limited to the question of damages.citations.accord,san diego gas electric superior court cal th,d,there is no right to jury trial on the issue whether there has been a taking in the first instance.even when the question of liability in an inverse condemnation proceeding involves the resolution of factual issues,there is no right to a jury trial.as unequivocally stated by the court in marshall department of water power d.we hold that in an inverse condemnation proceeding,the parties have a right to a jury trial solely on the issue of compensation.all other determinations related to the inverse taking,whether purely factual or a mixture of factual and legal,are nonjury questions.thus,the trial court determination that appellants had not established a taking did not deprive them of any right to a jury trial.
alternatively,appellants assert that,at a minimum,they were denied their right to a bench trial.in other contexts,appellate courts have been sympathetic to such a claim.for example,in panico truck ins.exchange th,d,the trial court issued a ruling from the bench in favor of an insurer on a bad faith claim on the basis of competing offers of proof.after noting that it had seen a number of cases where trial judges have attempted to streamline trial proceedings by adjudicating a case from the bench based on offers of proof,the appellate court criticized the procedure because the court of appeal must treat the case as if it were the product of a motion for nonsuit after an opening statement.citation.that means that all the inferences and conflicts in the evidence must be resolved,on appeal,in favor of the losing party,against the judgment.citation.id.at,d.if the trial court had conducted a bench trial,then the judgment would have been subject to the usual presumptions and favorable inferences generally resulting from a trial court judgment.ibid.
we agree with the panico court observations and conclude that while the absence of a bench trial on the issue of the department liability is not fatal to the judgment,it does affect our standard of review the procedure utilized by the trial court pursuant to section was akin to that in group,home indemnity th,d.there,the trial court ruled that an insurer owed no duty to defend after employing what the court of appeal characterized as the unusual and unorthodox procedure of receiving in limine that essentially required the plaintiff to set forth the facts most favorable to its case,which it would presume true,and then entertaining legal arguments from both parties on the question of coverage.id.at,d.the appellate court likened the procedure to a motion for nonsuit or demurrer to the evidence and reviewed the ruling as if it were a grant of nonsuit.coshow city of escondido th,d trial court properly exercised its inherent power over the proceedings by construing the motions in limine as a motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissing the action on the ground that plaintiff could not state a cause of action lucas county of los angeles th,d trial court had inherent power to entertain motion in limine and thereafter enter judgment in favor of the defendant,even though it had earlier denied summary judgment.
a court has inherent equity,supervisory and administrative powers,as well as inherent power to control litigation and conserve judicial resources.citation.courts can conduct hearings and formulate rules of procedure where justice so demands.lucas county of los angeles,supra,th at,d.here,the trial court implemented an appropriate procedure to determine the legal issues raised by the department motion in a manner consistent with the language and legislative purpose of section.for this reason,we further reject appellants argument that any pretrial disposition of their claims was limited to a motion for summary judgment.the procedural mechanism implemented by section expressly supplements,and does not replace any other pretrial or trial procedure otherwise available to resolve an evidentiary or other legal issue affecting the determination of compensation,subd.c.moreover,a motion for summary judgment is not the exclusive means by which a trial court can consider evidence in resolving issues before trial.see cal.rules of court,rule b other papers may be filed in support of a motion,including declarations,exhibits,appendices,and other documents or pleadings.
in a related argument,appellants suggest that they should have at least had the opportunity to present additional evidence once they realized that the trial court intended to resolve the legal issue of liability.but the record indicates that the trial court expressly apprised appellants of the issues on which it intended to rule and provided them with ample opportunity to present additional briefing and evidence.the case had been pending for over one year when the department filed its motion to dismiss in march.at the first hearing on that motion in april,the trial court granted appellants request for additional time to provide the court with information.the trial court issued a written order directing appellants to file supplemental points and authorities and declarations only on the issue of noise,dust and causation issues related to the cracking of plaintiffs patios no later than may,and providing the department with an opportunity to respond.in that order,the trial court also granted the motion on the third cause of action for negligence,thereby notifying appellants that it considered a motion brought pursuant to section an appropriate vehicle to resolve appellants claims on the merits.at the next hearing on june,the trial court granted a further continuance,which appellants had requested in order to receive the department outstanding responses to discovery requests.when the trial court ultimately heard the motion on july,the matter was scheduled for trial in one month.by that time,appellants should have assembled all their evidence,including expert witnesses,and obtained all relevant discovery from the department.see in an eminent domain action,absent a court order,each party has until days before trial to obtain discovery from experts disclosed by the other party,subd.a in an eminent domain action,expert witness lists should be exchanged days prior to commencement of trial.on the basis of the record before us,we are unable to have appellants informed us in their why appellants did not conduct statutorily permitted discovery earlier or what additional evidence they were unable to obtain by the time of the hearing on the motion to dismiss.
in sum,the trial court adopted and implemented a construction of section that comports with the statute language and overall statutory scheme,promotes its stated statutory purpose and is supported by legislative history.the trial court properly determined the legal issue of the department liability pursuant to the motion procedure afforded by section.
ii.the trial court properly resolved the legal issue of liability by concluding that appellants evidence was insufficient to support the claims alleged in the complaint.
appellants further assert that even if the trial court properly utilized section as a means to adjudicate liability,the judgment should be reversed because the evidence did not support the trial court findings.to review this claim,we are guided by the standard of review set forth in group,home indemnity,supra,th at page,d,where the court characterized the trial court process of ruling on in limine as being the equivalent of ruling on a motion for nonsuit.the court further reasoned continuing the analogy of the procedure below to a nonsuit gives us guidance as to the standard of review to be applied on appeal.we must accept all facts asserted in the opening statement or here,asserted in the best case scenario as true and must indulge every legitimate inference which may be drawn from those facts.citations.a nonsuit can only be upheld on appeal if,after accepting all the asserted facts as true and indulging every legitimate inference in favor of plaintiff,it can be said those facts and inferences lead inexorably to the conclusion plaintiff can not establish an essential element of its cause of action citations.accord,lombardo huysentruyt th,d panico truck ins.exchange,supra,th at,d.stated similarly,a trial court may grant a nonsuit only when,disregarding conflicting evidence,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and indulging in every legitimate inference which may be drawn from the evidence,it determines there is no substantial evidence to support a judgment in the plaintiff favor.edwards centex real estate th,d.
even when we apply this stringent standard of review,we conclude that the trial court properly ruled that the admissible evidence offered by appellants was insufficient to support their claims for inverse condemnation,nuisance and negligence.in its order granting the department motion to dismiss,the trial court sustained a number of evidentiary objections to appellants evidence.aside from complaining that the entire proceeding was simply unfair,appellants have not challenged the trial court evidentiary rulings on appeal.appellants failure to do so constitutes a waiver of that issue on appeal,dieckmeyer redevelopment agency of huntington beach th,d interinsurance exchange collins th,d dills redwoods associates,th,fn,d.thus,while we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to appellants,we must necessarily limit our review to only the admissible evidence offered by appellants.see reyes kosha th,fn,d.
inverse condemnation.
an inverse condemnation cause of action derives from article i,section of the california constitution,which states in relevant part private property may be taken or damaged for public use only when just compensation has first been paid to,or into court for,the owner.as explained in oliver wireless services th,d property is taken or damaged within the meaning of article i,section of the california constitution,so as to give rise to a claim for inverse condemnation,when the property has been physically invaded in a tangible manner no physical invasion has occurred,but the property has been physically damaged or an intangible intrusion onto the property has occurred which has caused no damage to the property but places a burden on the property that is direct,substantial,and peculiar to the property itself.citations.the property owner has the burden of establishing that the public entity has,in fact,taken or damaged his or her property.san diego gas electric superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
here,appellants relied on the latter two theories in an effort to demonstrate that the department had taken its property through the construction of the freeway extension.they contended that the freeway had caused physical damage to their property by compromising the homes structural integrity and causing subsurface erosion,manifested by cracks in their patio slabs and homes.as evidence of this damage,they offered a letter from civil engineer hernandez who opined only that the cracks he observed were the cause of an event that happened recently.the trial court ruled that the letter was hearsay and lacked any evidentiary proof in the record to support its contentions.appellants also offered a sworn declaration from gonzalez who opined the reckless use of this heavy equipment during freeway construction to bang and force out large and heavy steel shoring doubtless caused the patio cracks in these homes.they were there before this occurrence and according to the owners had been fine for years prior to the freeway.the trial court ruled that the declaration lacked any foundation for the opinions that were alleged in the declaration 
appellants failed to proffer any competent evidence that the construction and operation of the freeway caused physical damage to their property.in order for liability in inverse condemnation to lie,a causal connection must exist between the defendant public entity conduct and plaintiff damages.citation.the public use or improvement need not be the sole cause of the property damage.liability in inverse condemnation may be shown where the public improvement was a substantial concurring cause of the damage.citation.there must be a showing of a substantial relationship excluding the probability that other forces alone produced the injury.citations.citation.ullery county of contra costa d.
neither hernandez letter nor gonzalez declaration established any causal connection between the cracking on appellants property and the construction and maintenance of the freeway.as the trial court ruled,both opinions were based on assumptions of fact lacking evidentiary support.a n expert opinion that something could be true if certain assumed facts are true,without any foundation for concluding those assumed facts exist in the case,is not probative of the issue to be determined.jennings palomar pomerado health systems,th,d.stated another way,when an expert opinion is purely conclusory because unaccompanied by a reasoned explanation connecting the factual predicates to the ultimate conclusion,that opinion has no evidentiary value because an expert opinion is worth no more than the reasons upon which it rests.citation.ibid.applying these principles,the jennings court struck as too conclusory the testimony of an expert on infectious diseases who offered a conclusion rather than an explanation of how a retractor was a cause in fact of the plaintiff infection the expert opined,i t just sort of makes sense.we have that ribbon retractor and it contaminated,he infected.id.at,d,fn.omitted.that opinion is no different than those offered by appellants experts,who concluded that the cracks in the property must have
