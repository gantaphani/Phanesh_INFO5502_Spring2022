three of the defendants in this bivens action have taken interlocutory appeals,contending that they are entitled to qualified immunity.the plaintiffs are american citizens who were searched at airport between march and august when reentering this country after foreign travel.they contend that customs personnel chose them for searches,strip searches,inspections,or searches because of their race and sex the plaintiffs are black women rather than because of reasonable suspicion that they were violating the law.none of the searches detected any contraband in the plaintiffs possession.what is more,plaintiffs contend,inspectors were more likely to act on suspicion with respect to black women than with respect to black men,white women,or any other combination of attributes.the selection practices at between and the period covered by the complaint thus violate the equal protection component of the fifth amendment due process clause,plaintiffs maintain.appellants were managers and did not target any of the plaintiffs for search or perform any of those searches.their argument starts from the rule that there is no vicarious liability in bivens litigation,which means that they may be held liable only for their own none of that conduct would have alerted a reasonable person to the risk of liability,appellants contend.if that is so,then they are entitled to immunity.see,saucier katz,d anderson creighton,d.but the district court denied their motion for summary judgment,see d,leading to these appeals.see behrens pelletier,d.
because the first issue when a defendant invokes immunity is whether the conduct alleged in the complaint violates the constitution,see saucier,at,appellants also ask us to determine whether plaintiffs have a good claim against them.plaintiffs see this as an opening,because saucier did not reconcile its approach with the holding of johnson jones,d,that a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to consider a challenge to the quality of the plaintiffs proof.the district court must consider the merits first,but a court of appeals must stick to immunity,the argument goes.yet saucier described an evaluation of the merits as part of the appellate task.
resolution of this problem starts with separating factual and legal components of the claim for relief.we did do it may be a good defense,but it is unrelated to immunity a doctrine designed to protect public officials from the effects of guessing wrong in a world of legal uncertainty and thus,johnson held,not a proper ground of interlocutory appeal.johnson precludes the managerial defendants from denying that the line inspectors used race and sex as selection criteria.plaintiffs believe that,if we must assume that racial discrimination occurred on defendants watch,and they did nothing to stop it,there could be no point to the appeal.we should just let the case proceed to trial.recognizing the force of johnson,the managers concede for purpose of the appeal only that some line inspectors at behaved unconstitutionally,and they further concede again arguendo that they did not lift a finger to rectify the problem.there remains a bona fide question about legal doctrine,and thus about immunity would reasonable persons,knowing what the managers knew or were bound to learn,have recognized that the constitution required them to intervene we may address that question without transgressing johnson,and as in saucier may give either of two answers first,that taking all evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs there was no requirement to act or,second,that there is such a requirement but that a reasonable person would not have understood at the time that the law required this.thus it is possible,consistent with johnson,to cover the question whether the plaintiffs have a good legal theory as well as the immunity defense but,as johnson and saucier hold,see at,this must be done by taking the evidence and reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.lest plaintiffs think that we have overlooked one of their principal arguments,we add that the managers arguendo concession that discrimination occurred does not waive any of the contentions they present on appeal the concession is required not only by johnson but also by the rule that a party opposing a motion for summary judgment receives the benefit of all reasonable inferences about disputed material issues of fact.
application of this normal standard does not mean,however,that all evidence is equally helpful to the plaintiffs.plaintiffs point to data collected by the general accounting office and described in its report customs service better targeting of airline passengers for personal searches could produce better results.they submit that these data show systematic constitutional violations by the customs sort of violations that managers must know about and act to prevent.the district judge wrote that black women were the group of united states citizens most likely to be,a rate more than times that of white women and almost times that of white men,as well as higher than black men.d at.there were disparities by race,ethnicity,and sex in selection for other kinds of nonroutine searches as well.yet higher search rates for black women were not matched by better results implying that they were not justified by reasonable suspicion in proportion to the rate of search of those black women that were strip searched,contraband was found on of them,which is a higher positive rate than for white men and white women,but a substantially lower positive rate than for black men,hispanic men,and hispanic women.id.at.the implication is that customs inspectors searched black women with less by way of suspicion than they required before they would search hispanics or black men though black women seem to have been treated similarly to both white men and white women.
these and similar data from the gao report do not support any constitutional claim against the appellant managers,for at least four reasons.first,the report was not published until march,while the last search contested in this litigation occurred in august.during may the customs service announced a review of its criteria for conducting inspections plaintiffs do not contest the policy that was implemented as a result of this process.plaintiffs do not contend that the customs service had any equivalent compilations in its possession earlier,and there was accordingly no reason for the managers to know these statistics in time to have done plaintiffs any good.see d at.the constitution does not require prescience.second,the gao data are national,aggregate information it is not possible to use the published report to learn what happened at.third,the report principal finding is that very few arriving passengers were subject to searches.of approximately passengers arriving at airports from abroad during and,only were subjected to any kind of personal search.better targeting at.almost all black women,like almost all other passengers,were admitted without any search.the gao did not discuss how the customs service selected the from the million for all these data reveal,black women were underselected for search compared with other groups.the data to which the district court,and so on,are the kinds of searches experienced by the.all of those experienced some search.that there were differences in precisely which kind of search was used for which members of the group does not help us with the principal issue in this case were race and sex as opposed to reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing used to select,from among the million,the to be searched the gao report sheds no light on that subject.
fourth,these statistics show disparate impact,not disparate treatment,and the equal protection guarantee is concerned only with the latter.see washington davis,d.differences in the sorts of search carried out could stem from differences in the arriving passengers origins,itineraries,and other matters unrelated to race or sex.and even disparities that can not be chalked up to random variance may have causes other than race,sex,or another proscribed ground of decision.that the point of decisions such as personnel administrator of massachuset
