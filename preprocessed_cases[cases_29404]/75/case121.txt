national railroad passenger corporation amtrak appeals from an order of the united states district court for the northern district of new york lawrence kahn,judge granting united transportation union and carmen famulare motion for summary judgment,denying amtrak motion for summary judgment,and setting aside an award issued by public law board the board,a special adjustment board constituted pursuant to the railway labor act,et the rla 
this case raises what appears to be a novel question in this circuit involving the interpretation of the rla and the scope of judicial review of a labor board compliance with third third under first q first q.put less obliquely,we must determine whether the board failed to comply with the rla or exceeded its jurisdiction under the rla when it held that amtrak was permitted to discipline an employee for conduct that occurred while that employee was functioning as a union representative.the district court found that such a holding by a labor board fails to comply with the rla,and did not reach the jurisdictional question.for the reasons stated below,we reverse,and find both that the board decision complied with the rla and that the board acted within the proper scope of its jurisdiction.
background 
carmen famulare began working as a conductor for amtrak in.at the time relevant to this case,famulare also served as the local chairman of the united transportation union,the labor union authorized to represent certain classes of amtrak employees.on february,famulare represented an amtrak employee at a disciplinary hearing,during which famulare allegedly attempted to bribe a witness by offering free transportation on amtrak trains between poughkeepsie,new york,and buffalo,new york.amtrak subsequently charged famulare with violating its service standards for train service and service employees,as well as interfering with the contractual disciplinary process between amtrak and the united transportation union.although famulare denied the allegations,after a formal investigation initiated by amtrak,an amtrak hearing officer found famulare guilty of the alleged conduct.in so finding,the hearing officer determined that t he mere suggestion that any employee of amtrak,while acting in the capacity as a union representative could,with complete immunity,engage in acts of bribery or dishonesty for the purpose of influencing the outcome of a disciplinary investigation is simply not tenable.decision of hearing officer ronald nies,dated march,case.amtrak immediately terminated famulare employment,effective march.
the united transportation union pursued an appeal on famulare behalf through binding arbitration before the board.after reviewing the record,the board concluded that famulare was guilty as charged.the board rejected the argument that amtrak was not permitted to discipline famulare while he was acting within the scope of his union duties,explaining that w e have considered all the evidence,arguments,awards,and cases presented by the parties and conclude that significant latitude is provided to when functioning as such.however,that latitude falls far short of being a cloak of immunity,and does not cover activities such as that involved in this case.passenger amtrak united transp.union,award,case,johnson,arb.

iii.discussion 
a.the rla dispute resolution framework 
the rla was enacted in to provide for the prompt and orderly settlement of labor disputes between railway carriers and their employees,with the goal of avoiding strikes and the resultant disruption to interstate commerce.see see also detroit toledo shore line united transp.union,d.to effectuate this purpose,the rla imposes distinct dispute resolution procedures for what the supreme court has labeled minor and major disputes.see elgin,ry.burley.for major disputes,the rla requires voluntary processes of negotiation,mediation,voluntary arbitration,and conciliation.id.at.for minor disputes,t he adjustment boards,created pursuant to,have exclusive jurisdiction.indep.union of flight attendants pan am.world airways,cir see also of trainmen chi.river,d ollman special bd.of adjustment,cir.
this court has explained the differences between major and minor disputes on several occasions.see,of locomotive eng rs div.long island,cir csx,united transp.union,cir pan am.world airways,at.in brief,major disputes relate to disputes over the formation of collective agreements or efforts to secure them,while minor disputes contemplate the existence of a collective agreement already concluded or,at any rate,a situation in which no effort is made to bring about a formal change in terms or to create a new one.elgin,at.we have specifically held that the category of minor disputes encompasses disciplinary disputes even if involving employee discharge.pan am.world airways,at.
there is no dispute that amtrak is a carrier within the meaning of the rla,first,or that famulare is an employee of such a carrier,fifth.there also appears to be no disagreement that amtrak termination of famulare qualified as a minor dispute and therefore was subject to compulsory arbitration before the board.here,as noted,famulare and the united transportation union pursued their grievance before one such board,public law board,which found in favor of amtrak.famulare and the united transportation union then appealed to the district court pursuant to first q,which set aside the board decision,holding that the board failed to comply with third of the rla.
judicial review of the board decision 
section first q of the rla allows for a limited judicial review of a labor board ruling.the statute provides 
on such review,the findings and order of the division shall be conclusive on the parties,except that the order of the division may be set aside,in whole or in part,or remanded to the division,for failure of the division to comply with the requirements of this chapter,for failure of the order to conform,or confine itself,to matters within the scope of the division jurisdiction,or for fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the order.

on appeal,united transportation union and famulare invoke the first two prongs of first q,and contend that the board decision did not comply with the requirements of the rla and that the board exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction.for the reasons set forth below,each of these arguments fails.
failure to comply with third 
the district court in this case set aside the board decision for failure of the division to comply with the requirements of this chapter,that is,the failure to comply prong of first q.typically,a federal court review of board decisions under the failure to comply prong has been limited to determining whether boards have complied with the rla procedural obligations.see steward mann,cir meeks.cent.gulf,cir jones ry,cir of,airline clerks,freight handlers,express station employees louis sw.ry,cir.see generally the railway labor act at am.bar ass n,ed.courts also review decisions of adjustment boards for compliance with the procedural requirements of section of the rla.this case is distinguishable,as it does not involve the board failure to adhere to the rla procedural obligations,but rather involves a carrier alleged failure to comply with the obligations imposed upon it by third,and the board alleged failure to comply with the rla by issuing an erroneous award.in other words,famulare and the united transportation union challenge the merits of the board decision,not the procedures by which it was reached.although amtrak vigorously contends that this distinguishing characteristic precludes judicial review of the board decision under first q,we conclude that such review is clearly contemplated by the unambiguous text of the rla.see estate of pew cardarelli,cir we first look to the statute plain meaning if the language is unambiguous,we will not look farther.united states nelson,cir the starting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.internal quotation marks omitted.under the plain language of first q,a decision by a labor board may be set aside for failure of the division,the labor board to comply with the requirements of this chapter.section third is part of the same chapter of the united states code as,chapter of title.since a review of compliance with the requirements of this chapter necessarily implicates the merits of the decision,we agree with the district court that judicial review of a labor board decision under first q for failure to comply with third is proper.
our determination that federal courts may review whether a labor board award complies with third does not end our inquiry however.we turn now to the question of whether the board award in this matter did,in fact,comply with that section and to the related argument that the board exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction.
section third is entitled d esignation of representatives,and provides that 
representatives,for the purposes of this chapter,shall be designated by the respective parties without interference,influence,or coercion by either party over the designation of representatives by the other and neither party shall in any way interfere with,influence,or coerce the other in its choice of representatives.representatives of employees for the purposes of this chapter need not be persons in the employ of the carrier,and no carrier shall,by interference,influence,or coercion seek in any manner to prevent the designation by its employees as their representatives of those who or which are not employees of the carrier.
interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,considering the purpose and context of the statute,and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.dolan postal,d.looking first to the whole statutory text,we note that other provisions of the rla suggest that the term representative refers to the union or other organization designated to represent an employee,and not merely to an individual official within that organization.gustafson alloyd,d noting that under the normal rule of statutory construction,identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning internal quotation marks omitted.for example,ninth ninth provides that if a dispute arises among employees as to who are the representatives of such employees,it is the duty of a mediation board to resolve this dispute,and thereafter,the carrier shall treat with the representative so certified as the representative of the craft or class for the purposes of this chapter.ninth emphases added the supreme court has also found that the term influence,as used in third,plainly means pressure,the use of the authority or power of either party to induce action by the other in derogation of what the statute calls.of ry.clerks.emphasis added.
the text of third and its interpretation by the supreme court is consistent with the understanding that the statute primarily addresses precertification rights of unrepresented employees,meaning,the rights of unrepresented employees to organize an independent union free from employer interference.see virginian ry.system fed.interpreting third to read that employees are free to organize and to make choice of their representatives without the coercive interference and pressure of a company union organized and maintained by the employer see also trans world airlines,indep.fed of flight attendants,d noting that,f rom the time of our very first opportunity to interpret the amendments,we have viewed them as addressing primarily the precertification rights and freedoms of unorganized employees.our sister circuits have likewise emphasized the precertification focus of third.see int l of teamsters,united parcel serv,cir finding that third protects the rights of employees to choose their own collective bargaining representative,not to choose any member of any committee ever set up by a collective bargaining agreement,whether called a representative or not internal citations,quotation marks,and alterations omitted air line pilots ass n,int guilford transp,cir generally speaking,third and fourth prohibit carriers from taking actions designed to interfere with employees rights to organize and bargain collectively.the supreme court emphasized this point in twa,in which it held that once a union is certified,employees rights under section,third and fourth are narrowly circumscribed.see also ass of flight attendants,horizon air,cir of locomotive eng rs.city ry,cir dempsey atchison,topeka santa fe ry,cir johnson express one int l,cir int l ass of machinists aerospace workers nw.airlines,cir.section third thus aims to promote what has been deemed the essential foundation of the rla statutory scheme f reedom of choice in the selection of representatives,at.t
