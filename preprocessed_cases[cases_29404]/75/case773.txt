sixteen days after september,javid naghani,a passenger on air canada flight,went to the lavatory shortly after from los angeles international airport and lit a cigarette,setting off a smoke alarm.when flight attendants came to investigate,a verbal confrontation ensued,beginning with naghani initial refusal to admit to smoking or reveal where he had put whatever had caused the smoke and concluding with naghani purported threat that either he or his people would kill all americans.naghani,an iranian national and united states resident alien who speaks with an accent,denied making these remarks or refusing to cooperate.a jury nonetheless convicted him,and the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment for interfering with the duties of flight attendants in violation of.
naghani now appeals on five grounds,arguing that is unconstitutionally void for vagueness as applied to some of his actions the jury may have relied on an impermissible legal theory in convicting him there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction the district court erroneously failed to instruct the jury that it could convict him for a lesser included on the airplane and the district court incorrectly applied the term recklessly under united states sentencing guidelines.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and a,and we affirm.
on september,naghani boarded air canada flight at los angeles international airport after consuming several alcoholic drinks in the airport lounge.he immediately attracted the attention of flight attendants by with his wife and their small dog despite not being elderly or disabled,and by appearing agitated.
at some point just before or after the sign went off,naghani got up from his seat and went into the rear lavatory,tripping and falling against flight attendant natasha kecskemeti.once in the lavatory,naghani lit a cigarette,setting off the airplane smoke alarm.flight attendant natalie frechette knocked on the door and,not receiving a response,retrieved a fire extinguisher.naghani flushed the cigarette down the toilet.other flight attendants knocked on the door,which naghani finally opened.the attendants saw a cloud of smoke and naghani standing with a pack of cigarettes in his hand.
there was conflicting testimony as to what happened thereafter the flight attendants said that naghani initially denied smoking and that even when he did admit smoking,frechette had to ask him two to four times where he had placed the cigarette butt before he answered.naghani,however,testified that he immediately admitted that he had been smoking,that he handed over his cigarettes after being asked twice and that he immediately told the attendants that he had flushed the butt down the toilet.
naghani was made to sit in a jump seat near the lavatory and became angry when he was told by flight attendant roman dubejsky that the plane might have to return to los angeles.at this point,naghani made other comments to dubejsky,the substance of which is disputed.frechette and kecskemeti,who were standing a few feet away and overheard the angry and loud remarks,testified that they heard naghani say he was wealthy,had many employees and would sue air canada.they also testified that they heard him state either that my people will kill all americans or i will kill all americans.naghani,a native farsi speaker who speaks english with an accent,denied making this statement.he testified that he had explained that he was the president of a janitorial company called cleaning of america,and that he had to make payroll for his employees on the following monday.
on october,naghani was named in a indictment,charging him with interference with flight attendants duties by an act of intimidation in violation of.naghani pled not guilty,and a jury trial began on december.during the trial,the district court denied naghani motion for acquittal at the close of the evidence and also rejected a jury instruction that would have listed smoking on an airplane in violation of as a lesser included offense within.on december,the jury returned a general verdict of guilty.
at sentencing on march,the district court applied a base offense level of pursuant to,finding that naghani had acted recklessly.as a result,naghani received a sentence.he filed a timely notice of appeal three days later.
two of naghani challenges to his conviction hinge on his factual claim that the government presentation of the case led the jury to believe that it could convict naghani solely for actions such as smoking in the lavatory or threatening to sue the airline.he asserts that a conviction based on these lesser actions would be an unconstitutionally vague application of and,relatedly,that the jury was presented with a combination of a legally permissible theory that he could be convicted for threatening to kill all americans with a legally impermissible theory that he could be convicted for smoking in the lavatory or threatening to sue.although these arguments overlap,we address each in turn.
naghani did not raise a vagueness challenge below,but a defendant may attack the constitutionality of the law under which he is charged for the first time on appeal.see united states gilbert,cir.we review the issue de novo.see id.at.
a statute is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined,because people of ordinary intelligence ought to be able to know what is prohibited,and laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them to avoid arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by police,judges and juries.united states harris,cir see also city of chicago morales,d united states dahl,cir.naghani does not challenge the statute on its face.nor does he allege that first amendment rights are at issue.consequently,we need only examine the vagueness challenge under the facts of the particular case and decide whether,under a reasonable construction of the statute,the conduct in question is prohibited.united states fitzgerald,cir.
section states in pertinent part 
an individual who,by assaulting or intimidating a flight crew member or flight attendant of the aircraft,interferes with the performance of the duties of the member or attendant or lessens the ability of the member or attendant to perform those duties,or attempts or conspires to do such an act,shall be fined under title,imprisoned for not more than years,or both.
our circuit has defined intimidation under the predecessor statute to as conduct and words of the accused that would place an ordinary,reasonable person in fear.united states meeker,cir interpreting j 
naghani argues that neither his illicit smoking nor his threat to sue the airline would be reasonably understood to be acts of intimidation that would have created fear on the part of the flight attendants.he concedes,of course,that a threat to kill all americans would clearly satisfy the statute.parsing the government closing argument,however,he contends the jury verdict could have been based solely on his smoking or his threat to sue 
had the government so presented the case,naghani argument would have some force,because it is unlikely that the simple act of sneaking a smoke in the lavatory or threatening to file a lawsuit could satisfy the meaning of intimidation under.although portions of the government argument came perilously close to isolating setting off a smoke alarm or threatening to sue as themselves criminal acts of intimidation,we ultimately conclude that naghani has improperly characterized the government presentation of its case.read fairly and in context,we think it is clear that the government was tying all of naghani actions together as an escalating course of began by his creating an unexplained source of smoke and resultant alarm the missing lit cigarette and culminated in his overt threat of bodily harm kill all americans,combined with his aggressive,confrontational,uncooperative behavior throughout.indeed,the government throughout its argument referred the jury to naghani entire course of conduct,whole course of conduct and whole range of conduct.
because we conclude that the verdict rests on the totality of naghani conduct,including the threat to kill all americans,we ho
