this case considers the effect on the state budgetary process of a bond initiative measure proposition almost two decades after it was approved by voters.specifically,we consider the legality of the legislature creation of the mass transportation fund,the legality of the legislature transfer of a portion of spillover gas tax revenue to the mass transportation fund and the legislature appropriation of billion from the mass transportation fund and the public transportation account for the budget year in light of proposition.
josh shaw,an individual california taxpayer and elector,and the california transit association,a nonprofit corporation,hereafter petitioners filed a petition for writ of mandamus,declaratory and injunctive relief against john chiang,the california state controller,and michael genest,california director of finance,hereafter the state challenging the legislature actions.the trial court generally upheld the challenged actions,rejecting only the legislature transfer of million from the public transportation account to the general fund for past debt service payments on proposition bonds as not being consistent with the purposes of the public transportation account as described by proposition.petitioners appeal from the trial court rejection of their other claims the state the trial court judgment regarding the million transfer.
we agree with petitioners that the trial court improperly upheld the challenged legislative actions.rejecting the position of the state in its,we also conclude the trial court properly invalidated the million transfer.we shall reverse in part and affirm in part.
background 
an understanding of the retail sales tax fund and certain transfers from such fund,proposition,proposition,proposition and proposition is essential to this opinion.these statutes and propositions are discussed at length where pertinent to the appeal,but we begin with a short overview.
california uses state retail sales and use tax revenues to fund the general operation of state government.with a few exceptions not relevant here tax code,state retail sales and revenues are deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the retail sales tax fund.tax code.revenue and taxation code section section governs the withdrawal and transfer of funds from the retail sales tax fund.for many years,subdivision a of section has provided that a portion of the sales and use taxes from motor vehicle fuel,as determined by a specified formula hereafter spillover gas tax revenue,must be transferred from the retail sales tax fund to the state transportation fund stats,ch.the account receiving the spillover gas tax revenue within the state transportation fund has been renamed several times since,however,the account has been called the public transportation account in the state transportation fund pta stats,ch,pub.this appeal concerns the spillover gas tax revenue that would have,but for the challenged amendments and statutes,been transferred to the pta or would have remained in the pta.

unchallenged legislative amendments to section 
starting in,the legislature began to make annual amendments to subdivision a of section,the portion of section governing spillover gas tax revenue,subd.a a h.evidence was submitted to the trial court in the form of a declaration of a program budget manager for the department of finance that the amendments for the budget years and did not result in any change to the amount of money deposited in the pta.however,starting with budget year through,the amendments,subd.a c f resulted in a reduction in the transfer of gas tax spillover revenue to the pta.no legal challenge to this legislative practice was filed.
the challenged amendments,statutes and appropriations the mass transportation fund and the transportation debt service fund 
in,as relevant here,the legislature undertook a series of actions which added subparts g and h to subdivision a of section of the revenue and taxation code stats,ch,added section to the same code stats,ch,and added section to the government code stats,ch.essentially these amendments appropriated money that was otherwise directed to the pta to various other government sources and obligations.
section,subdivision a g relates to the budget year and provides for the transfer of million of spillover gas tax revenue to a new fund called the mass transportation fund mtf,subd.a g.subdivision a h of section relates to the budget year and every fiscal year thereafter,subd.a h.as amended in,subdivision a h calls for the transfer of million of spillover gas tax revenue to the mtf in and percent of the spillover gas tax revenue estimated each quarter in future years,subd.a h.
revenue and taxation code section section,subdivision a,creates the mtf in the state treasury and provides that the funds transferred to the fund may be used for,but shall not necessarily be limited to several specified transportation purposes.the four purposes specified by the statute include payment of debt service on transportation bonds or reimbursement to the general fund for past debt service on transportation bonds funding of the department of developmental services for regional center transportation suspended transfer reimbursements and funding of transportation,subd.a.
for budget year,appropriations were made from the mtf as follows.
section,subdivision b,takes the money million transferred to the mtf by section,subdivision a g,and retransfers million to a new transportation debt service fund and appropriates the remainder million to current suspended transfer reimbursements,subd.b.
government code section establishes the transportation debt service fund and authorizes the director of finance for the budget year to use the million transferred to the fund as follows to reimburse the general fund in the amount of million for the purpose of reimbursing the cost of current debt service payments on three bond propositions million for current debt service on proposition bonds,million for current debt service on proposition bonds is known as the passenger rail and clean air bond act of and is codified at sts,et and million for current debt service on proposition bonds is known as the seismic retrofit bond fund of and is codified at,et,subds.a b.government code section also authorizes the director of finance for the budget year to transfer million from section,subdivision b,to the general fund for the purpose of reimbursing the cost of past debt service payments made by the general fund for public general obligation bond expenditures,subd.b.the department of finance has determined that this million would be used to reimburse the general fund for past debt service payments on proposition bonds.
in summary,the legislature for the budget year transferred million of spillover gas tax revenue that would have otherwise gone into the pta into a new fund,the mtf.ultimately this money was designated to be used for five separate purposes 
million for current debt on suspended transfer reimbursements,subd.b 
million for current debt on proposition bonds,subd.b a 
million for current debt on proposition bonds,subd.b b 
million for current debt on proposition bonds,subd.b c and 
million for past debt on proposition bonds,subd.b.
apart from these five appropriations from the mtf,the budget act of also appropriated million directly from the pta for several purposes.the legislature transferred million from the pta to the department of developmental services dds to pay for the costs of transporting developmentally disabled persons receiving vocational rehabilitation services to regional centers.stats,ch,item,the budget act of.the legislature transferred million from the pta to the department of education doe to fund the transportation and small school district transportation programs.stats,ch,item amendments and additions to the budget act of.the legislature authorized the director of finance to reimburse the general fund with million of pta funds to offset the cost of past debt service payments on public transportation related general obligation bond expenditures stats,ch,amendments and additions to the budget act of and the state controller determined the million should be applied to past debt service on proposition bonds.
petitioners filed a petition for writ of mandate,declaratory relief,and injunction challenging the legislature amendment of section,subdivision a,four of the legislature five appropriations for the budget year from the mtf and all three of the legislature described appropriations for the budget year from the pta as being inconsistent with proposition and the california constitution.petitioners did not challenge the mtf appropriation of for payment of current debt on proposition bonds,subd.b b.
the trial court concluded the legislature validly exercised its authority to amend section to include subdivisions a g and h.the trial court rejected petitioners challenges to the four appropriations from the mtf.the trial court concluded the appropriations from the pta to the dds and doe were valid as they served a mass transportation purpose within the meaning of section.the trial court concluded,however,the transfer of million to the general fund for past debt service payments on proposition bonds was invalid as the transfer did not serve any transportation planning or mass transportation purpose and so was contrary to section.judgment was entered declaring the portion of the budget act of that authorized the million transfer violated section and issuing a writ of mandate commanding the state to transfer million from the general fund to the pta.the judgment denied all other claims for relief sought by petitioners.
standard of review 
petitioners claim on appeal the trial court erred in its interpretation of section in light of proposition and article xix a.according to petitioners,the mtf is improper.petitioners contend the voters intended all spillover gas tax revenue to be placed in the pta where it would be used only for transportation planning and public transportation purposes.petitioners claim that payment of home to school and small school district transportation,transit of developmentally disabled persons to regional centers,debt service on proposition bonds and reimbursement of past debt service are not such purposes.petitioners also claim payment of current proposition debt from spillover gas tax revenue violates proposition.petitioners claim payment of current suspended transfer reimbursements out of the pta violates article xix b proposition and proposition.
the state,in its,contends the trial court erred in concluding the reimbursement of past debt service on proposition bonds out of the pta was violative of section.
resolution of these issues requires statutory interpretation,which we consider independently as a question of law.professional engineers wilson th,d pe wilson.
in resolving the challenges at issue in this appeal,we consider both statutes adopted by the legislature,subd.a g h,the budget act of the amendments and additions to the budget act of and statutes and state constitutional provisions adopted by the voters of california,article xix a,proposition,article xix b,proposition proposition.
we keep in mind that u nlike the federal constitution,which is a grant of power to congress,the california constitution is a limitation or restriction on the powers of the legislature.citations.two important consequences flow from this fact.first,the entire authority of the state,except the people right of initiative and referendum,is vested in the legislature,and that body may exercise any and all legislative powers which are not expressly or by necessary implication denied to it by the constitution.citations.in other words,we do not look to the constitution to determine whether the l egislature is authorized to do an act,but only to see if it is prohibited.citation.secondly,all intendments favor the exercise of the legislature plenary authority if there is any doubt as to the legislature power to act in any given case,the doubt should be resolved in favor of the legislature action.such restrictions and limitations imposed by the constitution are to be construed strictly,and are not to be extended to include matters not covered by the language used.citations.methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor cal d,accord state personnel bd.of personnel admin.cal th,d.

the will of the electorate is involved in our consideration of initiative measures like proposition as well as article xix a and article xix statutes and constitutional provisions adopted by the voters must be construed liberally in favor of the people right to exercise the reserved powers of initiative and referendum.the initiative and referendum are not rights granted the people,but power s reserved by them.declaring it the duty of the courts to jealously guard this right of the people citation,the courts have described the initiative and referendum as articulating one of the most precious rights of our democratic process citation.i t has long been our judicial policy to apply a liberal construction to this power wherever it is challenged in order that the right not be improperly annulled.if doubts can reasonably be resolved in favor of the use of this reserve power,courts will preserve it.citations.rossi brown cal th,d.in fact,t he people reserved power of initiative is greater than the power of the legislative body.the latter may not bind future legislatures citation,but by constitutional and charter mandate,unless an initiative measure expressly provides otherwise,an initiative measure may be amended or repealed only by the electorate.thus,through exercise of the initiative power the people may bind future legislative bodies other than the people themselves.id.at,d.
discussion 
legislature amendment of section and creation of the mtf section 
as the trial court recognized,the threshold issue here is the legislature power to amend section,subdivision a.two constitutional provisions affect our analysis.
first,article iv,section of the california constitution provides,in pertinent part,that a section of a statute may not be amended unless the section is as amended.the effect of this section is that voters considering an initiative that seeks to make discrete amendments to selected provisions of an existing statute,are forced to reenact the entire statute as amended in order to accomplish the desired amendments.yoshisato superior court cal th,d,original italics deleted.
second,article ii,section,subdivision c of the california constitution provides that t he legislature may amend or repeal an initiative statute by another statute that becomes effective only when approved by the electors unless the initiative statute permits amendment or repeal without their approval.the purpose of this constitutional limitation on the legislature power to amend initiative statutes is to protect the people initiative powers by precluding the legislature from undoing what the people have done,without the electorate consent.proposition enforcement project quackenbush th,d.the power vested in the electorate to decide whether the legislature can amend an initiative statute is absolute and includes the power to enable legislative amendment subject to conditions attached by the voters.citation.citations.amwest surety ins.wilson cal th,d,amwest accord,foundation for taxpayer consumer rights garamendi th,d.
consequently,when section was amended in by proposition,it was actually in its entirety as amended.cal,art.iv.at that point,any subsequent amendment to any portion of section remembering this is the statute governing the withdrawal and transfer of virtually all of the state retail sales and use tax revenue would require approval of the voters to be effective,except that proposition expressly included conditional authority for legislative amendment.cal,art.ii.proposition provided that t he legislature may amend this section,by statute passed in each house of the legislature by rollcall vote entered in the journal,of the membership concurring,if the statute is consistent with,and furthers the purposes of this section,subd.e,formerly subd.d,italics added hereafter section e.thus,the meaning of the italicized phrase contained in section e is of paramount importance to our decision on this issue.
the validity of the legislature amendment of section,subdivision a to add subparts g and h,which transfer a portion of spillover gas tax revenue to the mtf rather than to the pta,depends on whether such amendment is consistent with,and furthers the purposes of this section.although the initiative limitation of the legislature authority to amend section to provisions consistent with,and that further the purposes of this section must be strictly construed,it also must be given the effect the voters intended it to have.amwest,supra,cal th at,d.in line with amwest,we start with the presumption that the legislature acted within its authority id.at,d,and uphold the validity of section,subdivision a g and h if,by any reasonable construction amwest,supra,at,d,it can be said those subparts are consistent with,and further the purposes of this section.e.
in determining what the voters meant by consistent with,and further the purposes of this section e,we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction.citation.thus,we turn first to the language of the initiative,giving the words their ordinary meaning.citation.professional engineers in california government kempton cal th,d,see dafonte,cal th,d.we do not examine that language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.if the language is clear,courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the voters did not intend.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.citations.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th,d.absent ambiguity,we presume that the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an initiative measure citation and the court may not add to the statute or rewrite it to conform to an assumed intent that is not apparent in its language.citation.professional engineers in california government kempton,supra,at,d.
the trial court concluded the term section in section e has a plain meaning.specifically,it found the accepted legal meaning of section refers to section as a whole,not its subdivisions.even if ambiguous,the trial court found no extrinsic evidence of intent in the ballot materials for proposition or anywhere else to suggest the voters intended to preclude the legislature from changing the amount of sales and use tax revenues allocated to the pta.the trial court concluded the purpose of section was to provide for the distribution of all state sales and use tax revenues that have been deposited in the retail sales tax fund.it determined that section,subdivision a g and h is consistent with and further s the purposes of section because the amendments distribute sales and use tax revenues for the general operation of the government.therefore,it concluded the amendments are valid.
we agree with the trial court that the term section has a plain and customary meaning that references section as a whole.in fact,the revenue and taxation code recognizes this common legal meaning when it references the division of the code into division,part,chapter,article,and section.this common understanding of the term can be inferred from the provision in the revenue and taxation code specifically providing that s ection means a section of this code unless some other statute is specifically mentioned and subdivision means a subdivision of the section in which that term occurs unless some other section is expressly mentioned.tax code.where a word or phrase in a statute has an accepted legal meaning,courts will adopt that definition,unless a contrary legislative intent appears.texas commerce bank garamendi th,d.
we part company with the trial court,however,in its understanding of the phrase consistent with,and furthers the purposes of this section.e.the trial court interpretation of the purpose of section and the phrase consistent with,and further s the purposes of,th is section e as allowing any amendment distribut ing sales and use tax revenues for the general operation of the government essentially amounts to a conclusion that any withdrawal or transfer of sales and use tax revenue from the retail sales tax fund is valid after proposition as long as it is a withdrawal or transfer of sales and use tax revenue from the retail sales tax fund.
we reject the trial court conclusion in part because the voters could have accomplished this by simply allowing the legislature to amend the section,period.the trial court interpretation renders meaningless the additional phrase that the amendment must be consistent with,and further the purposes of this section.we conclude it is not plainly evident what the voters meant by such phrase.true,the voters did not state that any amendment of section by the legislature must further the purposes of proposition.amwest surety ins.wilson,supra,cal th at,d,foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights garamendi,supra,th at,d proposition enforcement project quackenbush,supra,th at,d.however,the lack of language in section e limiting amendments to those that further only the purposes of proposition is perhaps understandable because,as the trial court put it,section is a distribution statute that governs the disposition of all state sales and use taxes deposited into the retail sales tax fund.if section e had limited amendments of the section to those that further the purposes of proposition,it would have arguably imposed proposition purposes on the legislature ability to deal with all of the sales and use tax revenue in the retail sales tax fund.considerable legal uncertainty would have resulted when nothing in proposition suggests an intent to change the legislature ability to generally deal with the state sales and use tax revenue.
it is also true that proposition did not include language in section e similar to public utilities code section,added by proposition.section limits amendment of this part the clean air and transportation improvement act of,to statutes consistent with and that further the purposes of this part.section then states no changes shall be made in the way in which funds are allocated pursuant to chapter commencing with section,except pursuant to section.certainly if section e contained a similar express limitation for spillover gas tax revenues transferred to the pta under section,subdivision a,there would be no issue of interpretation here.the failure of proposition to include a specific restriction of amendments to section,subdivision a in section e when it included a specific limitation in section may be evidence that the voters did not intend such a restriction.see people goodloe th,d engs motor truck state bd.of equalization d.on the other hand,examination of the legislation purpose and application of other canons of statutory construction may suggest the omission is an oversight.people goodloe,supra,at,d engs motor truck state bd.of equalization,supra,at.

unlike the trial court,we conclude that the voters in including the phrase consistent with,and furthers the purposes of this section in section e meant something more than the legislature may amend the section.the phrase is language of limitation.to determine the nature of the limitation we turn to the terms of proposition so that we may consider section e in the context of the entire initiative of which it is part dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.
proposition authorized the issuance of almost billion of general obligation bonds to fund primarily passenger and commuter rail infrastructure.pub,ballot,primary june,official title and summary.the voters expressed their intent that the bond funds shall not be used to displace existing sources of funds for rail and other forms of public transportation,including,but not limited to,funds that have been provided pursuant to,the pta,and that funding for public transit should be increased from existing sources including fuel taxes and sales tax on fuels.
by amendment to section,the voters designated the pta a trust fund and changed the purposes for which the pta funds could be used from transportation purposes to transportation planning and mass transportation purposes,subd.b.proposition also amended section to provide for more frequent transfers of spillover gas tax revenue to the pta,which again was referred to as a trust fund,subd.a.section,subdivision a provided the estimated spillover gas tax revenue shall be transferred to the pta.as amended by proposition,the language of section,subdivision a stopped there.ballot pamphlet,supra,text of proposition.it did not include the language except as modified as follows.that qualifier was added in by the legislature.stats,ch.
when the provisions of the initiative are read in context and harmonized together,we conclude the voters in adopting proposition intended to add a new source of money the proposition bond funds for public transportation projects,to convert the pta to a trust fund dedicated to supporting transportation planning and mass transportation projects,and to preserve the funding of the pta for such projects with spillover gas tax revenue according to the formula specified in section,subdivision a.a constant amount of spillover gas tax revenue is not guaranteed,but if the formula results in there being spillover gas tax revenue it must be transferred to the pta for use in accordance with section.the voters intent to preserve spillover gas tax funding of the pta would be frustrated if the legislature could amend section,subdivision a to modify the amount of spillover gas tax revenue making it to the pta.
we conclude,therefore,the language of section e that allows legislative amendment of this section if the amendment is consistent with,and furthers the purposes of this section must be read to authorize the legislature to amend any part of the section statute as long as the amendment is consistent with and furthers the purposes of that particular part of the statute.in the case of amendments to subdivision a of section,legislative amendments must be consistent with the purposes of the pta as described by section,subdivision b.that is,amendments to subdivision a of section may appropriate these trust funds only for transportation planning or mass transportation purposes.since subdivision a g and h of section transfer spillover gas tax revenue to the mtf,a fund with purposes not limited to those identified by section,there is no reasonable construction amwest,supra,cal th at,d,by which subdivision a g and h can be said to be consistent with,and further the purpose of the portion of section that they amend.they are invalid.
we find further support for our interpretation of section e in the legislature action in submitting proposition to the voters in the november general election.cal,art.xix a article xix a ballot pamphlet,official title and summary prepared by the attorney general.as relevant here,article xix a restricts the conditions under which funds from the pta may be loaned to the state general fund.cal,art.xix a.if the legislature could reduce transfers of revenue to or divert revenue from the pta to the benefit of the general fund by means of an amendment to section,subdivision a,a loan procedure would be unnecessary.the fact that the legislature believed revenue in the pta could be tapped only through loans,as evidenced by its submission of proposition to the electorate,reflects its understanding of the effect of proposition consistent with our opinion.this understanding also comports with our conclusion as to the nature and scope of the intent of proposition and section e.
our conclusion does not mean the legislature creation of the mtf is improper or invalid.the legislature has plenary lawmaking authority over the state budget cal,art.iv,and we are aware of no constitutional prohibition precluding it from creating specific funds in the state treasury for any number of governmental purposes.see methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor,supra,cal d at,schabarum california legislature,supra,th at,d.we only conclude that subdivision a g transferring millions of spillover gas tax revenue to the mtf in budget year and subdivision a h regarding the continuous transfer of millions of spillover gas tax revenue in and each fiscal year thereafter are invalid.the source of the revenue in the mtf may not be spillover gas tax revenue that would otherwise have been transferred to the pta pursuant to section,subdivision a.the voters,through proposition,have precluded such amendment of section,subdivision a.
use of pta revenue for transportation planning and mass transportation purposes 
although we have concluded the legislature amendment of section,subdivision a to add subparts g and h transferring pta money to the mtf was invalid,the funds transferred to the mtf in the budget year may nevertheless have been validly appropriated if they were actually used for transportation planning and mass transportation purposes as required for pta funds.in fact,petitioners concede the appropriation of million to pay current debt service on proposition the passenger rail and clean air bond act of,et bonds was a transportation planning and mass transportation purpose.petitioners argue,however,that of the budget year appropriations from the mtf,two of the other four appropriations the million for current debt on proposition bonds,subd.b c and the million,for past debt on proposition bonds,subd.b,were not for mass transportation purposes.
as to appropriations from the pta itself for budget year,petitioners contend all three were not for mass transportation purposes.the trial court disagreed with petitioners and found that all appropriations from the mtf were valid.as to appropriations from the pta,the trial court agreed with petitioners that the million transferred to the general fund to reimburse the general fund for past debt service on proposition bonds was invalid.it rejected petitioners claims regarding the transfers of million from the pta to the dds to pay for the costs of transporting developmentally disabled persons receiving vocational rehabilitation services to regional centers and the transfer of million from the pta to the doe to fund the transportation and small school district transportation programs.
petitioners argue on appeal the trial court erred in its conclusion as to these last two appropriations from the pta to the dds and the doe,and the state contends in its that the trial court erred as to its first conclusion.
finally,we also consider here petitioners challenge to the legislature transfer of million from the mtf to the general fund for suspended transfer reimbursements as violative of proposition and article xix b.the validity of such transfer is also resolved by consideration of whether it was a transfer for transportation planning or mass transportation purposes.
to determine these issues,we first consider the meaning of mass transportation as used in section.next we consider whether appropriations for payment of proposition debt,for costs of transporting the developmentally disabled to regional centers,and for transporting some school children are such mass transportation purposes.then we address the question of whether reimbursement of the general fund for its past debt service on an undisputed mass transportation bond fund is a mass transportation purpose within the meaning of section.finally,we consider the transfer of money from the mtf for suspended transfer reimbursements.
a.the meaning of mass transportation as used in section 
proposition amended section to designate the pta a trust fund and to change the purposes for which the pta funds could be used from transportation purposes to transportation planning and mass transportation purposes,subd.b.the term mass transportation is not defined.the trial court agreed with petitioners that the term should be equated with public transit or transportation.the state urges us to adopt instead a dictionary meaning of mass transportation as a means or system of conveying a large number of people.we conclude the trial court got it right.
in interpreting the meaning of mass transportation as used in section,our paramount task is to ascertain the intent of the voters who enacted section so that our construction best effectuates the purpose of the law.gattuso shoppers,cal th,d,professional engineers in cal.government kempton,supra,cal th at,d.we start with the statute words,giving them their ordinary and usual meaning and viewing them in their statutory context,because the statutory language is usually the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.gattuso shoppers,supra,at,d.the plain meaning of the words controls unless the words are ambiguous.green state of california cal th,d.if the statutory language is ambiguous and susceptible of differing constructions,we may reasonably infer that the legislators intended an interpretation producing practical and workable results rather than one resulting in mischief or absurdity.see in re reeves cal th,fn,d,and cases cited.it is a fundamental tenet of statutory construction that we must give the statute a reasonable construction conforming to legislative intent.gattuso,supra,cal th at,d.city of santa monica gonzalez cal th,d.
the state argues the plain and usual meaning of mass transportation may be determined by reference to the dictionary definitions of mass and transportation.since the dictionary defines the word mass as meaning of a large number of things,of a large number of persons,and of,characteristic of,or for the masses webster new world dictionary third college ed.at and transportation as a means or system of conveyance or the work or business of conveying passengers or goods i at,the state contends the dictionary definition of mass transportation is a means or system of conveying a large number of people.
the first problem with this approach is that the words mass and transportation have multiple dictionary meanings that may be combined to reach not only the state proposed definition,but a definition of public transportation as well.see,webster third new international dictionary at mass defined as of,relating to,designed for,serving,or characteristic of the mass of the people,transport defined as a system or organized means of public conveyance or travel,italics added.
the more fundamental problem with the state proffered meaning is its failure to provide a reasonable and workable distinction from transportation purposes generally.proposition deleted transportation purposes from section and substituted transportation planning and mass transportation purposes.clearly,a limiting change was intended by the use of the term mass transportation.yet the state suggestion that pta funds may be used for any transportation purpose that serves multiple people can cover virtually any state transportation project,including any street,highway or bridge.the qualifier that the project serve multiple people is meaningless as there is no clear,nonarbitrary means of determining exactly how many people are necessary to qualify as multiple people and we assume all of the state transportation projects benefit and serve more than one individual.the state construction of the term mass transportation renders the amendment of section superfluous.
moreover,the state interpretation does not effectuate the stated intent of the electorate in adopting proposition.proposition was adopted to provide new bond revenue to fund primarily passenger and commuter rail infrastructure.these are clearly means of public transportation.the voters expressed their intent that the bond funds shall not be used to displace existing sources of funds for rail and other forms of public transportation,and that funding for public transit should be increased from existing sources including fuel taxes and sales tax on fuels,italics added.given this context,it appears the voters intended the term mass transportation in section to be synonymous with public transportation or public transit.such interpretation accords a reasonable construction to the term mass transportation in light of the voter intent 
our interpretation is consistent with how the california department of transportation apparently views the term mass transportation.we note the department of transportation structurally includes a division of mass transportation that provides technical assistance to agencies responsible for public transportation.see as of june.in its web site description of the responsibilities and objectives of the division of mass transportation,the department of transportation uses the term mass transportation as the equivalent of public transportation.ibid.the department of transportation definition on its website of the term mass transportation is t ransportation by bus,rail,or other conveyance,either publicly or privately owned,which provides to the public general or special service on a regular and continuing basis.does not include school buses,charter,or sightseeing service.see also public transportation.as of june.
our interpretation of mass transportation as public transportation is also consistent with how the terms are defined by the federal urban mass transportation act of et,which was enacted in order to provide financial assistance to state and local governments for the development and operation of mass transportation systems.stockton metropolitan transit dist.amalgamated transit union d.section defines the term mass transportation for purposes of such law to mean public transportation,subd.a.
the trial court correctly determined the voters intended mass transportation in section to be the same as public transit or public transportation.
b.the legislature appropriations for current debt service on proposition bonds,for transportation of the developmentally disabled,and for transportation of school children 
having concluded the term mass transportation in section should be interpreted to mean public transit or public transportation,we now apply our statutory construction of section to three of the legislature appropriations.
current debt service for proposition 
to begin with,we consider the legislature appropriation of million from the mtf for the payment of current debt service on proposition bonds.proposition is known as the seismic retrofit bond fund of,subd.a.government code section provides that the proceeds of the proposition bonds are to be used for the seismic retrofit of highways and bridges,including toll bridges,throughout the state,subd.a.bond funds may be used to match any available federal funds for transportation purposes or may be used without matching federal funds to reconstruct,replace,or retrofit highways and bridges,including toll bridges.ibid.it is clear from these statements that payment of current debt service on proposition bonds is not funding a mass transportation purpose within the meaning of section,but a general transportation purpose.the state argues it may nevertheless be a transportation planning purpose because substantial planning is required for the seismic retrofitting of highways and bridges.we do not doubt a great deal of planning is necessary for projects funded by proposition,but it is not planning transportation.it is planning for reconstruction,replacement,and retrofitting of highways and bridges.the appropriation of revenue in the mtf for the purpose of debt service on proposition bonds,subd.b c violates the purposes of section and is invalid.
appropriations to the doe and to dds 
we next consider the legislature appropriation from the pta of million to the doe for the home to school and small school district transportation programs,et,et and million to the dds for transportation of the developmentally disabled to regional centers.it was the trial court view that mass transportation services may include not only general transportation services provided to the public at large,but also specialized transportation services indiscriminately provided to some portion of the public.the trial court concluded transporting public school children and the disabled was a specialized service of mass transportation within the meaning of section.we disagree.
while public transportation may include both general and specialized services,the critical point is that the transportation is provided indiscriminately to the public.see pub,see also,subd.a.thus,special services may be necessary to enable the disabled or the elderly to have comparable access to public transportation through,for example,paratransit or demand responsive services.see.but provision of transportation for public school children is not providing school children with access to public transportation.it is providing transportation service to a discrete portion of the public that is not available to the general public.see regional transit authority d,school bus routes must be open to the public to receive federal public transit funding.the same is true with the program for transporting developmentally disabled persons to regional centers.this is not a special service to enable the developmentally disabled access to public transportation.this is a transportation service to a discrete population developmentally disabled persons who have transportation services as part of their individual program plans welf,regs,subd.a that is not available to the general public.transportation services for school children and for the developmentally disabled are worthy causes,which the legislature may well consider important to financially support.we conclude only that they are not mass transportation purposes within the meaning of section they may not be funded with revenue from the pta.the appropriations from the pta for such purposes are invalid.
payment of past debt service,as a mass transportation purpose 
the legislature authorized two transfers in the budget year for the purpose of reimbursing the cost of past debt service payments made by the general fund on proposition bonds the passenger rail and clean air bond act of sts,et.first,government code section,subdivision b,authorized the transfer of million to the general fund for past debt service on proposition bonds from the transportation debt service fund.this was an indirect use of pta revenue since the mtf funded the transportation debt service fund,subd.b and we have already determined the mtf was wrongfully funded with spillover gas tax revenue that should have been transferred to the pta.second,the legislature authorized the transfer of million directly from the pta to reimburse the general fund for such past debt service payments on proposition bonds.stats,ch,amendments and additions to the budget act of.
petitioners challenged these transfers claiming they were improper because they were in effect a second payment of the proposition debt service obligation that had already been paid at least indirectly by diversion of pta funds in the prior years and the debt service obligation was discharged by payment in the prior years so that the transfer of pta revenue to offset those payments was not the expenditure of money for transportation planning and mass transportation purposes.
the trial court agreed with petitioners that the million transfer to offset past debt did not serve any transportation planning or mass transportation purpose.the trial court rejected petitioners claim regarding the million transfer,however,when it rejected all of petitioners challenges to the revenue transferred to the mtf.the trial court found the legislature amendments to section,subdivision a were valid,so the million transferred to the mtf was not pta spillover gas tax revenue subject to section.petitioners appeal the trial court conclusion with respect to the million transfer and the state the trial court conclusion with respect to the million transfer.
we have previously concluded that section,subdivision a g and h,were invalid legislative amendments in light of the voters intent in proposition.thus,the two transfers of pta spillover gas tax revenue for reimbursement of the general fund for prior debt service payments present the same dispositive issue does the transfer of spillover gas tax revenue to the general fund for the purpose of reimbursing the general fund past payment of its obligations on bond issues that were for a mass transportation purpose a transfer that is for a mass transportation purpose we conclude the answer is no.
there is a clear distinction between transferring revenue from the pta to the general fund to pay current debt obligations on mass transportation bonds and transferring such revenue to reimburse for past debt obligations.in the case of the former,the revenue flows from the source to the present obligation via the general fund to serve a mass transportation purpose.although the money passes through the general fund,it is still actually being used for the identified mass transportation purpose.in the legislature discretion,this may include the payment of current bond debt on mass transportation bonds.in the case of offsets or reimbursement of past debt service payments,however,there is no mass transportation debt obligation to be paid with the pta funds.the debt was paid by the general fund in the prior fiscal years.no actual debt remains.money from the pta under the label of offsetting or reimbursing past debt payments is simply transferred to the general fund where it can be used for any governmental purpose.such reimbursement of the general fund for its previous payment of its obligation on the specified bonds does not serve a mass transportation purpose.there is no flow through similar to the payment of current debt.funding restrictions can not be ignored through the guise of a theoretical legal obligation.pe wilson,supra,th,d.
the state offers a cursory argument that the reimbursement of past debt service payments does serve a mass transportation function.the state suggests there is a mass transportation purpose in the reimbursements because they provide needed flexibility for the legislature to deal with mass transportation projects supported with spillover gas tax revenues that vary from year to year.the state reasons that i f the legislature did not have the flexibility to reimburse the general fund for prior debt service payments,it would be forced to use spillover revenues to make current debt service payments even when there was a minimal amount of spillover revenues available to be transferred into the pta.by allowing the legislature to reimburse the general fund for past debt service payments,it would be able to make such payments when spillover revenues are high such that transportation projects ordinarily serviced by the pta would not be impacted.
we reject this argument for two reasons.first,the petitioners note that the state argument does not square with legislative practice general fund revenues were used to pay debt service in years when there was ample pta revenue.second,the argument is besides the point.constitutional restrictions can not be ignored based on budgetary convenience.
payment of suspended transfer reimbursements as a mass transportation purpose 
the legislature authorized the transfer of million from the mtf to the general fund in the budget year for the purpose of making suspended transfer reimbursements required by article xix b,subdivision f,subd.b.the trial court determined no law prohibited the reimbursement of the general fund for its ultimate obligation to repay the suspended transfers and rejected petitioners challenge to the appropriation,citing pe wilson,supra,th at pages,d.petitioners contend the trial court erred in finding pe wilson applicable and in concluding the transfer did not violate proposition and article xix b,subdivision f.the state claims pe wilson controls the outcome of petitioners challenge and requires us to uphold this transfer.
in pe wilson,supra,th,d,this court concluded the legislature could use funds from the state highway account sha to reimburse the general fund for payments of principal and interest on proposition and proposition bonds,except to the extent the sha funds were traceable to gas tax funds that were transferred in violation of article xix,section of the california constitution.pe wilson,supra,at,d.we drew a distinction between reimbursement and obligation and held that the use of sha funds to reimburse the general fund was not prohibited by proposition and proposition,which placed the ultimate obligation for payment of the bonds on the general fund.pe wilson,supra,at,d.we rejected appellants argument that the reimbursement violated the intent of the voters to increase mass transit spending without depleting existing transportation funds such as the sha.id.at,d.instead,from
