defendant ricky alcorn appeals his conviction,following a jury trial,for willfully and unlawfully wrecking a train,in violation of.we affirm.
background 
at approximately on august,alcorn drove his truck north along greenwich road in sedgwick county,kansas.as he approached street,he encountered two barricades stretching the width of the road and indicating that the road was closed.alcorn drove around the barriers and proceeded towards a construction project in which pipe construction company was rebuilding an section of the railroad crossing near street and greenwich road.
as alcorn approached the railroad crossing,he realized that there was an trench between the end of the roadbed and the newly replaced railroad tracks,which had not yet been filled in.the trench was eight to ten inches deep.as alcorn drove across the trench between the roadbed and the tracks,his truck became stuck.he then got out of his truck and walked some feet to a large excavator which had been used by the construction crew.the crew had left the excavator with its excavating arm stretched across the road as an additional barrier to traffic.the arm,when fully extended,stretches feet from the front of the machine.the arm also has a large bucket attached at its end,which is inches wide and inches tall.the operating cab of the excavator rotates so that the operator always faces in the direction of the excavating arm.
alcorn knew how to use the machine,as he had worked previously at construction jobs.alcorn found the key which the operator of the excavator had hidden,got into the cab,started the machine,turned on its lights,raised the arm and proceeded towards his truck,intending to use the arm to push his truck out of the trench.he maneuvered the excavator behind his truck,and pushed the truck out of the trench with the arm.he then backed the excavator up,dropped the arm and bucket to the ground,turned off the excavator lights,wiped his fingerprints off the inside of the cab,and returned the key to the compartment in which it had been hidden.the bucket lay partially across one of the railroad tracks.
alcorn walked north towards his truck,passing by the bucket.he acknowledged at trial that he had seen the bucket as he walked past it he got into his truck,which by now had two flat tires,drove around additional barricades,got stuck again,but finally freed his truck and proceeded towards the intersection of street and greenwich road.when he saw the headlights of a car approaching on street,he pulled behind a barricade,turned off his lights,and waited for the car to pass.
alcorn realized that he could not drive the car because of the two flat tires.accordingly,after passing several houses as he drove north on greenwich road,he eventually stopped and parked his truck at the house of kathy willis.he left a note on willis door,apologizing for leaving his truck in her front yard and stating that he would be back soon to pick it up.he did not leave his name or phone number.alcorn called a friend,john martin,on his cell phone and asked him to pick him up.
while waiting for martin to arrive,alcorn heard the crash of a train as it hit the excavator bucket.the foot long train had hit the bucket going miles per hour and derailed,causing a total of more than million in damage.when martin arrived,he and alcorn drove to the scene of the crash.when martin suggested they call on alcorn cell phone,alcorn said he did not want to.they then left the scene of the derailment.later,alcorn discussed with martin various stories he could tell the police about the incident.
alcorn was indicted on one count alleging that he did willfully and unlawfully,derail,disable and wreck a train,in violation of.vol.iv at tab.at trial,the court gave the following instructions to the jury 
instruction 
willfully,as that term is used in,means the acts charged in the indictment were committed voluntarily,deliberately and intentionally,even if defendant did not know his or her acts constituted a specific crime.
instruction 
a willful act is done knowingly.an act is done knowingly if defendant was aware of the act,realized what he was doing or what was happening around him,and did not act or fail to act because of ignorance,mistake,or accident.the government is not required to prove defendant knew these acts or omissions were unlawful.you may consider evidence of defendant words,acts,or omissions,along with all the other evidence,in deciding whether the defendant acted knowingly.
instruction 
the question of intent is also a matter for you,as jurors,to determine.
in every crime there must exist a union or joint operation of act and intent.
intent means more than the general intent to commit an act.the government must prove that defendant knowingly did an act which the law forbids.
intent is a state of mind.because you can not look directly into a person mind,the only reasonable way to determine intent is to consider all the facts and circumstances shown by the evidence and determine from that evidence defendant intent at the time in question.
instruction 
the intent required to violate is that a person act willfully to derail,disable or wreck a train.the government is not required to prove that a specific intent to derail,disable or wreck a train existed at the time of the events herein.in other words,you are not required to find the defendant acted with the intent to derail,disable or wreck a train.
willfulness may be shown by evidence of the natural,probable consequences of the defendant actions.
after deliberations began,the jury submitted a question to the court seeking clarification of instruction.the court conferred with the parties and responded,without objection,as follows an act is done knowingly if it done voluntarily and intentionally and not out of mistake or accident or other innocent reason.vol.vii at.after deliberating further,the jury asked two more questions if rick failed to check whether the bucket was on the track,is that considered to be a willful act,in terms of the bucket being left on the track and if he could have made sure he did obstruct the track and chose not to look or take any other action is that willful vol.iv at tab.alcorn requested that the court instruct the jury do you find or not find that ricky alcorn knew that he placed the bucket of the backhoe on the railroad track vol.vii at the court refused that request.
the court then proposed giving the jury a modified allen instruction,to which alcorn objected,arguing that the jury questions to the court indicated that they were confused about the meaning of willful in the context of this case,and that the modified allen instruction merely pressures the jury to make a decision with this fundamental misunderstanding being considered.id.at.the court overruled that objection,and gave the jury the following instruction 
instruction 
as i told you during instructions yesterday,your verdict must represent the considered judgment of each juror.in order to return a verdict,it will be necessary that each juror agree thereto.your verdict must be unanimous.
in this light,it is your duty as jurors to consult with one another and to deliberate with a view to reaching an agreement,if you can do so without violence to individual judgment.each of you must decide the case for yourself,but do so only after an impartial consideration of the evidence with your fellow jurors.in the course of your deliberations,do not hesitate to your own views and change your opinion if convinced it is erroneous.but do not surrender your honest conviction as to the weight or effect of the evidence solely because of the opinion of your fellow jurors,or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.
i have faith in your judgment,whatever your ultimate verdict.
you are not partisans.you are of the facts.your sole interest is to ascertain the truth from the evidence in this case.
vol.iv at tab.the court also responded to the jury two questions as follows 
the instructions,as supplemented in the response to jury question number one,adequately define willful actions.please carefully review those instructions again.it is your responsibility to determine if defendant willfully caused the derailment of the train.
vol.vii at.the court went on to say 
when i say the derailment,i including the whole wreck,the damage to the train.i think if you go back and take a look at the definition of willfully,you take a look at the definition of knowingly,and finally the supplement to that definition of knowing that we sent into you last night,that should guide you in terms of determining whether an act is willful or not.
i would remind you as well that while we have defined those terms for you in terms of the statute,you are still to its part of the common sense and knowledge and experience as you consider all the things that you looking at in this case.we are not going to be able to tell you because it your job to determine from what you have whether something is willful or not.we ca tell you whether it is or whether it is.if we could do that,we would probably be telling you what the verdict should be in the case.again,that difficult as it may seem,may even seem overwhelming at responsibility.we give you as much help as we possibly can,but we ca ultimately decide the case for you,which is what we would,in effect,be doing if we say,yes,this is willful conduct.no,that not willful conduct.because it is ambiguous to some extent in the sense that there could be some question with respect to whether an act was willful or not,depending on what the circumstances are.so you need to take a look at the whole case again,what all the circumstances are,and make a determination here with respect to the charge against the defendant based on the information that you heard during the trial,the evidence and based upon the instructions i have given you.
the jury resumed deliberations after receiving the above instructions,and returned a guilty verdict later that day.
alcorn then filed a motion for judgment of acquittal,which the district court denied in a written memorandum order.the court stated,the jury could and did determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant actions willfully wrecked a train.as in youts,the jury was required to find and did find that the defendant knowingly set in motion the events which caused the train to wreck.mem.order at,vol.iv at tab.
the court subsequently denied alcorn request for a downward departure under the sentencing guidelines,finding that alcorn case fell within the heartland of cases to which the particular guideline applied.the court accordingly sentenced alcorn to months imprisonment,followed by three years of supervised released,and directed alcorn to make restitution in the amount of.
alcorn appeals,arguing the district court erred in refusing to provide a substantive answer to the second set of questions submitted by the jury regarding the intent that must be proved in order to convict,and instead,referred the jurors to previous instructions,appellant br.at giving an allen instruction in response to the jury questions refusing to give a theory of the defense instruction,as requested by alcorn and refusing to depart downward in sentencing alcorn under the sentencing guidelines.
discussion 
jury instructions 
alcorn basic defense at trial was that he did not realize that he had left the excavator arm bucket on the railroad track,and therefore he did not willfully derail the train,as required by.he further argues that the jury questions during deliberations revealed that they were confused about the meaning of the term willful in this case,that the court response to the jury questions failed to eliminate that confusion,and that the jury confusion was exacerbated by the modified allen instruction and by the denial of alcorn requested theory of the defense instruction.
we review the jury instructions de novo to determine whether,as a whole,the instructions correctly state the governing law and provide the jury with an ample understanding of the issues and applicable standards.united states fredette,cir quotation omitted.the instructions as a whole need not be flawless,but we must be satisfied that,upon hearing the instructions,the jury understood the issues to be resolved and its duty to resolve them.id.at quotation omitted.further,while we review de novo the jury instructions as a whole,the district court decision to give a particular jury instruction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.id.at.
we review whether an allen instruction was erroneously given on a basis with a view towards determining whether the instruction had a coercive effect on the jury.united states,cir.some of the factors we consider in making this determination include the language of the instruction,whether the instruction is presented with other instructions,the timing of the instruction,and the length of the jury subsequent deliberations.gilbert mullin,cir quotation omitted.finally,with respect to alcorn theory of defense argument,w e review de novo whether a district court committed reversible error in failing to submit a requested theory of defense instruction.united states bindley,cir.
alcorn first argues that the district court erred in failing to give a specific substantive answer to the jury second set of questions,and instead simply referred the jury to the instructions already given which defined the term willful.he argues that those prior definitions were inadequate and that their inadequacy stemmed from the district court misinterpretation of united states youts,cir.
in youts,the defendant boarded an idling locomotive,drove it to a place near his house,put the train in reverse at full throttle and jumped off the train.the driverless train rounded a curve at miles per hour and derailed.agreeing with the few other circuits which have addressed the matter,we rejected the defendant argument in youts that requires proof of a specific intent to disable,derail or wreck a train.we held,rather,that the willfulness language in section is best understood as a knowledge requirement.id.at.we further held that a person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense when,if the element involves a result of his conduct,he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.id.quoting model penal code b ii.thus,t he natural,probable consequences of an act can satisfactorily evidence the state of mind accompanying it.id.at.as applied in youts,we held that t he natural,probable,and practically certain consequences of sending a driverless locomotive down curving tracks at full speed will be the result punished by the statute.id.we concluded our analysis in youts by stating,youts knowingly set in and events which caused the train to wreck.that is all section requires.id 
we hold that the instructions given to the jury in this case adequately and accurately defined the intent required to find a violation of and adequately defined the term willful,as our circuit has interpreted the intent requirement of.as instruction stated,a willful act is done knowingly.vol.iv at tab.the instruction,in turn,defined knowingly as where the defendant was aware of the act,realized what he was doing or what was happening around him,and did not act or fail to act because of ignorance,mistake or accident.id.instruction correctly informed the jury that the government need not prove a specific intent to derail,but that w illfulness may be shown by evidence of the natural,probable consequences of the defendant actions.id.thus,just as in youts the natural,probable consequence of sending a driverless train at full speed around a corner was derailment,in this case the natural,probable consequence of leaving an excavating bucket partially across a railroad track is derailment of an oncoming train.
alcorn argues that the jury questions indicate the jurors were confused about the definition of willfulness and knowing.we disagree.the jury questions indicate that jurors were having difficulty applying those instructions to the particular facts of this case.but the fact that jurors submit questions indicating they are having difficulty applying particular instructions to the facts of the case does not necessarily mean that the instructions are themselves faulty.rather,the jury questions suggest they were focused precisely on th
