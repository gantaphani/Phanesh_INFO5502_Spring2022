this appeal arises from the district court grant of summary judgment for consolidated rail corporation conrail in this action filed under the federal safety appliances act fsaa,the federal employee liability act fela,and the federal boiler inspection act bia.honas richards richards challenges the district court dismissal of his fsaa claim arguing that the court erred in finding that he failed to produce sufficient evidence of a defective appliance and that this defect caused his injuries.because we find that richards produced sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on the issue of the defect and because we find that this court holding as to causation in reetz chicago erie railroad,cir has been called into question by the united states supreme court holding in rogers missouri pacific railroad,d,and never clarified,we reverse and remand.
richards began working for conrail in.he became a conductor in and was working in that position on may.on that date,richards and a were responsible for taking a freight train with approximately ninety cars from columbus,ohio,to cincinnati,ohio.
approximately thirty minutes after leaving columbus,the train unexpectedly stopped as a result of an automatic emergency application of the air braking system.in such a situation,the conductor must attempt to determine the cause of the undesired brake application.this is done by walking the train getting off the train,walking its length,and inspecting for visible causes.after placing an emergency radio call to the dispatcher,richards climbed down from the train and began his inspection.
richards walked east alongside the train on the ballast,stopping occasionally to inspect underneath the cars.at some point,he lost his footing and allegedly injured his back.richards waited until the pain in his back subsided and then he completed his inspection.
richards did not observe any defects during his inspection that would have caused an emergency brake example,an air hose leak,car derailment,or shift in loads.based on his experience and training,richards therefore concluded that the stop must have been caused by a defective control valve,commonly referred to as a kicker.each freight car equipped with a brake has an internal valve that controls the amount of air that is depleted to activate the brake system.obviously if this valve is located inside the brake mechanism,richards could not visibly inspect it when he walked the train.as richards explained,
my examination eliminated everything except a defective control valve.there had to be a reason,and there was no reasons are like busted air hoses where the air escapes into the atmosphere.train brakes apply when air is taken away from the system not when it put in.when you put it in,the brakes release.when you take it away,the brakes apply.
and so there had to be there was sic no leaks and i walked that whole thing so based on my experience and what i been taught in these classes,the only reasonable explanation was a defective control valve,a kicker.
the district court granted conrail motion for summary judgment,finding as to richard fsaa claim that he failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove that the braking system was defective.after reviewing the evidence,specifically the transcript from richard deposition,the court concluded that richards only could opine that the stop was caused by a defective control valve.the court also concluded that,even upon proof of a defective appliance,richards could not demonstrate that his injury was causally linked to the allegedly defective appliance.relying primarily upon this court opinion in reetz,the district court held that the defective control valve did not cause richard injury rather,his injury merely was an incidental condition of the defect.the trial court explained,
plaintiff slip while walking the track was only incidentally caused by the alleged appliance violation the injury was not the direct or efficient cause of any alleged appliance violation.as in reetz,although plaintiff would not have been walking the track to inspect but for the allegedly defective appliance,his subsequent slip and injury bears too tenuous a connection with the defective appliance so as to give rise to liability.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court order granting summary judgment,viewing all the evidence and inferences therefrom in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.campbell grand trunk,cir citations omitted.the moving party must show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,and the nonmoving party must then come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.id.
ii.analysis 
the fsaa imposes an absolute duty on railroads to provide and maintain certain safety appliances,including power braking systems.myers reading.elgin,ry.to recover for a violation of the fsaa,therefore,plaintiffs need only show the statute was violated and they suffered injuries resulting in whole or in part from the defective equipment.coray pac.
proof of a defective appliance 
there are two recognized methods of showing that an appliance was defective evidence may be adduced to establish some particular defect,or the same inefficiency may be established by showing a failure to function,when operated with due care,in the normal,natural,and usual manner.myers,at.quoting didinger pennsylvania,cir.as the myers court elaborated,efficient means adequate in performance producing properly a desired effect.inefficient means not producing or not capable of producing the desired effect incapable incompetent inadequate.id.if the plaintiff demonstrates a defect using the second method,he or she need not show an actual break or visible defect.id.if the plaintiff establishes that the appliance functioned inefficiently at the relevant time,it is irrelevant that the appliance worked efficiently both before and after the occasion.id.
thus in didinger,where the plaintiff demonstrated that he firmly set a hand brake which immediately gave way and failed to hold,this court held that it was not necessary for the plaintiff to show the specific reason why the brake failed 
assuming the proper setting of the hand brake,the fact that it did not hold demonstrates its inefficiency.as said in philadelphia ry.auchenbach,cir the test of the observance of this duty under the safety appliance act is the performance of the appliances,and it was not necessary for the plaintiff to show whether this failure to function was due to the fact that the ratchet broke loose from the brake staff,that the ratchet teeth were worn,that the dog or its rocker pivot broke,that there was too much vertical play between dog and ratchet or any other precise defect minneapolis louis gotschall.if the brake was properly set,as asserted,some defect must have been latent in it.otherwise it would have held.
didinger,at.as didinger suggests,plaintiffs may rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to prove their fsaa claims.see also myers,at.holding that conductor testimony that brake wheel did not function like ordinary wheel and that it suddenly kicked back and knocked him to ground was sufficient to make an issue for the jury as to whether brake was defective anderson baltimore,cir finding that the failure of the sanding apparatus to function when operated in a proper manner and under normal working conditions makes a prima facie case of insufficiency either in the air pressure or in mechanical construction.the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur has frequently been applied to prove,in the absence of explanation,a violation of provisions of the safety appliance act.trial judges should not rule out plaintiffs opinions as to why appliances functioned inefficiently,where the plaintiffs opinions are based on their experience and perceptions at the time of their accident.see fritts toledo terminal,cir holding that trial judge improperly ruled out plaintiff opinion,based on his experience working for the railroad,that lurching of the engine was due to a worn frog see also myers,at.holding that the plaintiff testimony as to the inefficiency of the appliance is such substantial evidence of inefficiency as to make an issue for
