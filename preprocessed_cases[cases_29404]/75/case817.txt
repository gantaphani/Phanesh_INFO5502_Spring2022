petitioner cooper tire rubber company cooper seeks a writ of mandamus directing the district court to vacate its discovery order and requiring the district court,on remand,to apply the provisions of rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.specifically,cooper asserts that the district court erred in not applying the proper standards regarding the scope of relevant information for purposes of discovery,the calculation of whether the requested discovery posed an undue burden,and the determination of whether trade secrets should be revealed.reviewing the district court order and the requirements of rule b,we conclude that cooper right to the issuance of the writ is not clear and indisputable.further,we determine that the issuance of the writ is not appropriate under the circumstances of this case.accordingly,exercising our jurisdiction under the all writs act,a,we deny cooper petition.
background 
this case arises from an accident on a utah highway where the tread belt on a cooper tire separated,causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle.as a result,the van went off the road and rolled over several times before coming to a stop.nine of the eleven individuals in the van died from the injuries they sustained in the accident.the remaining two passengers suffered severe injuries but survived.
the survivors and heirs of the deceased passengers brought suit against daimlerchrysler corporation,daimlerchrysler motors corporation,collectively chrysler and cooper.their complaint asserted various strict products liability,negligence,and breach of warranty claims against chrysler and cooper.with regard to cooper,the plaintiffs alleged that cooper knew or should have known that the tires were prone to tread separation within their normal and intended use.specifically,the plaintiffs claimed that prior to the production of the van tire,cooper realized that its tires suffered from an unacceptably high rate of tread separations,but deliberately failed to make design changes to combat this knowledge or warn consumers about the problems with its tires.pet r app.at,compl.jury demand,dated.they alleged that information available to cooper before production of the tire even began confirmed that cooper knew about these dangerous and defective conditions.id.at.
to substantiate these claims,the plaintiffs sought discovery from cooper.cooper,in turn,filed a motion for protection from the plaintiffs excessively broad scope of discovery,asking that discovery instead be limited to the design of the green tire specification gts at issue the plant at issue,and for a reasonable period of time one year before and one year after the date of manufacture.id.at cooper tire rubber mem.in supp.of its mot.for protection from pls.excessive scope of,dated may.in support of its motion,cooper argued that the proper scope of discovery was similar products,that is,similar tires in the context of this case.cooper defined similar tires as those tires manufactured to the same gts.accordingly,cooper asserted that discovery should be limited to the eleven tire brands made to gts,which is the gts of the tire at issue additionally,cooper argued that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of demonstrating that the trade secrets they sought were relevant and necessary to the lawsuit.
the plaintiffs then filed a motion to compel,arguing that their discovery requests were specific to the five separate manufacturing and design defects they alleged to exist in the tire at issue and accusing cooper of engaging in a history of discovery abuse and of making objections to impermissibly narrow the scope of discovery.in response,cooper filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to compel in which it reiterated its arguments about the definition of similar tires and the burden for requesting trade secrets and also argued that some discovery requests sought information about different cases,claims,and tires.in their reply,the plaintiffs noted,inter alia,that the issue of notice was a part of their complaint,they bear the burden on notice at trial,and their requests would assist them in meeting this burden.
the magistrate declined to accept cooper view of similar tires and compelled cooper to comply with the discovery requests with the exception of requests regarding information in other complaints or suits brought against cooper.in coming to this conclusion,the magistrate noted that discovery is proper regarding any matter,not privileged,that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party.id.at mem.decision order,dated,quoting.b.although the magistrate did indicate that discovery was not limited to issues raised in the pleadings,he also recognized that the amendments to the federal rules of civil procedure direct ed parties and the courts to focus on the actual claims and defenses involved in the action in determining relevance for purposes of discovery.id.at quoting.advisory committee note.
additionally,the magistrate rejected cooper contention that the plaintiffs bore the burden of demonstrating substantial similarity of the tires at this stage and noted that the plaintiffs would face this burden when they sought to admit the evidence at trial.he also reasoned that the definition of substantial similarity might be more relaxed due to the plaintiffs broad theory of the case.id.at.ultimately,the magistrate rejected cooper arguments about substantial similarity because he determined they were more appropriate to the question of whether the requested information is admissible as opposed to whether it is discoverable.
the magistrate also considered cooper arguments regarding the burden of the discovery requests and trade secrets and found them to be without merit.the magistrate,although sympathetic to cooper concerns about the amount of discovery requested,found that the plaintiffs should be permitted to engage in discovery in line with their broad theory of the case.the magistrate also cited the plaintiffs broad theory in determining that they had met their burden of demonstrating that the trade secrets were relevant and necessary to their case.the magistrate further noted that cooper proposed protective order had been adopted,which would provide adequate protection against improper disclosure of their trade secrets.accordingly,the magistrate ordered cooper to comply with the discovery requests.
cooper filed objections to the magistrate order in which it argued that the magistrate erred in applying a relaxed standard of substantial similarity,failed to apply the appropriate standard for discovery of trade secrets,allowed for overbroad discovery,and imposed an undue and impossible burden on cooper.the district court heard oral arguments regarding cooper objections where cooper essentially reiterated the arguments that it had previously made in its motions and in its objection to the magistrate order.cooper also argued that tread separation is not a defect in and of itself but rather is caused by a defect the relevant question is then what caused that particular tread to separate.
as to the issue of undue burden,the plaintiffs told the district court that most of the documents had already been produced in other cases and they were willing to retrieve those documents from the electronic database in other cases so that they could be utilized in the instant case.they also volunteered to undertake the printing and copying and to bear those costs.the plaintiffs also argued that cooper proposed definition of substantially similar tires was tantamount to defining substantially similar as identical.pet r app.at miscellaneous hearing,dated.
the plaintiffs argued that the appropriate standard was their proffered standard,which had been accepted in other cases,that generally different models of tires would be substantially similar if they share characteristics with the tire that are pertinent to the litigation.here,they said that they sought information on different models with the same critical components that affect tread belt separation.the plaintiffs also contested whether cooper had demonstrated that their documents contained trade secrets and noted that these documents had been produced in other litigation and a protective order was in effect.
the district court overruled cooper objections and affirmed the magistrate ruling.cooper then filed the petition for writ of mandamus now before us.meanwhile,before the district court,cooper sought,and was granted,a stay of the disputed discovery pending our resolution of this petition.
ii.discussion 
cooper seeks a writ of mandamus vacating the district court order and directing the district court to apply the correct legal standards under rule b in making its discovery ruling.cooper main arguments are that the district court impermissibly defined the scope of discovery in a manner that conflicts with the,and amendments to rule b and that the district court ordered the production of documents containing trade secrets without applying the correct standard for such documents.specifically,cooper asserts that the district court applied an erroneous standard in five ways by failing to require the plaintiffs to demonstrate that the documents were relevant to a claim or defense by failing to require the plaintiffs to show that good cause existed for the discovery of documents that were relevant to the subject matter of the action and not specifically to a claim or defense by applying a relevance test based on the plaintiffs broad theory of the case that allegedly conflicts with the language and purpose of the and amendments to the rule by failing to apply the limitations imposed by rule b iii and by allowing discovery of trade secrets that were not proven to be relevant and necessary.before addressing the merits of cooper claims,we must first address the standards for the issuance of a writ of mandamus and the requirements of rule b.
writ of mandamus standard 
a writ of mandamus differs in many important respects from a direct appeal.most significantly,the standard for granting the writ differs from that for reversing on appeal.although a simple showing of error may suffice to obtain reversal on direct appeal,a greater showing must be made to obtain a writ of mandamus.barclaysamerican kane,cir.accordingly,mandamus is not a substitute for an appeal.id.at.rather,a writ of mandamus is a drastic remedy,and is to be invoked only in extraordinary circumstances.id.quoting allied chem.daiflon,d per curiam.
unlike an appeal,a writ of mandamus is used only to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.allied chem,at.internal quotation marks omitted.only exceptional circumstances,amounting to a judicial usurpation of power,will justify the invocation of this extraordinary remedy.id.therefore,we will grant a writ only when the district court has acted wholly without jurisdiction or so clearly abused its discretion as to constitute usurpation of power.united states carrigan,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
when the district court errs in deciding a legal issue,it necessarily abuses its discretion.in re qwest commc ns int l,cir.however,the supreme court has cautioned against relying on a label such as abuse of discretion to justify issuing the writ.will united states,d will calvert fire ins,d.there must be more than what we would typically consider to be an abuse of discretion in order for the writ to issue.see paramount film distrib.civic center theatre,cir the adverse effects which uncontrolled discovery has are apparent,but again we can not say on this record that the trial judge has here abdicated his judicial function nor is it such a gross abuse of discretion as to warrant the issuance of the writ.emphasis added citing parr united states.roche evaporated milk ass n.bankers life cas.holland.it is not appropriate to issue a writ when the most that could be claimed is that the district courts have erred in ruling on matters within their jurisdiction.schlagenhauf holder,d internal quotation marks omitted.

for guidance in determining whether the writ may issue,we have identified five nonconclusive guidelines.united states mcveigh,cir per curiam.these guidelines are 
whether the party has alternative means to secure relief whether the party will be damaged in a way not correctable on appeal whether the district court order constitutes an abuse of discretion whether the order represents an often repeated error and manifests a persistent disregard of federal rules and whether the order raises new and important problems or issues of law of the first impression.

federal rules of civil procedure rule b 
our consideration of whether the district court has usurped its power must begin with an examination of the rule that it is alleged to have failed to of the federal rules of civil procedure.the federal rules of civil procedure shall be construed and administered to secure the just,speedy,and inexpensive determination of every action.the rules recognize the affirmative duty of the court to exercise the authority conferred by these rules to ensure that civil litigation is resolved not only fairly,but also without undue cost or delay.advisory committee note.cooper argues that the district court failed to properly administer the rules,focusing mainly on two provisions of rule b.we address the legal standards identified in each provision in turn.in so doing,we also give weight to the advisory committee notes that accompany rule.see united states vonn,d schiavone fortune,d.publ g murphree.esposito united states,cir.
the first provision that cooper alleges the district court violated describes the scope of discovery that is typically available parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter,not privileged,that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party.b.this is a change in the rule that was implemented in the amendments.advisory committee note.prior to that time,the available scope of discovery was that which was relevant to the subject matter of the action.id.however,the amendment did not entirely eliminate discovery on the subject matter of the action.the rule also states for good cause,the court may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action.b emphasis added.
this change implemented a discovery process the first tier being discovery of information relevant to any claim or defense of a party,and the second being discovery that can include information relevant to the subject matter of the action see,james moore et,moore federal practice ed hereinafter moore charles alan wright,arthur miller,richard marcus,federal practice and procedure ed hereinafter federal practice thomas rowe,a square peg in a round hole the limitation on the scope of federal civil discovery.accordingly,when a party objects that discovery goes beyond that relevant to the claims or defenses,the court would become involved to determine whether the discovery is relevant to the claims or defenses and,if not,whether good cause exists for authorizing it so long as it is relevant to the subject matter of the action.advisory committee note this standard is intended to be flexible.id.when the district court does intervene in discovery,it has discretion in determining what the scope of discovery should be.t he actual scope of discovery should be determined according to the reasonable needs of the action.the court may permit broader discovery in a particular case depending on the circumstances of the case,the nature of the claims and defenses,and the scope of the discovery requested.id.
cooper argues that under the amendments the concept of relevance is no more expansive in discovery than at trial and that the use of the term relevant in rule has the same meaning as when it is used in the federal rules of evidence.pet r br.at.that may not be the case.see moore,supra,a t he standard for determining whether information is relevant for purposes of pretrial discovery is substantially broader than the standard for relevance during trial.in one respect,the term relevance clearly is broader than admissibility at trial for purposes of discovery,r elevant information need not be admissible at trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.b.for reasons explained below,it is not necessary in this case to expand the definition of relevant evidence beyond that which would be admissible at trial in support of a claim or defense or that which appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of evidence that would be so admissible.
as to the second provision,cooper alleges that the district court erred in not balancing the considerations identified in rule b iii.under that rule 
the frequency or extent of use of the discovery methods otherwise permitted under these rules and by any local rule shall be limited by the court if it determines that iii the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit,taking into account the needs of the case,the amount in controversy,the parties resources,the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation,and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues.
b.to make this determination,the district court may,after reasonable notice,act on its own initiative or it may act pursuant to a motion for a protective order.id.rule b also notes all discovery is subject to the limitations imposed by rule b i,ii,and iii.the advisory committee note indicates that t his otherwise redundant has been added to emphasize the need for active judicial use of subdivision b to control excessive discovery.advisory committee note.
the advisory committee note also explains that the amendments to rule b generally were intended to involve the court more actively in regulating the breadth of sweeping or contentious discovery.id.indeed,beginning with the amendments,the committee has amended rule b with the intention of encouraging more judicial involvement in discovery.see.advisory committee note the rule contemplates greater judicial involvement in the discovery process and thus acknowledges the reality that it can not always operate on a basis.advisory committee note textual changes are then made to enable the court to keep tighter rein on the extent of discovery.
in the amendments,the advisory committee determined expressly not to review the question of discovery abuse,but rather chose to focus on the architecture of discovery rules and determine whether modest changes could be effected to reduce the costs of discovery,to increase its efficiency,to restore uniformity of practice,and to encourage the judiciary to participate more actively in case management.memorandum from paul niemeyer,chair,advisory committee on civil rules,to anthony scirica,chair,committee on rules of practice and procedure may.
finally,cooper directs part of its argument to the district court order requiring the discovery of its alleged trade secrets.specifically,cooper argues that the district court erred in applying the standard for production of documents containing trade secrets.a protective order may be issued to limit the disclosure of trade secrets.c.when a party seeks such a protective order,it must first establish that the information sought is a trade secret and then demonstrate that its disclosure might be harmful.centurion,warren steurer,cir footnote omitted.if the party makes such a showing,the burden shifts to the party seeking discovery to establish that the disclosure of trade secrets is relevant and necessary to the action.id.
the need for the trade secrets should be balanced against the claim of harm resulting from the disclosure.id.it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to decide whether trade secrets are relevant and whether the need outweighs the harm of disclosure.id.at.if the party seeking discovery can not prove that the information is relevant and necessary,then discovery should be denied.id.at.however,if the party meets its burden,the trade secrets should be disclosed,unless they are privileged or the subpoenas are unreasonable,oppressive,annoying,or embarrassing.id.at.
district court discovery order 
we next consider whether,given the legal standards identified supra,the writ should issue.for the writ to issue,cooper must have no other adequate means of relief and cooper right to the writ must be clear and indisputable.cheney,at.additionally,we must be convinced that,in the exercise of our discretion,it is appropriate under the circumstances for the writ to issue.id.after our own careful and independent review of the record,we conclude that neither of the final two conditions for the issuance of the writ are met 
whether the right to the writ is clear and indisputable 
cooper arguments regarding rule b 
cooper argues that the district court did not find that the contested discovery pertained to a nonprivileged matter relevant to a claim or defense but,rather,allowed discovery based on the plaintiffs broad theory of the case.cooper claims that the district court never found good cause for the broad discovery predicate for allowing discovery relevant to the subject matter of the action.cooper also asserts that the district court erred in applying a conception of relevance when it noted that relevance is construed more broadly during discovery than at trial.
in ruling on the discovery motions,the magistrate properly invoked the version of rule.he also cited a amendment case for the proposition that discovery is broad under the federal rules of civil procedure.pet r app.at citing gomez martin marietta,cir.after doing so,the magistrate noted that the advisory committee note instructed parties and the court to focus on the claims and defenses for purposes of discovery.in responding to cooper argument that the plaintiffs bore the burden of demonstrating that different products were substantially similar,the magistrate stated that the plaintiffs would bear that burden if they sought to have the information about different products admitted at trial.then,citing our decision in four corners helicopters,turbomeca,cir,the magistrate noted that the substantial similarity requirement may be somewhat relaxed based on the plaintiffs theory of the case.
ultimately,the magistrate rejected cooper arguments finding them somewhat misplaced and better suited to the more narrow issue of admissibility of certain information,rather than the issue before the court,which is the broader question of whether that information is discoverable.pet r app.at.he noted that limiting discovery as cooper proposed could deprive the plaintiffs of discovery supporting their theory,citing the advisory committee notes to the amendments direction to focus on the action claims.
we first address cooper claim that the district court applied the incorrect definition of relevance in endorsing the magistrate reasoning.this claim has two components first,the magistrate statement that there was a relaxed requirement of substantial similarity and second,the magistrate reliance on the idea that relevant discovery is broader than relevant admissible evidence.
regarding the first component,we find no error.the magistrate cited four corners helicopters,in noting that the requirement of substantial similarity may be somewhat relaxed.pet r app.at.this is entirely consistent with this court precedents addressing the substantial similarity requirement in the context of proof of the defendant awareness of defects in products liability actions.substantial similarity depends upon the underlying theory of the case.four corners helicopters,at.when the evidence is offered to demonstrate that a highly dangerous condition existed,a high degree of substantial similarity is required.id.the requirement of substantial similarity is relaxed,however,when the evidence of other incidents is used to demonstrate notice or awareness of a potential defect.id.citing wheeler john deere,cir.because the plaintiffs theory of the case includes the argument that cooper was on notice of the tread separation problem,the district court was not clearly in error in concluding that information on tires manufactured to specifications other than gts could tend to lead to discoverable evidence.see.b.
with regard to the second aspect of the relevance argument,we can not conclude on this record that any error by the district court amounted to a gross abuse of discretion such that cooper could establish that its right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.the amendments effected a change in the scope of what is relevant for purposes of discovery.however,this change is limited in two respects.first,it changed only the answer to the question of relevant to what in other words,it did not change the definition of the word relevance itself for purposes of discovery but it did change what we are looking to in deciding what is relevant.after the amendments,a party is entitled to information relevant to the claims and defenses of any party,rather than the subject matter of the action.second,a broader scope of relevant to the subject still available if the court determines that the party seeking the discovery has shown good cause for seeking that broader discovery.the amendment did not change the overall scope of the court authority to order discovery,but it did alter the scope of discovery available as a matter of right to the attorneys without court authorization.federal practice,supra.
here,it is not clear that the district court believed that plaintiffs discovery requests went beyond that relevant to the plaintiffs claims.the magistrate cited the amendment rule and the advisory committee note.although the magistrate cited a amendment case indicating that discovery is not limited to the pleadings,the magistrate also repeatedly recognized the need to focus on the claims of the parties.the magistrate appears to have concluded that all of the requested discovery was relevant to the plaintiff claims,rejecting cooper narrow concept of what constituted a similar tire.
cooper essentially seeks to limit the plaintiffs discovery based upon its own theory of what tires are substantially similar.however,a party should not be limited by its opponent theory of the case in determining what is discoverable.see federal practice,supra.what is relevant to the claims or defenses depends on the circumstances of the pending action.advisory committee note.the magistrate determined that the circumstances of the pending,the plaintiffs theory of the case,based on five specifically alleged design and manufacturing the plaintiffs to discovery about substantially similar tires.given the arguments before the magistrate and district court and the discussion in the magistrate order,it would not be unreasonable to conclude that the magistrate determination was driven by a conclusion that these similar tires were related to the plaintiffs claims.
to the extent that cooper now complains that the magistrate judge and the district court failed to distinguish between relevance to the plaintiff claims and relevance to the subject matter of the lawsuit,this is largely attributable to cooper own litigation choices.in the district court,cooper focused entirely on the definition of similar tires and did not frame its argument in terms of the relevancy definition of rule b.had it done so,it no doubt would have received a more focused response.it can not now complain,at the appellate level and on petition for mandamus,that the district court failed to provide legal analysis that cooper did not ask it to provide.
cooper argues that the magistrate judges reliance on the plaintiffs broad theory of the case indicates that the district court went beyond what is relevant to the claims and defenses to allow discovery relevant to the subject matter of the lawsuit,without making the necessary finding of good cause.in koch koch industries,cir,the plaintiff filed a complaint alleging fraud in entirely indefinite terms,without in fact knowing of any specific wrongdoing by the defendant.at.we concluded that when a plaintiff bases massive discovery requests upon nebulous allegations,in the hope of finding particular evidence of wrongdoing,that plaintiff abuses the judicial process.id.
we agree that the mere fact that a plaintiff entertains a broad theory of the case does not justify more expansive discovery,unless the discovery is relevant to the plaintiff actual claims or defenses,or the plaintiff makes a showing of good cause.but t he dividing line between information relevant to the claims and defenses and that relevant only to the subject matter of the action can not be defined with precision.advisory committee note.based on this record,while we recognize the possibility that the district court erred,we can not say with a sufficient degree of certainty that this line was crossed.
unlike koch,the plaintiffs claims here are not purely speculative.instead,this is a products liability action where the tread of one of cooper tires did,in fact,separate.the plaintiffs identified five specific design and manufacturing flaws that they believe led to the separation.the plaintiffs also alleged that cooper had been on notice of the problem of tread separation and yet made no design changes and issued no warnings to consumers.we can not conclude that the district court allowance of the discovery at issue here authorized plaintiffs to abuse the judicial process.
were it clear that the plaintiffs were seeking discovery that only pertained to the subject matter of the action and not their claims,the magistrate would have erred in allowing discovery without a showing of good cause.however,the record before us does not demonstrate that this is such a case.accordingly,we can not say that it is clear and indisputable that there was a gross abuse of discretion in allowing this discovery without requiring the plaintiffs to make any good cause showing.
cooper arguments regarding rule b iii 
cooper also argues that the district court erred in failing to take into consideration the factors identified in rule b iii.cooper contends that any time a district court is faced with a discovery dispute,it must explicitly balance the costs and benefits of the proposed discovery,taking into account the needs of the case,the amount in controversy,the parties resources,the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation,and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues.b iii.in this case,it asserts that had the district court considered those factors,logic and common sense would have compelled the conclusion that most,if not all,of the contested discovery was neither needed by plaintiffs nor sufficiently important in resolving the issues to justify the burden and expense of production.pet r br.at.
with regard to cooper contention that the discovery requested was unduly burdensome,the magistrate noted that he was sympathetic to the large amount of discovery requested by plaintiffs.pet r app.at.but considering plaintiffs discovery needs,in light of its broad theory of the case,the magistrate ultimately declined to grant cooper requested limitations on plaintiffs discovery requests.in doing so,the magistrate did not,however,expressly find that cooper burden or expense of discovery
