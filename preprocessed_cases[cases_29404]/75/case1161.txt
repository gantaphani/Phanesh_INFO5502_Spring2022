introduction 
plaintiff and appellant scott gordon sustained severe injuries when a nissan pathfinder he was driving rolled over.gordon claims that the manufacturer of the vehicle,defendant and respondent nissan motor,is liable for his injuries because the vehicle was defectively unstable.he also claims that the pathfinder roof was defective because it was not crashworthy,that is,it was not adequately designed to withstand a rollover.
the case was tried twice in the superior court.the first trial resulted in a mistrial.the second trial,which is the subject of this appeal,resulted in a verdict in nissan favor.gordon elected not to pursue his roof defect claim at the first trial.prior to the second trial,however,gordon designated expert witnesses to testify about matters relating to that claim.by granting nissan motion to strike portions of gordon expert witness disclosure statement relating to the alleged defects in the design of the pathfinder roof,the trial court effectively barred gordon from presenting evidence on the issue.
the order granting nissan motion to strike was reversible error.gordon should have been given an opportunity to present evidence regarding his roof defect claim.further,in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we find that the superior court erroneously refused to give a jury instruction offered by gordon relating to his instability claim.we thus reverse the judgment and remand the case to the superior court with directions to conduct a new trial on both of gordon claims.
factual and procedural background 
the accident 
in the afternoon of june,gordon was driving a nissan pathfinder accompanied by his friend michael slotnick.gordon and slotnick were traveling from colorado to california.after stopping at a gas station,gordon began driving on an to interstate highway in nevada.slotnick asked gordon to check whether the rear driver side window was closed.when gordon turned to do so,he lost sight of the road and allowed the vehicle to veer partially onto the left shoulder of the road.gordon turned the vehicle to the right,then,in order to avoid going off the right side of the road,turned the vehicle to the left again.the vehicle began to spin,then it rolled over.gordon was not wearing his seatbelt.as a result of the accident,gordon sustained spinal injuries and was rendered a paraplegic.
the parties and their respective experts dispute many facts relating to the accident.nissan contends gordon vehicle was traveling miles per hour when gordon veered onto the left shoulder,and miles per hour at the time of the rollover.gordon claims that he was driving miles per hour when the vehicle first left marks on the pavement and miles per hour when the vehicle started to roll over.nissan contends that when gordon turned the vehicle to the left the second time,the vehicle began to travel sideways,then the right rear wheel dug into the asphalt,deeply gouging the pavement and causing the vehicle to roll over two times.although gordon concedes that the vehicle started sliding sideways when he made his second left turn,he contends that the right rear wheel only gouged into the pavement as it was rolling over,and that the vehicle only rolled over once.
the allegations in gordon complaint 
in january,gordon commenced a lawsuit against nissan for strict product liability and other causes of action gordon complaint alleged that the pathfinder he was driving at the time of the accident was defectively designed because of its propensity to roll over.gordon complaint further alleged that the vehicle was defectively designed because its roof and other features did not adequately protect occupants in the event of a collision.
gordon election not to pursue his roof defect claim 
prior to the first trial,gordon elected not to pursue his defective roof claim but instead to pursue only his vehicle stability claim.nissan has characterized this election as an admission that gordon roof defect claim was meritless,and a waiver by gordon of his right to pursue the claim.because the heart of this dispute arises from the scope and effect of gordon election,we will state in detail the way it occurred.
a.the deposition 
at a deposition of one of gordon expert witnesses,the following colloquy took place between nissan counsel mark berry and gordon former counsel daniel dell osso 
berry before we go off the record,dell osso,we spoke at a break about this scenario.it appears to me that i have experts that i do need.
dell osso yes.the issue is whether you need experts to address the issue of roof crush and restraint performance and as you know,having now completed all of plaintiff experts,nobody offering any opinions about roof performance or restraint performance other than,you know,gordon expert,carley ward,describing how the roof comes down to cause injury,so 
berry well,an alternative scenario.
dell osso right,right.exactly.but that has not been articulated necessarily as an issue with the roof per se.so i think we agreed that i have no problem with you withdrawing your experts who were going to talk about roof crush and restraint.
berry and those would be cooper and gratzinger and based on our discussion and your comments just now,my intention would be to go ahead and withdraw them so that you do need to depose them.i think we through.
dell osso okay.
b.the motion in limine 
the second alleged admission by gordon took place at a hearing on one of nissan motions in limine.gordon took the position that his injuries could have been more severe had he been wearing a seat belt during the accident.his expert,ward,conceded that gordon would not have sustained the injuries he received had he been wearing a seatbelt.ward further opined,however,that when a passenger wears a seatbelt during a rollover accident,there is a greater risk of a cervical injury nissan argued that gordon injury were more severe because he was not wearing a seatbelt.in its motion,nissan sought to preclude evidence allegedly supporting gordon position on this issue.at the hearing on the motion,the following exchange took place between the court and gordon counsel 
the court my inclination is to deny the motion and let the evidence come in as to the opinions of what would have happened by way of injuries 
the court i am concerned about this other issue of crash worthiness.i am not suggesting that i approving that evidence regarding crash worthiness be introduced.but i understood from the opposition,dell osso,that that was not your intention.it was simply to show that because the roof crashed in the way it did and that established,then the injury would have been worse if he had his seat belt on.and i think you entitled to do that.
del osso that correct,your honor.we not going to attack the roof in this case.
the court you not going to attack the roof 
del osso sometimes we do in these cases.but it not one in which we do that.
the court okay.so the motion is denied.
the first trial 
in may,the first trial commenced.gordon apparently did not make any arguments or present any expert testimony regarding the alleged defects in the roof design of the pathfinder.in june,after the jury became hopelessly deadlocked,the court declared a mistrial.
gordon designation of experts regarding his roof defect claim 
the superior court then ordered that a second trial commence on february.pursuant to an agreement between counsel for both sides,the parties exchanged supplemental expert disclosures on december.gordon supplemental expert disclosure statement listed five expert caldwell,mariusz ziejewski,daniel thomas,shane richardson,and brian would testify regarding topics relating to gordon roof defect theory.on december,nissan identified robert gratzinger as an expert to address roof crush and crashworthiness issues.both parties had an opportunity to depose expert witnesses identified or for purposes of the second trial.
nissan motion to strike 
on december,nissan filed a motion to strike portions of gordon supplemental expert witness disclosure statement referring to roof performance.nissan argued that gordon waived his roof defect claim and was judicially and equitably estopped from asserting it.on january,the court granted the motion.nissan prepared a notice of the ruling,wherein it stated that the court order granting its motion precluded gordon from introducing evidence on a theory that his injuries were caused by a defective design or unsafe condition of the roof of the subject vehicle.
the second trial 
the second trial was postponed to september.after a trial,the jury returned a verdict in favor of nissan and against gordon,and the court entered judgment thereon.gordon filed a timely notice of appeal.
contentions 
gordon contends that the superior court erroneously granted nissan motion to strike,thereby precluding gordon from pursuing his roof defect theory.he further contends that the court erred by declining to give jury instructions relating to the consumer expectation theory in products liability cases.finally,gordon argues that the judgment should be reversed because a series of evidentiary rulings by the court deprived him of a fair trial.we address the first argument in the published portion of our opinion and the second argument in the unpublished portion.because we grant gordon a new trial based on his first two arguments,we do not reach his third argument.
discussion 
the granting of nissan motion to strike was reversible errora.standard of review 
nissan brought its motion to strike on the ground that the court had the inherent power to strike portions of gordon expert witness disclosure statement.the granting of the motion,as discussed below,had the effect of precluding gordon from introducing evidence relating to his roof defect claim.the standard of review of any ruling by a trial court on the admissibility of evidence is abuse of discretion.city of ripon sweetin th,d.we will review the trial court granting of nissan motion to strike under that standard.
b.the superior court abused its discretion in granting nissan motion to strike 
the effect of an order granting a new trial is to leave the case at large and to place the parties in the same position as if the case had never been tried.saakyan modern auto,th,d guzman superior court th,d guzman sichterman hollingshead,sichterman.the parties are entitled to introduce additional or new evidence not introduced at the earlier trial.guzman,at,d sichterman,at.
in guzman,the court granted the defendant motion for a new trial on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support the plaintiff damages.the court found that no expert witness linked the plaintiff initial arm injury to his subsequent thumb injury.prior to the second trial,the plaintiff moved to augment his expert witness list to include expert witnesses to testify regarding that issue.the trial court denied the motion even though the defendant had ample time to depose the plaintiff new expert witnesses.the court of appeal reversed,holding that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to deny the plaintiff motion.guzman,supra,th at,d.
in sichterman,the plaintiff claimed that he was injured as a result of the defendant negligent operation of an automobile.in the first trial,the plaintiff stated that he did not have knowledge of the speed at which the defendant was driving.the jury returned a verdict in the plaintiff favor but the judgment rendered thereon was reversed on the ground that the evidence failed to show negligence on the part of the defendant.in the second trial,the plaintiff testified that the defendant was driving at an excessive speed.the defendant objected to this testimony on the ground that it was false and fabricated.the court of appeal,however,held that the new evidence and factual claim by the plaintiff was permitted in a new trial.the defendant had an opportunity to impeach the plaintiff with his prior testimony it was up to the jury to decide whether the plaintiff was telling the truth.sichterman,supra.at.
in atchison.ry.superior court cal d,atchison,the plaintiff asserted causes of action based on a federal statute and common law negligence.during the first trial,the plaintiff abandoned his negligence claim.id.at.the jury returned a verdict in the plaintiff favor with respect to his federal statutory claim.the united states supreme court,however,reversed the judgment,holding that as a matter of law there was no violation of the federal statute.id.at.
after the trial court ordered a new trial,the defendant petitioned for a writ of prohibition seeking to prevent a second trial.atchison,supra,cal d at.the california supreme court,however,denied the petition.id.at.in reaching its decision,the court noted that the effect in general of a reversal of a judgment is to set the case at large as if it had never been tried.id.at.the court also recognized that the law favors deciding cases on their merits,and that when a party misconceives his remedy in a first trial,he is not in general precluded from availing himself of the proper remedy in a second trial.ibid.the plaintiff therefore was not prohibited from pursuing,in the second trial,the common law negligence claim which the plaintiff had abandoned during the first trial.id.at.
under these principles,the trial court in this case abused its discretion in granting nissan motion to strike.gordon was entitled to present new expert witness testimony regarding his roof defect claim in the second trial guzman,supra,th at,d,even though he abandoned the claim prior to the first trial atchison,supra,cal d at,and even if the factual basis of his new claim arguably contradicted the facts presented in the first trial sichterman,supra.at.no exceptional circumstances existed that would justify depriving gordon of an opportunity to present his roof defect claim to the jury.gordon complaint set forth the claim,thereby giving nissan fair notice of the claim and ample opportunity to conduct discovery on the claim prior to the first trial nissan also had an opportunity to depose all of gordon expert witnesses regarding the claim before the second trial.
nissan argues that as a result of gordon lawyer statements prior to the first trial,gordon judicially admitted that the roof of the pathfinder was not a cause of his injuries.although statements of counsel may be treated as judicial admissions if they were intended to be such or reasonably construed by the court or the other party as such,such admissions must be clear and unambiguous.people jackson th,d see also zelayeta pacific greyhound lines d.in this case,the statements of gordon counsel,when read in context,simply amounted to an election not pursue his roof defect claim in the first trial.this election was not the same thing as an admission that the claim lacked merit or an admission that the cause of gordon injuries was unrelated to the alleged roof defect.parties often choose not to assert a claim or defense for tactical reasons unrelated to the merits of the claim or the defense.we do not believe that such a tactical choice should bind the plaintiff on retrial.
next,nissan argues that gordon waived his right to pursue his roof defect claim.that was true with respect to the first trial but was not true with the respect to the second.like the plaintiff in atchison,gordon had a right to pursue his roof defect claim in the second trial even though he abandoned that claim prior to the first trial.
finally,nissan argues that gordon was judicially and equitably estopped from pursuing his roof defect claim.the doctrine of judicial estoppel,however,only bars a party from taking two totally inconsistent positions in the course of judicial proceedings.jackson county of los angeles th,d jackson.likewise,a party may invoke equitable estoppel to prevent his opponent from changing positions if he detrimentally relied upon his opponent prior position ibid.here,gordon did not take a position with respect to his roof defect claim during or prior to the first trial.rather,he simply elected not to pursue the claim.gordon therefore was not judicially or equitably estopped from pursuing the claim in the second trial.
gordon made a sufficient offer of proof 
a judgment can not be set aside on the ground that the court erroneously excluded evidence unless the substance,purpose and relevance of the excluded evidence were m
