in a series of four deeds the blackburn,phillips,frazer,and knight deeds,property owners conveyed their interests in the northern corridor of the rail way to seaboard in september.those deeds appear,on their face,to unambiguously convey a fee simple interest to seaboard.after receiving these deeds,seaboard laid track and began to operate trains along the entire corridor as of november.at this time,seaboard had not received any deed corresponding to the southern portion of the rail corridor,but still operated trains along the entire corridor.

in bird bay,the court of federal claims found that the ble deed for the southern portion of the railroad corridor conveyed a fee simple interest to seaboard.in rogers,the court of federal claims similarly held that the blackburn,phillips,frazer,and knight deeds conveyed a fee simple interest to seaboard for the northern portion of the railroad corridor.the court of federal claims concluded,accordingly,that those plaintiffs the present appellants had no compensable property interest for which they could be entitled to compensation upon its taking.
