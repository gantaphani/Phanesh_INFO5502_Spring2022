air transport association of america,ata and regional airline association raa seek review of the federal aviation administration november,interpretation issued by letter of federal aviation regulation,far,and attendant notice of enforcement policy notice entitled flight crewmember flight time limitations and rest requirements,published in the federal register.may.ata contends the letter interpretation and notice are inconsistent with the plain language of far.in addition,ata maintains that the letter interpretation constitutes a substantive change to far and,accordingly,requires rulemaking under the administrative procedure act apa,et.we disagree.
the federal aviation act of,et act,directs the administrator of the federal aviation administration faa to promote safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations in the interest of safety for the maximum hours or periods of service of aircrew and other employees of air carriers.a.the rules issued by the faa under section a of the act are generally referred to as flight time limitations.in,pursuant to rulemaking,the faa promulgated far,establishing flight time limitations and rest requirements for flight crewmembers engaged in air transportation.see flight time limitations and rest requirements.july.while the faa was focused on simplifying scheduling and giving air carriers added scheduling flexibility,it also noted in the notice of proposed rulemaking that the current part rule provides no protection against acute fatigue for crewmembers.see flight time limitations and rest requirements for flight crewmembers,march.the regulation allows a domestic airline certificate holder to schedule,and a crewmember to accept,a flight assignment only if the crewmember total flight time does not exceed yearly,monthly and weekly maximum flight time limitations.a.in addition,the regulation establishes a maximum of eight hours of flight time between required rest periods.a.pursuant to subsection b,during the consecutive hours preceding the scheduled completion of any flight segment,a crewmember must be scheduled for a rest period of at least nine consecutive hours for eight hours or fewer of scheduled flight time ten consecutive hours of rest for more than eight but fewer than nine hours of scheduled flight time and eleven hours of rest for nine or more hours of scheduled flight time.id.b.subsection c,however,allows a carrier a measure of scheduling flexibility by way of a compensatory rest period.a required rest period of nine hours may be scheduled for or reduced to a minimum of hours if the crewmember is given compensatory rest of at least ten hours begin ning no later than hours after the commencement of the reduced rest period.id.c compensatory rest,like required rest under paragraph b,may not be reduced or delayed under any circumstances.see e see also.at if a flight crewmember does not receive the required number of hours of rest,the operator and the flight crewmember are in violation of the regulation 
on september,captain richard rubin,chairman of the flight time committee of the allied pilots association,submitted to the faa several questions regarding far,which questions apparently arose as a result of changes in american airlines pilot reserve system.on november,faa deputy counsel james whitlow responded by letter whitlow letter to rubin questions.the whitlow letter begins by stating that far b requires a minimum of nine consecutive hours of scheduled rest in the hours preceding eight or fewer hours of scheduled flight time.the nine hours rest period may be reduced pursuant to far c to a minimum of eight hours if a minimum of ten hours of compensatory rest begins no later than hours after the commencement of the reduced rest period.more significantly,the whitlow letter provides that is computed by using actual expected flight time and time,based on the specific conditions that exist on the day,to determine the scheduled arrival time for purposes of determining whether a flight should be commenced.whitlow letter at.irrespective of the carrier published flight time,then,scheduled flight time under far should be calculated or recalculated using the actual conditions on the day of departure regardless whether the length of the flight is longer or shorter than the originally scheduled flight time.once this information is calculated,i f it is known,or reasonably should be known,that a flight segment will result in less than eight hours of rest for a particular crew,the flight may not leave the gate.whitlow letter at 
on january,ata petitioned for review of the whitlow letter and raa intervened.four months later,the faa published in the federal register note of its intent to rigorously enforce existing regulations governing flight crewmember rest requirements.notice.at may.the notice incorporated the whitlow letter and advised that,within six months of the date of the notice publication,the faa intended to begin a comprehensive review of flight scheduling practices and to deal stringently with any violations.id.ata and raa then filed separate petitions for review of the notice and.we consolidated for review all three petitions.see july,consolidation order on september,we granted ata motion to stay the notice.
faa interpretation of far 
because the whitlow constitutes the faa interpretation of its own regulation,that interpretation must be afforded substantial deference and upheld unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.thomas jefferson shalala,d see also paralyzed veterans of america arena,cert.denied,d.accordingly,we defer to the faa view unless an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language or by other indications of the agency intent at the time of the regulation promulgation.thomas jefferson,at.at quoting gardebring jenkins,d.ata contends that the whitlow letter,by requiring the recalculation of a previously computed rest period,is inconsistent with both the text and the purpose of far.ata maintains that the phrase scheduled completion of any flight segment in subsection b means that compliance with far turns solely on the legality of the originally established flight schedule irrespective of any unexpected flight delay that may require.see ata blue br.at.the phrase,ata asserts,can not be squared with the whitlow letter,which requires scheduled flight time to take into account actual expected flight time.see whitlow letter at.
the faa responds that the phrase scheduled completion of any flight segment can reasonably be understood to include a flight time based on actual flight conditions.to be sure,scheduled completion can be construed narrowly to refer only to the originally scheduled flight completion time.the point,however,is that the faa more expansive interpretation is not unreasonable.a rescheduled completion of a flight segment based on flight conditions existing in fact is nonetheless a scheduled completion.nothing in the text of far or in the ordinary usage of the word scheduled dictates that the timetable of a particular flight segment can be determined only when the schedule is originally created regardless of adjustments made necessary by conditions.
ata interpretations of subsection b term scheduled rest period and subsection c reference to reduce a scheduled rest are similarly unavailing.its construction of scheduled rest would allow a carrier to set up adequate rest periods in advance and then disregard whether the rest periods in fact occurred in light of actual flight conditions because,under its construction,scheduled rest means rest that is lawfully established at the time of scheduling.ata blue br.at.ata argues that the term refers only to a future rest period and can not justify a retrospective recalculation of rest a crewmember has already taken.even if the semantic point were valid,which we doubt as set forth below,this argument ignores the structure of the regulation itself.under far,all rest requirements flow from the scheduled completion of a particular flight segment.the minimum rest requirements described in subsection b are all keyed to the hour period before the completion is to occur.the required rest mu
