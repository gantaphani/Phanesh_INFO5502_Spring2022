discussion 
applicable law 
we review the granting of a motion for summary judgment de novo.scaria rubin,cir per curiam 
under the act,a company engaging in stevedoring activities must be licensed by the commission and its employees must be registered as longshoremen.unconsol.laws.a stevedore is defined as 
a contractor not including an employee engaged for compensation pursuant to a contract or arrangement with a carrier of freight by water,in moving waterborne freight carried or consigned for carriage by such carrier on vessels of such carrier berthed at piers,on piers at which such vessels are berthed or at other waterfront terminals.
id.emphasis added.this includes contractors who perform labor or services incidental to the movement of waterborne freight on vessels berthed at piers,on piers or at other waterfront terminals,including,but not limited to,cargo storage,cargo repairing,coopering,general maintenance,mechanical and miscellaneous work,horse and cattle fitting,grain ceiling,and marine carpentry.id.b.the term also includes contractors who perform labor or services involving,or incidental to,the movement of freight into or out of containers which have been or which will be carried by a carrier of freight by water on vessels berthed at piers,on piers or at other waterfront terminals.id.c.
further guidance is provided by the commission rulings,which define stevedoring activities to include weighing and scaling,strapping,and sampling at other waterfront terminals.rulings of the waterfront commission of new york harbor on the applicability of the legislative amendments to the waterfront commission act to certain situations the rulings,the rulings also define stevedoring activities to include load ing or unload ing containers with freight which has been carried by a carrier of freight by water within yards of a pier,as well as services performed at deconsolidation stations,at which a business receives containers from piers and terminals and strips cargo from said containers for distribution to consignees.rulings 
an other waterfront terminal is a warehouse,depot or other terminal other than a pier which is located within one thousand yards of any pier in the port of new york district and which is used for waterborne freight in whole or substantial part.unconsol.laws 
application 
continental argues that it was not required to be licensed as a stevedore under the act for its activities at the warehouse because its primary function is regular warehousing,issu ing warehouse receipts,and that any stevedoring activity was incidental to its warehouse function,appellant br.at quoting rulings,and the warehouse is not an other waterfront terminal because it is not located within yards of a pier.we disagree,in both respects.
continental activities 
we conclude that the district court correctly held,as a matter of law,that continental engages in stevedoring activities.
continental provided quintessential stevedoring services under the act,as it provided services incidental to the movement of waterborne freight at other waterfront terminals,unconsol.laws b,and provided services involving,or incidental to,the m
