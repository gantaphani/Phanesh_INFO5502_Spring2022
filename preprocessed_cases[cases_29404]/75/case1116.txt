state law generally preempts local law in the field of traffic control.rumford city of berkeley cal d,a city has no authority over vehicular traffic control unless expressly provided by the legislature.there are exceptions,and this appeal concerns one of those exceptions the legislature has allowed local regulation of tow truck companies and drivers.given that power,san francisco and other cities have adopted permit systems to regulate towing service.the question is whether tow truck companies and drivers must obtain a permit in each jurisdiction in which they tow cars.contrary to the decision reached by the trial court,we conclude san francisco is authorized to regulate only those tow truck companies and drivers who maintain their principal place of business or employment in that city.we also conclude san francisco may collect a fee or fees to cover the cost of that regulation.
background 
san francisco tow truck regulatory scheme 
the city and county of san francisco the city or san francisco requires both tow truck drivers and tow truck companies to obtain permits to tow cars in the city.the permit requirements are found in the city police code.police code.the code requires tow truck drivers to complete a permit application that requests personal,employment and license information.the applicant is also required to provide information on all criminal offenses for which he or she has been arrested,a complete set of fingerprints,and a current photograph,subd,subds.b,c.the applicant must pay a filing fee and a fingerprinting fee,subds.a,e.
the chief of police will grant the application unless the applicant has been convicted of certain crimes within the prior four years.police code,subd.a.those crimes include burglary,robbery,theft,receipt of stolen property,breaking or removing parts from a vehicle,malicious mischief to a vehicle,unlawful use or tampering by the bailee of a vehicle,or altering a vehicle identification number.ibid.the application may also be denied if the applicant has acted in violation of the criminal statutes for the preceding crimes,subd.b.finally,the chief may deny the application if the driver intentionally falsified any statement in the application,subd.c.
the owner or owners of a tow car firm are required to prepare an application and submit information similar to that provided by drivers,including fingerprints and current photographs police code,subd.the applicant must also provide a description of the firm business operations and information regarding its vehicles,employees,and insurance,subds.the chief of police will grant the application unless the firm does not possess a minimum amount of liability insurance or the requisite equipment or facilities to protect towed vehicles,subds.an owner conviction for any one of several serious crimes can also disqualify the firm from obtaining a permit,as will falsifying any statement or omitting information from the application,subds.finally,the firm must possess a bank credit card machine,subd.
the towing firm must pay a filing fee with its application.police code,subd.if the firm obtains a permit,it must pay a license fee based on the number of trucks used in the business.the permit must be renewed and the license fee paid annually.
the city imposes various requirements on permitted towing firms,including reporting tows from private property to city authorities within minutes of the tow,maintaining records for each tow,and notifying the police of any changes in vehicles or drivers.police code.the firm must also make available a brochure prepared by the police department that summarizes california law on the rights and responsibilities of vehicle owners,tow operators,and real property owners with respect to tows from private property,subds.c,d.
a permit may be revoked.the chief of police shall revoke a driver permit if after a hearing on the matter he finds that grounds exist which would have constituted just cause for refusal to issue such a permit.police code.a firm permit may be revoked for a host of reasons,including criminal convictions,improper or excessive tow or storage charges,improper tows,failure to maintain required insurance,or the employment of drivers who do not possess a valid permit.
towing vehicles without a permit is a misdemeanor.police code.
b.the challenge to the permit system 
the california tow truck association the association represents more than towing companies doing business in california.the association filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the city tow truck regulatory scheme.the association alleged the permit system was preempted by federal and state law,and that all or part of the system was unconstitutional.with respect to the state preemption claim,the association alleged preemption by provisions in the vehicle code and the revenue and taxation code.the association sought a permanent injunction prohibiting the city from enforcing the permit system.
the city removed the case to federal court,where litigation of the federal preemption and constitutional issues resulted in nearly all of the provisions of the permit system surviving the association challenge.see.tow truck ass city of san francisco ca tow truck ass city cty.of san francisco d.the federal district court,however,remanded the state preemption issues back to the state court.california tow truck ass city county of san francisco wl.
on remand,the association and the city filed for judgment on the pleadings.the trial court denied the association motion and granted the city motion.the trial court concluded san francisco permit system was not preempted by state law so long as the city applied the scheme only to those drivers and firms that conduct substantial or consequential business in san francisco.the court offered the association an opportunity to amend its complaint to allege the towing permit scheme is being applied to drivers and firms that perform minimal or transitory work in the city.the court provided no analysis of the association tax preemption claim,but offered the association the opportunity to amend its complaint to allege the permit fees were impermissible taxes.the association apparently chose not to amend its pleadings.the court therefore entered judgment in favor of the city.

state regulation of tow truck service 
cities and counties may make and enforce ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.cal.const.art.xi.local legislation that conflicts with state law,however,is void.city of riverside inland empire patients health wellness center,cal th.a conflict exists when local legislation duplicates,contradicts,or enters an area fully occupied by state law.ibid.
the state has expressly manifested an intent to occupy fully the subject matter governed by the vehicle code except as otherwise expressly provided,the provisions of this code are applicable and uniform throughout the state and in all counties and municipalities therein,and a local authority shall not enact or enforce any ordinance or resolution on the matters covered by this code,including ordinances or resolutions that establish regulations or procedures for,or assess a fine,penalty,assessment,or fee for a violation of,matters covered by this code,unless expressly authorized by this code,subd.a.
the state regulates tow truck service through a variety of vehicle code provisions.see,subd.a defining tow truck record keeping requirements for vehicle storage towing service shall not pay commission or compensation for arranging tow stopping on highway and soliciting of services at scene of accident charges for tow or storage and required notice to vehicle owner requiring acceptance of cash or credit card for payment of towing and storage towing vehicle from private property lamp requirements warning lights required equipment towing requirements.
notwithstanding the state involvement in regulating tow truck service,the legislature has expressly permitted local authorities to license and regulate the operation of tow truck service or tow truck drivers whose principal place of business or employment is within the jurisdiction of the local authority,subd.g.there is no dispute here that the city can regulate some tow service.the question is whether all tow truck companies and drivers with substantial operations in the city are subject to the city permit system,or whether only those tow truck operators who have their principal place of business or employment in san francisco are subject to the regulations.
principal place of business or employment 
the trial court concluded that principal place of business or employment meant companies and drivers who conduct substantial or consequential business within the jurisdiction san francisco.the association contends the trial court interpretation has no basis in the statutory text and is incapable of meaningful definition.the association argues the language of subdivision g of section is plain and unambiguous,and that the city permit system,which is not limited to companies and drivers whose principal place of business or employment is within san francisco,exceeds the limited authority granted by the legislature.
our fundamental task in interpreting a statute is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.we first examine the statutory language,giving it a plain and commonsense meaning.we do not examine that language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.if the language is clear,courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intend.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th.
there is no doubt the legislature intended vigorous local regulation of tow truck service.subdivision g of section provides the legislature finds that the safety and welfare of the general public is promoted by permitting local authorities to regulate tow truck service companies and operators by requiring licensure,insurance,and proper training in the safe operation of towing equipment,thereby ensuring against towing mistakes that may lead to violent confrontation,stranding motorists in dangerous situations,impeding the expedited vehicle recovery,and wasting state and local law enforcement limited resources.we agree with the association,however,that the legislature,through the use of the phrase principal place of business or employment,in section,subdivision g,intended that the regulation come from a single local jurisdiction.
the city contends the legislature intended to allow any jurisdiction where a company does a substantial amount of business to impose a permit system on that company.the city acknowledges that in many contexts a company can have only one principal place of business,but claims this is not always so,citing clinical leasing service,cir clinical leasing service as an example.but that decision,if relevant at all,supports the association not the city arguments.
clinical leasing service involved the federal government regulation of medical providers dispensing controlled substances.every person distributing controlled substances is required to register annually with the united states attorney general.a separate registration is required at each principal place of business,subd.e.the circuit court concluded it was evident from the plain language of the statute that a physician must separately register at each physical location from which a controlled substance was dispensed.clinical leasing service,supra,at.
there is no qualifying language such as each or separate in section,subdivision g.nothing in the subdivision suggests the legislature intended that tow truck firms or drivers would have to obtain a permit in each and every separate jurisdiction in which they do business.it would have been simple enough for the legislature to give local authorities the power to regulate tow truck service operating within the jurisdiction of a city or county.for example,government code,section,which provides for local regulation of taxicab service,applies to service which is operated within the jurisdiction of the city or county,subd.a.section,in contrast,provides for local regulation of tow truck services or tow truck drivers if their principal place of business or employment is within the jurisdiction of the local authority.
we also agree with the association that the city proposed test for permitting regulation under the statute,doing substantial business in the jurisdiction,does not provide a meaningful standard.in describing this proposed standard,the city itself refers to towing companies routinely doing business in a city or companies regularly doing business in san francisco by towing multiple vehicles per day in san francisco or companies planning to respond to towing calls from san francisco.these varied formulations reflect the difficulties in defining substantial business and also do not relate to or comport with the statutory language of principal place of business or employment.
the city concedes section,subdivision g,viewed in isolation,could be construed as imposing the limitation the association urges.the city contends,however,that this construction would lead to absurd results.see coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles,supra,cal th at courts will follow plain meaning unless literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences.according to the city,tow truck companies would simply set up their headquarters in neighboring jurisdictions with no tow service regulation,while operating primarily in a jurisdiction that has adopted ordinances regulating tow trucks,thus vitiating the entire purpose of the statute.relying on the legislature statement in support of local regulation section,subd.g,and the legislative history for that subdivision,expressing concern over abusive practices by tow companies the city argues that section is best construed as authorizing local regulation by any jurisdiction where the tow service does a substantial amount of business.the city also cites cases that demonstrate the real harm citizens can suffer at the hands of tow truck operators.see people ex.rel.renne servantes th,porter city of atlanta.
the association,for its part,points out that the cost of obtaining permits in multiple jurisdictions could become unduly burdensome.in san francisco,for example,the city requires a filing fee and fingerprinting fee for both tow firm and driver permit applications.police code.the city then requires an annual license fee to maintain a permit.a towing company license fee is calculated based on the number of trucks it operates.according to the association,even a small towing company could incur thousands of dollars in filing fees and annual licensing fees.the association also discounts the city fears of tow truck operators fleeing to neighboring cities to avoid regulation.it argues that towing businesses already located in san francisco are unlikely to relocate,en masse,and that firms operating under local permits by the city would have a competitive advantage in securing business within the city.
we do not discount the city apprehension.the city representation that some of its neighboring jurisdictions impose no regulations on tow truck businesses is a legitimate concern.of course,towing companies located in jurisdictions with no local regulations are still subject to the provisions of the vehicle code regulating their practices and providing penalties for miscondu
