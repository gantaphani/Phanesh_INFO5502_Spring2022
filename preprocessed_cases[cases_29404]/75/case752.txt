south coast air quality management district the district is a political subdivision of the state of california responsible for air pollution control in the south coast air basin the basin,an area comprising the city of los angeles and portions of surrounding counties.in,the district enacted six fleet rules that require operators of various kinds of vehicle as street sweepers,garbage trucks,and airport choose vehicles meeting specified emissions standards or containing specified engines when adding to their fleets.some provisions of the fleet rules apply to state and local governmental agencies others apply to federal governmental agencies and to private fleet operators.after a remand by the supreme court,we consider for the second time whether these fleet rules are preempted by the federal clean air act caa,et.
we have jurisdiction under.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,including its preemption analysis.see chamber of commerce lockyer,cir en banc.we affirm the district court in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the basin is the only area in the united states classified by the environmental protection agency as an extreme nonattainment area for ozone.it is one of only five areas designated as a serious area for small particulate matter.see a,b.
the district is charged with developing and implementing strategies to meet air quality standards within the basin.see cal.health safety code.california health and safety code,adopted in,authorizes the district to adopt regulations that 
r equire operators of public and commercial fleet vehicles,consisting of or more vehicles under a single owner or lessee and operating substantially in the south coast district,when adding vehicles to or replacing vehicles in an existing fleet or purchasing vehicles to form a new fleet,to purchase vehicles which are capable of operating on methanol or other equivalently clean burning alternative fuel and to require that these vehicles be operated,to the maximum extent feasible,on the alternative fuel when operating in the south coast district.
between june and october,the district adopted six rules the fleet rules or rules pursuant to.each rule applies only to fleet operators of or more vehicles.the rules variously refer to purchasing,procuring,leasing,and contracting for vehicles and appear to use the terms purchasing and procuring interchangeably.in order to be as clear as possible in our holding,and at the risk of awkward repetition,we adhere to the rules terminology throughout this opinion.
fleet rule applies to fleet operators of street sweepers when purchasing or leasing these vehicles for sweeping operations undertaken by or for governments or governmental agencies in the jurisdiction of the district.the rule applies to any federal,state,county,city or governmental department or agency,and any special district such as water,air,sanitation,transit,and school districts hereinafter,public fleets and any private individual firm,association,franchise,contractor,user or owner who provides sweeping services to a governmental agency hereinafter,private fleets with public contracts.when purchasing or leasing street sweepers,these fleet operators must acquire or otherwise sweepers.an sweeper is one with engine s that use compressed or liquefied natural gas,liquefied petroleum gas propane,methanol,electricity,or fuel cells,and h and technologies that use diesel fuel are not considered technologies for the purposes of the rule.fleet operators may obtain a waiver from the rule requirement if they demonstrate the technical infeasibility of complying either because no such sweepers are commercially available,or because a fueling station for sweepers is not available within five miles of the vehicle storage or maintenance yards.rule also requires government agencies that contract for sweeping services to contract for sweeping services that use sweepers if possible.
fleet rule applies to public fleets located in the basin.it requires passenger car,truck,or vehicle fleet operators to acquire gasoline or vehicles when procuring or leasing these vehicles in the district.the rule defines compliant vehicles by reference to emissions standards for vehicles set by the california air resources board carb pursuant to california preemption waivers under b of the clean air act discussed in greater detail below.the rule contains various exemptions,including an exemption for emergency vehicles.the rule also allows the public fleets to continue to purchase vehicles by offsetting those purchases with purchases of low emission vehicles.the rule does not apply to p rivately owned or operated fleets that provide contract services to a public agency.
fleet rule applies to fleets of public transit vehicle s or urban buses,operated by government agencies or operated by private entities under contract to government agencies.when procuring or leasing vehicles,these fleet operators must choose vehicles,defined as vehicles that use compressed or liquified natural gas,propane,methanol,electricity,fuel cells,or other advanced technologies that do not rely on diesel fuel,and that meet the emissions requirements of the urban transit bus rule adopted by carb.the rule contains various exemptions,including for buses not used for the express purpose of public transportation and for buses used for the express purpose of providing service.
fleet rule applies to both public and private fleets of garbage trucks,regardless of whether the private fleets are under public contract.the rule requires the fleet operators to acquire refuse collection vehicles when procuring or leasing these vehicles and defines vehicles in the same manner as in rule.the rule allows purchases of vehicles relying on both diesel and alternative fuels for certain purposes,and operators are exempt from the rule,inter alia,when no engine is available commercially or could be used.
fleet rule applies to public and private airport transportation fleets,also regardless of whether the private fleets are under public contract.the affected vehicles include taxis,limousines,commercial shuttles,and courtesy shuttle transportation such as those provided by rental agencies and hotels.when procuring,purchasing,or leasing vehicles,fleet operators using passenger cars or vehicles for airport transportation must acquire a specified percentage of vehicles that meet carb standards for vehicles.fleet operators purchasing and leasing vehicles must acquire vehicles,defined as vehicles not powered by gasoline or diesel fuel.the rule also contains various exceptions,including exemptions where no such vehicles are available or could be used and for taxi fleets if the district has not provided sufficient funding to fully offset the purchase cost less paid by the airport fleet operator.
fleet rule requires public fleet operators of vehicles to acquire mostly or vehicles when procuring,purchasing,or leasing vehicles.vehicle is defined in the same manner as in rules,and.a vehicle is defined as a vehicle equipped with a diesel engine that uses an alternative fuel such as compressed or liquefied natural gas,liquefied petroleum gas,methanol,or other advanced technologies in combination with diesel fuel to enable compression ignition.among other exceptions,the rule does not apply to emergency and rescue vehicles,private fleets with public contracts,and m ilitary vehicles used for tactical operations.in addition,every fleet operator may have as part of the fleet a certain number of dedicated gasoline vehicles not meeting these standards depending on the size of the fleet.
each rule provides that a fleet operator must produce records proving compliance with the rules upon request from the district.each rule also contains a severability provision stating that if any part of the rule is held invalid in a court order,that order shall not affect the validity of the remainder of the rule.
soon after the adoption of the fleet rules in,the engine manufacturers association ema brought suit in federal district court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the rules.ema first amended complaint claimed that the rules were state emissions standards entirely by a and of the clean air act.see caa a,a no state or any political subdivision thereof shall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines subject to this part.caa b,id.b providing an exception to preemption under a whereby the state of california can obtain a preemption waiver from the epa to promulgate its own emissions standards caa,id.providing that other states may adopt the standards promulgated by california pursuant to b,but that the other states standards must be identical to california.
ema named as defendants the district,its board members,and its executive director.the western states petroleum association intervened as a plaintiff hereinafter,together with ema,appellants.various environmental organizations intervened as defendants coalition for clean air,natural resources defense council,communities for a better environment,planning and conservation league and sierra club hereinafter included by reference to the district.
the district court granted summary judgment to the district.d.the court held that the rules were not preempted by a and because they did not compel manufacturers to meet new emissions standards rather,they merely compelled fleet operators to purchase vehicles from within classes of vehicles conforming to extant california standards lawfully promulgated pursuant to waivers of a preemption under b.id.at the fleet rules accept as given the existing carb vehicle standards they merely require fleet operators to choose from among the least polluting of,available vehicles.id.at.this court affirmed in a published order adopting the district court reasoning,cir.
the supreme court reversed.it rejected the argument that the rules escape d under a because they address the purchase of vehicles,rather than their manufacture or sale.engine mfrs.ass south coast air quality management,d.the court held that efforts that are proscribed by can be directed to manufacturers or purchasers.id.at.however,the court did not decide whether the rules were actually preempted.see id.at.the court stated that it was likely that at least certain aspects of the fleet rules are,but allowed that i t does not necessarily follow that the fleet rules are in toto.id.the court therefore remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.
on remand in the district court,appellants brought a motion for order implementing the supreme court decision requesting declaratory and injunctive relief on the ground that the rules were preempted in their entirety.on may,the district court denied appellants motion.the court held that appellants had brought an unsuccessful facial challenge because they had not carried their burden of showing that all applications of the fleet rules were preempted.specifically,the court held that the fleet rules were not preempted as applied to state and local governmental entities.according to the court,those applications of the rules directed state proprietary action and were therefore protected from clean air act preemption under the market participant doctrine.because the facial challenge failed,the district court declined to address the validity of other applications of the rules.
appellants then moved in the district court for a judgment under federal rule of civil procedure c.they sought a declaratory judgment that rules,and were invalid as applied to federal agencies and to private fleet operators purchases of new vehicles,and sought an injunction against enforcement of those provisions appellants contended that they were entitled to such a judgment based on the district failure to defend those applications of the rules in their briefing in the district court on appellants motion to implement the supreme court decision.on september,the district court denied the motion,noting that since appellants were not the party in whose favor the judgment was rendered,they were not entitled to a judgment under rule c.c.
finally,appellants moved in the district court for entry of final judgment under federal rule of civil procedure in accordance with the court orders of may and september.on october,the district court entered a final judgment dismissing appellants suit with prejudice for the reasons given in its order of may.appellants timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
appellants contend that the district court made two errors.first,they contend that the district court erred in holding that the market participant doctrine saved any applications of the rules from preemption.second,they contend that,even if the rules are not preempted as applied to state and local government entities,the district court erred in dismissing appellants suit rather than determining which applications were and which were not.
we affirm the district court holding that the clean air act does not preempt the fleet rules insofar as they direct the procurement behavior of state and local governmental entities.however,we agree with appellants second contention and remand to the district court for further proceedings to determine which,if any,of the rules other provisions are

market participant doctrine 
the market participant doctrine distinguishes between a state role as a regulator,on the one hand,and its role as a market participant,on the other.actions taken by a state or its subdivision as a market participant are generally protected from federal preemption.the doctrine was originally developed in a series of dormant commerce clause cases.in hughes alexandria scrap,d,the supreme court held that maryland did not violate the commerce clause by favoring processors of scrap metal when participating in the market for scrap metal.id.at.subsequently,in reeves,stake,d,the court held that south dakota,as a seller of cement,was free to discriminate in a time of shortage by selling cement only to users.the court was moved by considerations of state sovereignty,the role of each state as guardian and trustee for its people,and the long recognized right of trader or manufacturer,engaged in an entirely private business,freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.id.at.footnotes,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.suggests that,when acting as proprietors,states should similarly share existing freedoms from federal constraints,including the inherent limits of the commerce clause.id.at.the court stated that in market participant cases,courts undertake a single inquiry whether the challenged program constituted direct state participation in the market.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted accord white.council of constr.employers,d citing reeves single inquiry in upholding executive order requiring all boston construction projects funded by city funds to be performed by work forces of at least half city residents.
after the development of the market participant doctrine in these dormant commerce clause cases,the supreme court and the lower federal courts have applied the doctrine to protect proprietary state action from preemption by various federal statutes.see,building constr.trades council associated builders contractors boston harbor,d national labor relations act tocher,at federal aviation administration authorization act of faaa associated contractors metro.water,cir employee retirement income security act of.
in the statutory preemption context,the market participant doctrine is based on the proposition that doctrines apply only to state regulation.boston harbor,at.not all actions by state or local government entities constitute regulation,for such an entity,like a private person,may buy and sell or own and manage property in the marketplace.sprint spectrum mills,cir.thus,even where a federal statute state regulation in an area,state action in that area is not preempted so long as it is proprietary rather than regulatory.the supreme court has stated the rule in the negative in the absence of any express or implied indication by congress that a state may not manage its own property when it pursues its purely proprietary interests,and where analogous private conduct would be permitted,this court will not infer such a restriction.boston harbor,at.
in considering the scope of the market participant doctrine for purposes of preemption under the national labor relations act,we have adopted the fifth circuit test for distinguishing proprietary from regulatory action.in lockyer,we held that state action qualifies as proprietary in either of two circumstances.first,state action is proprietary if it essentially reflect s the governmental entity own interest in its efficient procurement of needed goods and services,as measured by comparison with the typical behavior of private parties in similar circumstances.at quoting cardinal towing,at.in these circumstances,the market participant doctrine protects comprehensive state policies with wide application from preemption,so long as the type of state action is essentially proprietary.id.second,state action is proprietary if the narrow scope of the challenged action defeat s an inference that its primary goal was to encourage a general policy rather than address a specific proprietary problem.id.quoting cardinal towing,at.thus,the doctrine also protects narrow spending decisions that do not necessarily reflect a state interest in the efficient procurement of goods or services,but that also lack the effect of broader social regulation.id.
along with three other circuits,we have held that the market participant doctrine protection of state proprietary action includes proprietary action by states political subdivisions.big country foods,bd.of,cir accord solid waste mgmt.ass williams,cir smith setzer sons,procurement review panel,cir trojan,pennsylvania,cir see also city of columbus,at.the principle is well settled that local governmental units are created as convenient agencies for exercising such of the governmental powers of the state as may be entrusted to them in its absolute discretion.quoting.pub.intervenor mortier,d constr.trades dep t,allbaugh,upholding under market participant doctrine a rule prohibiting federal agencies and entities receiving federal construction funds from requiring contractors to enter,or prohibiting them from entering,project labor agreements id.at t here is simply no logical justification for holding that if an executive order establishes a consistent practice regarding the use of such labor agreements,it is regulatory even though the only decision governed by the executive order are those that the federal government makes as a market participant.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.but see window bernardi,cir as amended holding that state regulation did not fall within market participant exception because it was not limited to the state contracts,but also included those of local government entities.
the central question presented in this appeal is whether the clean air act preempts the fleet rules insofar as they apply to state and local government entities.the answer turns on the applicability and scope of the market participant doctrine as it relates to preemption under the act.because the market participant doctrine is not a wholly freestanding doctrine,but rather a presumption about congressional intent,the doctrine may have a different scope under different federal statutes.it is possible that some aspects of the doctrine have a constitutional dimension,protecting certain sovereign actions of the states from unconstitutional interference by the federal government.league of cities usery,d,overruled by garcia san antonio metro.transit,d.but we need not pursue the constitutional issue here,the precise scope of the market participant doctrine under the clean air are presented with a statutory question under the act rather than a constitutional question under the tenth amendment.
market participant doctrine under the clean air act 
the district court decision in this case appears to be the first of any court to analyze the market participant doctrine under the federal clean air act.because congressional intent is the key to preemption analysis,we must consider whether the act contains any express or implied indication by congress that the presumption embodied by the market participant doctrine should not apply to preemption under the act.boston harbor,at.
the clean air act largely preserves the traditional role of the states in preventing air pollution.exxon mobil epa,cir air pollution prevention falls under the broad police powers of the states,which include the power to protect the health of citizens in the state.as we have previously noted,t he overriding purpose of the clean air act is to force the states to do their job in regulating air pollution effectively so as to achieve baseline air quality standards,the national ambient air quality standards naaqs.id.emphasis added see also a.indeed,the act congressional findings state that air pollution prevention that is,the reduction or elimination,through any measures,of the amount of pollutants produced or created at the source and air pollution control at its source is the primary responsibility of states and local governments.a.
states discharge their primary responsibility for attaining and maintaining the naaqs through their state implementation plans sips.see id.the section of the act concerning sips reaffirms the primary responsibility of the states each state shall have the primary responsibility for assuring air quality within the entire geographic area comprising such state by submitting an implementation plan for such state which will specify the manner in which national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards will be achieved and maintained within each air quality control region in such state.id.a.
the act also contains a provision titled retention of state authority.id.that section provides that,with certain exceptions,nothing in this chapter shall preclude or deny the right of any state or political subdivision thereof to adopt or enforce any standard or limitation respecting emissions of air pollutants or any requirement respecting control or abatement of air pollution.id.
appellants concede,and we agree,that the market participation doctrine applies to preemption under a and of the clean air act.neither of these two provisions indicates that congress intended to extend the provisions reach to preempt state proprietary action.
section a provides,in its entirety 
no state or any political subdivision thereof shall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines subject to this part.no state shall require certification,inspection,or any other approval relating to the control of emissions from any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine as condition precedent to the initial retail sale,titling if any,or registration of such motor vehicle,motor vehicle engine,or equipment.
section a prevents a state absent a waiver granted to the state of california under b from imposing emissions standards more stringent than or otherwise different from the federal standards.however,the section contains nothing to indicate a congressional intent to bar states from choosing to use their own money to acquire or use vehicles that exceed the federal standards.inferring such a limit on state proprietary action would run afoul of the presumption articulated in boston harbor,at.it would also run afoul of the clean air act express reservation to the states of primary authority over and responsibility for controlling air pollution.
section is a corollary to b of the act.section b provides that the epa shall grant the state of california a waiver from a preemption to adopt and enforce its own emission standards,provided that california has determined that the standards are,in the aggregate,at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable federal standards.id.b see also motor equip.mfrs.ass n,epa,as amended discussing the history and purpose of b am.auto.mfrs.ass cahill,cir describing the standards california has promulgated under b waivers,codified at regs.tit,et section provides that states other than california may require that vehicles sold in their state comply with standards that are identical to the california standards for which a waiver has been granted under b for such model year.like a,contains no language impliedly or expressly limiting states proprietary action,and we decline to infer such a limit for the reasons just stated regarding a.
an amicus,the los angeles taxi industry lati,argues that the market participation doctrine does not apply to preemption analysis under any section of the clean air act.another amicus,the american automotive leasing association aala,argues that of the act preempts the fleet rules even as they apply to state and local governments.generally,we do not consider on appeal an issue raised only by an amicus.chaker crogan,cir quoting swan peterson,cir.however,because the central question in this case is the applicability and scope of the market participant exception under the clean air act,and because there are ready answers,we respond to lati and aala arguments.
lati argues that the market participant doctrine is not applicable to preemption analysis under the clean air act based on our suggestion in dictum in hydrostorage,cal.boilermakers local joint apprenticeship,cir,that the market participant doctrine does not exist outside the dormant commerce clause context.we have since acknowledged,however,that our dictum in hydrostorage was not the product of deep consideration,given that in hydrostorage we held that the action was regulatory rather than proprietary.associated contractors,at.moreover,as we have also noted,our dictum was abrogated by boston harbor,which applied the market participant doctrine to preemption under the nrla.id.citing boston harbor.lati asserts that boston harbor is distinguishable because it did not involve express preemption.however,boston harbor does not support a distinction between express and other forms of preemption.boston harbor holds that the court will not infer preemption of proprietary action unless congress indicat es that a state may not manage its own property when it pursues its purely proprietary interests.at.lati does not point us to any such indication by congress in the clean air act.see also tocher,at holding that market participant doctrine protected portion of a city ordinance from express preemption by c.
aala argues that of the clean air act,precludes application of the market participant doctrine.section requires that states with certain nonattainment areas adopt specified rules for centrally fueled fleets as part of their sips.section does not mention fleets,but under definitions covered fleets include both private and fleets.see,e.aala does not argue that adhering to the fleet rules in procuring vehicles would cause state and local entities to fail to meet fleet standards.rather,aala argues that the rules conflict with because,under sips promulgated by a state pursuant to,a fleet operator shall have the choice of vehicles and clean alternative fuels,id.d,whereas the rules preclude fleet operators from making that choice.this conflict between and the fleet rules might support a holding that the rules are preempted as applied to private fleet operators.however,it does not support a holding that the a and preempt the rules as applied to state and local governments acting in their capacities as fleet operators.the requirement that a state sip give fleet operators a choice among fuels and vehicles is entirely consistent with the state own ability to choose to purchase particular fuels and vehicles in its proprietary capacity as a fleet operator.
we therefore conclude that a,and of the clean air act do not contain any express or implied indication of congressional intent that they should extend to state proprietary action.
scope and application of the doctrine 
appellants contend that even though the market participant doctrine protects a state proprietary action from clean air act preemption,the doctrine does not protect the fleet rules.according to appellants,all of the fleet rules provisions constitute regulatory rather than proprietary action under either of lockyer two categories of state proprietary action 
as an initial matter,we note that our analysis in lockyer addressed the market participant doctrine in the context of preemption by the national labor relations act nlra.while the clean air act expressly reserves to the states their traditional police powers in regulating pollution except in a few limited areas of express preemption,the nlra preempts broad swaths of state labor regulation.compare exxon mobil,at,with boston harbor,at.describing the nlra preemption doctrines prohibit ing state regulation even of activities that the nlra only arguably protects or prohibits and of areas that congress left to be controlled by the free play of economic forces internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.due regard for congressional intent requires that we not mechanically apply our market participant analysis in lockyer to preemption analyses of federal statutes other than the nlra.depending on congress intent,another statute might require us to employ a definition of protected state proprietary action different from the two definitions adopted in lockyer for purposes of preemption under the nlra.
nevertheless,in the case before us,we need not consider other possible definitions of proprietary action,for the fleet rule provisions governing purchasing,procuring,leasing,and contracting for the use of vehicles by state and local governmental entities fall squarely within lockyer first category of state proprietary action.that is,these provisions essentially reflect the state entity own interest in its efficient procurement of needed goods and services,as measured by comparison with the typical behavior of private parties in similar circumstances.lockyer,at quoting cardinal towing,at.
as described in greater detail above,fleet rule directs state and local government entities to meet certain criteria when purchasing or leasing street sweepers and,if feasible to do so,when contracting for use of street sweepers rule directs the same state entities to choose vehicles that meet certain criteria when procuring or leasing cars,trucks,and vehicles rule directs them to meet certain criteria when procuring or leasing vehicles for public transit fleets rule directs them to meet certain criteria when procuring or leasing solid waste collection vehicles rule directs them to meet certain criteria when procuring,purchasing,or leasing vehicles for transportation providing ground access to airports and rule directs them to meet certain criteria when procuring,purchasing,or leasing vehicles.
we conclude that these provisions directing state and local governmental entities to purchase,procure,lease,or contract for use of vehicles meeting specified air pollution criteria constitute direct state participation in the market.we so conclude even though not only the state,but also some of its political subdivisions,are directed to take these actions.see big country foods,at a state should not be penalized for exercising its power through smaller,localized units local control fosters both administrative efficiency and democratic governance.
appellants object to this conclusion on three grounds.first,they contend that the fleet rules are not concerned with efficient procurement within the meaning of lockyer,at,because the rules purpose is to reduce air pollution.appellants point to the legislative history of the statute pursuant to which the rules were adopted,california health safety code,which makes this purpose clear.we do not regard this purpose as fatal to the rules.that a state or local governmental entity may have policy goals that it seeks to further through its participation in the market does not preclude the doctrine application,so long as the action in question is the state own market participation.see,alexandria scrap,at.maryland entered the market for the purpose,agreed by all to be commendable as well as legitimate,of protecting the state environment.as the means of furthering this purpose,it elected the payment of state funds in the form of bounties to encourage the removal of automobile hulks from maryland streets and.boston harbor,at.upholding against an nlra preemption challenge a requirement that all contractors on a public construction project adhere to a labor agreement and noting that the court had not held in.dep t of,labor human relations gould,d,that purchasing decisions may never be influenced by labor considerations big country foods,at upholding alaska statute requiring school districts to pay up to percent more for milk in order to purchase milk rather than milk see also.chapter of associated builders contractors,lavin,cir federal preemption doctrine evaluates what legislation does,not why legislators voted for it or what political coalition led to its enactment.id.noting that in boston harbor,boston wanted to clean up its harbor,but there can be little doubt that it also wanted to shower benefits on workers who were the incumbents political supporters gould,at.holding that wisconsin law prohibiting state procurement agents from purchasing products from repeat nlra violators was not protected by the market participant doctrine because the statute function ed unambiguously as a supplemental sanction for violations of the nlra rather than as state proprietary action lockyer,at holding state action not proprietary where statute placed spending restrictions related to labor organizing on all private employers receiving more than in state funds.
in arguing that the fleet rules are not concerned with efficient procurement by state and local governments within the meaning of lockyer,appellants read the word efficient too narrowly.efficient does not merely mean cheap.in context,efficient procurement means procurement that serves the state may include purposes other than saving as private entities serve their purposes by taking into account factors other than price in their procurement decisions.see boston harbor,at.to the extent that a private purchaser may choose a contractor based upon that contractor willingness to enter into a prehire agreement,a public entity as purchaser should be permitted to do the same.see also id.at.comparing state labor agreement to private construction firms agreements.
tellingly,appellants do not argue that the fleet rules fall outside lockyer first definition of state proprietary action on the ground that private fleet operators do not take air pollution concerns into account when making their procurement decisions.such an argument would be contradicted by evidence presented in this case that two prominent private fleet owners,fedex and ups,have,for their own purposes,adopted programs to introduce vehicles into their fleets.there is therefore no basis for concluding that purchasing vehicles is not a purpose that a state may pursue as a market participant.
second,appellants contend that the fleet rules do not constitute proprietary action because they do not control the disposition of any state funds or property.that is,the rules direct not how the state of california shall spend its own money,but rather how political subdivisions of the state shall spend their money.this argument is largely foreclosed by big country foods,in which we held that the market participant doctrine saved from a dormant commerce clause challenge an alaska statute that directed the purchase of milk by local school districts.at.there,we rejected an analogous argument that the market participant doctrine did not apply because,although alaskan school districts entered into the milk contracts,federal funds ultimately paid for the milk federal funds provide the wherewithal to make the milk purchases,but it is alaska that is the direct participant in the market.accordingly,the market participant exception applies.id.at.in so holding,we rejected what we saw as strong public policy arguments to the contrary,because such arguments extend the debate beyond the single inquiry the supreme court demands whether the challenged program constituted direct state participation in the market.id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting white,at.quoting reeves,at.see also cardinal towing,at holding doctrine protected towing ordinance from faaa preemption where ordinance governed city contracts for nonconsensual towing services ultimately paid for by the people whose cars were towed.
like alaska milk ordinance,the fleet rules constitute direct state participation in the market.the rules are a state directive determining which vehicles the state and its political subdivisions will procure.while it is true that the local governments may spend their own money rather than the state in complying with the rules,this fact is not inconsistent with the doctrine.appellants do not contend that the state of california lacks the power under state law to compel its political subdivisions to purchase particular vehicles and to spend local funds in so doing.we can not discern any reason why the market participant doctrine should not apply merely because the state,which has the legal right under state law to direct the actions of local governments,directs the expenditure of local rather than state funds 
third,appellants contend that the fleet rules are regulatory rather than proprietary because they are enforceable by criminal sanctions and fines.however,appellants do not explain why such enforcement provisions preclude the application of the market participant doctrine.they assert in their brief only that in lockyer we emphasized the enforcement provisions of the statute as reinforcing its regulatory character.in fact,we merely mentioned the existence of enforcement provisions,at,and did so in the context of a statute that quite plainly functioned as regulatory rather than proprietary action,irrespective of any means chosen to enforce it.here,by contrast,the provisions of the fleet rules directed to the procurement decisions of the state and local governments clearly constitute proprietary action within the meaning of the market participant doctrine.
we do not believe that the enforcement provisions have the effect of transforming the rules from proprietary to regulatory action.it is unclear whether the criminal sanctions and fines provided in the fleet rules are intended to be,or are,enforceable against government entities,as distinct from private parties.but even if they are so enforceable,we do not see how action by a state or local government that is proprietary when enforced by one mechanism loses its proprietary character when enforced by some other mechanism.
as part of their argument that the rules are regulatory,appellants contend that protecting the fleet rules from preemption under the market participant doctrine would seriously undermine the uniformity contemplated by a.they assert that purchases by government entities in the aggregate no doubt represent a very substantial segment of the market.however,appellants cite no evidence from the record in support of an argument based on the market share of the state and lo
