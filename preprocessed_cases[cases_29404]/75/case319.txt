the new orleans gulf coast railway company nogcr or the railroad brought this action to prevent the,a collection of louisiana property owners the landowners,from installing or using private,railroad crossings,which the railroad has not authorized,but which louisiana state property law allegedly has.the district court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we affirm.
nogcr is a railroad company that operates in louisiana.the landowners are the owners of enclosed estates,a group of louisiana property owners whose only access from their estates to any public road is blocked by the railroad tracks.this dispute involves the right of the landowners to cross the railroad tracks to reach these public roads.
article of the louisiana civil code permits the owner of an estate with no access to a public road to claim a right of passage over neighboring property to the nearest public road in exchange for indemnity.with this louisiana authority as background,the landowners have built private,railroad crossings of various types and quality over the railroad tracks 
the railroad seeks to regulate these private crossings and has attempted to require the landowners to obtain permits,at some cost,to construct and operate the crossings.according to the railroad,these private crossings impose substantial burdens on the railroad in terms of both cost and safety.the crossings supposedly make it more difficult and thus more costly for the railroad to upgrade,maintain,and monitor its tracks.the railroad claims that it has incurred expense in correcting and improving the substandard workmanship of some of these crossings and repairing damage to the tracks caused by these crossings.the crossings also allegedly make it difficult for the railroad to comply with various federal regulations governing railroad operation and safety.in short,these private crossings increase the railroad operating costs,imposing what the railroad characterizes in its complaint as onerous economic requirements on nogcr railroad operations.
as a result,the railroad brought this action in federal court seeking injunctive and declaratory relief either to prohibit or regulate these private crossings,which the railroad allegedly has not permitted.in its complaint,the railroad sought a permanent injunction ordering the landowners to cease and desist from their continuing trespass and intrusion upon its and interference with railroad operations by use of unauthorized and substandard crossings.further,as part of its prayer for relief,the railroad sought to prohibit private railroad crossings without its express written permission.the railroad also sought a declaratory judgment that,in short,its in the railroad louisiana state law was superior to any claimed right of passage by the landowners.moreover,the railroad sought a declaration that louisiana civil code article,the basis for the landowners claimed right of passage,was preempted by federal law,specifically the interstate commerce commission termination act iccta,the federal railroad safety act frsa,and the commerce clause.
some time after the railroad filed its declaratory judgment action,one of the defendants in the case,jerry rayborn,filed an action against the railroad in louisiana state court seeking a temporary restraining order,a preliminary injunction,and a permanent injunction to prevent the railroad from interfering with the private railroad crossings located on rayborn property.the louisiana state court granted a temporary restraining order that prevented the railroad from barricading or removing rayborn two existing private crossings,which provided the rayborn property with access to a public road.the order also required rayborn to post a bond.the railroad removed rayborn case to federal court,where the case was consolidated with the railroad declaratory judgment action,while the temporary restraining order remained in effect.
before the district court,the railroad asserted jurisdiction based both on the presence of a federal question and diversity,and.regarding federal question jurisdiction,the railroad claimed that the case was one arising under the constitution and laws of the united states because two federal statutes,the iccta and the frsa,and the constitution commerce clause preempted the inconsistent louisiana state law authorizing the railroad crossings.the district court rejected these claims,dismissing the railroad declaratory judgment action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and,for the same reason,remanding the rayborn action to the louisiana state court.
the railroad now appeals.the railroad does not,however,appeal the district court commerce clause or diversity jurisdiction rulings.rather,the railroad appeal focuses on its claim that federal jurisdiction is proper under because it seeks injunctive relief based on a federal statute,because of the completely preemptive force of the iccta and the frsa,and because the case otherwise presents a substantial federal question.

therefore,under d,we lack jurisdiction to consider the district court remand order for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and we dismiss that portion of the appeal challenging the district court decision to remand the rayborn action to state court.
turning to the declaratory judgment action,the railroad presents four arguments why the district court erred in dismissing its case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.first,the railroad argues that federal question jurisdiction is established because it seeks injunctive relief against an allegedly preempted state law or regulation.second,relying on the complete preemption doctrine,the railroad argues that the iccta preempts any state law claim to a right of passage over the railroad tracks,rendering such a claim either wholly federal or nothing at all.third,the railroad argues that the frsa also completely preempts any state law claim to a right of passage.fourth,the railroad argues that a substantial and disputed federal question underlies its complaint,thus establishing federal question jurisdiction.we consider and reject each of these claims below.
the railroad first argues that federal question jurisdiction is established because it seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from state regulation on the ground that the state regulation is preempted by federal law.
the federal question statute,provides district courts with original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.to determine whether a case is one arising under federal law for these purposes,we ordinarily apply the complaint rule.pci,at hoskins,at.pursuant to the complaint rule 
w hether a case is one arising under the constitution or a law or treaty of the united states,in the sense of the jurisdictional statute,must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff statement of his own claim in the bill or declaration,unaided by anything alleged in anticipation of avoidance of defenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose.
franchise tax bd.of state of cal.constr.laborers vacation trust for,d alterations in original quoting taylor anderson.skelly oil phillips petroleum.the complaint rule focuses on whether the plaintiff has affirmatively alleged a federal claim,thus providing a basis for federal jurisdiction anticipated or potential defenses,including defenses based on federal preemption,do not provide a basis for federal question jurisdiction.pci,at citing beneficial bank anderson,d see also caterpillar williams,d i t is now settled law that a case may not be removed to federal court on the basis of a federal defense,including the defense of,even if the defense is anticipated in the plaintiff complaint,and even if both parties concede that the federal defense is the only question truly at issue.
where,as here,a plaintiff brings a declaratory judgment claim pursuant to and,in applying the complaint rule we ask whether if the declaratory judgment defendant brought a coercive action to enforce its rights,that suit would necessarily present a federal question.franchise tax,at.ttea ysleta del sur pueblo,cir.a plaintiff can not evade the complaint rule by using the declaratory judgment remedy to recast what are in essence merely anticipated or potential federal defenses as affirmative claims for relief under federal law.see ttea,at stating that an anticipatory federal defense is insufficient for federal jurisdiction citing louisville nashville mottley.where the complaint in an action for declaratory judgment seeks in essence to assert a defense to an impending or threatened state court action,it is the character of the threatened action,and not of the defense,which will determine whether there is jurisdiction pub.serv.comm of utah wycoff.dictum.
in this case,the railroad declaratory judgment action seeks to resolve whether the landowners may rely upon louisiana state property law to establish a right,as enclosed estate owners,to construct and use private crossings over the railroad tracks.if the landowners,the declaratory judgment defendants,brought coercive actions to claim a right of passage over the railroad tracks,such actions would arise exclusively under state law.although the railroad also seeks a declaration that this state property law constitutes a form of preempted state regulation,this claim arises merely as an anticipatory federal defense to a state law cause of action,which is generally insufficient to establish federal question jurisdiction.
nonetheless,the railroad argues that jurisdiction is established based on shaw delta air lines,d.in shaw,the supreme court explained 
it is beyond dispute that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal rights.see ex parte young.a plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from state regulation,on the ground that such regulation is by a federal statute which,by virtue of the supremacy clause of the constitution,must prevail,thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under to resolve.
id.at.the railroad argues that because it seeks injunctive relief from state regulation on preemption grounds,shaw applies and federal jurisdiction is established.
shaw,among the progeny of ex parte young,clearly establishes a federal right of action against state officials to enjoin the enforcement of preempted state regulations.this cause of action against state officials is an affirmative federal claim that can form the basis for federal jurisdiction.see,planned parenthood of houston and se.sanchez,cir suit against texas state officials to enjoin the enforcement of allegedly preempted state abortion laws gillis louisiana,cir suit against louisiana and louisiana state officials to enjoin as preempted louisiana regulation of pilotage off the state coastline.however,shaw does not address whether a comparable right of action can be asserted exclusively against private parties in the absence of any allegation of state action.
on this issue,professor wright explains 
on principle it should be held that the rule of these cases is confined to actions to which state officials are parties.the best explanation of ex parte young and its progeny is that the supremacy clause creates an implied right of action for injunctive relief against state officers who are threatening to violate the federal constitution and laws that implied right of action does not reach to a suit by one private party against another and it ought to be held that there is no federal jurisdiction of an action for a private party that federal law has preempted a duty he would otherwise owe to another private party.
charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure.in line with this understanding,the first circuit has stated jurisdiction over actions for declarations of can logically only be asserted where a state official is the defendant.colonial penn group,colonial deposit,cir.likewise,when confronted with a declaratory judgment action raising preemption issues and involving only private parties,the second circuit distinguished shaw because the plaintiffs have not sued state officials to enjoin them from enforcing an unconstitutional state law.albradco,bevona,cir.
we agree with these authorities that the principle articulated in a plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief on preemption grounds necessarily presents a federal not apply in a suit exclusively between private parties,in the absence of some showing of state action.shaw reemphasized that an affirmative federal cause of action exists against state officials who interfere with federal rights,including where the state official seeks to enforce federally preempted state regulations.shaw did not,however,establish a comparable right of action against private parties,nor did it eviscerate that aspect of the complaint rule providing that anticipated or potential defenses,including defenses based on federal preemption,do not establish a basis for federal question jurisdiction.
because the railroad sought relief exclusively against private parties and because the railroad preemption claim arises as an anticipated or potential federal defense,the railroad argument that federal jurisdiction is established under shaw fails.
the railroad next argues that the iccta completely preempts the louisiana statutory scheme for enclosed estate owners,which has allegedly authorized the landowners construction and use of these private,railroad crossings.
the complete preemption doctrine is an exception to the complaint rule.mcateer silverleaf resorts,cir citing beneficial bank,at.under the complete preemption doctrine,what otherwise appears as merely a state law claim is converted to a claim arising under federal law for jurisdictional purposes because the federal statute so forcibly and completely displace s state law that the plaintiff cause of action is either wholly federal or nothing at all.hoskins,at quoting carpenter wichita falls indep.sch,cir.the question in complete preemption analysis is whether congress intended the federal cause of action to be the exclusive cause of action for the particular claims asserted under state law.see pci,at hoskins,at.if congress intended the federal cause of action to be exclusive,the state law cause of action is completely preempted,and federal jurisdiction exists.
the complete preemption doctrine must be distinguished from the concept of ordinary preemption.see sullivan am.airlines,cir distinguishing complete preemption from defensive preemption or ordinary preemption.complete preemption is a jurisdictional doctrine,while ordinary preemption simply declares the primacy of federal law,regardless of the forum or the claim.lontz tharp,cir johnson baylor,cir complete preemption,which creates federal removal jurisdiction,differs from more common ordinary preemption also known as conflict preemption,which does not.see also sullivan,at suggesting that the term jurisdictional preemption would reflect more accurately the doctrine theoretical underpinnings.as a general matter,complete preemption is less common and more extraordinary than defensive or ordinary preemption.see sullivan,at many federal more than support complete support a defendant argument that because federal law preempts state law,the defendant can not be held liable under state law.
we have held that the complete preemption doctrine applies to state causes of action that fall squarely under b of the iccta.see pci,at,concluding that the iccta provided the exclusive cause of action for the plaintiff relief that effectively sought to regulate the operation of a railroad switching yard and therefore fell squarely under b.section b provides 
b the jurisdiction of the board over 
transportation by rail carriers,and the remedies provided in this part with respect to rates,classifications,rules including car service,interchange,and other operating rules,practices,routes,services,and facilities of such carriers and 
the construction,acquisition,operation,abandonment,or discontinuance of spur,industrial,team,switching,or side tracks,or facilities,even if the tracks are located,or intended to be located,entirely in one state,
is exclusive.except as otherwise provided in this part,the remedies provided under this part with respect to regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under federal or state law.
the board refers to the surface transportation board stb,which is the body authorized by congress to administer the iccta.see friberg kansas city ry,cir noting that with the iccta congress abolished the interstate commerce commission icc and replaced it with the stb to perform many of the regulatory functions previously performed by the icc.as the agency authorized by congress to administer the iccta,the transportation board is uniquely qualified to determine whether state law should be preempted by the iccta.emerson kansas city ry,cir alterations in original quoting green mountain vermont,cir.
although pci transportation applied the complete preemption doctrine to an asserted state remedy that fell squarely under b of the iccta,that decision focused on whether the complete preemption doctrine applied,as opposed to what extent it applied.we have never defined the precise contours of complete preemption under b or stated how broadly the complete preemption doctrine extends in the context of the iccta.
the stb has articulated a comprehensive test for determining the extent to which a particular state action or remedy is preempted by b.however,the stb test applies to ordinary preemption analysis under b the test does not necessarily apply to complete preemption.nonetheless,as discussed below,the stb test clarifies the status of routine crossing cases within the framework of the iccta and thus is instructive.
the stb b preemption analysis distinguishes between two types of preempted state actions or regulations.first,there are those state actions that are categorically preempted by the iccta because such actions would directly conflict with exclusive federal regulation of railroads.csx transportation,for declaratory order,stb finance docket,wl,at may.regulations falling within this first category are facially preempted or categorically preempted and come in two types 
the first is any form of state or local permitting or preclearance that,by its nature,could be used to deny a railroad the ability to conduct some part of its operations or to proceed with activities that the board has authorized 
second,there can be no state or local regulation of matters directly regulated by the as the construction,operation,and abandonment of rail lines see railroad mergers,line acquisitions,and other forms of consolidation see and railroad rates and service see b.
id.at citations and footnote omitted.state actions such as these constitute per se unreasonable interference with interstate commerce.id.at.as such,the preemption analysis for state regulations in this first category is addressed to the act of regulation itself and not to the reasonableness of the particular state or local action.id.
the second category of preempted state actions and regulations are those that are preempted as applied.section b of the iccta may preempt state regulations,actions,or remedies as applied,based on the degree of interference the particular state action has on railroad operations.for state or local actions that are not facially preempted,the section b preemption analysis requires a factual assessment of whether that action would have the effect of preventing or unreasonably interfering with railroad transportation.id.citing our decision in friberg,at,the stb stated that it is well settled that states can not take an action that would have the effect of foreclosing or unduly restricting a railroad ability to conduct any part of its operations or otherwise unreasonably burdening interstate commerce.id.at.
the stb has clearly identified where routine crossing disputes,such as the one at issue in this case,fall in this scheme of iccta preemption.routine crossing disputes are not typically preempted.crossing disputes,despite the fact that they touch the tracks in some literal sense,thus do not fall into the category of categorically preempted or facially preempted state actions.the stb has explained that t hese crossing cases are typically resolved in state courts.maumee and rmw ventures,for declaratory order,stb finance docket,wl,at march.r outine,uses,such as easements for road crossings,wire crossings,sewer crossings,are not preempted so long as they would not impede rail operations or pose undue safety risks.see also csx,wl,at approving the proposition that a state traditional authority over the safety of roads and bridges at crossings pursuant to other statutory schemes is not preempted by section b so long as no unreasonable burden is imposed on a railroad city of lincoln surface transp,cir stb adopting the position that it is well established that nonconflicting,nonexclusive easements across railroad property are not preempted if they do not hinder rail operations or pose safety risks.thus,within the stb analytical framework,preemption claims in routine crossing cases fall into the category of preemption challenges.
the stb position with respect to these routine crossing cases is consistent with the historical,rule governing these crossing disputes.as the supreme court explained 
the care of grade crossings is peculiarly within the police power of the states,and,if it is seriously contended that the cost of this grade crossing is such as to interfere with or impair economical management of the railroad,this should be made clear.it was certainly not intended by the transportation act to take from the states or to thrust upon the interstate commerce commission investigation into parochial matters like this,unless by reason of their effect on economical management and service,their general bearing is clear.
lehigh valley bd.of pub.util.comm rs.citations omitted see also erie bd.of pub.util.comm rs.holmes,it is well settled that railroad corporations may be required,at their own expense,not only to abolish existing grade crossings but also to build and maintain suitable bridges or viaducts to carry highways,newly laid out,over their tracks or to carry their tracks over such highways.internal quotation marks omitted.
the railroad argues that the louisiana statutory scheme for enclosed estate owners,which allegedly authorizes the landowners construction and use of these private crossings,is completely preempted by the iccta because the scheme prevents or unreasonably interferes with railroad operations.framing the railroad argument within the structure of the stb preemption analysis,the railroad raises an preemption challenge to the louisiana state law.however,the railroad does not argue why the stb test for ordinary preemption under the iccta should also govern or help define the scope of the distinct jurisdictional doctrine of complete preemption.more specifically,the railroad fails to explain whether and why the inquiry for preemption challenges should be consi
