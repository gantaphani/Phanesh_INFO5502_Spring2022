may the state suspend the driver licenses of individuals convicted of boating under the influence after independently reviewing the pertinent vehicle code and harbors and navigation code provisions,we conclude that state law does not authorize the department of motor vehicles to automatically suspend the driver licenses of individuals convicted of boating while intoxicated the trial court correctly enjoined the state from proceeding with the unauthorized license suspensions.
plaintiff ronnie cinquegrani has numerous convictions.in,he was convicted of driving under the influence dui his driver license was suspended for one month,and his ability to drive was restricted for an additional five months.in,cinquegrani was again arrested for dui,and convicted of reckless driving his license was suspended from november until september.cinquegrani license was suspended from september to december,and from december until october,both times for failure to appear.
in,cinquegrani was arrested on the colorado river for boating under the influence bui.he was charged with two misdemeanor violations of the bui statute.cinquegrani entered a guilty plea to one of the charges the other charge was dismissed.he was placed on summary probation.
shortly after pleading guilty to bui,cinquegrani received a notice from the department of motor vehicles dmv,informing him that his california driver license was suspended due to his bui conviction.cinquegrani hired counsel to contest the suspension.counsel convinced a dmv employee that the suspension was invalid,and cinquegrani license was reinstated within three months.
like cinquegrani,plaintiff bryan royea has a record of offenses.in,he was convicted of dui,and his driver license was suspended until march.his license was suspended on two other occasions for failure to provide evidence of financial responsibility after a traffic collision.in,royea pleaded no contest to violating the bui statute.soon afterward,the dmv notified royea that his driver license was suspended for two years.
a class action was brought against the dmv to vindicate the rights of california motorists who have had their licenses to operate a motor vehicle illegally suspended revoked due to bui convictions.plaintiffs cinquegrani and royea are the class representatives.they seek injunctive and declaratory relief,and damages for violations of their federal and state rights.
plaintiffs requested a preliminary injunction,asking the court to bar the dmv from suspending the driver licenses of individuals with bui convictions.the court granted plaintiffs request for an injunction.the court found that plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits because the dmv lacks statutory authority to suspend a driver license solely to punish a bui conviction plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm without an injunction because no complete substitute for the privilege of driving a personal vehicle currently exists the balance of harm favors plaintiffs because the dmv presented no evidence that the injunction will increase the harm caused by either drunken boaters or drunken drivers and plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.the dmv was enjoined from suspending driver licenses following a bui,and ordered to set aside current suspensions resulting from bui convictions.

the bui statute forbids the operation of a vessel while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or drug.h n,subds.b d.the penalties for a bui conviction include fines,imprisonment,successful completion of an alcohol or drug education,training or treatment program,and mandatory completion of a boating safety course.the penalties are increased if the convicted boater has suffered a dui conviction within seven years however,suspension of driving privileges is not listed as a penalty for a bui.h n,subds.e f.the parties do not challenge the validity of the bui statute or its penalties.

when the dmv suspended plaintiffs driver licenses following their bui convictions,the agency was relying on a specific provision in the vehicle code that creates a bridge between the bui and the dui statutes.the provision reads,for the purposes of this division and chapter commencing with section of division,and section,a separate offense that resulted in a conviction of a violation of subdivision b,c,d,or e of section of the harbors and navigation code is a separate violation of section,subd.b.
the parties dispute the meaning of section.the dmv contends that the words separate violation in section mean that the bui need only be unconnected or distinct to enable the dmv to suspend a driver license following a bui conviction.in other words,the dmv treats a bui conviction as if it were a dui conviction,for purposes of punishment.by contrast,plaintiffs interpret the separate violation language to mean that a bui conviction can be used only to enhance the penalties associated with a dui conviction.
section is part of an extensive dui penalty scheme for recidivist drunk drivers contained in division of the vehicle code,entitled sentencing for driving while under the influence.et the supreme court had occasion to consider this penalty scheme in the snook opinion.the court was asked to determine the effect of the words separate violations as used in former section,subdivision a this language was part of a amendment changing the words prior offenses to the words separate violations.the amendment subjects individuals to enhanced penalties for multiple offenses,regardless of whether the convictions were obtained in the same sequence as the offenses were committed.the amendments close the loophole that allowed some repeat offenders to avoid enhanced punishment by pleading guilty to the second,third and fourth offenses before going to trial on
