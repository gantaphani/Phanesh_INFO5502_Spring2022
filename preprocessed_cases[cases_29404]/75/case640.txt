the city and county of san francisco requires tow truck drivers and towing firms to obtain permits to operate and conduct business within san francisco.the city enacted two ordinances,articles and of the san francisco police code the permit scheme,which comprehensively regulate the towing industry within the city and provide a number of conditions and requirements concerning the towing permits.
the california tow truck association ctta preempted by the federal aviation administration authorization act of,faaaa or the act.after the district court initially granted partial summary judgment,the parties appealed to this court.see cal.tow truck ass city cnty.of,cir ctta i.we held that the district court did not analyze the permit scheme as required by our precedent,and so vacated the judgment and remanded for the required analysis.see id.at.
following remand,the district court upheld nearly all of the permit scheme,holding some provisions outside the ambit of the act express preemption clause,c,and others covered by the act savings clauses,id.c a c.in particular,the district court determined that many of the provisions fell within the faaaa safety exception,id.c a,because they are genuinely responsive to safety concerns.city of columbus ours garage wrecker.the district court thus granted the city for summary judgment,from which ctta appeals.with the exception of the challenge to the permit scheme business plan requirement,we affirm.
pursuant to its authority under california law,see cal.g,the city enacted the permit scheme.article of the permit scheme regulates tow car drivers,police code et,and article regulates tow car firms,id.et together,articles and set forth a comprehensive regulatory regime requiring tow truck drivers and towing firms to obtain permits to operate and conduct business in san francisco.ctta i,at.
article provides that n o person shall drive or operate a tow car within the city without first obtaining a permit from the chief of police police code.to obtain a permit,tow car drivers must submit identifying information,and disclose any criminal arrest history.see id.along with the application,applicants must submit fingerprints,photographs,a letter from an employer,and a filing fee.id.after receiving an application for a permit,t he chief of police shall make an investigation without unnecessary delay and grant such application,unless the applicant was convicted of violating,or acted in violation of,certain enumerated criminal statutes,or falsified information on the application.id.
the tow car driver must keep the permit,which contains the names and residences of the driver and employer and other identifying information,in his immediate possession at all times while driving or operating a tow car and shall exhibit such permit on demand of any peace officer.id.the permits last for one year,are renewable upon payment of the annual license fee,id,and can be revoked after a hearing if the chief of police finds that grounds exist which would have constituted just cause for refusal to issue such permit,id.driving or operating a tow car within the city without a permit,or not maintaining possession of a permit while driving or operating a tow car,is a misdemeanor.id.
the permit scheme requirements for tow car firms are similar to those for tow car drivers.as with tow car drivers,n o person shall engage in or conduct business as a tow car firm within the city without first obtaining a permit from the chief of police id.applicants for such permits must provide not only identifying information about themselves and their business,id,but also additional information,including details of every tow car that will be operated by the tow car firm,id.a description of the applicant business plan,and proposed services to be provided,including a system for handling complaints that is acceptable to the chief of police,id.the name and permit number of all tow car operators employed by the firm,id.evidence of a minimum level of insurance,id.and a record of all crimes of which the applicant has been convicted,plead ed guilty,or plead ed no contest,id.like tow car driver applicants,tow car firm applicants must submit fingerprints,photographs,and a filing fee.id.
a tow car firm permit shall be granted unless the police not possess a minimum level of insurance,does not possess requisite tow car equipment,or has been convicted of certain crimes.id.every firm issued a permit must display the permit in a conspicuous place within the tow car firm business address,so that the permit may be readily seen by persons entering the premises.id.the police department may suspend or revoke a tow car firm permit for any of the grounds listed in,as well as for additional reasons,including failing to maintain required levels of insurance and employing a tow car operator who lacks a valid operating permit.id.
like the individual tow car driver permits,a tow car firm permit lasts for a year and is renewable upon payment of an annual license fee.id.article,however,contains some additional requirements for tow car firm.for example,tow car firms are required regularly to submit proof of insurance and evidence of registration,and must notify the police department of the number of tow vehicles or changes in tow car drivers employment status.id.additionally,t ow car firm vehicles may be inspected for code and safety violations by any peace officer.id.tow car firms are also required to maintain records of each vehicle towed for three years and to make such records available for inspection by any peace officer.id.conducting business without a tow car firm permit or failing to display the permit at the tow car firm business is a misdemeanor.id.
the san francisco board of supervisors amended article in to include a brochure requirement.see id.c.when a vehicle has been towed,tow car firms must provide information to owners by displaying and making available a brochure in a conspicuous place in the location where a vehicle owner must come to reclaim their towed vehicle.ctta i,at quoting police code c.the brochure,developed by the city police department,consists of a concise summary of california law,including the maximum rate that can be legally charged for a private property tow and the rights and responsibilities of all parties who participate in towing from private property police code b.with this requirement triggers an administrative penalty of.id.f.
when it promulgated the brochure requirement in,the board of supervisors made a number of legislative findings,including 
i that there are frequent incidents of illegal towing from private property in san francisco and that there is a significant risk to the safety of residents and visitors when illegal towing from private property occurs at night and 
ii that there is a risk to public health and safety when the vehicles of senior citizens and persons with disabilities are illegally towed from private property and 
iii that illegal towing from private property affects vulnerable populations when people of limited economic means are required to pay hundreds of dollars to recover their vehicle,or are subjected to deficiency claims by collection agencies if they could not afford to pick up their vehicle even though the vehicle was illegally towed and 
ix that consistent adherence to legal towing practices will substantially increase the quality of life for residents and the experience of visitors to san francisco.
police code a.both articles and include severability clauses,providing that if any part is held to be unconstitutional or invalid,such a decision shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the remaining portions.id.
in july,ctta,a nonprofit organization representing more than towing companies doing business in california,filed a complaint against the city in san francisco superior court.according to ctta,its members had been harassed and subject to citations,fines,and in some cases the impound of their tow truck for failing to obtain a permit.moreover,it alleged,t he ability of ctta members to conduct their business is adversely affected by the san francisco ordinance,because it subjects them to great uncertainty as to whether they are able to conduct business in,around,and through the city.several owners and operators of tow car firms also declared that the permit scheme has impacted their routes and services,and caused them to incur significant costs.
in its action,ctta sought,among other things,a declaration that the permit scheme is preempted by federal law and an injunction prohibiting the city from enforcing its provisions.after the city removed the case to federal court,the parties filed for summary judgment.as relevant here,ctta argued that the permit scheme is preempted by the faaaa express preemption clause,which provides a state may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.c.
conceding that the permit scheme relate s to the price and service of a towing company,and hence of a motor carrier,the city argued that the permit scheme is not preempted because it falls within the act savings clauses in particular,the act safety exception.the safety exception provides that the act express preemption clause shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a state with respect to motor vehicles.c a.the city emphasized that the regulations were motivated by safety concerns,pointing in particular to a declaration by sergeant william coggan,the commanding officer of the san francisco police department permit section.coggan explained that corruption and criminal activity pervade the towing industry,leading to i mproper conduct such as towing vehicles illegally overcharging people whose vehicles are towed outright stealing towed vehicles operating tow trucks in an unsafe manner on the road stealing merchandise from towed vehicles and causing damages to towed vehicles.further,coggan stated that he was aware of instances in which tow operators or their employees have physically or sexually assaulted persons whose cars had been towed.t he towing business,coggan declared,by its nature,presents certain dangers to the public,as when a person discovers that her car has been towed,she is sometimes left stranded in a dangerous location.
the district court initially held that the permit scheme was preempted to the extent it applied to companies and drivers that engage solely in consensual tows,as well as to those merely passing through san francisco.ctta i,at but it also held that the permit scheme was not preempted as applied to companies and drivers that engage in nonconsensual tows in the city.id.the district court entered judgment for the city on ctta other federal claims,and remanded ctta state claims to state court 
both parties appealed on the faaaa preemption question.we concluded that the district court erred in analyzing the permit scheme without specifically addressing its individual provisions,rather than on a basis.ctta i,at.the district court,we noted,need not analyze every sentence of the permit scheme,line by line.id.at.but where a law or regulation is challenged as a whole,we explained,it is still necessary to analyze each of its essential or major component parts.id.at.although the district court applied the correct test in determining whether the permit scheme was preempted,id.at,it did not analyze the major provisions identified and address whether the permit system can survive,after severing provisions,if any,that are,id.at.we thus vacated and remanded to the district court to conduct the faaaa preemption analysis in the first instance.id 
after remand,the parties again filed for summary judgment.the district court then granted summary judgment to the city as to all but one of the challenged provisions of the permit scheme,holding that a majority of the permit scheme provisions were exempted from preemption by the act safety,insurance,and price exceptions in so holding,it rejected ctta narrow definition of motor vehicle safety,noting that the ninth circuit has endorsed a concept of motor vehicle safety that encompasses but surely goes well beyond the safe performance of towing services.the district court also determined that several challenged provisions the permit display requirement sections and and the business plan requirement section were not subject to the faaaa express preemption clause at all.ctta appeals from that judgment.
the principal purpose of the faaaa was to prevent states from undermining federal deregulation of interstate trucking through a patchwork of state regulations.dilts penske logistics,llc,cir quoting am.trucking ass ns city of,cir,rev in part.toward that end,the faaaa contains an express preemption clause,which provides 
except as provided in the savings clauses in paragraphs and,a state or political subdivision of a state may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier 
c.the parties agree that tow car firms are motor carriers under the statute,and that the permit scheme generally relate s to a price,route,or service of a motor carrier.see ctta i,at.accordingly,at least some of the permit scheme provisions are preempted unless they fall within the faaaa savings clauses,c.
three of those clauses are at issue here.see ctta i,at.the safety exception provides that the faaaa shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a state with respect to motor vehicles.c a.the insurance exception saves from preemption state laws relating to insurance requirements and authorization.id.finally,the price exception permits a state or a political subdivision of a state to enact or enforce a law relating to the price of motor vehicle transportation by a tow truck,if such transportation is performed without the prior consent or authorization of the owner or operator of the motor vehicle,is a nonconsensual tow.id.c c.as the district court observed,t he motor vehicle safety exception is the main,though not exclusive,focus of the parties dispute.
importantly,p reemption analysis start s with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.ours garage,at second alteration in original quoting medtronic,lohr.furthermore,the act does not state laws that affect rates,routes,or services in too tenuous,remote,or peripheral a manner.rowe motor transp.ass n,internal quotation marks omitted.
ours garage held that the faaaa safety exception can apply to ordinances enacted by municipalities,even though c a refers only to the safety regulatory authority of a state.at.that is so,ours garage explained,because congress clear purpose in c a is to ensure that its preemption of states economic authority over motor carriers of property not restrict the preexisting and traditional state police power over safety,includ ing the choice to delegate the state safety regulatory authority to localities.id.at.at the same time,however,ours garage also warned that states and municipalities could not hide economic regulation under the guise of safety regulation.ctta i,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
ours garage went on to direct a basic framework for applying the faaaa safety exception a state law is saved from preemption only if it is genuinely responsive to safety concerns.at.we have given that approach shape by fashioning a inquiry 
the first step examines any expressions of legislative intent,including the particular language of the statute or regulation being challenged,and any explicit statutory or regulatory findings in the provision and available legislative or regulatory history once a safety motivation is identified,the second step looks to the existing record evidence to determine whether there is a logical or genuine connection between the regulation and the safety justification,or,instead,whether the purported safety justification is a pretext for undue economic regulation.the more attenuated or speculative the connection,the more likely it will be that a court will find the purported safety motives illusory or pretextual and that the safety justification will not withstand scrutiny.
ctta i also articulated some more specific guidelines concerning the faaaa safety exception applicable to the district court preemption analysis on remand.id.at.first,while the initial step of the safety exception test addresses whatever traditional sources of legislative intent are available,it also allows for the situation where history is lacking especially at a local level where committee reports or municipal statements might not be published.id.at.m erely because a safety rationale is not documented does not necessarily mean the safety exception can not apply,ctta i explained,as s ometimes a safety justification is so obvious that it need not be stated intent can be obvious from the subject of the regulation itself,as well as from the surrounding circumstances.id.citing tillison gregoire,cir.
next,ctta i described how to assess legislative intent when regulators had mixed motives for example,where a regulation was motivated by safety concerns and economic concerns.we observed that t he presence of such mixed motives does not preclude the application of the safety exception,provided that the state safety motives are not.id.at alteration in original quoting am.trucking,at.determining whether an asserted safety motive is not pretextual is equivalent to asking whether a law is genuinely responsive to safety concerns in other words,whether the challenged provision has a logical connection to motor vehicle safety.ctta i,at.
finally,we reiterated in ctta i that proper analysis of an faaaa preemption challenge to a comprehensive regulation must be conducted on a basis.id.were it otherwise,a single valid excepted provision would allow a vast amount of nonexcepted provisions to stand.id.quoting am.trucking ass ns,city of,cir.similarly,the mere fact that one part of the regulatory scheme is preempted does not mean that other parts of the scheme are preempted,or that the scheme as a whole is preempted.id.
before applying the above principles to san francisco permit scheme,we consider a threshold dispute between the parties over the proper scope of the faaaa safety exception.
ctta argues that an appropriately circumscribed understanding of the act safety exception covers only regulations related to the motor vehicle safety of the tow trucks themselves for example,the manner in which tow trucks operate,the way they are driven on the roadways,and the manner in which they transport motor vehicles and not the safety of the people whose vehicles are towed.conversely,the city contends that ctta assumes an artificially narrow definition of the term safety,and that,properly understood,the safety exception covers regulation s seek ing to prevent or mitigate the danger a person experiences when her motor vehicle is being or has been towed by another motor vehicle.the city is correct.
the very language of the safety exception demonstrates that ctta understanding of the faaaa safety concept is unduly narrow.section c provides that the faaaa shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a state with respect to motor vehicles.c a emphases added.the safety exception nowhere mentions motor vehicle safety,the talismanic phrase to which ctta repeatedly refers rather,it expressly states that the faaaa shall not restrict the state general safety regulatory authority,not just its regulatory authority regarding the safe operation of the regulated motor vehicles.
nor does the language of the exception limit the motor vehicles covered by the exemption to the regulated vehicles covered by the faaaa as a whole.indeed,the faaaa specifically defines motor vehicle for purposes of this part of the statute as 
a vehicle,machine,tractor,trailer,or semitrailer propelled or drawn by mechanical power and used on a highway in transportation,or a combination determined by the secretary,but does not include a vehicle,locomotive,or car operated only on a rail,or a trolley bus operated by electric power from a fixed overhead wire,and providing local passenger transportation similar to service.
t he cardinal canon of statutory construction is that congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.planned parenthood,betlach,cir quoting.bank germain.congress chose to fashion the faaaa safety exception to encompass the state safety regulatory authority with respect to the broader category of motor vehicles,generally,instead of the more limited set of vehicles denoted by the term m otor carriers of property.c.accordingly,as tow trucks are engaged in towing other motor vehicles,the exception in terms extends to safety regulatory authority concerning the vehicles towed.
furthermore,t he phrase with respect to is generally understood to be synonymous with the phrase relating to.in re plant insulation,cir.and,although the the breadth of the words related to does not mean the sky is the limit,the supreme court has reiterated that the ordinary meaning of the words related to is a broad one,meaning having a connection with or reference to.dan city used cars,pelkey,second alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted see also,ginsberg.consequently,the faaaa safety exception exempts from preemption safety regulations that hav e a connection with motor vehicles,not only those that directly govern the physical operation of the tow trucks themselves.see dan city.at.
consistent with the statutory language,ace auto body towing,city of,cir,holding modified on other grounds by loyal tire auto,town of woodbury,cir,specifically rejected the argument that the safety exception extends only to safety regulation of the mechanical components of motor vehicles.noting that n either the text nor the legislative history of c a supports such a narrow reading,ace auto body concluded that even if the phrase safety regulatory authority with respect to motor vehicles were ambiguous,it must be read to encompass the authority to enact safety regulations with respect to motor vehicle accidents and.id.
more generally,and contrary to ctta arguments,c ase law has on the whole given a broad construction to the safety regulation exception.vrc llc city of dallas,cir.ours garage specifically rejected the narrowest possible construction of the safety exception,at,noting that congress clear purpose in enacting c a was to ensure that its preemption of states economic authority over motor carriers of property not restrict the preexisting and traditional state police power over safety,id.at.
we have likewise held that towing regulations directed at safety in a fairly broad sense are exempt from preemption under the faaaa safety exception.tillison city of san diego,cir,for example,held that a state law requiring towing companies to obtain written authorization before removing a vehicle from private property,fell within the faaaa safety exception.in so holding,tillison emphasized the california legislature statement that it enacted the statute 
to further the safety of the general public by ensuring that a private property owner or lessee has provided his or her authorization for the removal of a vehicle from his or her property,thereby promoting the safety of those persons involved in ordering the removal of the vehicle as well as those persons removing,towing,and storing the vehicle.
id.at emphasis added quoting cal.m.tillison gregoire similarly held a state law restricting patrol and nonconsensual towing exempted by the faaaa safety exception,listing a number of possible safety purposes animating the law,including prevent ing involuntary tows and towing mistakes,reduc ing confrontations,and expedit ing vehicle recovery.at.some of these purposes for example,reducing confrontations are related to the safety of individuals affected by the towing process,but not directly to the safe operation of the tow trucks when in use as a vehicle.
finally,in addition to the second circuit in ace auto body,our other sister circuits have interpreted the scope of the faaaa safety concept consonantly with our cases.cole city of dallas,cir per curiam,for instance,held a dallas regulation prohibiting the issuance of a tow driving permit to persons who had been convicted of certain drug crimes to be a motor vehicle safety regulation under c a.id.at.it is difficult to imagine,the court explained,a regulation with a more direct protective nexus or peripheral economic burden.id.at.cole emphasized that ours garage anchored its interpretation of the faaaa safety exception to congress desire to leave for the states and local governments those responsibilities regarding motor carriers that do not relate to the slender congressional goal of addressing economic authority over such carriers.id.at.accordingly,cole decline d to elasticize congress economic goal by narrowly interpreting safety regulatory authority of a state with respect to motor vehicles.id.at see also vrc llc,at holding that an ordinance requiring explanatory signs concerning towing fell within the faaaa safety exception as possible violent confrontation between unwarned vehicle owners and tow truck drivers could be remedied by a sign requirement galactic towing,city of miami beach,cir concluding that a nonconsensual towing ordinance requiring permits and written authorization to tow fell within the faaaa safety exception.
in sum,the faaaa safety exception does not,as ctta contends,limit the set of valid safety rationales in this context to those concerned only with the safe physical operation of the tow trucks themselves.rather,regulations that are genuinely responsive to the safety of other vehicles and individuals involved in the towing process may also be exempted from preemption.keeping this proper understanding of the faaaa safety concept in mind,we turn to ctta specific challenges to san francisco permit scheme.
we first analyze ctta challenge to the permit scheme general permit requirements.we then address the remaining provisions enabling the operation of the permit scheme,such as the requirements concerning applications,fees,permit possession and display,and penalties.
the permit scheme requirements that tow car operators and tow car firms hold a permit while operating in san francisco,police code,clearly fall within the faaaa preemption clause,as they are related to a service of a motor carrier,c.but the permit requirements,we hold,fall within the act safety exception.
in applying the safety exception,we first consider available legislative or regulatory intent to evaluate whether safety relating to motor vehicles was truly a concern,using whatever traditional sources of legislative intent are available.ctta i,at.neither party has cited legislative history dating from the initial enactment of these ordinances,which may not exist.when amending article in,however,the board of supervisors made explicit findings,some of which are directly concerned with safety.
specifically,the board found that there is a significant risk to the safety of residents and visitors when illegal towing from private property occurs at night,and that there is a risk to public health and safety when the vehicles of senior citizens and persons with disabilities are illegally towed from private property.police code a ii,iii.ctta maintains that only these findings are relevant to evaluating the permit scheme.but that argument assumes that the only safety concerns relevant to the preemption analysis are those expressly stated in section a.that is not so.as ctta i emphasized,a safety justification can be obvious from the subject of the regulation itself,as well as from the surrounding circumstances.at.
here,as in gregoire,it is reasonable to conclude from the permit scheme subject matter that the legislature had public safety in mind when it passed the law.at.indeed,the california state law allowing municipalities like san francisco to regulate towing services demonstrates clear safety concerns.see cal.g furthermore,the coggan declaration although not direct evidence of the board intent,as it was produced after the permit scheme was enacted can be considered to establish the surrounding circumstances in which the ordinances were passed.ctta i,at.that is,the declaration is evidence of the broad range of safety problems arising in the towing industry,such as the operati on of tow trucks in an unsafe manner on the road,stealing merchandise from towed vehicles,and instances of physical or sexual assault by tow operators or their employees.
viewing the various indices of regulatory intent in combination,we find that safety relating to motor vehicles was truly a concern that motivated the board of supervisors to enact the challenged permit requirements ctta i,at.these safety concerns include the limited set articulated when enacting the amendment to article the risk posed by illegal towing from private property at night or involving a vehicle belonging to senior citizens and persons with disabilities but are not limited to those concerns.rather,we may infer from the other indices that broader safety concerns,including safe operation of the trucks,physical or sexual assault,the possibility of violent confrontations,and the stranding of motorists in dangerous situations,also underlay the enactment of the challenged permit requirements.
the second prong of the safety exception analysis requires us to assess the nexus between the provision at issue and the safety concern.ctta i,at.that nexus is more than sufficient.
that the permit requirements have a significant and logical relationship to safety is evident.as the district court stated,the presence of a permit requirement implies the threat of permit revocation,which makes the requirement a tool for policing misconduct in the towing industry.furthermore,the permit requirement enables the city proactively to weed out and monitor tow car drivers and firms on an ongoing basis.
ctta maintains that a more appropriate safety response by the city would be to increase the criminal penalties for illegal towing,instead of creating a scheme that places enormous regulatory and economic burdens on legitimate towing firms.but the faaaa safety exception does not save from preemption only the least intrusive methods of promoting safety.moreover,as sergeant coggan reasonably observed,it may well be that the threat of permit nonrenewal or revocation by administrative action is more effective than the threat of criminal or civil prosecution,given the relative certainty and timeliness of the administrative process.ctta offers no reason to doubt this assessment.
taking another tack,ctta complains that the city has produced no evidence that the permit scheme has in fact increased safety or reduced the incidence of illegal towing,contending that the record evidence is entirely bereft of any statistical data or other empirical data.but a regulation falls within the faaaa safety exception if it is genuinely responsive to safety concerns,a test we have described as requiring a logical connection to motor vehicle safety.ctta i,at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.that is,the safety exception is concerned with legislative intent,not legislative effectiveness.
as a third line of attack,ctta contends that the permit requirements are not facially concerned with safety.in ctta view,permissible safety regulations include regulations such as requiring tow truck drivers to pass a driving test,or to demonstrate competence in towing motor vehicles,not permit requirements.this argument rests on ctta incorrect understanding of the faaaa safety concept,see part iii,supra.as we have explained,the safety exception is not limited to regulations that narrowly address safety for tow trucks rather,it extends to regulations that protect safety in connection with motor vehicles towed and the individuals who interact with tow truck operators and firms.see,tillison,at gregoire,at vrc llc,at,galactic towing,at cole,at.ctta can not plausibly claim that revoking the permit of those tow car drivers and firms who commit misconduct related to their services,strand motorists in dangerous locations,or operate dangerously is not logically connected to improving the safety of individuals involved in the towing process.
finally,ctta invokes automobile club of new york,dykstra,cir.dykstra involved a challenge to new york city comprehensive regulation of the towing industry as applied to tow trucks from outside new york city.id.at.holding that e nforcing the scheme against tow trucks passing through new york city or towing vehicles into new york city does not respond to safety concerns and does not fall within the safety exception,id.at,dykstra,presumably because it focused on those questions,did not discuss or even cite earlier decisions like cole,vrc,or galactic towing,all of which held that the faaaa safety exception covers towing permit regulations affecting operators.notably,dykstra observed that tow trucks from new york city would presumably already be licensed under the city permit regulation,without questioning the validity of that regulation.id.at.dykstra was thus primarily concerned with the application of new york city permit regulation to vehicles coming from outside the city the case does not support ctta position in this case.
in sum,the permit requirements of sections and are genuinely responsive to the set of real safety concerns that underlay enactment of the permit scheme.accordingly,these requirements fall within the act safety exception,and so are exempted from preemption.
the district court concluded that the majority of the remaining provisions fell within the faaaa safety exception,while others were not covered by the faaaa preemption clause in the first place.ctta arguments concerning these provisions for the most part suffer from the same infirmities that undermine its arguments concerning the general permit requirements.as the district court properly conducted a thorough analysis,we address most of the provisions only in brief.we separately address thereafter section system and business plan requirements,see police code.
permit application requirements,sections and 
the district court concluded that the permit scheme application and requirements fall within the faaaa safety exception we agree.
requiring tow car operators and tow car firm applicants to submit identification information as part of their applications is logical ly connect ed,ctta i,at,to the safety of individuals potentially threatened by such drivers or firms.those requirements allow the police more easily to identify drivers and firms that commit wrongdoing or misconduct.
one of the primary ways by which the permit scheme genuinely responds to safety concerns is by providing police the capability proactively to monitor the towing industry,a capability that is predicated on the police having basic information about tow car drivers.ctta in fact concedes that such identifying information may be helpful to the police in identifying tow truck drivers,but argues that such identification does nothing to improve towing safety and ensure that drivers will operate their vehicle safely.but,as we have explained,the act safety concept is not limited to the safe physical operation of the tow trucks.instead,it includes protection of customers,who may be in vulnerable situations,from dangerous or irresponsible tow truck operators.accurate identification of the tow car operator and car firm operators helps to provide such protection.
ctta contends in particular that the requirements that applicants provide criminal history information as part of their application,see police code,are preempted by the faaaa.that these requirements genuinely respon d to safety concerns is quite apparent.indeed,i t is difficult to imagine a regulation with a more direct protective nexus or peripheral economic burden.cole,at 
finally,ctta argues that,in any event,requiring driver permit applicants to list all criminal offenses for which they have been arrested is not responsive to safety concerns,because an arrest is not competent evidence of any wrongdoing.that observation is quite valid,and curbing the misuse of arrest records is a legitimate concern as the city points out,however,the police code does not allow a permit denial based solely on arrest any such denials would be extremely troublesome and could be separately challenged simply collecting information on arrests is nonetheless pertinent to assuring accurate identification of drivers,as arrest records contain identifying information,including fingerprints and usage of aliases.
in sum,the permit scheme application requirements,including the criminal history disclosure requirements,fall within the scope of c a,and are therefore not preempted.
permit fees,section and penalties,sections and 
the district court correctly concluded that the permit fee and penalty provisions fall within the safety exception.
the filing and license fees reimburse the city for the costs of processing the application.the permit fees thus directly support the permit scheme other requirements.as the district court explained,that the permit fee requirements regulate somewhat more indirectly is not by itself fatal,for,like the essential permit requirements themselves,they remain logically and genuinely connected to obvious safety concerns.i t would make no sense to conclude that certain provisions of the permit scheme are not preempted because they are genuinely responsive to safety concerns,but that the state is forbidden from taking measures to make those provisions effective.prof l towing recovery operators of box,d.
the penalty provisions for driving or operating a tow truck in the city without requiring the requisite permit are likewise integral to the functioning of the scheme permit requirement.absent some penalty for noncompliance,the permit requirement would be a dead letter.ctta only argument is a reiteration of its basic theme while the threat of misdemeanor convictions may serve as a deterrent to encourage drivers to comply with the ordinance,there has been no showing that complying with the ordinance enhances the safety of the motoring public.repeating the same refrain does not improve it.
we thus hold that the fee and penalty provisions fall under the safety exception and are not preempted.
possession and display requirements,section and 
the district court concluded that the permit possession and display requirements are not subject to faaaa preemption in the first place,as displaying a permit does not constitute a service under c.ctta argues to the contrary that directing drivers to affirmatively perform an act,such as display a permit to a police officer,is inherently a service.
we can not agree with ctta.a requirement designed to demonstrate compliance with a legal obligation is not ordinarily termed a service.one who hands over his driver license to a police officer when stopped for a traffic violation,for example,is not providing a service to the officer.moreover,the only state laws whose effect is forbidden under the faaaa are those with a significant impact on carrier rates,routes,or services.rowe,at internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.ctta has not shown that the permit possession and display requirements affect its members in any significant manner distinct from the requirement of obtaining the permit in the first place.
consequently,sections and are not preempted by the faaaa 
complaint system and business plan requirements,section 
to obtain a tow car firm permit,applicants must include in their application a description of the applicant business plan,and a system for handling complaints that is acceptable to the chief of police.police code.the district court concluded that both requirements fell within the faaaa safety exception while we agree that the complaint system requirement genuinely responds to safety concerns,we conclude that the business plan requirement falls outside of the safety exception and is therefore preempted.
a requiring tow car firms to have acceptable systems for handling customer complaints is logically connected to improving safety.
first,as the district court found,having such a complaint system in place could reduce the incidence of heated confrontations between tow car firm employees and individuals whose vehicles were towed.it is reasonable to conclude that individuals who are upset or angered by the towing process are less likely personally to confront tow car firm operators or employees when they are aware that there is an official mechanism for handling their complaint
