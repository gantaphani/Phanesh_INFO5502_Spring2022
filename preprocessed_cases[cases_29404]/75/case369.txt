plaintiff worldwide equipment,worldwide,a dealer and authorized distributor of mack trucks,serves the industry in kentucky,tennessee,west virginia and virginia,and is required to collect a federal retail excise tax fret on the sale of certain trucks.worldwide filed this suit for a refund of in excise taxes it paid the irs for the first quarter of,related to the sale of eight model dump trucks.defendant government counterclaimed for in excise taxes claimed to be due for the period from to early.the government sought summary judgment on both the claim and counterclaim.the district court granted the government motion on both claims.we vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
neither party challenges the district court statement of underlying facts 
plaintiff worldwide equipment is a heavy truck dealer with headquarters in prestonburg,kentucky.doc.at.it has facilities and conducts business in kentucky,west virginia,tennessee,and ohio.id.the vehicle at issue in this case is a mack trucks,mack.by way of explaining why worldwide is responsible for the federal excise tax imposed by the internal revenue service irs,worldwide provides 
worldwide is a heavy truck dealer and as such,a form filer.this means that worldwide purchases complete or incomplete new truck chassis from an original manufacturer,such as mack,without paying federal excise tax.when worldwide sells a completed new truck or an incomplete chassis to a retail customer,it has the responsibility for determining whether the excise tax is due,and if it is,charging,collecting and remitting the tax to the irs along with a form federal excise tax return.while worldwide,like most dealers,passes the excise tax on to its customers,worldwide is the party required by law to collect the excise tax.
doc.at footnotes omitted.with respect to the,plaintiff states 
worldwide adopted a practice of requiring its customers to sign a written statement attesting that the coal hauler they were purchasing from worldwide would be operated as an vehicle.if the customer refused to sign this statement,or worldwide believed that the customer intended to operate the vehicle on public highways,it collected,reported and remitted excise though the vehicle was still illegal to operate on public highways.
doc.at footnote and internal citation omitted.
the first came to the attention of the irs during a investigation into whether a particular tire should be subject to excise tax.doc.at.the irs ultimately determined that the was subject to excise tax.on or before july,the irs notified plaintiff that it was opening an investigation into plaintiff tax returns because plaintiff had not paid federal retail excise taxes fret for certain sales.doc.at.a footnote here states during the relevant period from to,plaintiff sold approximately total.at.plaintiff argued that the irs assessment was erroneous.this argument was initially rejected in,and again in after plaintiff had availed itself of internal service administrative appeal procedures.id.plaintiff paid the excise tax on eight vehicles sold to a single customer,james justice.plaintiff then filed a complaint for the refund of the fret paid.defendant filed a counterclaim for for taxes assessed upon vehicles sold since from through the first quarter of,about vehicles for which no fret had been paid.
the internal revenue code,a imposes a tax on the first retail sale of any chassis or body weighing over pounds if the chassis or body is sold for use as a component part of a highway vehicle.highway vehicle is defined as 
any vehicle,or any trailer or semitrailer,designed to perform a function of transporting a load over public highways,whether or not also designed to perform other functions,but does not include a vehicle described in paragraph d of this section a d.
the d exception at issue in this case is the vehicle exception,which provides 
ii certain vehicles specially designed for offhighway transportation.a vehicle,or a trailer or semitrailer,is not a highway vehicle if it is a specially designed for the primary function of transporting a particular type of load other than over the public highway in connection with a mining operation and b if by reason of such special design,the use of such vehicle to transport such load over the public highways is substantially limited or substantially impaired.for purposes of applying the rule of b of this subdivision,account may be taken of whether the vehicle may travel at regular highway speeds,requires a special permit for highway use,is overweight,overheight or overwidth for regular use,and any other relevant considerations a d ii.
a vehicle taxability is determined by application of an ex ante analysis that examines a vehicle intended primary design.see dillon ranch supply united states,cir noting that t he test for taxability under a is primary design,not primary use,under both the old and new treasury regulations a use test would be unworkable since there would be no way of knowing how a given article would be used by the consumer at the time of sale.see also freightliner of grand rapids united states,d,noting that because the taxability of a vehicle under,see id.at must be determined at the time of the first retail sale,an actual use standard is unworkable.
the government motion for summary judgment argued that the was not specially designed for the primary function of transporting a load other than over the public highway because it was designed to be a highway vehicle,and because it was not specially designed to transport a particular type of load.the district court agreed that the exception does not apply 
whether the satisfies the exception special design test is a close call.it would seem that the vehicle primary purpose is,indeed,the hauling of coal.however,this hauling entails transport of the coal from mine site to tipple,which often entails travel over the public highways.thus,while specific components of the may have been modified to improve its ability to operate in the appalachian coal region,it does not satisfy the requirement that it be specially designed for the primary function of transporting a particular type of load other than over the public highway.a d ii a emphasis added.rather,the ability to transport coal over public roadways is as important to its role in the coal industry as its sturdier design features which make it better suited for work in the appalachian coal fields.use of the on the public highways can hardly be considered merely incidental,since,in most cases,one must travel over the public roads to transport coal from mine face to tipple.footnote here states while some mines have tipples,most do not.pigman decl.
taken as a whole,the record evidence suggests that the is not a special design.rather,it is a dual use highway vehicle that may be licensed and that complies with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards 
worldwide raises three objections to the district court opinion that the court failed to properly apply the summary judgment standard that the court applied an incorrect legal standard when analyzing the special design test,in that worldwide need only show that the primary function of the was the transport of coal and that the court misconstrued several key pieces of evidence,thereby making assumptions of fact that were not supported by the record.in essence,worldwide challenges the district court conclusion that,as a matter of law,the did not meet the special design prong of the vehicle exception.
this court reviews de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.united states,cir.summary judgment is properly granted if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also,at.irs determinations are presumed correct,and the taxpayer must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it is entitled to a tax refund,at.
dual use vehicles are not disqualified under the vehicle exception 
worldwide and amici argue that the district court incorrectly interpreted the special design prong of the vehicle exception as disqualifying vehicles.amici national automobile dealers association and various state coal associations relatedly assert that the district court application of an incidental use standard was improper and unsupported by the plain language of the regulations.we agree with both arguments.
clause a of the vehicle exception,the special design prong,provides that a vehicle is not a highway vehicle if it is specially designed for the primary function of transporting a particular type of load other than over the public highway.c.a d ii a emphasis added.the term primary means first in rank of importance,webster third new international dictionary it does not mean exclusive.see also malat riddle,noting that a statute words,including revenue acts,should be interpreted where possible in their ordinary,everyday senses,and holding that as used in of the internal revenue code,primarily means of first importance or principally.
the structure of the statute supports that the exception comes into play only with respect to vehicles that are designed,at least to some extent,for both use various irs general counsel support that conclusion.see,at,noting that only vehicles with no or negligible utility for transporting loads on public highways fail to meet the design test in the general definition of highway vehicle,and t he exceptions are provided to exclude vehicles that should not be taxed,but which meet the design test see also july,noting that only vehicles with no or negligible highway capabilities fail to come within the general definition of a highway vehicle,and because the truck at issue can function as a highway vehicle it is subject to excise tax unless it is exempt under one of the exceptions.
further,when read as a whole,the exception clearly contemplates that highway use may occur,in that clause b of the exception states if by reason of such special design,the use of such vehicle to transport such load over the public highways is substantially limited or substantially impaired.a d ii b emphasis added.
the primary function standard of a permits more than incidental highway use 
the district court concluded that r egardless of whether plaintiff or defendant version of highway usage is accepted,the record does not support plaintiff position that the use on public highways is merely incidental.
although the court understandably applied an incidental use standard to the special design prong of the exception,given that the parties argued it,that standard no longer applies under current regulations the term incidental is defined as s ubordinate to something of greater importance having a minor role.black law dictionary ed.however,the proper standard for application of the exception special design prong is not whether highway use is incidental or subordinate to use,but rather,whether the vehicle was designed for the primary function of transporting loads other than over a public highway.see a d ii.the primary function standard permits more than incidental highway use.see,glb enterprises,united states,cir.highway use that is more than incidental does not necessarily mean the truck was not designed primarily for use.see halliburton united states,noting that trucks that were primarily designed as vehicles were not subject to excise tax simply because of their use on public highways as necessary to get to the job sites see also glb enterprises,at.
we relatedly conclude that the district court erroneously considered evidence of presumed use instead of focusing on the objective design of the vehicle.the district court noted the proper ex ante analysis that examines a vehicle primary design,see dillon ranch supply,at noting that t he test for taxability under a is primary design,not primary use,under both the old and new treasury regulations a use test would be unworkable since there would be no way of knowing how a given article would be used by the consumer at the time of sale.however,after citing the proper standard,the court considered evidence of highway use the irs and and intended use the fact that worldwide collected taxes on certain sold to customers who planned public highway use.the court inquiry should have been limited to the intent and objective design of the vehicle itself.
in addition,the district court credited only the government interpretation of the evidence when it found that worldwide admits the was designed to transport coal from mine site to purpose often necessitating use of the public roads.the evidence worldwide submitted below supported that the primary design function was for transport from mine face to tipple.
rather than focusing on whether a question of material fact existed,the court improperly credited only irs expert pigman affidavit,which stated in pertinent part 
it is true that some mine facilities are large enough,and expected to have a long enough productive lifetime,in order to justify construction of a tipple on the mine property itself.however,most mines in kentucky have not been of that scale or have been located in areas inaccessible to rail or barge transportation with the result that tipples have generally not been located on the mine property itself.
based on pigman general statement that most mines in kentucky have not been of a large enough scale to justify an tipple,the district court concluded that some mines have tipples,most do not,and that one must travel over public roads to transport coal from mine face to tipple.the district court concluded that the must have been designed to travel on public highways and,therefore,that it fails the special design test.
we note that expert witnesses can not create a question of fact by simply stating conclusions on ultimate issues.a court is free to reject an argument as having no factual basis.however,as discussed below,worldwide presented extensive evidence demonstrating the existence of a factual dispute regarding whether the was designed for the primary function of transporting coal other than over the public highways.under these circumstances,the district court was not free to simply credit the government submissions,weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter.rather,the court function was to determine whether there was a genuine issue for trial.see doe metropolitan nashville pub,cir noting that weighing the evidence is never appropriate at the summary judgment stage.
worldwide does not dispute that the coal hauler is physically capable of being driven on the highway and is sometimes driven on public highways.nonetheless,worldwide introduced extensive evidence regarding the special design features of both the chassis the mack and the bodies incorporated into the coal hauler.this evidence included the affidavit of terry dotson,chief executive officer,president and chairman of worldwide equipment,which stated in pertinent part 
worldwide is a heavy truck dealer headquartered in prestonburg,kentucky,and an authorized dealer for new mack,volvo and gmc trucks worldwide was founded as a mack dealer.
a significant portion of worldwide business is selling and servicing heavy trucks for the coal mining industry in eastern kentucky,west virginia,virginia and,to a lesser extent,tennessee.
mack is a custom truck builder that manufactures and sells trucks every mack truck is a custom designed and custom engineered truck.worldwide,working with its retail customers,custom orders each truck it buys from mack according to the specific application for which the truck is being purchased.
from the time i joined the company in until sometime in the,worldwide would typically recommend and custom order a specially designed and configured version of a mack model series truck for customers who said they wanted a rugged dump truck to haul coal in the coal fields in the area.
mack designated the unique combination of special design and configuration features for the coal hauling dump version of the series ordered by worldwide as the sometime in.the c stood for coal.prior to mack use of this model designation,worldwide would order a for its coal hauling customers.the had the same unique special design and configuration features as the.the l stood for logging.however,the intended use of the trucks ordered by worldwide was for hauling coal and an oversized dump bed was added to the truck.
sometime in late or early,i learned that mack was going to stop building the 
based upon years of working closely with worldwide customers involved in the coal mining industry,i knew that they had a need for a rugged dump truck designed and configured for operating in the conditions typical to the region a vehicle that could survive in the hilly,muddy,rocky,gravelly appalachian coal fields and still provide an economically viable method to transport coal from the extraction point the mine face to the tipple or processing area.
in late or early,i learned about the series trucks that mack was just beginning to manufacture for the canadian logging industry.after seeing the basic specifications for this new series,i personally approached mack and asked whether the base platform could be designed and configured so that it would be suitable for use as an coal hauling dump suitable replacement for the.
worldwide,in collaboration with mack and its coal field customers,helped to develop the specifications for the specially configured truck that became known as the coal hauler.the paperwork on every coal hauler ordered by worldwide stated that the vehicle was intended to be used as severe service coal hauler.
the coal hauler was a direct successor to the and shared many of the same design features,including a lb.bogie,heavy duty triple rail frames and associated frame and suspension components a special engine,transmission and rear axle combination an oversized steel dump body and special goodyear tires.the coal hauler was designed and sold to the same customers for the same exact purpose as the coal hauling.
the typical coal hauler sold by worldwide had more than in customizations as compared to the standard sx truck,or a price increase of approximately.attached hereto as exhibit a is a specification comparison of the sx standard truck and the coal hauler.
the coal hauler was a custom designed and configured truck built for a special purpose.it was wider,taller,longer,heavier,slower and significantly more expensive to purchase and operate than general purpose heavy duty dump trucks manufactured by mack and several other manufacturers which were intended for highway use.it was built for the primary purpose of use.attached hereto as exhibit b is a copy of a january,letter where mack confirms the coal hauler intended purpose.
the coal hauler shared the same fundamental modifications that distinguished the trucks as and qualified them for tax exempt status a lb.bogie heavy duty triple rail frames and associated frame and suspension components a special engine,transmission and rear axle combination an oversized steel dump body and special goodyear tires.
in the majority of situations,worldwide would take delivery of an incomplete chassis from mack and subcontract with a custom dump bed manufacturer to affix a dump bed to the chassis to make a complete truck.on rare occasions,worldwide customer wanted to complete the vehicle by affixing a dump bed or other equipment to the chassis on its own or through a subcontractor of its choice.
every coal hauler sold by worldwide from april,through march,was at least inches wide at the rear bogie as measured from tire to tire,and the majority of those trucks were sold with dump beds that exceeded inches in width.it is important to note that this width measurement is based on an empty truck.when the truck is loaded,the tires flatten out and the width of the vehicle increases as much as inches or more.
the maximum allowed width for vehicles using public highways in the united states is hawaii is inches,and connecticut is inches.worldwide never sold an coal hauler for use in hawaii or connecticut.further,there are many public roads on which the maximum width is just inches.attached hereto as exhibit c is a copy of a july,list prepared by keller and associates,which shows maximum vehicle sizes and weights for all states.this is a document that worldwide uses in its business.
the custom specifications of the coal hauler prevent it from being driven at regular highway speeds.although the maximum geared road speed of this truck is listed by mack as approximately mph,it is virtually impossible to sustain that speed for any length of time because to do so would require the engine to operate at its maximum governed rpm rating.in addition,if the coal hauler is operated for any length of time at or above mph,the rear transaxles will overheat due to the very low gear ratios a low gear ratio means that the rear transaxles must turn times for each revolution of the rear wheels.if the rear transaxles are overheated for any length of time,the lubricant will coke and the gears will be burned out.furthermore,if an coal hauler is operated for any length of time at or above mph,the special goodyear tires will overheat and suffer tread separation or even catastrophic tire failure a blowout,a problem that is exacerbated if the truck is hauling a heavy load.
the coal hauler can not legally be operated on the highway without a special permit due to its excessive width weight 
to justify the premium cost for an coal hauler,an must fully load the truck for its operation to be economically feasible.a fully loaded coal hauler often weighs in excess of pounds lbs.empty weight.but if used on public highways,the coal hauler would only be able to legally haul a fraction of its rated or actual load capacity.it is not economically feasible for the coal hauler to be used for the primary purpose of transporting loads over public highways.
mack halted production of the coal hauler in.
less than coal hauler trucks were built by mack truck during the entire plus year production run.of this number,worldwide purchased all but about.
an could modify an coal hauler to make it highway legal,but i never known anyone to do this.the truck would have to be totally reconfigured.at a minimum,the lb.bogie and all the wheels,spacers and tires would have to be replaced,the custom dump bed would have to be replaced,and the chassis would have to be reconfigured emphasis added.
additional evidence worldwide presented on the special design prong of the exception included the affidavit of bruce hollenbeck,mack truck vice president of product planning,and an employee of mack truck since,stating in pertinent part 
mack has historically used the terms highway on road vehicles,highway vehicles,and off highway off road vehicles to describe the different categories or types of vehicles it has designed and manufactured over the years.however,mack internal terminology had nothing whatsoever to do with whether particular vehicles could be licensed or whether federal excise tax was applicable to the sale of particular vehicles.
from to,i was the program manager responsible for the development of the series of mack trucks.one of the variants of the series was the model.as such,i am very familiar with the development of the series and the variant of that series.
the series,including the variant,was purposely designed so that,depending on the specifications required by the customer,the vehicles could operate,or both.customer specifications are generally driven by the customer intended vehicle other words,how the customer intends to use the truck.
the two vocational applications for which the series was originally designed were logging hauling logs both off and on paved surfaces,and,oil field operations hauling very heavy oil field equipment both off and on paved surfaces.
coal hauling was not one of the original applications for which the series was designed.however,after the series had been put in production,it was determined in approximately that chassis could be configured in such a way that would be suitable for coal hauling both off and on paved surfaces.
the series was a very low volume product for mack.
i have carefully examined pages through of mack exhibit to my deposition january.these pages relate to the specifications for trucks serial through ordered by worldwide equipment in april.based upon my review of those specifications,i would classify
