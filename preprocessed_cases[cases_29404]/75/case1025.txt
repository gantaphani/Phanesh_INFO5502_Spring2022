appellee washington metropolitan area transit authority wmata contracted with appellants kiska construction and kajima engineering and construction,collectively kiska in early to construct two subway tunnels in washington,for a fixed price of million.after experiencing various difficulties completing the project,kiska filed suit against wmata in the united states district court for the district of columbia alleging counts of fraudulent misrepresentation negligent misrepresentation unilateral mistake material breach of contract and quantum meruit.
the district court dismissed kiska two tort misrepresentation and negligent lack of subject matter jurisdiction,concluding that wmata had not waived its sovereign immunity from liability for torts occurring in the performance of a governmental function.the district court then granted summary judgment to wmata on kiska quantum meruit claim.after a trial on the remaining contract claims,the jury returned a verdict for wmata on both counts.the district court subsequently entered final judgment in wmata favor on march,and denied kiska motion for a new trial on august.
on appeal,kiska challenges three rulings that the district court august,opinion and order incorporated by reference.first,kiska argues that the district court erred in dismissing its tort claims on sovereign immunity grounds.second,kiska argues that the district court misinterpreted the contract dewatering provisions.third,kiska argues that the district court likewise misinterpreted the contract grout hole provisions.we find all three of kiska challenges to be without merit and,accordingly,affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
a.the street tunnel project 
this litigation arises out of the extension of wmata green line subway train under street in washington,before soliciting bids for the tunnel project,wmata retained an outside technical expert,gza geoenvironmental,gza,to analyze the subsurface conditions in the project area and to study the feasibility of various tunneling methods,tunneling equipment and dewatering systems.gza submitted its first tunnel alternative report tar in november.the first tar reported that g roundwater for most of the tunnel alignment is anticipated to be above the crown,the top of the tunnel,and that,in light of this soil condition,even fairly extensive dewatering was not likely to be entirely e ffective.joint appendix ja.accordingly,gza recommended not only that some type of closed face tunnel boring machine be used for the project,but also that open face tunneling be strictly prohibited on this contract.ja.
gza submitted a revised tar in january.the second tar reaffirmed the conclusions of the first,noting that dewatering considerations dictate closed face mining methods,ja,and that o pen faced tunneling in conjunction with dewatering is not judged a viable construction technique on this c ontract,ja.after reviewing the second tar,wmata board of engineers met with gza.shortly thereafter,in march,gza issued a third and final tar,which authorized the use of an open face machine,but cautioned that e xtensive dewatering will be an essential element of the open faced shield option.ja.noting that effective dewatering of the alignment is at best going to be difficult,the third tar recommended that an extensive improvement program be required for most of the alignment.ja.
following the issuance of the third tar,gza calculated the extent of the dewatering and grouting necessary to allow for open face tunneling.even extensive grouting would not permit open face tunneling,gza warned wmata,if groundwater is not depressed through dewatering the recommended two feet below tunnel invert,the bottom of the tunnel.ja.wmata then directed gza to design an appropriate dewatering system for the project.gza produced a dewatering design that included over three hundred dewatering wells.ja 
on december,wmata issued an invitation for bids ifb on the street tunnel project.the ifb set forth detailed design specifications and required bidders to submit bids for carrying out the work based upon those specifications wmata did not include gza tars in the bid package,however,nor did wmata conform the design specifications to gza recommended dewatering system.in particular,wmata design specifications called for only dewatering wells.ja.based upon the specifications provided by wmata,kiska submitted a bid of approximately million.wmata accepted kiska bid and,in early,the two parties signed a construction contract.
b.the dewatering and grout hole provisions 
section of the contract governed dewatering.it not only set forth a detailed dewatering system for the project,but also required kiska to implement the system specified therein the contractor shall proceed with the installation of the specified dewatering system as soon as possible after notice to proceed.contract,a.two subsections touched on the question whether the contract required the dewatering system to maintain the groundwater level at two feet below tunnel invert.section b read,in pertinent part,as follows 
for mined earth tunnels,additional wells beyond the specified minimum dewatering system may be required to effectively reduce hydrostatic pressure and control groundwater in soil surrounding each tunnel in order to prevent the following 
heaving of the invert,blowups,hazardous seepage and sudden flow of soil in tunnel face.
loss of ground and surface subsidence.
maintain groundwater feet below invert.
id,b.section a also addressed dewatering,stating that t he designed dewatering system may not eliminate all groundwater from the tunnel excavation.the contractor shall be prepared to support the tunnel face and to handle and convey groundwater from the tunnel to appropriate discharge locations.id,a.this subsection further provided that a dditional dewatering wells may be required based on the observed performance of the dewatering system.id.
section of the contract covered chemical grouting,specifying the precise location of thousands of surface grout holes to stabilize the soil around the tunnels.in particular,section b provided that p chemical grouting shall be preformed sic from the existing ground surface at locations shown on the contract drawings.id,b.although these drawings depicted grout holes drilled vertically at intervals in a diamond grid pattern,see ja,section a stated that grout piping should be installed horizontally,vertically or inclined,as required,contract,a.in the case of a discrepancy between drawings and specifications,the contract general provisions provided that the specifications shall govern.ja.
c.the rulings 
during the tunnel construction,kiska experienced a number of difficulties with both the dewatering system and the excavation methods required by the contract.two complications proved particularly troublesome the dewatering system specified by wmata failed to lower the groundwater table two feet below the tunnel invert and the great majority of surface grout holes could not be drilled vertically at their specified locations without damaging underground utility lines.although kiska overcame these difficulties and eventually completed the project,it did so at a cost of almost double its million bid.upon completion of the project,kiska filed a complaint against wmata asserting both tort and contract claims.
before the case went to trial,the district court issued several rulings,three of which kiska now challenges on appeal.first,the district court dismissed kiska tort claims on sovereign immunity grounds,holding that the challenged decisions are susceptible to policy judgment,and therefore immune from judicial review,because they involve planning and design rather than implementation or operation.kiska constr.wmata,civ.at,mem.first order.second,the district court held that the contract was ambiguous,but not patently so,with respect to whether the contract required that the dewatering system maintain the groundwater level at two feet below tunnel invert.kiska constr.wmata,civ.at june,mem.second order third,the district court held that while the contract affords no flexibility with regard to the locations of grout drillings,kiska constr.wmata,civ.at,mem.third order emphasis in original,the contract permitted kiska to drill all grout holes,including surface grout holes,horizontally,vertically or inclined,id.at quoting contract,a 
ii.analysis 
we review de novo the dismissal of kiska tort claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,accepting as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint sturm,ruger chao.we review the district court construction of the contract between kiska and wmata under the same de novo standard.ltv gulf states steel,cert.denied,d interpretation of the plain language of a contract is a question of law subject to de novo review by this court.
sovereign immunity 
on appeal,kiska argues that the district court erred by dismissing its two tort misrepresentation and negligent sovereign immunity grounds.rejecting the district court conclusion that wmata had broad discretion in defining the contours of the invitation for bids,first order at,kiska asserts that wmata lacks the discretion to conceal misrepresent material information from contractors and that such tortious conduct does not involve the exercise of a policy judgment,br.for appellant at.thus,kiska maintains,sovereign immunity does not shield wmata from kiska tort claims.
discretionary functions ministerial functions 
wmata is the product of an interstate compact entered into by maryland,virginia and the district of columbia.watters wmata.we have frequently recognized that,a s a entity created by its signatory parties,wmata is entitled to share the sovereign immunity of those parties with respect to common law tort actions.beatty wmata,quoting heffez wmata.we have also acknowledged,however,that section of the wmata compact provides a limited waiver of wmata sovereign immunity for torts committed in the conduct of any proprietary function,but not for torts occurring in the performance of a governmental function.beebe wmata,quoting ann.unless the limited waiver of immunity applies,the district court lacks jurisdiction to enter a judgment against wmata.watters,at.
because the distinction between proprietary and governmental functions has created a quagmire that has long plagued the law of municipal corporations,beatty,at quoting indian towing united states,we have interpreted section as incorporating the distinction between discretionary and ministerial functions,a dichotomy set forth in the federal tort claims act ftca,dant district of columbia.given that o nly those activities considered discretionary are shielded by sovereign immunity,burkhart wmata,wmata immunity turns on whether the challenged activity is discretionary or ministerial,beebe,at 
to determine whether a wmata activity is discretionary,and thus shielded by sovereign immunity,we apply a test culled from the ftca discretionary function jurisprudence see id.first,we ask whether any statute,regulation,or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow.id.quoting cope scott,quoting united states gaubert,d.if a course of action is so prescribed,sovereign immunity does not bar suits based on an employee failure to follow the prescribed course of conduct.burkhart,at.if the governing statutes or regulations leave room for the exercise of discretion,however,we ask a second question whether the exercise of discretion is grounded in social,economic,or political goals.beebe,at quoting cope,at quoting gaubert,at.at.if the exercise of discretion is so grounded,and hence susceptible to policy judgment,cope,at,the activity is governmental,thus falling within section retention of sovereign immunity,beebe,at.
the contents of the bid package a discretionary decision 
this case poses the following question does wmata discretion to select a particular project design encompass the discretion to determine the content of that project bid package on appeal,kiska answers this question in the negative,arguing that wmata lacks the discretion to conceal misrepresent material information from contractors and such tortious conduct does not involve the exercise of a policy judgment.br.for appellant at 
applying the analysis outlined above,see supra part,we find that kiska has failed to cite any statute,regulation or policy that specifically prescribes the content of wmata ifbs.unable to identify support for its position within the four corners of the wmata compact,kiska relies upon two external sources of authority to argue that wmata failed,in this case,to follow the prescribed course of conduct contract cases that recognize a government agency duty to disclose pertinent facts to contractors with whom the agency contracts,br.for appellant at,and a federal transit administration fta circular providing that all contract solicitations must i ncorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material,product,or service to be procured,id.at quoting ja.
kiska maintains that the general obligation to abide by the covenant of good faith and fair dealing specifically prescribed the contents of the bid package,requiring wmata to disclose to kiska all material information.we disagree.although the covenant of good faith and fair dealing undoubtedly constrains wmata behavior within the context of its contractual relationships,kiska misrepresentation claims sound in tort,not contract.given that section distinguishes between tort claims and contract claims,affording a limited waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to the former and a complete waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to the latter,ann,we must agree with the district court conclusion that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not the kind of specific dictate that renders wmata acts merely ministerial,first order at emphasis in original.burkhart,at holding that employment provisions of wmata compact hardly constrain wmata discretion over whom it will employ and how it will train and supervise employees.
the fta circular likewise fails to circumscribe wmata discretion with respect to the contents of the bid package a regulation constrains discretion if it specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow such that the employee has no rightful option but to adhere to the directive.gaubert,at.at quoting berkovitz united states,d.although the fta circular obligates wmata to i ncorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material,product,or service to be procured,ja,the circular does not specifically prescribe a course of action for wmata to follow in specifying the contents of a bid package.in our view,an administrative ukase that mandates only clarity and accuracy does not constrain wmata discretion with respect to the particular documents to include within a bid package.appalachian power epa.given kiska failure to produce persuasive authority to the contrary,we conclude that wmata had broad discretion to determine the contents of the tunnel project bid package 
next,kiska argues that wmata can not satisfy the second step of the sovereign immunity inquiry,whether the exercise of such discretion is grounded in social,economic,or political policy.cope,at internal quotations omitted.as we recognized in cope,d etermining whether a decision is essentially political,social,or economic is admittedly difficult,since nearly every government action is,at least to some extent,subject to policy analysis.id.quoting red lake band of chippewa indians united states.budgetary constraints,we observed,underlie virtually all economic activity.id.at quoting ara leisure servs.united states,cir.
to avoid the exception swallowing the rule,we have held that the mere association of a decision with regulatory concerns is not enough to render that decision discretionary exempt decisions are those fraught with public policy considerations.id.quoting sami united states.we therefore concluded in cope that t he mere presence of if that choice involves whether money should be not trigger the discretionary function exemption.id.
wmata argues that its employees had to,and did,exercise judgment when they decided that the bid package would not benefit from the inclusion of superseded,discarded design concepts.br.for appellee at.citing the court decision in red lake,wmata maintains that its decisions regarding the manner in which its policies are implemented or enforced are themselves discretionary because such decisions directly affect the feasibility and practicality of the program,and require the agency to establish priorities for the accomplishment of its policy objectives by balancing the objectives sought to be obtained against such practical considerations as staffing and funding.id.at quoting red lake,at internal quotations omitted.wmata thus reasons that its decision not to include thousands of pages of draft or superseded design documents in the bid package is a perfect example of such discretion.id.at.
while kiska claim presents a closer question than those decided in cases past,we believe that the district court correctly held that wmata discretionary decision to exclude certain design documents from the tunnel project bid package is susceptible to policy judgment.cope,at.specifically,wmata decision required consideration of budgetary constraints and economic expediency.while at first glance wmata fiscal considerations may appear to pale in comparison to those implicated in hiring decisions,see beebe,at burkhart,at,those considerations involve more than simply packaging,duplication and distribution costs.if wmata were to release unreliable or mistaken reports indicating an inflated need for dewatering wells,for example,the reports could cause contractors to similarly inflate their bids.of course,wmata may not withhold all unfavorable information from contractors if it did,wmata might soon find few firms willing to submit bids on its projects.wmata must therefore exercise its policy judgment to balance the goal of fair disclosure against the sensible withholding of unreliable information.
although kiska argues that wmata position assumes the merits of the issue,that the information concealed from bidders was not material,reply br.at emphasis in original,kiska position,in that the merits of a claim will rarely be known before a court establishes its jurisdiction over that permit endless contractor challenges to wmata final specifications.while kiska may disagree with wmata decisions regarding the materiality of a given set of documents,such judgments are,in our view,wmata to make.we therefore conclude that the content of the tunnel project bid package is a discretionary decision susceptible to policy judgment and,accordingly,affirm the district court dismissal of kiska tort claims on sovereign immunity grounds 
b.the contract provisions 
kiska remaining challenges involve the district court interpretation of two contract provisions section dewatering and section grouting.both challenges rely upon united states spearin,t he seminal case recognizing a cause of action for breach of contractual warranty of specifications,hercules united states,d,which held that if a contractor is bound to build according to plans and specifications prepared by the owner,the contractor will not be responsible for the consequences of defects in the plans and specifications,spearin,at.at.relying on spearin,kiska argues that wmata warranted by implication that its dewatering system would lower the groundwater table in the project area two feet below the tunnel invert and the surface grout holes required under the contract could be drilled vertically at the precise locations specified by wmata.
the dewatering system 
kiska maintains that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that the contract was ambiguous as to whether the contract thus the dewatering system would lower the groundwater table in the project area two feet below the tunnel invert.relying chiefly on section b,kiska argues that the contract specifically and unambiguously warranted that the groundwater table would be lowered two feet below the invert of the tunnel by the dewatering system wmata designed.in kiska view,none of the provisions relied on by wmata abrogates the clear statement contained in section b and,accordingly,kiska claims that its reading of the contract provides the only reasonable interpretation of the dewatering provisions contained therein.its argument fails.
section b provided that f or mined earth tunnels,additional wells beyond the specified minimum dewatering system may be required to control groundwater in the soil surrounding each tunnel in order to m aintain groundwater feet below invert.contract,b emphasis added.noting that the groundwater table could not be maintain ed two feet below the tunnel invert if it was not already at that level,kiska asserts that section required,and hence warranted,that wmata dewatering system would indeed lower the groundwater table to two feet below tunnel invert.in kiska view,its reading of section b is confirmed by section a a,which provided the water table shall be lowered as specified in the specification section.id,a a emphasis added.
wmata,however,reads section b not as an implied warranty but as a statement that the minimum dewatering system might not lower the groundwater to two feet below invert and that kiska might have to install additional wells to accomplish that goal.br.for appellee at emphasis in original according to wmata,section a likewise put kiska on notice that groundwater may remain in the tunnel despite the dewatering system.contract,a the designed dewatering system may not eliminate all groundwater from the tunnel excavation.wmata further asserts that both section a and section a suggest that groundwater could remain above the tunnel invert without violating the contract.id,a providing that kiska must c ontrol groundwater along the tunnel alignment and within the tunnel heading to prevent certain specified events from occurring emphasis added id,a if the tunnel invert is below groundwater level,kiska must maintain qualified personnel on duty to monitor conditions that might threaten stability of heading whenever tunnel excavation is suspended or shut down.emphasis added.
the law requires contracts to be read as a whole,with meaning given to every provision contained therein.see fort sumter tours,babbitt,citing united states ins.of,noting the cardinal principle of contract construction that a document should be read to give effect to all its provisions quoting mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d.if the contract is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,however,the court must find that the contract is ambiguous as a matter of law.metric constructors,nasa.
if the court finds the contract to be ambiguous,it must then determine whether that ambiguity is patent or latent.id.an ambiguity is patent if it is glaring,substantial,or patently obvious.comtrol,united states.patent ambiguities are construed against a government contractor absent an inquiry about the correct meaning of the terms at issue.burke united states.if the ambiguity is neither glaring nor substantial nor patently obvious,grumman data.dalton,internal quotations omitted,however,and therefore latent,the ambiguity is ordinarily construed against the drafting party,see,jowett,united states.
applying these principles,the district court concluded that both kiska and wmata proposed reasonable interpretations of the contract dewatering provisions,holding the contract to be ambiguous,but not patently so.second order at.we disagree and find the provisions to be.
although kiska provides a sensible explanation for each of the provisions relied upon by wmata we do not accept kiska assertion that section b provided a clear statement that wmata warranted that its design would lower the groundwater table two feet below tunnel invert.the grammatical difficulties of the provision aside,see infra note,section b can not,in our opinion,carry the interpretive weight placed upon it by kiska.contract,b.section a a likewise fails to advance kiska cause as it appears to speak to the manner of dewatering and not to the level at which the groundwater must be maintained.id,a a.
in our view,the grammatical errors of section b render the ambiguity of the dewatering provisions sufficiently obvious that kiska had a duty to inquire as to the true meaning
