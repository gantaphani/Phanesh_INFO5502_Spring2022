the metropolitan washington airports authority mwaa is a regional entity created by the virginia general assembly and the district of columbia city council for the purpose of operating the federally owned international airport and ronald reagan washington national airport.the metropolitan washington airports act of,see,stat.codified as amended at west supp the enabling act,authorized the transfer of the control and operation of these airports to mwaa via a lease the lease between the secretary of transportation and mwaa,see a.
in august,mwaa issued a request for proposals for the dulles taxicab concession contract.appellant transportation,wdt,the incumbent taxi concessionaire,submitted a proposal but was not awarded the contract.mwaa business administration committee instead selected dulles taxi systems,to receive the taxi concession.wdt filed an action in federal court first seeking a declaration that mwaa decision violated the enabling act and the lease,and also seeking an injunction barring mwaa from awarding the taxi concession to dulles taxi and directing mwaa to give the concession to wdt.the district court subsequently dismissed wdt complaint for want of subject matter jurisdiction.on appeal,we are asked to decide whether the district court had jurisdiction over this matter and,if so,whether wdt has standing to bring this action in the first place.we answer both questions in the affirmative.accordingly,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
before congress enacted legislation authorizing the secretary of transportation to transfer control of dulles and reagan national airports,the commonwealth of virginia and the district of columbia,acting pursuant to an interstate compact,jointly created mwaa for the sole purpose of leasing dulles and reagan national airports from the federal government.see.acts ch,repealed by.acts ch.to be codified at ann.ann.virginia and the district of columbia enacted similar statutes that conferred on mwaa various powers and assigned it various duties.see.acts ch.to be codified at ann.ann.under both statutory schemes,the courts of the commonwealth of virginia are vested with original jurisdiction of all actions brought by or against mwaa,which courts shall in all cases apply the law of the commonwealth of virginia.acts ch.to be codified at ann.a see ann.a.virginia courts are given jurisdiction over lawsuits against mwaa for breach of contract,see.acts ch.to be codified at ann.b ann.b however,neither the virginia code nor the specifically purports to give virginia courts jurisdiction over actions against mwaa to force it to adhere to the terms of the lease.
thus,when congress passed the enabling act,it did so with the knowledge that the state statutes creating mwaa broadly conferred jurisdiction to virginia courts over legal actions involving mwaa.recognizing a continuing but limited federal interest,in the operation of the two airports that can be provided through a lease mechanism which provides for local control and operation,congress dictated various requirements that the lease must satisfy.moreover,congress granted the federal courts jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of the lease the district courts of the united states have jurisdiction to compel the airports authority and its officers and employees to comply with the terms of the lease.c.the parties,however,dispute whether this action technically qualifies as one to compel mwaa to comply with the lease under c.
the enabling act prescribes a number of mandatory provisions that must be included in the lease.see a.the lease,in turn,specifically incorporates these mandatory terms.the enabling act requires the lease to provide that i n acquiring by contract supplies or services for an amount estimated to be more than,or awarding concession contracts,the airports authority to the maximum extent practicable shall obtain complete and open competition through the use of published competitive procedures.a emphasis added.section.of the lease more or less incorporates this provision,except that the lease employs the phrase full and open competition.congress determined that the lease must also include a provision directing mwaa to develop a code of ethics and financial disclosure to ensure the integrity of all decisions made by its board of directors and employees.a.this provision is contained in section of the lease.
the lease also incorporates a number of the enabling act other provisions even though these provisions are not statutorily required to be made part of the lease.for example,the enabling act subjects mwaa contracts to review to ensure the contracts were awarded by procedures that follow sound government contracting principles,see g,and the lease provides for such a review as well.the lease incorporates the enabling act prohibition against board members and their immediate families working for or holding a substantial financial interest in any entity that has or is seeking a contract or agreement with the authority.d.the code of ethics that mwaa is directed to develop must include standards for determining what constitutes a substantial financial interest under d.see a.in addition to incorporating specific statutory requirements,the lease also includes a requirement that mwaa comply with the conditions imposed by the enabling act.
mwaa adopted a contracting policies and procedures manual the contracting manual expressly for the purpose of fulfilling the legislative and lease requirements for published competitive procedures.the contracting manual provides that when a request for proposals is issued,as in this case,the proposals are evaluated and scored against predetermined evaluation criteria and mwaa select s the proposal which offers the greatest overall benefit to the mwaa in terms of the evaluation criteria listed in the request for proposals.wdt argues that its action for declaratory and injunctive relief is an attempt to compel mwaa to comply with these provisions of the lease.
wdt complaint alleges that mwaa issued a formal request for proposals that disclosed the criteria mwaa would use in selecting the best proposal.an evaluation team reviewed the proposals and determined that wdt proposal scored higher under these criteria than any other proposal and recommended that the concession be awarded to wdt.wdt proposal,according to the complaint,was also the most financially advantageous proposal submitted to mwaa.nevertheless,mwaa business administration committee voted to reject the evaluation team recommendation and to award the taxi concession to dulles taxi.subsequently,one of the members of the business administration committee revealed that his law firm represented an entity that was partially owned by dulles taxi principals and recused himself from further involvement in mwaa request for proposals for the taxi concession.wdt formally protested mwaa selection of dulles taxi.mwaa permitted wdt and dulles taxi to present additional information to the business administration committee,but the committee was not persuaded to change its recommendation that dulles taxi be awarded the taxi concession.subsequently,mwaa board of directors denied wdt protest.
in its complaint,wdt contends that mwaa deviated from its published competitive procedures in refusing to award the taxi concession to wdt,which scored the highest on the selection criteria and received the recommendation of the evaluation team,and failed,therefore,to obtain full and open competition.a,or comply with sound government contracting principles,g,in violation of the enabling act and the lease.additionally,wdt contends that the competitive nature of the procurement process was tainted by the business administration committee member conflict of interest.
the district court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction.the court reasoned that federal courts have jurisdiction to decide whether mwaa has adopted competitive bid procedures that satisfy the mandate of the enabling act and that a federal court may entertain a facial challenge to the sufficiency of the published competitive procedures used by mwaa.however,the district court concluded that when the application of the published
