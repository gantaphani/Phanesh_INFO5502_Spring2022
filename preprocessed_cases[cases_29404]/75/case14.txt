petitioner lozman floating home was a plywood structure with empty bilge space underneath the main floor to keep it afloat.he had it towed several times before deciding on a marina owned by the city of riviera beach city.after various disputes with lozman and unsuccessful efforts to evict him from the marina,the city brought a federal admiralty lawsuit in rem against the floating home,seeking a lien for dockage fees and damages for trespass.lozman moved to dismiss the suit for lack of admiralty jurisdiction.the district court found the floating home to be a vessel under the rules of construction act,which defines a vessel as including every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used,or capable of being used,as a means of transportation on water,concluded that admiralty jurisdiction was proper,and awarded the city dockage fees and nominal damages.the eleventh circuit affirmed,agreeing that the home was a vessel since it was capable of movement over water despite petitioner subjective intent to remain moored indefinitely.
this case is not moot.the district court ordered the floating home sold,and the city purchased the home at auction and had it destroyed.before the sale,the court ordered the city to post a bond to ensure lozman could obtain monetary relief if he prevailed.
lozman floating home is not a vessel.
a the eleventh circuit found the home capable of being used as a means of transportation on water because it could float and proceed under tow and its shore connections did not render it incapable of transportation.this interpretation is too broad.the definition of transportation,the conveyance of persons or things from one place to another,must be applied in a practical way.stewart dutra constr.consequently,a structure does not fall within the scope of the statutory phrase unless a reasonable observer,looking to the home physical characteristics and activities,would consider it designed to a practical degree for carrying people or things over water.
b but for the fact that it floats,nothing about lozman home suggests that it was designed to any practical degree to transport persons or things over water.it had no steering mechanism,had an unraked hull and rectangular bottom inches below the water,and had no capacity to generate or store electricity.it also lacked,differing significantly from an ordinary houseboat.
c this view of the statute is consistent with its text,precedent,and relevant purposes.the statute language,read naturally,lends itself to that interpretation the term contrivance refers to something employed in contriving to effect a purpose craft explains that purpose as water carriage and transport the addition of water to craft emphasizes the point and the words,used,or capable of being used,as a means of transportation on water,drive the point home.both evansville bowling green packet chero cola bottling,and stewart,supra,support this conclusion.evansville involved a wharfboat floated next to a dock,used to transfer cargo,and towed to harbor each winter and stewart involved a dredge used to remove silt from the ocean floor,which carried a captain and crew and could be navigated only by manipulating anchors and cables or by being towed.water transportation was not the primary purpose of either structure neither was in motion at relevant times and both were sometimes attached to the ocean bottom or to land.however,stewart dredge,which was regularly,but not primarily,used to transport workers and equipment over water,fell within the statutory definition while evansville wharfboat,which was not designed to,and did not,serve a transportation function,did not.lower court cases,on balance,also tend to support this conclusion.further,the purposes of major federal maritime statutes,admiralty provisions provide special attachment procedures lest a vessel avoid liability by sailing away,recognize that sailors face special perils at sea,and encourage shipowners to engage in commerce reveal little reason to classify floating homes as vessels.finally,this conclusion is consistent with state laws in states where floating home owners have congregated in communities.
d several important arguments made by the city and its amici are unavailing.they argue that a test may introduce a subjective element into vessel determinations.but the court has considered only objective evidence,looking to the views of a reasonable observer and the physical attributes and behavior of the structure.they also argue against using criteria that are too abstract,complex,or.while this court approach is neither perfectly precise nor always determinative,it is workable and consistent and should offer guidance in a significant number of borderline cases.and contrary to the dissent suggestion,the court sees nothing to be gained by a remand.
e the city additional argument that lozman floating home was actually used for transportation over water is similarly unpersuasive.

fane lozman,petitioner v.the city of riviera beach,florida 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
the rules of construction act defines a vessel as including every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used,or capable of being used,as a means of transportation on water.the question before us is whether petitioner floating home which is not falls within the terms of that definition.
in answering that question we focus primarily upon the phrase capable of being used.this term encompasses practical possibilities,not merely theoretical ones.stewart dutra constr.we believe that a reasonable observer,looking to the home physical characteristics and activities,would not consider it to be designed to any practical degree for carrying people or things on water.and we consequently conclude that the floating home is not a vessel.
in fane lozman,petitioner,bought a by floating home.app.the home consisted of a plywood structure with french doors on three sides,at.it contained a sitting room,bedroom,closet,bathroom,and kitchen,along with a stairway leading to a second level with office space,at.an empty bilge space underneath the main floor kept it afloat,at.see appendix,infra,for a photograph.after buying the floating home,lozman had it towed about miles to north bay village,florida,where he moored it and then twice more had it towed between nearby marinas.in lozman had the home towed a further miles to a marina owned by the city of riviera beach city,respondent,where he kept it docked.brief for respondent.
after various disputes with lozman and unsuccessful efforts to evict him from the marina,the city brought this federal admiralty lawsuit in rem against the floating home.it sought a maritime lien for dockage fees and damages for trespass.see federal maritime lien act,authorizing federal maritime lien against vessel to collect debts owed for the provision of necessaries to a vessel civil admiralty jurisdiction.see also leon galceran,wall.the rock island bridge,wall.
lozman,acting pro se,asked the district court to dismiss the suit on the ground that the court lacked admiralty jurisdiction.see record,doc.after summary judgment proceedings,the court found that the floating home was a vessel and concluded that admiralty jurisdiction was consequently proper.pet.for cert.the judge then conducted a bench trial on the merits and awarded the city for dockage along with in nominal damages for trespass,at.
on appeal the eleventh circuit affirmed.riviera beach v.that certain unnamed gray,vessel approximately feet in length.it agreed with the district court that the home was a vessel.in its view,the home was capable of movement over water and the owner subjective intent to remain moored indefinitely at a dock could not show the contrary,at.
lozman sought certiorari.in light of uncertainty among the circuits about application of the term capable we granted his petition.compare de la rosa charles gaming,structure is not a vessel where physically,but only theoretical ly,capable of sailing,and owner intends to moor it indefinitely as floating casino,with board of comm rs of or leans levee dist.belle of orleans,structure is a vessel where capable of moving over water under tow,albeit to her detriment,despite intent to moor indefinitely.see also,at rejecting views of circuits that focus on the intent of the shipowner 
at the outset we consider one threshold matter.the district court ordered the floating home sold to satisfy the city judgment.the city bought the home at public auction and subsequently had it destroyed.and,after the parties filed their merits briefs,we ordered further briefing on the question of mootness in light of the home destruction.the parties now have pointed out that,prior to the home sale,the district court ordered the city to post a bond to secure lozman value in the vessel.record,doc.the bond ensures that lozman can obtain monetary relief if he ultimately prevails.we consequently agree with the parties that the case is not moot.
we focus primarily upon the statutory phrase capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.the court of appeals found that the home was capable of transportation because it could float,it could proceed under tow,and its shore connections power cable,water hose,rope lines did not rende r it practically incapable of transportation or movement.at quoting belle of orleans,supra,at,in turn quoting stewart,at.at least for argument sake we agree with the court of appeals about the point,namely that lozman shore connections did not render the home practically incapable of transportation.but unlike the eleventh circuit,we do not find these considerations even when combined with the home other characteristics sufficient to show that lozman home was a vessel.
the court of appeals recognized that it had applied the term capable broadly,at.indeed,it pointed with approval to language in an earlier case,burks american river transp,in which the fifth circuit said 
no doubt the three men in a tub would also fit within our definition,and one probably could make a convincing case for jonah inside the whale.at brackets omitted quoting burks,supra,at.
but the eleventh circuit interpretation is too broad.not every floating structure is a vessel.to state the obvious,a wooden washtub,a plastic dishpan,a swimming platform on pontoons,a large fishing net,a door taken off its hinges,or pinocchio when inside the whale are not vessels,even if they are artificial contrivance s capable of floating,moving under tow,and incidentally carrying even a item or two when they do so.rather,the statute applies to an artificial contrivance capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.emphasis added.t ransportation involves the conveyance of things or persons from one place to another.oxford english dictionary ed.oed.accord,webster,an american dictionary of the english language goodrich porter eds.t he act of transporting,carrying,or conveying from one place to another and we must apply this definition in a practical,not a theoretical,way.stewart,supra,at.consequently,in our view a structure does not fall within the scope of this statutory phrase unless a reasonable observer,looking to the home physical characteristics and activities,would consider it designed to a practical degree for carrying people or things over water.
though our criterion is general,the facts of this case illustrate more specifically what we have in mind.but for the fact that it floats,nothing about lozman home suggests that it was designed to any practical degree to transport persons or things over water.it had no rudder or other steering mechanism,at.its hull was unraked,and it had a rectangular bottom inches below the water.brief for petitioner app.it had no special capacity to generate or store electricity but could obtain that utility only through ongoing connections with the land,at.its small rooms looked like ordinary nonmaritime living quarters.and those inside those rooms looked out upon the world,not through watertight portholes,but through french doors or ordinary windows,at.
although lack of is not dispositive,the robert parsons,it may be a relevant physical characteristic.and lozman home differs significantly from an ordinary houseboat in that it has no ability to propel itself.cfr houseboat means a motorized vessel designed primarily for accommodation spaces with low freeboard and little or no foredeck or cockpit emphasis added.lozman home was able to travel over water only by being towed.prior to its arrest,that home travel by tow over water took place on only four occasions over a period of seven years.supra,at.and when the home was towed a significant distance in,the towing company had a second boat follow behind to prevent the home from swinging dangerously from side to side.app.
the home has no other feature that might suggest a design to transport over water anything other than its own furnishings and related personal effects.in a word,we can find nothing about the home that could lead a reasonable observer to consider it designed to a practical degree for transportation on water.
our view of the statute is consistent with its text,precedent,and relevant purposes.for one thing,the statute language,read naturally,lends itself to that interpretation.we concede that the statute uses the word every,referring to every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance.emphasis added.but the term contrivance refers to something contrived for,or employed in contriving to effect a purpose.oed def.the term craft explains that purpose as water carriage and transport.at def.v b defining craft as a vesse l for that purpose.the of the word water to craft,yielding the term watercraft,emphasizes the point.and the next few words,used,or capable of being used,as a means of transportation on water,drive the point home.
for another thing,the bulk of precedent supports our conclusion.in evansville bowling green packet chero cola bottling,the court held that a wharfboat was not a vessel.the wharfboat floated next to a dock it was used to transfer cargo from ship to dock and ship to ship and it was connected to the dock with cables,utility lines,and a ramp,at.at the same time,it was capable of being towed.and it was towed each winter to a harbor to avoid river ice,at.the court reasoned that,despite the annual movement under tow,the wharfboat was not used to carry freight from one place to another,nor did it encounter perils of navigation to which craft used for transportation are exposed.at.see appendix,infra,for photograph of a period wharfboat.
the court reasoning in stewart also supports our conclusion.we there considered the application of the statutory definition to a dredge,at.the dredge was a massive floating platform from which a suspended clamshell bucket would remov e silt from the ocean floor,depositing it onto one of two scows floating alongside the dredge,at.like more traditional seagoing vessels,the dredge had,a captain and crew,navigational lights,ballast tanks,and a crew dining area.ibid.unlike more ordinary vessels,it could navigate only by manipulating its anchors and cables or by being towed.ibid.nonetheless it did move.in fact it moved over water every couple of hours.at.
we held that the dredge was a vessel.we wrote that definition merely codified the meaning that the term vessel had acquired in general maritime law.at.we added that the question of the watercraft use as a means of transportation on water is practical,and not merely theoretical.at.and we pointed to cases holding that dredges ordinarily served a waterborne transportation function,namely that in performing their work they carried machinery,equipment,and crew over water.at citing,butler ellis.
as the court of appeals pointed out,in stewart we also wrote that does not require that a watercraft be used primarily for that transportation purpose,at that a watercraft need not be in motion to qualify as a vessel,and that a structure may qualify as a vessel even if attached but not permanently attached to the land or ocean floor,at.we did not take these statements,however,as implying a universal set of sufficient conditions for application of the definition.rather,they say,and they mean,that the statutory definition may or may not apply not that it automatically must apply where a structure has some other primary purpose,where it is stationary at relevant times,and where it is attached but not permanently attached to land.
after all,a washtub is normally not a vessel though it does not have water transportation as its primary purpose,it may be stationary much of the time,and it might be attached but not permanently attached to land.more to the point,water transportation was not the primary purpose of either stewart dredge or evansville wharfboat neither structure was in motion at relevant times and both were sometimes attached though not permanently attached to the ocean bottom or to land.nonetheless stewart dredge fell within the statute definition while evansville wharfboat did not.
the basic difference,we believe,is that the dredge was regularly,but not primarily,used and designed in part to be used to transport workers and equipment over water while the wharfboat was not designed to any practical degree to serve a transportation function and did not do so.compare cope vallette dry dock,floating drydock not a vessel because permanently fixed to wharf,with jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,barge sometimes attached to river bottom to use as a work platform remains a vessel when at other times it was used for transportation see also ibid.citing great lakes dredge dock chicago,a craft is a vessel if its purpose is to some reasonable degree the transportation of passengers,cargo,or equipment from place to place across navigable waters cope,supra,at describing as potentially a vessel because it is a navigable structure,used for the purpose of transportation benedict on admiralty,ed.maritime jurisdiction proper if the craft is a navigable structure intended for maritime transportation 
lower court cases also tend,on balance,to support our conclusion.see,bernard binnings constr,work punt lacking features objectively indicating a transportation function not a vessel,for our decisions make clear that the mere capacity to float or move across navigable waters does not necessarily make a structure a vessel ruddiman v.a scow platform,sdny scow,though capable of being towed though not without some difficulty,from its clumsy structure just a floating box,not a vessel,because it was not designed or used for the purpose of navigation,not engaged in the transportation of persons or cargo,and had no motive power,no rudder,no sails see also schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law,ed.courts have found that floating s,floating platforms,barges,or rafts used for construction or repair of piers,docks,bridges,pipelines and other similar facilities are not vessels benedict,american admiralty,ed.defining vessel as a machine adapted to transportation over rivers,seas,and oceans 
we recognize that some lower court opinions can be read as endorsing the anything that floats approach.see miami river boat yard,houseboat,houseboat lacking sea village marina,llc v.a carlcraft houseboat,wl,d nj,following miami river boat yard hudson harbor street boat basin,sea casa,supp,sdny same.holmes atlantic sounding,floating dormitory summerlin massman constr,derrick anchored in the river engaged in building a bridge is a vessel.for the reasons we have stated,we find such an approach inappropriate and inconsistent with our precedents.
further,our examination of the purposes of major federal maritime statutes reveals little reason to classify floating homes as vessels.admiralty law,for example,provides special attachment procedures lest a vessel avoid liability by sailing away.ed.and supp.iv.liability statutes such as the jones act recognize that sailors face the special perils of the sea.chandris,latsis,referring to vessel s in navigation certain admiralty tort doctrines can encourage shipowners to engage in commerce,executive jet aviation,cleveland.and maritime safety statutes subject vessels to coast guard inspections.
lozman,however,can not easily escape liability by sailing away in his home.he faces no special sea dangers.he does not significantly engage in commerce.and the solicitor general tells us that to adopt a version of the anything that floats test would place unnecessary and undesirable inspection burdens upon the coast guard.brief for united states as amicus curiae.
finally,our conclusion is consistent with state laws in states where floating home owners have congregated in communities.see brief for seattle floating homes association et as amici curiae.a washington state environmental statute,for example,defines a floating home for regulatory purposes as a dwelling unit constructed on a float,that is moored,anchored,or otherwise secured in waters,and is not a vessel,even though it may be capable of being towed.code ann.b ii supp.a california statute defines a floating home for tax purposes as a floating structure that is designed and built to be used,or is modified to be used,as a stationary waterborne residential dwelling,and which unlike a typical houseboat,has no independent power generation,and is dependent on shore utilities.cal.health safety code ann.d west.these states,we are told,treat structures that meet their floating home definitions like ordinary homes rather than like vessels.brief for seattle floating homes association.consistency of interpretation of related state and federal laws is a virtue in that it helps to create simplicity making the law easier to understand and to follow for lawyers and for nonlawyers alike.and that consideration here supports our conclusion.
the city and supporting amici make several important arguments that warrant our response.first,they argue against use of any test lest we introduce into vessel determinations a subjective element namely,the owner intent.that element,they say,is often unverifiable and too easily manipulated.its introduction would foment unpredictability and invite gamesmanship.brief for respondent.
we agree with the city about the need to eliminate the consideration of evidence of subjective intent.but we can not agree that the need requires abandonment of all criteria based on purpose.stewart,at discussing transportation purpose.indeed,it is difficult,if not impossible,to determine the use of a human contrivance without some consideration of human purposes.at the same time,we have sought to avoid subjective elements,such as owner intent,by permitting consideration only of objective evidence of a waterborne transportation purpose.that is why we have referred to the views of a reasonable observer.supra,at.and it is why we have looked to the physical attributes and behavior of the structure,as objective manifestations of any relevant purpose,and not to the subjective intent of the owner.supra,at.we note that various admiralty treatises refer to the use of tests without any suggestion that administration of those tests has introduced too much subjectivity into the process.benedict on admiralty admiralty and maritime law.
second,the city,with support of amici,argues against the use of criteria that are too abstract,complex,or.brief for respondent.a court jurisdiction,admiralty jurisdiction,may turn on application of the term vessel.and jurisdictional tests,often applied at the outset of a case,should be as simple as possible.hertz friend,slip,at.
we agree with the sentiment.and we also understand that our approach is neither perfectly nor always determinative.satisfaction of a or criterion,for example,is not always sufficient for application of the statutory word vessel.a craft whose physical characteristics and activities objectively evidence a waterborne transportation purpose or function may still be rendered a nonvessel by later physical alterations.for example,an owner might take a structure that is otherwise a vessel even the queen mary and connect it permanently to the land for use,say,as a hotel.see stewart,supra,at.further,changes over time may produce a new form,a newly designed structure in which case it may be the new that is relevant.see kathriner unisea,floating processing plant was no longer a vessel where a large opening had been cut into her hull 
nor is satisfaction of the criterion always a necessary condition,see part iv,infra.it is conceivable that an owner might actually use a floating structure not designed to any practical degree for transportation as,say,a ferry boat,regularly transporting goods and persons over water.
nonetheless,we believe the criterion we have used,taken together with our example of its application here,should offer guidance in a significant number of borderline cases where capacity to transport over water is in doubt.moreover,borderline cases will always exist they require a method for resolution we believe the method we have used is workable and,unlike,say,an anything that floats test,it is consistent with statutory text,purpose,and precedent.nor do we believe that the dissent approach would prove any more workable.for example,the dissent suggests a relevant distinction between an owner clothes and personal effects and large appliances like an oven or a refrigerator.post,at opinion of sotomayor.but a transportation function need not turn on the size of the items in question,and we believe the line between items being transported from place to place,cargo and items that are mere appurtenances is the one more likely to be relevant.benedict,american admiralty,at a ship is usually described as consisting of the ship,her tackle,apparel,and furniture 
finally,the dissent and the solicitor general as amicus for lozman argue that a remand is warranted for further factfinding.see post,at brief for united states as amicus curiae.but neither the city nor lozman makes such a request.brief for respondent.and the only potentially relevant factual dispute the dissent points to is that the home suffered serious damage during a tow.post,at.but this would add support to our ultimate conclusion that this floating home was not a vessel.we consequently see nothing to be gained by a remand.
although we have focused on the phrase capable of being used for transportation over water,the statute also includes as a vessel a structure that is actually used for that transportation.emphasis added.and the city argues that,irrespective of its design,lozman floating home was actually so used.brief for respondent.we are not persuaded by its argument.
we are willing to assume for argument sake that sometimes it is possible actually to use for water transportation a structure that is in no practical way designed for that purpose.see supra,at.but even so,the city can not show the actual use for which it argues.lozman floating home moved only under tow.before its arrest,it moved significant distances only twice in seven years.and when it moved,it carried,not passengers or cargo,but at the very most giving the benefit of any factual ambiguity to the city only its own furnishings,its owner personal effects,and personnel present to assure the home safety,at brief for respondent tr.of oral arg.this is far too little actual use to bring the floating home within the terms of the statute.see evansville,at wharfboat not a vessel even though e ach winter it was towed to a harbor to protect it from ice see also roper united states,unlike a barge,the harry lane was not moved in order to transport commodities from one location to another see also supra,at.
for these reasons,the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.
it is so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice sotomayor,with whom justice kennedy joins,dissenting.
i agree with much of the court reasoning.our precedents fully support the court reasoning that the eleventh circuit test is overinclusive that the subjective intentions of a watercraft owner or designer play no role in the vessel analysis of and that an objective assessment of a watercraft purpose or function governs whether that structure is a vessel.the court,however,creates a novel and unnecessary reasonable observer reformulation of these principles and errs in its determination,under this new standard,that the craft before us is not a vessel.given the underdeveloped record below,we should remand.therefore,i respectfully dissent.
the relevant statute,sweeps broadly.stewart dutra constr.it provides that t he word vessel includes every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used,or capable of being used,as a means of transportation on water.this broad phrasing flows from admiralty law long recognition that vessels come in many shapes and sizes.see benedict,american admiralty,ed.v essel,is a general word,many times used for any kind of navigation cohen,admiralty jurisdiction,law,and practice t he term vessel shall be understood to comprehend every description of vessel navigating on any sea or channel,lake or river 
our test for vessel status has remained the same for decades under,a vessel is any watercraft practically capable of maritime transportation stewart,at see also evansville bowling green packet chero cola bottling,cope vallette dry dock.at its core,vessel status has always rested upon the objective physical characteristics of a vessel such as its structure,shape,and materials of construction,as well as its usage history.but over time,several important principles have guided both this court and the lower courts in determining what kinds of watercraft fall properly within the scope of admiralty jurisdiction.
consider the most basic of requirements.for a watercraft to be practically capable of maritime transportation,it must first be capable of such transportation.only those structures that can simultaneously float and carry people or things over water are even presumptively within reach.stopping here,as the eleventh circuit essentially did,results in an overinclusive test.section,after all,does not drag every bit of floating and towable flotsam and jetsam into admiralty jurisdiction.rather,the terms capable of being used and practical have real significance in our maritime jurisprudence.
a water craft is not capable of being used for maritime transport in any meaningful sense if it has been permanently moored.stewart,at.so,to take an obvious example,a floating bridge over water does not constitute a vessel such mooring is clearly permanent.the rock island bridge,wall.less dramatically,a watercraft whose objective physical connections to land evidence a permanent location does not fall within ambit.see,evansville,at the wharfboat served at evansville as an office,warehouse and wharf,and was not taken from place to place.the connections with the water,electric light and telephone systems of the city evidence a permanent location dunklin louisiana riverboat gaming partnership,wl,may,per curiam describing a fully functional casino boat placed in an enclosed pond in a cofferdam put plainly,structures permanently affixed to shore or resting on the ocean floor,stewart,at,have never been treated as vessels for the purposes of.
our precedents have also excluded from vessel status those watercraft rendered practically incapable of transportation or movement.at.take the easiest case,a vessel whose physical characteristics have been so altered as to make waterborne transportation a practical impossibility.ibid.explaining that a floating processing plant was no longer a vessel where a large opening had been cut into her hull,rendering her incapable of moving over the water quoting kathriner unisea.the longstanding admiralty exception for dead ships,those watercraft that require a major overhaul for their reactivation,also falls into this category.see roper united states,finding that a liberty ship deactivated from service and mothballed is not a vessel in navigation see generally rutherglen,dead ships,maritime comm.likewise,ships that have been withdrawn from the water for extended periods of time in order to facilitate repairs and reconstruction may lose their status as vessels until they are rendered capable of maritime transport.stewart,at.west united states,noting that the mary austin was withdrawn from any operation whatever while in storage with the fleet and that t he mary austin,as anyone could see,was not in maritime service.she was undergoing major repairs and complete renovation 
finally,our maritime jurisprudence excludes from vessel status those floating structures that,based on their physical characteristics,do not transport people,freight,or cargo from place to place as one of their purposes.stewart,at.purpose,in this context,is determined solely by an objective inquiry into a craft function.n either size,form,equipment nor means of propulsion are determinative factors upon the question of vessel status,though all may be considered.the robert parsons.moreover,in assessing a particular structure function,we have consistently examined its past and present activities.stewart,at cope,at.of course,a seaborne craft is not excluded from vessel status simply because its primary purpose is not maritime transport.stewart,at.we held as much in stewart when we concluded that a dredge was a vessel notwithstanding that its primary purpose was dredging rather than transportation.at.so long as one purpose of a craft is transportation,whether of cargo or people or both,practical capability requirement is satisfied.
certainly,difficult and marginal cases will arise.fortunately,courts do not consider each floating structure anew.so,for example,when we were confronted in stewart with the question whether a dredge is a vessel,we did not commence with a clean slate we instead sought guidance from previous cases that had confronted similar structures.see,at,and see also norton warner,likewise surveying earlier cases.
in sum,our precedents offer substantial guidance for how objectively to determine whether a watercraft is practically capable of maritime transport and thus qualifies as a vessel.first,the capacity to float and carry things or people is an obvious prerequisite to vessel status.second,structures or ships that are permanently moored or fixed in place are not vessels.likewise,structures that are practically incapable of maritime transport are not vessels,whether they are ships that have been altered so that they may no longer be put to sea,dead ships,or ships removed from navigation for extended periods of time.third,those watercraft whose physical characteristics and usage history reveal no maritime transport purpose or use are not vessels.
the majority does not appear to disavow the legal principles described above.the majority apparently accepts that permanent mooring suffices to take a ship out of vessel status,ante,at,and that a craft whose physical characteristics and activities objectively evidence a waterborne transportation purpose or function may still be rendered a nonvessel by later physical alterations,ante,at no one argues that lozman craft was permanently moored,see app.describing the deteriorated ropes holding the craft in place,or that it had undergone physical alterations sufficient to take it out of vessel status,see tr.of oral arg.lozman counsel arguing that the craft was never a vessel in the first place.our precedents make clear that the eleventh circuit anything that floats test is overinclusive and ignores that purpose is a crucial factor in determining whether a particular craft is or is not a vessel.accordingly,the majority is correct that determining whether lozman craft is a vessel hinges on whether that craft had any maritime transportation purpose or function.
the majority errs,though,in concluding that the purpose component of the test is whether a reasonable observer,looking to the craft physical characteristics and activities,would not consider it to be designed to any practical degree for carrying people or things on water.ante,at.this phrasing has never appeared in any of our cases and the majority use of it,despite its seemingly objective gloss,effectively and erroneously introduces a subjective component into the inquiry.
for one thing,in applying this test the majority points to some characteristics of lozman craft that have no relationship to maritime transport,such as the style of the craft rooms or that those inside those rooms looked out upon the world,not through portholes,but through french doors or ordinary windows.ante,at.the majority never explains why it believes these particular esthetic elements are important for determining vessel status.in fact,they are not.section is focused on whether a structure is used,or capable of being used,as a means of transportation on water.by importing windows,doors,room style,and other esthetic criteria into the analysis,the majority gives our vessel test an i know it when i see it flavor.jacobellis ohio,stewart,concurring.but that has never been nor should it be the test a badly designed and unattractive vessel is different from a structure that lacks any practical capacity for maritime transport.in the majority eyes,the two appear to be one and the same.
the majority treatment of the craft past voyages is also strange.the majority notes that lozman craft could be and was,in fact,towed over long distances,including over miles at one point.ante,at.but the majority determines that,given the design of lozman craft,this is far too little actual use to bring the floating home within the terms of the statute.ante,at.this is because when it moved,it carried,not passengers or cargo,but at the very most giving the benefit of any factual ambiguity to the city only its own furnishings,its owner personal effects,and personnel present to assure the home safety.ante,at.
i find this analysis confusing.the majority accepts that the record indicates that lozman craft traveled hundreds of miles while carrying people or things.ante,at.but then,in the same breath,the majority concludes that a reasonable observer would nonetheless conclude that the craft was not designed to any practical degree for carrying people or things on water.ibid.the majority fails to explain how a craft that apparently did carry people and things over water for long distances was not practically capable of maritime transport.
this is not to say that a structure capable of such feats is necessarily a vessel.a craft like lozman might not be a vessel,for example,if it could only carry its owner clothes and personal effects,or if it is only capable of transporting itself and its appurtenances.jerome gru bart,great lakes dredge dock,m aritime law ordinarily treats an appurtenance attached to a vessel in navigable waters as part of the vessel itself but if such a craft can carry large appliances like an oven or a refrigerator and all of the other things we might find in a normal home in addition to the occupants of that home,as the existing record suggests lozman craft may have done,then it would seem to be much more like a mobile home and therefore a vessel than a firmly rooted residence.the simple truth is that we know very little about the craft capabilities and what did or did not happen on its various trips.by focusing on the little we do know for certain about this craft,its windows,doors,and the style of its rooms in determining whether it is a vessel,the majority renders the inquiry opaque and unpredictable.
indeed,the little we do know about lozman craft suggests only that it was an unusual structure.a surveyor was unable to find any comparable craft for sale in the state of florida.app.lozman home was neither obviously a houseboat,as the majority describes such ships,ante,at,nor clearly a floating home,ante,at.see app,sale,lease,and surveying documents describing lozman craft as a houseboat the only clear difference that the majority identifies between these two kinds of structures is that the former are,while the latter are not.ante,at.but even the majority
