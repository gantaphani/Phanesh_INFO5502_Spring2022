we deal here with the scope of the freedom of information act exception,commonly known as the deliberative process privilege.
specifically,we must determine whether the district court erred in concluding that the freedom of information act requests made to the national railroad passenger corporation by the law firm of moye,hogan,pickert were not protected from disclosure pursuant to the deliberative process privilege.
after a review of the record,we conclude that the material sought is protected from disclosure by the deliberative process privilege and that the district court erred in requiring the national railroad passenger corporation to disclose this material.
accordingly,we must reverse and remand.
background 
in december,the national railroad passenger corporation amtrak entered into a contract with balfour beatty construction,and massachusetts electric construction company to design and build a rail electrification system between new haven,connecticut,and boston,massachusetts.this project was referred to as the northeast corridor electrification project,was financed with federal funds,and was intended to construct a rail system which would enable amtrak to operate high speed train service between washington,and boston.the contract set forth certain work standards and a series of payment terms.
in,congress established an office of inspector general oig within amtrak.congress established the oig within amtrak under the inspector general act of,which created inspector generals throughout the federal government in order to combat fraud,waste,abuse,and mismanagement in federal programs and operations.
pursuant to the terms of its statutory mandate,amtrak oig conducted a series of financial and performance audits of activities since the inception of the northeast corridor electrification project.some of these audits prompted further investigation of whether committed civil criminal fraud in seeking contract payments.amtrak oig also conducted a series of more routine financial audits evaluating whether various claims for additional payments were proper.
on may,the law firm of moye,hogan pickert the firm sent amtrak a freedom of information act foia,request which contained separately numbered paragraphs and which asked amtrak to produce documents associated with twelve routine financial audits which amtrak oig had performed with regard to the northeast corridor electrification project contract.the firm foia request sought a broad array of documents,including final audit reports and associated drafts,notes,internal memoranda,and other work papers 
on july,amtrak issued a blanket denial of the firm foia request,asserting that all of the requested documents were exempted from disclosure pursuant to all three components of foia exemption,attorney work product,privilege,and deliberative process privilege.b.on august,the firm filed an administrative appeal of amtrak decision.
however,amtrak did not rule upon the merits of the firm appeal.instead,amtrak,through a letter from its general counsel,informed the firm that amtrak would be unable to address the merits of the administrative appeal because the documents in question were in the possession of amtrak oig.
on february,the firm filed suit in federal district court.specifically,the firm sued amtrak,pursuant to a b,foia,to compel production of the requested documents.amtrak answered the firm complaint by reasserting,inter alia,that the documents requested were exempted from disclosure by the deliberative process privilege codified in foia at b.on june,the parties consented to having the case heard by united states magistrate judge karla spaulding the district court.the district court then held a series of scheduling conferences,ordered that responses to the firm foia requests be staged,and required amtrak to respond to the firm requests in groups,requests,request,and requests,in turn 
on november,the firm moved for partial summary judgment on requests and on request.on january,amtrak filed a for summary judgment as to these requests.on may,the district court largely denied both parties motions,essentially concluding that the evidentiary record had not been sufficiently developed in order to determine whether amtrak had a valid basis for asserting the deliberative process privilege as to the requested documents 
on july,the district court conducted a bench trial on the firm foia requests.on august,the district court rejected amtrak assertion of the deliberative process privilege,allowed the firm foia requests,and entered an directing amtrak to disclose most of the requested documents to the firm within twenty days.on september,the district court stayed its requiring amtrak to disclose the foia material requested by the firm in paragraphs pending a resolution of amtrak appeal to this court.

iv.analysis 
amtrak argues that the district court erred in finding that the firm foia requests were not protected from disclosure pursuant to foia exemption,the deliberative process privilege,b,for four reasons.first,amtrak asserts that,contrary to the district court conclusions,the protections afforded by the deliberative process privilege are not confined only to the documents reviewed by the final.on the contrary,amtrak contends that the deliberative process privilege extends,not only to the draft audit reports submitted for the final consideration,but to the internal memoranda,notes,and other work papers prepared by lower level auditors and their staff because these staff level work papers play a significant role in the deliberative process and are a vital part of the consultative process.amtrak asserts that these documents essentially record the deliberative process and,therefore,are protected by the privilege.
second,amtrak claims that the public policy considerations underlying the privilege mandate that these documents be considered privileged.amtrak argues that in large,hierarchical organizations frequently requires consultation and deliberation among staff and lower level officials in order to gather and analyze data,narrow the range of possible policy choices,compile and verify a factual record,and shape recommendations for a final decision.amtrak asserts that subordinates participation in this process requires the same protection of full and frank communications which is afforded to higher level officials otherwise,amtrak claims,the potential for disclosure would chill subordinates communications and internal discussions.
third,amtrak argues that the district court improperly placed the burden upon it to establish that disclosure of the documents would chill communications from a particular subordinate auditor to senior auditors and,ultimately,to the.amtrak asserts that congress has already determined that disclosure of deliberative materials carries a risk of chilling internal discussions,and thus,the district court erred in requiring it to make a further showing of a chilling effect.
fourth,amtrak argues that its detailed evidentiary submissions to the district court at the bench trial clearly established that the audit work papers sought by the firm embodied precisely the type of advice,recommendations,and discretionary policy choices protected by the deliberative process privilege.in particular,amtrak contends that the audit work papers record the auditors decisions as to the methodology and scope of the planned audit,the mental impressions of interviews,documents,and other data,preliminary analyses and conclusions,supervisory review,and evaluation of the audit work in progress.as such,amtrak claims that the audit work papers document a collaborative,consultative process leading to a final audit decision and,therefore,fall squarely within the protection of the deliberative process privilege.
in short,amtrak argues that the district court narrow,restrictive interpretation of the deliberative process privilege is at odds with both precedent and sound public policy considerations.amtrak contends that,contrary to the district court finding,it carried its burden of establishing that the documents sought by the firm were both predecisional and deliberative.as such,amtrak asks the court to reverse the district court requiring them to disclose the documents sought by the firm in its foia requests.
the firm asks the court to affirm the district court holding because the district court correctly found that amtrak had failed to carry its evidentiary burden of proof at trial and because the district court did not commit any errors as a matter of law.specifically,the firm asserts that the district court correctly found that amtrak had failed to carry its evidentiary burden of proving that the audit work papers were predecisional and deliberative.the firm contends that the only deliberative process asserted by amtrak was gary glowacki,the decision regarding whether or not to issue a final audit report.however,the district court found that amtrak failed to offer any evidence regarding the deliberative process employed by glowacki in determining whether or not to issue a final audit report on the contract,and the firm asserts that this finding is not clearly erroneous.
furthermore,the firm claims that the district court applied the proper legal standards in evaluating amtrak claim of the deliberative process privilege.in fact,the firm notes that the district court quoted verbatim the standard set forth by this court in prior published opinions for determining whether the privilege applies 
moreover,the firm contends that amtrak has mischaracterized the district court holding in that,contrary to amtrak assertion,the district court did not limit the applicability of the deliberative process privilege to the deliberations of the.on the contrary,the firm argues that the district court expressly recognized that the privilege could also reach a communications with subordinates,but the district court went on to hold that the privilege did not extend to these documents under the circumstances.
in addition,the firm argues that the district court decision is consistent with public policy considerations relating to foia.specifically,the firm contends that congress enacted foia in order to permit access to information and that foia mandates disclosure of documents unless a specified exemption applies.the firm asserts that amtrak interpretation of exemption would swallow the rule and would shield almost every document within the government control from public scrutiny.
finally,the firm argues that glowacki decision regarding whether or not to issue a final audit report is not a decision to which exemption applies.in short,the firm contends that the decision to issue or not to issue a final audit report does not qualify as a deliberative process affecting any agency law or policy,and thus,amtrak can not avail itself of the deliberative process privilege.accordingly,the firm asks the court to affirm the district court requiring amtrak to disclose the material which it sought pursuant to its foia requests.
