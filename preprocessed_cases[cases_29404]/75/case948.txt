when petitioner dean transportation,took over operations at a facility that provided bus transportation for the grand rapids public schools grps,it refused to recognize and bargain with the grand rapids educational support personnel association grespa,the union that had been representing employees at the facility.instead,dean recognized the union that represented bus drivers at dean seven other facilities,the dean transportation employees union dteu.the national labor relations board determined that,in so doing,dean and dteu violated the national labor relations act.the board determination was based on the following findings dean was a successor to grps as the employer of bus drivers,mechanics,and route planners at the facility it acquired by lease from grps a unit consisting of those employees was an appropriate bargaining unit the bus drivers in the unit were not accreted to dteu bargaining unit and grespa had made a proper demand for recognition and bargaining.we deny the company petition for review and grant in full the board applications for enforcement of its order.
the grand rapids public schools grps is a large,urban school district in michigan serving more than students in approximately schools.in,the michigan employment relations commission merc certified the grand rapids educational support personnel association grespa as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of a unit of grps employees.the unit included most employees of grps transportation all bus drivers,route planners,and mechanics,but not including five dispatchers and one payroll clerk.the transportation department was located at a single facility at union street in the city of grand rapids.grespa also represented other,grps employees in the same unit.during the school year,grps employed more than people,of whom were in the grespa bargaining unit.approximately of those employees worked at the union street facility.
the bus drivers in the grespa unit provided transportation for general and special education students.those drivers transporting special education students,approximately of the unit employees,were jointly employed by grps and the kent intermediate school district kisd pursuant to a july agreement between the two districts.kisd is a countywide school district that provides educational services to students with special needs.
in april,the grps board of education approved a resolution to outsource all of its student transportation services to dean transportation,which employed drivers working out of seven different locations to provide transportation services for several school districts in the state.thereafter,dean signed a contract with grps for transportation of its students and a second contract with kisd for transportation of grps special needs students.under those contracts,dean agreed to use its best efforts to maintain existing bus routes within grps for the first year and to offer incentives to current grps drivers to encourage them to apply for jobs with dean.the goal of the parties agreement was for dean to maintain continuity in the transportation services it provided to grps students.dean,at june,alj op.the contracts also required dean to use grps existing route planning software and to adhere to grps administration directives,and they gave the grps superintendent the right of final approval for any route changes.these provisions and others required dean to treat its transportation services for grps differently from the services it provided to other school districts with respect to route planning,driving,maintenance,and employee compensation.
grps and kisd permanently laid off their transportation department employees on june,and dean began transporting both general and special education students in grand rapids on june.as part of its arrangements with grps and kisd,dean leased grps union street facility and purchased the school buses that grps and kisd had used to transport students.the company continued to use the union street facility to provide transportation services for grps,including the maintenance and repair of buses,route planning,and dispatch operations.by the start of the school year in september,a majority of dean employees at union street had formerly been employed by grps in the same capacity,including of drivers,of mechanics,and of route planners.all of these former employees had been represented by grespa when grps operated the union street facility.in addition,grps transportation director continued in the same position for dean,as did one of two grps supervisors.dean also hired seven dispatchers to work at the union street facility six had previously worked for grps as bus drivers and the seventh as a payroll clerk at the same facility.
since,dean had recognized the dean transportation employees union dteu,which was certified by merc,to represent the company drivers.beginning june,the company recognized dteu as the exclusive collective bargaining agent of the bus drivers employed at union street,and dteu accepted that recognition.dean applied its existing bargaining agreement with dteu to the union street drivers and deducted dteu dues from their salaries.the company did not recognize any union with respect to the route planners,dispatchers,and mechanics.
on september,grespa sent dean a letter stating that it was the recognized exclusive collective bargaining representative of the employees performing transportation services for grps students that have been hired by dean transportation.grespa asked the company to recognize and bargain with it as the exclusive representative of the unit employees,including the full and part time bus drivers,dispatchers,mechanics,and route planners.id.on september,the company refused to grant recognition,disputing grespa claim to represent the employees.
in response,grespa filed unfair labor practice charges against dean and dteu with the national labor relations board nlrb,and,on december,the general counsel issued a complaint.thereafter,an administrative law judge alj found that dean was a successor to grps as the employer of a unit of employees at the union street facility composed of bus drivers,mechanics,and route planners the unit was an appropriate bargaining unit the bus drivers in the unit were not accreted to the existing dteu bargaining unit and grespa had made an appropriate demand for recognition and bargaining.in light of these findings,the alj concluded that dean violated sections a and of the national labor relations act,a,by failing to recognize and refusing to bargain with grespa,and that it violated sections a,and,a,by recognizing dteu as the representative of the bus drivers in the unit and imposing the terms of its collective bargaining agreement with dteu.the alj also determined that dteu violated sections b a and,b a,by accepting that recognition and applying the terms of its collective bargaining agreement.dean,at alj op.the board affirmed the alj findings and reasoning and adopted the alj recommended order.
dean now petitions for review,and the board for enforcement.in part ii we consider the board finding that dean was a successor employer,and in part iii we consider dean claim that the employees at the union street facility do not constitute an appropriate bargaining unit.in part iv we address the accretion issue,and in part v we consider dean contention that grespa demand for recognition was inappropriate and hence ineffective.
we assess the nlrb decision under familiar standards we review the board factual conclusions for substantial evidence,defer to nlrb rules if they are rational and consistent with the act,and uphold the board application of law to facts unless arbitrary or otherwise erroneous.harter tomato prods.nlrb,quotation marks and citations omitted.
a new employer has an obligation to bargain with the union representing its predecessor employees if,inter alia,the new employer is in fact a successor of the old employer and the majority of its employees were employed by its predecessor.fall river dyeing finishing nlrb,d see harter tomato,at.it is undisputed that a majority of dean employees at union street were formerly employed by grps in the same capacity,including of drivers,of mechanics,and of route planners.all of these former employees were represented by grespa when grps operated the union street facility.dean contends,however,that it is not in fact a successor employer.
a new employer qualifies as a successor to its predecessor if there is substantial continuity between the enterprises.fall river,at.the determination of substantial continuity is based upon the totality of the circumstances of a given situation,and requires that the board focus on whether the new company has acquired substantial assets of its predecessor and continued,without interruption or substantial change,the predecessor business operations.id.quoting golden state bottling,nlrb,d see pennsylvania transformer,nlrb,citisteel usa,nlrb.in fall river,the supreme court identified the following factors as relevant to the determination of substantial continuity 
w hether the business of both employers is essentially the same whether the employees of the new company are doing the same jobs in the same working conditions under the same supervisors and whether the new entity has the same production process,produces the same products,and basically has the same body of customers.
fall river,at.these factors are assessed from the employees perspective,and the court asks whether those employees who have been retained will understandably view their job situations as essentially unaltered.id.quoting golden state bottling,at.see harter tomato,at.
there is no dispute that dean acquired substantial transportation assets from,all of grps buses and the union street physical that it continued,without interruption,grps transportation operations.the alj found that,when viewed from the perspective of the employees,there has been very little change in their working conditions.dean,at alj op.as the alj explained 
the bus drivers continue to report to the same location,drive the same buses,transport the same group of students to essentially the same schools.they report to the same supervisors that they did when they worked for grps and kisd the route planners continue to work in the same office,doing the same jobs,using the same computer software,and reporting to the same supervisor the mechanics,likewise,work in the same garage,with the same equipment and tools,repairing and maintaining the same buses.
id.substantial evidence supports all of these findings,and dean does not seriously contest them.instead,the company focuses on several factors that it contends should count against a finding of substantial continuity.
first,dean argues that it implemented a number of significant changes when it took over operations at union street,including changes with respect to wages and benefits,supervision,work rules,policies,training programs,paperwork,and the method for assigning routes.petitioner br.the alj acknowledged these operational changes.see dean,at alj op.but as we have noted before,p ointing to differences in size,wages,benefits,training,customer base,and managerial philosophy,among others,is unresponsive to the question we face.we ask not whether the petitioner view of the facts supports its version of what happened,but rather whether the board interpretation of the facts is reasonably defensible.pennsylvania transformer,at quoting harter tomato,at internal quotation marks omitted.if so,the case is over,even if the petitioner version might support a contrary result.harter tomato,at.
we have several times upheld a successorship determination by the board even when factors like those highlighted by dean were present.see,community hosps.of cent.cal.nlrb,pennsylvania transformer,at harter tomato,at united food commercial workers int l union,local nlrb.in pennsylvania transformer,for example,we found substantial continuity notwithstanding differences in size,facilities,work force,managerial philosophy,and customer base,in part because the business of both employers was essentially the same and employees continued to use the same skills and expertise.pennsylvania transformer,at.we reached a similar conclusion in community hospitals.despite the successor new supervisory and management structure changes in the duties,compensation,and benefits of the nurses at the hospital and changes in the nurses shift schedules and in the organization of support functions,we nonetheless ruled that the board had reasonably found that the nurses at the hospital continued to do the same jobs,in the same location,using the same equipment,and treating the same patients as they had before the acquisition.community,at.
moreover,the board finding of substantial continuity here is directly in line with its decision in van lear equipment.that case involved strikingly similar facts a private employer engaged in school bus transportation took over the provision of services to a public school district but refused to recognize the union that had previously represented the district bus drivers.id.at.the company maintained that substantial continuity was absent because it had implemented many operational changes.although the board recognized those changes,it rejected the company argument because,viewed from the drivers perspective,the drivers are performing the same work that they performed as school district school children to and from district schools by school bus and van.id.at.in light of van lear,dean can not seriously contend that the board interpretation of the facts in this case was not reasonably defensible.pennsylvania transformer,at internal quotation marks omitted.
second,the company argues against a finding of substantial continuity on the ground that it only took over grps union street facility and not the entire grespa unit.but as the nlrb recognized,i t is well established that the board may find substantial continuity even where,as here,a successor employer has taken over only a discrete portion of the predecessor bargaining unit.dean,at citing van lear,at bronx health plan,enforced,unpublished table decision.once again,van lear is directly on point.although the bus drivers in that case had previously been represented in a larger unit that also included custodians,maintenance workers,and secretaries,the board found substantial continuity even though the new employer did not take over all the operations and functions of the prior school district bargaining unit.van lear,at.
nor,as the board correctly held,is atlantic technical services,to the contrary.in atlantic technical,the board found that a small company that took over the mail distribution function from aviation giant twa was not twa successor.t he new unit contained only employees out of the twa nationwide unit of,of whom were based at the same facility.dean,at.as the board noted in dean,n othing like those peculiar circumstances exists here.the grps bargaining unit included workers,of whom worked at the union street facility,and a large majority of those employees continued working at the facility after the change in management.id.quoting atlantic technical,at.although dean charges that the board unfairly limited the reach of atlantic technical by characterizing it as involving peculiar circumstances,petitioner reply br,that characterization comes from the atlantic technical opinion own description of a small company taking over a small part of a giant entity,see atlantic technical,at.
finally,before the agency dean argued against a finding of substantial continuity on the ground that the union street workers,who at grps had been employees governed by michigan law,were now employees subject to a different statutory scheme.in response,the alj correctly noted that t he board has applied the usual successorship test even where,as here,the predecessor is a public entity.dean,at alj op.citing community hosps.of cent,enforced,lincoln park zoological soc y,enforced,cir jmm operational.indeed,in van lear,the board held that the successorship doctrine continue d to apply even though the predecessor school district wa s a public employer and the successor bus transportation company was not.van lear,at.and in community hospitals,this court likewise ruled that t he change from public to private ownership of the hospital does not undermine the board finding that community was a successor.community,at.
on appeal,dean focuses not simply on the general differences between public and private employment,but on the fact that the employees will now have the right to strike under the nlra,a right that was unavailable to them as public employees under michigan law.petitioner br.dean suggests that employees who acquire the right to strike under the nlra may not want to be represented by the same union that represented them under a state statute that barred strikes.in response,nlrb counsel argues the opposite,contending that the acquisition of the right to strike is more likely than not to support former public employees desire for continued representation.respondent br.
we do not resolve this dispute.dean did not mention this argument in any of its filings before the board and offers no excuse for not doing so section e of the nlra therefore prevents us from considering it.e no objection that has not been urged before the board shall be considered by the court,unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.given that none of the board precedents discussing the impact of a change on the issue of successorship addresses the point,there was no reason for the board to suspect that this was the objection dean was raising.dean general reference to the different statutory schemes was therefore insufficient to put the board on adequate notice of the argument the company now seeks to advance on review,and we are barred from considering it.highlands hosp,nlrb,quoting american postal workers union nlrb,id.holding that a petitioner generalized reference to the excessive breadth of a remedy with multiple parts was insufficient to put the board on notice that the petitioner was challenging the adequacy of the justification for an affirmative bargaining order.
dean also maintains that the unit of drivers,route planners,and mechanics at the union street facility does not constitute an appropriate bargaining unit.our standard of review when considering such a claim is,again,quite limited.the board need only select an appropriate unit,not the most appropriate unit.serramonte oldsmobile,nlrb,quoting cleveland,nlrb,internal quotation mark omitted.
dean principal contention is that the board erred in finding appropriate a unit consisting of employees at a single facility.but as the alj stated,t he board has long recognized a presumption that a single plant or store unit is appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining unless it has been so effectively merged into a comprehensive unit,or is so functionally integrated,that it has lost its separate identity.dean,at alj op.see community,at van lear,at.dean argues that a unit is not appropriate in this case because the company has merged the bus drivers at union street into its operations,and the union street drivers therefore no longer retain a separate identity.to support this argument,dean notes that its regional and corporate managers supervise all dean employees the company has adopted training and personnel policies the union street facility is located only eight miles from another dean facility and occasional interchange has occurred between employees at union street and those at other facilities.
although the alj acknowledged that dean is a highly centralized operation,he concluded that the factors noted by dean did not undermine the presumption because onsite supervisors oversee operations at the union street location as a result of the contracts that dean signed with grps and kisd,union street drivers are treated separately from drivers at dean other facilities for job assignment and bidding purposes the degree of interchange between union street and other facilities is minimal and union street is the only depot that employs a substantial number of general education drivers in addition to special education drivers.dean,at alj op.substantial evidence in the record supports all of these findings,and van lear again supports the alj conclusion.there,the board found appropriate a unit composed of the predecessor bus drivers,notwithstanding that the successor was centrally managed from its home office,because the supervisor maintain ed discretion and independence on certain matters and because there was no interchange between the drivers at the different locations.van lear,at.
dean presses upon us dattco,a case in which the nlrb found that the respondent had rebutted the presumption.we agree with the board,however,that dattco is easily distinguishable on its facts because the operation of the facility in dattco was completely integrated with a network of other facilities.dean,at.as the board noted 
fully of the bus drivers in dattco were shuttled from their home facilities to other terminals on a daily basis upon arriving at the new facility,drivers were supervised by managers based at that other facility.here,the drivers work exclusively out of their home facility,where their routes and runs are determined,and where they are supervised by the local managers.this autonomy of the union street facility over operations distinguishes it from the facility in dattco.
id.at oral argument,dean acknowledged that the facts of dattco do distinguish it from the instant case.oral arg.recording at 
in concluding that a unit was appropriate,the alj also properly gave weight to the fact that the drivers,route planners,and mechanics at the union street facility had a long history of being represented by grespa.dean,at alj op.see community,at a group of employees with a significant history of representation by a particular union presumptively constitute s an appropriate bargaining unit.see also trident seafoods,nlrb.dean objects that the union street employees were never a historical bargaining unit,but instead were merely part of the larger grespa unit.as the alj correctly observed,however,t he fact that the employees who dean hired to work at union street were only a subset of a much larger bargaining unit is not determinative of the appropriateness of the unit.dean,at alj op.citing community,at.indeed,we rejected an argument identical to dean in community hospitals because it would have us distinguish between a previously recognized bargaining unit and a subset of such a bargaining unit,limiting the presumption of appropriateness to the former.community,at.the petitioner in that case,we said,provide d no authority for this distinction,which is inconsistent with our own precedent.id.citing int l union of,radio mach.workers,nlrb.dean has been no more successful in finding relevant support and while dean also insists that the bargaining history upon which the board should have focused was that between dean and dteu,the case law instead concentrates on the history between the employees and their union.see,community,at trident seafoods,at.
dean further maintains that the board should have applied the systemwide presumption it uses in the public utility industry,rather than the presumption it employs generally and applied here.the board applies the systemwide presumption to public utilities because they are characterized by a high degree of interdependence of their various segments and the public has an immediate and direct interest in the uninterrupted maintenance of the essential services that this industry alone can adequately provide.baltimore gas.for those reasons,the board is reluctant to fragmentize a utility operations.id.
grps is not a public utility,of course,and only one board decision has extended the systemwide presumption beyond that industry.that case is easily distinguished.in alyeska pipeline service,the board applied a systemwide presumption to a company that,although not itself a public utility,used a pipeline to transport of the crude oil in alaska.id.at.the company,which ha d an integrated and interdependent operation,was the sole source of supply for public utilities that render ed essential services to the public.id.at.dean business does not enjoy a similar monopoly of school bus transportation in michigan.nor has the nlrb applied a systemwide presumptio
