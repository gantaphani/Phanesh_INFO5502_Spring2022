plaintiffs citizens for better streets citizens and richard wall brought this taxpayers action to enjoin an alleged unlawful use of public property by the board of supervisors,mayor,and planning and housing directors of the city and county of san francisco collectively,city.plaintiffs contend that defendants have threatened to act unlawfully by proposing to lease for purposes of housing portions of the former of the embarcadero freeway,which was demolished in the aftermath of the loma prieta earthquake.plaintiffs contend that under streets and highways code section,by which the state of california granted these lands to the city,the city was required either to build roads upon the affected lands or to sell them at market value and apply the proceeds to road building.the trial court denied plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction,finding among other things that plaintiffs were not likely to prevail on the merits.we will affirm that order.
background 
it is undisputed that the earthquake of october damaged route,a freeway in san francisco commonly known as the embarcadero freeway.on october,the legislature enacted section to prescribe the respective duties of the department of transportation and the city with respect to the demolition and replacement of the freeway.the department of transportation was obligated to demolish the damaged freeway transfer the to the city,retaining such portion as was necessary for new ramps and j ointly agree with the city on a system of ramps and city streets that would essentially provide motorists with accessibility comparable to that provided by the demolished freeway,subd.a.the city was obligated,among other things,to c onstruct the system of ramps and city streets and utilize the route or the proceeds from sales of that for the sole purpose of constructing an alternate system of local streets pursuant to paragraph of subdivision a,subd.b,italics added.the bill enacting section also removed route from the state highway system and had various other effects not at issue here.stats,ch.
in december,the state conveyed the route to the city pursuant to an agreement reciting that the conveyance was made p ursuant to section of the streets and highways code.the agreement noted that the statute required the city to construct a system of ramps and city streets utilizing the route or the proceeds from the sale of that for the sole purpose of constructing an alternate system of local streets as above described.thereafter the city,the state,and the federal highway administration apparently developed a project for a replacement street system,known as the roadway project,which was analyzed in a combined environmental impact statement and environmental impact report the,which was certified by the san francisco planning commission on september.
on january,the san francisco board of supervisors board adopted resolution approving in principle the disposition of three parcels of a former freeway designated as broadway parcels,and.the board declared its intention to transfer parcel to the san francisco police department,parcel to the port of san francisco,and parcel property here at the mayor office of housing moh for the development of affordable housing including but not limited to the issuance of requests for qualifications proposals for a developer to purchase or lease of sic the site at less than fair market value for the development of affordable housing.the january,resolution recited that the loss of the freeway had impacted the social and economic viability of the chinatown and north beach communities and that the proposed uses of the broadway parcels are intended to mitigate the effects of that demolition.the resolution also noted a statutory priority under government code sections et for the disposition of surplus city property,such as broadway parcel,at less than fair market value for affordable housing development,and declared that the proceeds from the proposed dispositions,including the sale or lease of broadway parcel at less than fair market value for the development of affordable housing,would provide the city with significant resources for the improvement of local street access comparable to that provided by the former embarcadero freeway,while enhancing the feasibility of developing such affordable housing.it was further resolved that any proceeds from these dispositions shall be used in accordance with the requirements imposed by streets highways code section,to the extent such proceeds are deemed necessary by the city waterfront transportation project to fulfill the city obligation under that section to provide local street access comparable to that provided by the former embarcadero freeway.
according to respondent,the january,resolution gave birth to what became known as the broadway ii affordable housing project.on january,the moh entered into an exclusive negotiating agreement for the development and construction of the project with chinatowncdc ccdc,a nonprofit housing and community development corporation.the city and ccdc thereafter spent substantial amounts of time and money in predevelopment activities.in november,the mayor approved a loan to ccdc of for predevelopment costs.on november,the mayor approved loans totaling for development of the project.by january,the city and ccdc had negotiated a lease disposition and development agreement under which ccdc would lease the property for years at a rate of per year,but apparently including an option for an additional years 
on december,citizens and wall brought this action their complaint alleged an illegal and wasteful expenditure of property consisting of the city proposal to lease the property for years at per year.plaintiffs alleged that the city was currently deriving revenues from the property of over per month,largely from parking lots then occupying of the area of the parcels in question,that the fair market value of the property was more than million,and that the fair value of a lease was more than per year.plaintiffs alleged that the proposed lease violated both section and the terms of the state grant.plaintiffs prayed for preliminary and permanent injunctions restraining defendants from wasting the property and revenues of the city by illegally leasing the property for a purpose for which it was not intended at a rate below market value.
plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.in opposition,the city presented a declaration to the effect that as of january,the project had been e ssentially completed in satisfaction of the city obligations under section,that the responsible city department was in the process of closing out the project with the responsible state and federal agencies,and that f unds from the lease of the broadway ii parcel will be paid to the responsible city department and will be used for the roadway project.the city has also asked this court to take judicial notice of a board resolution of september,reciting that the roadway project has been paid for out of federal and state grants and a loan from the san francisco transportation authority of which the city department of public works is obligated to repay million.the september,resolution further recites that the funds received from the housing project lease,as well as from the sale of other former freeway parcels,will be applied to and will satisfy this obligation.
on march,the trial court denied plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.it found that plaintiffs had not demonstrated a probability that they would prevail on the merits,because t he city has complied with the requirements of section.it also found that t he balance of harms,including consideration of laches,weighs in favor of the city,the public,and the chinatowncdc.
plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on may.
discussion 
a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction bears the burden of presenting facts which show a reasonable probability that he will succeed on the merits.fleishman superior court th,d.when the trial court denies the requested relief,the plaintiff bears the burden,as appellant,of overcoming the presumption of correctness which attends the challenged ruling.id.at,d.here the dispositive question is whether plaintiffs have carried their burden,as appellants,of showing that the trial court erred in finding that they had not demonstrated a reasonable probability of success on the merits.
ordinarily,the trial court grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.garamendi executive life ins.th,d.however,where the ruling depends on the construction of a statute,it is to that extent reviewed de novo.ibid.here the trial court denied plaintiffs motion in part on the ground that plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the merits because their claims depended on an interpretation of section which was unlikely to be sustained.we review this determination de novo.
plaintiffs argument rests on the requirement imposed by section that the city shall utilize the route or the proceeds from sales of that for the sole purpose of constructing an alternate system of local streets pursuant to paragraph of subdivision a,subd.b.plaintiffs contend that this language required the city either to build the replacement project on the property,or to sell it at market value and apply the proceeds to road construction.
nothing in the statute requires a sale at market value,or on any other particular terms.plaintiffs argument obliquely implies such a requirement.but a n intention to legislate by implication is not to be presumed.rapid transit advocates,southern cal.rapid transit dist.d.plaintiffs have failed to show that the implication on which their argument rests is necessarily derived from the statute.see lubner city of los angeles th,d.
by its terms the statute requires the city either to use the parcels in question to build an alternate system of local streets to replace the demolished freeway,the replacement project,or to apply the proceeds of any sale of those parcels to financing that specific project.so far as this record shows,the city has complied with these conditions.the city did not use the parcels as an actual site for the project,but it has adopted a resolution stating that the proceeds from their disposition will be applied to pay for the project the city proposed actions therefore appear to comply with the letter of section.
plaintiff arguments rest on the city supposed contravention of the purpose of section,by leasing the property,for a purpose other than road construction,at a price below fair market value.but again,the statute says nothing about the terms on which a disposition must be made,only that the proceeds must be applied to the replacement project.the statute might conceivably be read to imply a requirement of fair market value if,as plaintiffs contend,it required the proceeds of sale to be applied to road construction or streets and roads in general.but plaintiffs are simply in error when they assert that the statute contains an express requirement that the property or its sale proceeds be used for the sole purpose of constructing streets and roads w hen the legislature granted the property to the city,the intent was to build roads the statute does not require the city to create a fund for streets and roads indeed it does not permit the city to spend the proceeds of sale on construction of streets and roads other than those comprising the replacement project,the alternate system of local streets pursuant to paragraph of subdivision a.the italicized language refers unequivocally to the replacement project.see,subd.a.thus the only purpose contemplated by section is the construction of the replacement project itself.
this reading of the plain terms of the statute is echoed in the sources plaintiffs cite for their own interpretation.thus the legislative counsel digest for the bill which became section merely restates the requirement that san francisco utilize the route,or the proceeds from the sale of the,to construct an alternate system of local streets.stats,ch,italics added.plaintiffs position is also contradicted by the statement they quote from an environmental impact report jointly submitted by local,state,and federal authorities,which states that section requires the proceeds from sales of the to be used for the current project.
plaintiffs also invoke article of the california constitution,which governs the utilization of gasoline tax proceeds and properties acquired with those proceeds.the trial court sustained an objection to plaintiffs citation of these provisions on the ground that they were first asserted in plaintiffs reply memorandum.but assuming the point is properly before us,we are directed to no evidence which would make those provisions applicable to this case.article applies largely,if not exclusively,to property purchased with gasoline tax revenues or vehicle license fees.see cal,art.xix.so far as we have discovered,plaintiffs made no effort to demonstrate that the properties here were actually purchased with such revenues.plaintiffs argument simply assumes that the constitutional provisions apply.the argument therefore fails for lack of necessary factual support 
plaintiffs also point to a report prepared by certain agencies of the city,containing the opinion that an arrangement giv ing up portions of the freeway at cost for purposes of housing would clearly conflict with the basic purpose of the land transfer.plaintiffs do not suggest that this the bound by this opinion.as we have stated,it is our view that the purpose of the transfer,as manifested in section,was to condition the conveyance of these properties on the construction of a replacement system of ramps and streets,and to provide adequate land and funding to ensure that end.in these conditions remained to be fulfilled no replacement project had been built,and presumably the authors of the report could not know whether adequate funding for the project would otherwise be obtained.thus,whatever persuasive value these opinions might otherwise have possessed,we can give them little weight today,ten years later,when the replacement system is in place and will be fully paid for without selling all of the parcels at market value.
defendants devote considerable energy to demonstrating the need for affordable housing in san francisco.we agree with plaintiffs that this demonstration is beside the point.as plaintiffs state,the principal issue here is whether section permits defendants to use property that was formerly part of the route for a purpose wholly unrelated to road construction.the answer to this question is plainly affirmative the property can be used for any purpose whatsoever,provided that the proceeds from its disposition are applied to the construction of a replacement system of ramps and streets,and such a system is in fact constructed.since the present record indicates that both of these conditions have been or will be fulfilled,there is no present likelihood that plaintiffs will prevail on the merits this makes it unnecessary to consider the alternative grounds on which the city contends the trial court ruling may be sustained 
disposition 
the order of the trial court denying plaintiff motion for a preliminary injunction is affirmed.
i respectfully dissent.
the statute by which the land was conveyed to the city requires that the property,or the proceeds of its sale,be used for the sole purpose of building a system of alternate streets to take the place of the embarcadero freeway that collapsed during the earthquake.the city maintains that it has complied with both the spirit and the letter of the statute.the majority agrees.i do not.the city maintains,and the trial court impliedly found,that neither the property nor the sales proceeds therefrom are needed for the project for which the property was conveyed nor to repay the million loan incurred by the city to complete it.for purposes of this appeal appellant concedes that the trial court did not abuse its discretion as a fact finder in making this concession,appellant has pared the issue down to this single question is the city free to use or cause the property to be used for housing i believe the answer to that question is it may not do so without legislative approval.
the city has structured a lease to a private commercial developer that it ma
