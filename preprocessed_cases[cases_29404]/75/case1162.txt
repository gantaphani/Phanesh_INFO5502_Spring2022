introduction 
real party in interest twc aviation,twc aviation leased three aircraft from real parties in interest aml leasing llc aml and dwal llc dwal to operate as air taxis.petitioner and respondent rick auerbach,in his capacity as the los angeles county assessor assessor,levied,enrolled property tax assessments on the aircraft.twc applied for changed assessments before the los angeles county assessment appeals board appeals board.twc contended,inter alia,that the assessor proposed apportionment account for the time during the tax year that the aircraft were in arbitrary,resulting in a combined valuation by california and nevada that exceeded percent of the value of the aircraft,and that the appeals board should instead adopt the formula used by nevada.the appeals board agreed with twc and adjusted the assessments accordingly.
the assessor filed a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus in the trial court seeking to overturn the findings of the appeals board.the trial court denied the petition as to another issue,but granted it as to the apportionment issue.the assessor appealed from the denial of the petition as to the other issue.twc challenging the trial court ruling on the apportionment issue and arguing that the appeals board correctly found that the nevada apportionment formula was more reasonable than the assessor formula,because,inter alia,it avoided duplicative taxation.
in the published portion of this opinion,we hold that even if the combined valuation of the aircraft by nevada and california exceeded percent of the value of the property,the assessor apportionment formula is not arbitrary,but rather is rationally related to the opportunities,benefits,and protections afforded to twc by california.thus,the trial court correctly concluded that the appeals board finding on the apportionment issue should be vacated.accordingly,we affirm the judgment vacating the appeals board finding on the apportionment issue.
factual and procedural background 
apportionment issue 
twc aviation,a nevada corporation with its principal base of operation in burbank,is a certificated,air taxi that operates aircraft as an interstate common carrier.an air taxi is a charter operator providing air transportation to the general public.twc aviation also performs aircraft management and maintenance.
the three aircraft that are the subject of this appeal are owned by either aml or dwal and leased to twc aviation for management and charter operations.aml,dwal,and twc aviation are all owned by an individual who is a nevada resident.
after the assessor enrolled escape assessments on each aircraft,twc filed applications for a change in the assessments.the applications raised as an issue,inter alia,whether twc was entitled to a proration of the los angeles county taxes because taxes were also paid in nevada for the same time period.the appeals board held a hearing on twc applications for changed assessments.the assessor,based on the contacts of two of the aircraft with nevada,agreed to apportion the value of each aircraft attributable to the nevada contacts.twc,however,disagreed with the assessor proposed formula for calculating the apportionment and challenged the proposed apportionment on that basis.
the appeals board made the following findings in connection with the allocation for taxes paid in nevada the applicant provided the board a nevada department of taxation letter of september,giving a calculation based on their a sic methodology that determined an allocation of for this aircraft.the assessor put before the board sections of assessor handbook exhibit that states in general,the courts have only said that the state s tax system must provide for fair apportionment,not discriminate against interstate commerce,and be fairly related to the services provided by the state.this chapter states the dollar amount of the other state s tax bill is irrelevant.the board finds for the nevada tax calculation as fair and reasonable for this aircraft and the percentage as reasonable.the appeals board adjusted the assessed value of each aircraft using a allocation for the taxes imposed by nevada,allocating percent of the value to california,and making an assessment based on the allocation.
the assessor filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus in the trial court challenging the findings of the appeals board as to each of the three aircraft in issue.the assessor asserted,inter alia,that the appeals board erred by requiring that the three escape assessments be reduced based on an apportionment of value using the calculation by the nevada department of taxation.
on the apportionment issue,the trial court ruled that a bsent any evidence that the county assessor apportionment method was contrary to california law,it was an abuse of discretion for the assessment appeals board to require that california use the same method of apportionment that is adopted by a sister state.such a decision is not supported by substantial evidence contained in the administrative record.the taxpayer had the burden at the administrative hearing to prove that the method of apportionment used by the county assessor was contrary to california tax law.the taxpayer failed to carry such burden.
on june,the trial court entered a judgment granting the assessor petition for writ of administrative mandamus as to the apportionment issue and issued a writ of mandate directing the appeals board to set aside its decision of june,and to hold further proceedings consistent with the trial court ruling as contained in its june,minute order.on august,the assessor filed a notice of appeal from the judgment as to a different issue.on september,twc filed a notice of from the judgment challenging the ruling on the apportionment issue.
