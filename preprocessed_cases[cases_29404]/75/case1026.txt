darrell andrews trucking,a commercial motor carrier,petitions for review of an order of the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa assigning andrews a conditional safety rating.the agency gave andrews that rating because it violated a regulation requiring carriers to maintain all documents that support its drivers records of duty status.the fmcsa found that andrews removed its drivers toll receipts from files,where they could be used to verify the number of hours a driver was on the road,and commingled them with the receipts of all other drivers so that the tolls could not be used for verification.andrews challenges the fmcsa decision on a number of grounds,including a claim that the agency improperly changed its original interpretation of the recordkeeping regulation.we reject that challenge and all of the others but one.we remand the case to the agency for consideration of the sole issue that it failed to address below.
congress has directed the secretary of transportation to prescribe regulations establishing a procedure for determining the safety fitness of the owners and operators of commercial motor vehicles.b see mst express department of.the secretary has delegated that responsibility to the fmcsa.pursuant to part of its regulations,the fmcsa assigns motor carriers one of three possible safety ratings satisfactory,conditional,or unsatisfactory.see id.listing factors considered in determining safety ratings,including the frequency of accidents and the frequency and severity of regulatory violations see generally mst express,at the agency conducts compliance reviews,examination s of motor carrier operations,in order to determine whether a motor carrier meets the safety fitness standard and which rating it should be assigned.see id.
to ensure that truck drivers are awake and alert on the road,congress has also directed the secretary of transportation to prescribe the maximum number of hours they may operate their vehicles in a given time period.see b.to implement that directive,the fmcsa has promulgated regulations that fix maximum driving times,and require each driver to keep a record of duty status rods that records his or her driving times for each period,id.in order to permit the fmcsa to ensure compliance with the limitations,the regulations further require each motor carrier to maintain records of duty status and all supporting documents for each driver it employs for a period of six months from the date of receipt.k.
on november,during an compliance review,fmcsa investigators determined that andrews had violated agency regulations.the investigators found violations as well as false rods.compliance review,at.in addition,they cited andrews for failing to properly maintain supporting documents for the rods.specifically,the investigators noted that,although andrews receives an envelope containing each driver expenses toll receipts,fuel receipts,cat scale receipts,it separates out the toll receipts and files them all together with those of the other drivers.at.the result,the investigators said,is that the carrier is not able to cross reference toll receipts back to the driver rods.id.moreover,if the toll receipts had been maintained as received,the investigators believed that more falsification would have been discovered.at.based on andrews treatment of the toll receipts,the investigators cited the carrier for violating k,the recordkeeping regulation.as a consequence of that violation,together with an unrelated citation for an excessively high accident rate,the compliance review assigned andrews the lowest of the three possible safety ratings unsatisfactory.at.
andrews sought administrative review before the fmcsa.the carrier conceded that it maintained the toll receipts in the ordinary course of its business.in re darrell andrews trucking,slip op.at fmcsa.andrews argued,however,that the receipts were not supporting documents within the meaning of k,because it did not use them to verify the information in its drivers rods.it further contended that,even if the toll receipts were supporting documents,the regulation did not require that such documents be kept in a manner that permitted their correlation with the driver to whom they corresponded.
the fmcsa disagreed.first,it concluded that,under k,supporting documents include documents that can be used to verify information on the driver records of duty status not only those that the carrier actually does use.andrews trucking,fmcsa slip op.at emphasis added citing regulatory guidance for the federal motor carrier safety regulations.second,the fmcsa thought it reasonable to construe the maintenance requirement as requiring carriers to maintain the documents in a usable condition.id.at.as did the investigators,the agency noted that although each andrews driver turns in a trip envelope that contains his or her toll and other receipts,thereafter the toll receipts are removed and all filed together in one central location.id.at.this salad shooter approach,the fmcsa held,does not comply with the spirit of the law and frustrates proper enforcement.id.at quoting in re transport express,slip op.at fmcsa may,aff,transport express,united states,cir.in particular,it frustrates an investigator s ability to connect the supporting document toll receipt and the rods,and leaves the investigator unable to use the toll receipt to check for service or falsification violations of the driver.id.at.finally,the agency concluded that prior compliance reviews had put andrews on notice that its method of retention of supporting documents including toll receipts does not conform to the regulatory requirements.id.at.

andrews raises five main challenges to the fmcsa decision.according to andrews,the requirement that it maintain each driver toll receipts,and that it refrain from combining them with the receipts of all other drivers i constitutes a change in the original regulation,promulgated without the required notice and opportunity for comment ii even if not a change,was applied to andrews without fair notice iii imposes increased and unapproved recordkeeping burdens,in violation of the paperwork reduction act,iv was applied to andrews without adherence to proper adjudicatory procedures and v was imposed without consideration of a substantial countervailing consideration.we consider andrews five challenges below 
andrews first argument is that the interpretation of k upon which the fmcsa based its decision constitutes a substantial change in the agency construction of that regulation,and that it was unlawful for the agency to make such a change without promulgating a new regulation pursuant to the notice and comment provisions of the administrative procedure act apa,c.see appalachian power epa,it is that an agency may not escape the notice and comment requirements by labeling a major substantive legal addition to a rule a mere interpretation.paralyzed veterans of am.arena,once an agency gives its regulation an interpretation,it can only change that interpretation as it would formally modify the regulation itself through the process of notice and comment rulemaking.to succeed with this argument,andrews must show that the agency has given its regulation a definitive interpretation,and later significantly revise d that interpretation.alaska prof l hunters ass faa.
andrews contends that two elements of the fmcsa decision represent significant changes from the agency prior,definitive position.those are the agency determinations that a toll receipts that the carrier does not itself use for verification of rods are supporting documents that the carrier must maintain and b the carrier must not only preserve the toll receipts but also must refrain from removing them from individually identifiable files and combining them in a fashion that makes correlation with individual drivers impossible.we consider each of these determinations below.
the fmcsa concluded that andrews toll receipts are supporting documents because they could be used by the carrier and the agency to check the accuracy of the drivers rods.andrews contends that the term applies only to documents that a carrier actually uses to verify the rods.because andrews does not use toll receipts in its verification process,the carrier contends that it is not required to maintain them.
section k states 
retention of driver record of duty status.each motor carrier shall maintain records of duty status and all supporting documents for each driver it employs for a period of six months from the date of receipt.
k.the regulation does not define supporting documents and,as a consequence,we are bound to defer to a reasonable agency interpretation.the agency interprets the term as encompassing any document that could be used to support the rods,and notes that a toll receipt because it is normally date and is such a document.although this may not be the only plausible interpretation of supporting document,it is hardly unreasonable.the agency further contends that to adopt andrews would permit each carrier to exclude from the coverage of k any document it chose simply by not using it for eviscerate enforcement of the regulations.while that may be an overstatement of the consequence of adopting andrews view,the agency is nonetheless correct in arguing that its own view is consistent with the regulatory purpose and facilitates the agency ability to ensure the veracity of the rods and the enforcement of the limits on driving time.
we thus conclude that the fmcsa current interpretation of k is a reasonable construction of its regulation.nonetheless,that interpretation might still trigger the requirements of notice and comment if it represents a significant change from a previous,definitive interpretation.we are unable,however,to discern such a change.
in support of its contention that the fmcsa previously interpreted supporting documents as limited to those actually used by a carrier,andrews points to a passage from a regulatory guidance that the agency issued in and repeated verbatim in 
supporting documents are the records of the motor carrier which are maintained in the ordinary course of business and used by the motor carrier to verify the information recorded on the driver record of duty status.examples are bills of lading,tickets,fuel receipts,fuel billing statements,and toll receipts 
regulatory guidance for the federal motor carrier safety regulations,repeated in,emphasis added.in focusing on this passage,however,andrews neglects the two sentences that immediately follow,and that appear to adopt a can be used or could be used interpretation 
supporting documents may include other documents which the motor carrier maintains and can be used to verify information on the driver records of duty status.
id.emphasis added.the regulatory guidance thus offers some support for the positions of both andrews and the fmcsa,and can only be described.it can not be said to mark a definitive interpretation from which the agency current construction is a substantial departure.
in further support of its argument,andrews points to a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm that the fmcsa issued in but never finalized in a promulgated rule.the nprm was issued in response to congress directive,in the hazardous materials transportation authorization act of,stat,that the fmcsa clarify the meaning of supporting document and list those supporting documents that a carrier is required to maintain.the statute directed the fmcsa to prescribe regulations amending part of title,and to include a provision specifying the number,type,and frequency of supporting documents that must be retained by a motor carrier.id.a,b.for purposes of those new regulations,the legislation defined a supporting document as any document that is generated or received by a motor carrier or commercial motor vehicle driver in the normal course of business that could be used,as produced or with additional identifying information,to verify the accuracy of a driver record of duty status.id.c emphasis added.the congressional directive was not and did not indicate whether it was restating or changing the agency existing interpretation.hence,because the fmcsa never promulgated the contemplated regulation,the statutory definition does not govern this case.it does,however,provide support for the proposition that the agency interpretation of supporting document,as a document that could be used to verify the accuracy of a rods,is reasonable.
needless to say,this is not the aspect of the nprm to which andrews draws our attention.instead,it contends that statements in the notice show that the fmcsa understood its original interpretation of supporting documents as limited to documents actually used by the carrier.but the nprm is no less ambiguous or,perhaps better put,no less than the guidances that preceded it.the nprm does state,as andrews notes,that 
the fmcsa intended that the term supporting document refer to those specific documents,and only those specific documents,that a motor carrier used in its system or program to verify the accuracy of the driver duty activities.it was not meant to encompass all records,but only those that were,indeed,used by the motor carrier,to verify the dates,times,and locations the driver recorded.
hours of service of drivers supporting documents,emphasis added.but two sentences later,the nprm destroys this clarity by stating 
the regulatory guidance stated that supporting documents are the records of the motor carrier maintained in the ordinary course of business that are used,or could be used,by the motor carrier to verify the information recorded on a driver record of duty status.
id.emphasis added.moreover,the nprm then goes on to state that it is proposing to use the statutory definition of supporting documents as provided by congress in the act,the could be used declares that,because since,the fmcsa has required that all supporting documents must be collected and kept for six months,t his collection of documents is not a new paperwork burden.id.at.in short,although ambiguous may be too charitable a word to describe these conflicting passages in the nprm,the one thing that is clear is that the document can not be regarded as a definitive acknowledgment that the agency had previously regarded used by rather than could be used as the appropriate interpretation of supporting documents.
finally,we note that,while its federal register notices are less than clear,the agency prior informal adjudication on this issue is quite clear and completely in accord with the view of supporting documents relied upon by the fmcsa below.in in re national retail transportation,no.fmcsa,the fmcsa rejected a carrier claim,identical to that of andrews,that the term supporting documents should be limited to those that the motor carrier of could have been log verification,fmcsa slip op.at.if supporting documents were defined as the carrier urged,the fmcsa continued,motor carriers could always escape responsibility for retaining them merely by saying that they do not use them.id.instead,the agency said,k provided the carrier with reasonable notice of a duty to keep ordinary business documents so that the record of duty status of its drivers could be verified specifically including documents containing information such as mileage,origin,destination,stops,expenses,and tolls.id.at emphasis added 
in sum,in the midst of the period in which the fmcsa issued the ambiguous guidances relied upon by andrews,it issued a clear decision that confirms the interpretation applied by the agency in this case.andrews is therefore unable to show that the decision below represents a substantial change in the agency construction of k.
andrews further contends that,even if toll receipts are supporting documents and therefore must be maintained,k does not require motor carriers to maintain them in a way that permits the fmcsa to match them with their corresponding drivers.andrews argues that the phrase,shall maintain all supporting documents for each driver,requires maintenance only and does not specify the manner in which the documents must be maintained.the agency,by contrast,argues that maintain is reasonably construed to mean maintain in a usable condition here,that the carrier may not take documents that it receives in a format that permits identification of individual drivers,and then merge them so that the individual identifications are lost.once again,we find the agency interpretation reasonable.
although k does not define maintain,it is hardly arbitrary to construe the regulation in light of its is to ensure the enforceability of the hours of service regulations and the protection to the public which these regulations provide.driver logs.if the carrier maintains the toll receipts which usually do not have the individual driver name on them in the manner in which they arrive at its,in the individual driver trip is possible for both the carrier and the fmcsa to enforce those regulations.if,instead,andrews removes the receipts and,without copying or otherwise marking them,combines them with the receipts of all other drivers,correlation with individual drivers becomes impossible and the purpose of the regulation is frustrated.it is thus not unreasonable for the agency to read maintain in a way that bars the latter practice.
andrews seeks support for its position in the following passage from the and guidances cited above 
supporting documents may include other documents which the motor carrier maintains and can be used to verify information on the driver records of duty status.if these records are maintained at locations other than the principal place of business but are not used by the motor carrier for verification purposes,they must be forwarded to the principal place of business upon a request by an authorized representative of the fmcsa or state official within business days.
at,repeated in.at emphasis added.andrews contends that the italicized clause recognizes that a carrier may keep records that it does not use for verification,like the toll receipts in this case,at a location remote from the place at which it keeps the driver rods.but while andrews is correct in concluding that supporting documents may be removed from their original location,the passage also makes clear that the documents must quickly be returned upon the request of an fmcsa investigator.and since the investigator purpose in requesting return is to permit verification of the information in the driver rods,it is not unreasonable for the agency to insist that,if the documents are removed,they must be handled in a fashion that permits them to be matched with their original driver.
andrews also contends that the fmcsa decision in this case amounts to the de facto adoption of a recordkeeping requirement considered but rejected in the nprm.like that requirement,andrews asserts,the fmcsa decision requires the carrier to toe tag label by driver every supporting document,create a system of,and then file each document accordingly.but that is not an accurate description of the decision below.this case involves a document a toll receipt that andrews concedes it receives in the ordinary course of business,and that it receives in a manner inside the driver trip envelope that permits identification of the driver who submitted it.all the fmcsa decision requires is that andrews retain such documents for six months and refrain from destroying the agency ability to match them with their associated drivers by taking them out of their original envelopes and tossing them into a common pile.in short,the fmcsa decision does not require andrews to index these documents it merely bars the carrier from them at least without copying or labeling them first 
our conclusion,that the fmcsa has reasonably interpreted k as barring andrews from irretrievably commingling its drivers toll receipts,is in accord with the views of the only other circuit to have considered the question.in transport express,united states,the sixth circuit considered the fmcsa conditional rating of a motor carrier that,like andrews,treated its drivers toll receipts in a fashion that prevented their comparison with the associated driver rods.cir,aff g in re transport express,fmcsa may.transport received a driver packet from each driver,containing inter alia the driver toll receipts,bills of lading,fuel receipts,and logs.when the payroll department finished with the toll receipts,it lumped the receipts for all its drivers into one large envelope for each month of the correlation of receipts and drivers impossible.the fmcsa found transport to have violated k,holding that supporting documents must be maintained by the carrier in a manner that will allow an agency investigator to compare those documents to the rods.in re transport,fmcsa slip op.at,quoted in transport,at.
the sixth circuit affirmed,concluding that the fmcsa interpretation of k is reasonable and consistent with the language of the regulations.transport,at.it found that transport practice rendered the toll receipts nearly useless in verifying a driver rods,and that while it was semantically possible to construe maintain as requiring nothing more than what transport did,the fmcsa interpretation better served the statutory purpose of promoting the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles.id.at.finally,the court also held that,because the fmcsa decision did nothing more than interpret an existing regulation and did not change any existing law or policy,it was an interpretative rule exempt from the notice and comment requirements of the administrative procedure act.id.at.we are in accord with the views of the sixth circuit,and therefore reject the claim of the petitioner here 
andrews next argument is that,even if the fmcsa interpretation of k is reasonable and unchanged,andrews had no fair notice that its satisfactory safety rating was in jeopardy for failing to maintain its drivers toll receipts in an identifiable fashion.andrews br.at.in general electric epa,we held that i n the absence of example,when the regulation is not sufficiently clear to warn a party about what is expected of agency may not deprive a party of property by imposing civil or criminal liability,as the discussion in part suggests,there is something to andrews argument that the agency has been less than clear as to whether the term supporting documents extends to records,like andrews toll receipts,that could be but are not actually used by a carrier to verify its drivers rods.although the regulatory language may not itself be so unclear as to implicate the general electric rule,the clarifying utterances of the agency could have left a carrier confused about what was required of it.for that,the agency has no one but itself to blame.despite congress direction that the fmcsa issue a regulation elucidating the term coverage,the agency has still inexplicably failed to act.
notwithstanding the ambiguity of the regulatory guidances,however,the fmcsa opinion in national retail transportation was crystal clear on this point.it expressly rejected the claim that supporting documents are only those a motor carrier actually uses,and specifically listed tolls as the kind of information included within the realm of supporting documents.moreover,andrews early reaction to its citation strongly suggests that the employer was not in doubt that k requires it to maintain toll receipts.the carrier petition for administrative review did not dispute that toll receipts are supporting documents,but claimed only that the regulation did not require that all supporting documents be filed by each driver.at emphasis omitted.similarly,the affidavit of andrews safety director acknowledged that i retain toll receipts for at least six months to comply with k.jones aff.at at indeed,despite the legal arguments andrews raises here,the fact is that andrews does retain its toll receipts the carrier was not downgraded for not having toll receipts,but for refiling them in a manner that left them useless.
the only remaining question,therefore,is whether andrews had sufficient notice that the fmcsa regarded andrews practice of combining drivers toll receipts as a violation of k.on that point,this court has no doubt.under general electric,an agency efforts to bring about compliance will provide adequate notice.at.and as the agency points out,andrews was the subject of many such efforts.
in response to the fair notice argument below,the fmcsa held that andrews has previously been put on notice that its method of retention of supporting documents including toll receipts does not conform to the regulatory requirements,specifically citing andrews march compliance review.andrews trucking,fmcsa slip op.at.in that review,andrews was cited for violating k,because its drivers had submitted f alse reports of record of duty status and because supporting documents are not identifiable to the driver s corresponding record of duty status.at.the review went on to advise andrews to ensure all documents supporting records of duty status such as toll,fuel,repair and other expense receipts are identified to the corresponding drivers record of duty status.at emphasis added 
nor was march the first or last time andrews was warned prior to the instant citation.in andrews july compliance review,the fmcsa discovered ten instances in which drivers had falsified their rods.administrative record doc,at.andrews was cited for not having a system to effectively control the drivers hours of service.id.at.the investigators specifically noted carrier has change d his method of filing documents since the last prosecution.toll records are thrown in a box.id.at.thereafter,in a september compliance review,andrews was again cited for allowing drivers to submit f alse reports of records of duty status,and for allowing drivers to drive in excess of the limitations.doc,at.the fmcsa specifically noted that andrews had reduce d the probability of identifying a false record of duty status by mainta in ing toll receipts by payroll period,not by driver.id.at.finally,in a december compliance review,the investigators once again noted that andrews had taken the toll tickets from the driver expense envelope and placed these documents in a box with other driver s toll tickets.doc,at.this meant,the investigators said,that the toll receipts could not be used to check the driver logs for accuracy.it appear ed,they continued,that the carrier has taken steps to make it difficult to determine if the drivers are in a specific location at a certain time.id 
nor were these citations andrews only notice of the fmcsa interpretation of the recordkeeping requirements.as we have discussed above,six months before it issued the citation to andrews,the fmcsa held in transport that a carrier practice of removing toll receipts from its individual drivers packets and combining them in large envelopes violated k and warranted a conditional safety rating.in re transport,fmcsa slip op.at.thus,even if nothing else did,transport put andrews squarely on notice that it should cease the filing practices against which it had been repeatedly warned throughout the.this is not a case in which a regulated entity required extraordinary intuition or the aid of a psychic to anticipate being found in violation of a regulation.united states chrysler.rather,it is a case in which the carrier persisted in its ways despite clear and repeated warnings from the relevant government agency.andrews,therefore,can find no refuge in the doctrine of fair notice.
andrews also argues that the requirement that toll receipts be retained,and retained in a way that permits the fmcsa to match them to its drivers rods,violates the paperwork reduction act.that statute bars the enforcement of a recordkeeping requirement unless it is first approved by the office of management and budget omb.id.the fmcsa does not dispute the application of the act to the recordkeeping requirements of k,but argues that the statute has been satisfied because omb approved the regulation when it was promulgated in.see driver logs,see also.at referring to past omb approvals of k recordkeeping requirements.
andrews contends that the original approval by omb is insufficient because the fmcsa has materially changed the meaning of the regulation,and that the new meaning amounts to a new recordkeeping burden regardless of whether the agency acknowledges the point by promulgating a new rule.see h providing that an agency may not make a substantive or material modification to a collection of information after such collection has been approved by omb,unless the modification has been submitted to omb for review and approval.this argument has little traction,however,as we have already accepted the agency position that its current interpretation does not depart from the original.andrews might nonetheless prevail if it could demonstrate that,whatever the fmcsa thought in,omb understood the regulation differently.but this andrews can not do either,as the announcement of omb approval did not describe what documents either agency thought were within the scope of the regulation.see.at.
in a related vein,andrews argues that the fmcsa latest estimate of the burden posed by its current interpretation is substantially higher than its estimate of the burden of the original rule.if true,this could suggest that the agency is indeed requiring more than it did when the rule was first promulgated the cited estimates,however,do not support andrews argument.
once again,the document andrews points to is the nprm.there,the fmcsa stated that it believed the burden imposed by fully implementing the hazardous materials transportation authorization act of would be more than is currently expected and at least hours.at.although the nprm did not state the currently expected burden,andrews points to a roughly contemporaneous submission by the department of transportation that put the figure at hours andrews contends that the difference results from the hazardous materials act requirement that all documents that could be used to verify rods must be retained and indexed,while the original regulation required nothing more than retention of those documents that actually are used to verify rods.
the nprm,however,does not corroborate andrews argument.the estimated burden was not for maintaining,in the manner in which they were received by the carrier,all documents that could be used to verify a driver rods.to the contrary,the agency indicated that merely defining supporting documents as the act defined them,as those that could be used is not a new paperwork burden.id.at.the collection of documents under that definition,the fmcsa said,has been calculated into past paperwork burden approvals of the office of management and budget.id.rather,the burden was for a new rule the agency considered but did not propose a rule that would have required carriers to audit each one of supporting documents for a minimum of five items,compare the documents to the rods,and fil e and stor e the records.id.at.that was the task the agency said was more than is currently expected and that it rejected as too burdensome.id.and as we have explained in part above,that is not the task required by the decision below.
in sum,because the fmcsa decision in this case relies upon a reasonable interpretation of a regulation previously cleared by omb under the paperwork reduction act,and does not represent the imposition of a new rule or recordkeeping burden,the act does not bar enforcement of the interpretation against andrews 
andrews further contends that,in reaching its decision to downgrade the carrier safety rating,the fmcsa violated the procedural requirements of both the apa and the constitution.in particular,it contends that the fmcsa improperly denied its request for an oral hearing and discovery.these arguments require only brief mention.
andrews argues that it was entitled
