kathleen hernandez,the family of ashlee hernandez and rochelle ramos filed a lawsuit against the california department of transportation caltrans after ramos and kathleen hernandez were injured and ashlee hernandez was killed in an automobile accident at the lower azusa road on the interstate freeway.they contend the lack of a guardrail at the accident location constituted a dangerous condition of public property.the trial court granted caltrans motion for summary judgment,finding the action was barred by statutory design immunity as a matter of law.we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
according to the undisputed facts presented in connection with caltrans motion for summary judgment,the accident at issue in this case occurred on september.plaintiffs were passengers in a toyota camry driven by melinda martinez.the camry was pursued by a kia driven by ramos former boyfriend raul contreras.the kia chased the camry from surface streets in west covina to the interstate freeway and then to the northbound interstate freeway.the cars were traveling at a high speed when contreras intentionally rammed the camry.frightened,martinez attempted to exit the freeway at the lower azusa road,with contreras still in pursuit.the camry,which was then traveling at to miles per hour,struck a dodge caravan and skidded off the roadway and down an embankment.ashlee hernandez was killed kathleen hernandez was rendered paraplegic and ramos allegedly suffered brain injuries hernandez sued caltrans,alleging the lack of a guardrail at the site of the accident constituted a dangerous condition of public property pursuant to government code section 
caltrans moved for summary judgment the motion on four grounds it could not be liable because it had no duty to protect hernandez against the unforeseeable criminal acts of contreras hernandez could not establish dangerous condition liability as a matter of law because the was not being used with due care and in a reasonable foreseeably manner when the accident occurred hernandez could not prove caltrans had either actual or constructive notice of any dangerous condition at the accident site and caltrans had an absolute defense to the action based on the design immunity provisions of government code section 
hernandez opposed the motion,arguing although caltrans owed no duty to protect her from the unforeseeable criminal acts of third parties,it owed a duty to prevent dangerous conditions of public property such as that allegedly existing at the accident site the existence of a dangerous condition at the is a question of fact that,based on the conflicting evidence presented by the parties,can not be resolved on summary judgment caltrans had evidence of three previous accidents near the accident site within the months preceding the accident and triable issues of fact existed as to the applicability of the design immunity defense.
with respect to the discretionary approval element of caltrans design immunity affirmative defense,with its summary judgment motion caltrans presented evidence that the at issue was part of a construction project designed in the late and completed in may.the was built as designed without guardrails at the location where the martinez car left the roadway.the design plan shows the existence of the embankment,its approximate height and slope and the locations where guardrails were to be total of feet of guardrail along the ramp,feet of railing at the top of the ramp and feet at the bottom.caltrans also produced the certified plans signed by officials with authority to approve them.caltrans expert testified to the normal approval process utilized by caltrans when the project was designed and opined that the signatures on the plans indicate that the individuals who signed had approved the design contained in the plans prior to construction of the.
in opposition hernandez presented evidence that the as designed violated caltrans then applicable guidelines,which,according to hernandez expert,required installation of an embankment guardrail along the entirety of the ramp under the analysis prescribed by the state guardrail need determination curve.any deviation from the applicable guidelines required the designer to obtain formal approval,which would be recorded in a project approval document.hernandez noted and caltrans did not dispute that no project approval document for the could be located.at his deposition caltrans expert acknowledged that he did not know whether any of the three engineers who signed the plans actually considered the guardrail installation guidelines and approved the purported deviation from the guidelines requirements.
at a hearing on december,the trial court found triable issues of fact existed as to the presence of a dangerous condition at the site of the accident.in a memorandum of decision dated january,however,the trial court granted caltrans motion on the ground of design immunity.it ruled that,in order to establish design immunity on summary judgment,caltrans was required to show substantial evidence of a discretionary approval of the design for the and b reasonableness of the design.it found caltrans had met that burden,concluding that,w hile the inference made from the absence of guardrails is not strong enough to amount to substantial evidence that someone must have evaluated the situation and exercised discretion with respect to the need for guardrails,the presence of guardrails on the plans at the top and bottom of the,but not at the location of the accident,is substantial evidence.the court rejected hernandez argument that the design violated the state guardrail guidelines and the required approval for such a deviation had not been proved,finding from the evidence presented that the plans can not be said to not conform to state standards for guardrails the court also found there was insufficient evidence,as a matter of law,of changed circumstances that would cause the design immunity to be lost.judgment was entered in favor of caltrans.
contentions 
hernandez contends the trial court erred in holding the discretionary approval element of the design immunity defense is a question of law for the court and granting summary judgment based on substantial evidence of discretionary approval when that evidence was disputed by other evidence and inferences.
discussion 
standard of review 
the standard of review on appeal after an order granting summary judgment is well settled.a trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.we review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.artiglio corning cal th,d.in the trial court,once a moving defendant has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue to meet that burden,the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action code civ,subd.o see aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.merrill navegar,cal th,d.
in reviewing the evidence,we strictly construe the moving party evidence and liberally construe the opposing party and accept as undisputed only those portions of the moving party evidence that are uncontradicted.only when the inferences are indisputable may the court decide the issues as a matter of law.if the evidence is in conflict,the factual issues must be resolved by trial.any doubts about the propriety of summary judgment are generally resolved against granting the motion,because that allows the future development of the case and avoids errors.citation.binder aetna life ins.th,d see also katz chevron th,d doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion should be resolved in favor of the opposing party.
the trial court erred in granting summary judgment based on design immunity 
the state is not liable for a defect in the design plan for a public improvement if it can establish the three elements that constitute the design immunity affirmative defense.the state must show a causal relationship between the project design and the accident discretionary approval of the design prior to construction and substantial evidence supporting the reasonableness of the design.citations.alvarez state of california th,d alvarez cornette department of transportation cal th,d,cornette see also.the parties do not dispute the existence of the first and third elements for purposes of the motion.relying on established rules governing summary judgment,hernandez contends caltrans failed to establish the absence of triable issues of material fact with respect to the second element.caltrans,on the other hand,contends all elements of design immunity are legal issues for the court and its only burden was to show substantial evidence there was discretionary approval of the plans prior to construction.the trial court agreed with caltrans.we do not.
in its memorandum of decision the trial court extensively discussed two court of appeal decisions alvarez,supra,th,d,in which the court affirmed a summary judgment based on the design immunity defense and levin state of california d.levin,in which the court reversed such a summary judgment.hernandez contends,and we agree,that the trial court erred in following alvarez and failing to apply the rationale of the supreme court decision in cornette,supra,cal th,d,which recognized that the second element of the design immunity defense is a question of fact for the jury.
alvarez state of california 
both in the trial court and on appeal caltrans has relied on alvarez,supra,th,d,in which the fifth district affirmed the trial court grant of summary judgment on the ground of design immunity,holding that w hether each element of design immunity exists is a question of law.id.at,d.in alvarez the plaintiff contended the lack of a median barrier on state route constituted a dangerous condition.id.at,d.the state moved for summary judgment based on design immunity.ibid.in support of the second element of the design immunity defense,the state presented a copy of the as built plans for the project in question and the declarations of former and current caltrans employees describing the discretionary approval process for roadway designs in general and for the project in particular id.at,d.
the plaintiff contended the state evidence was insufficient to meet its burden of establishing that the dangerous feature of the design was approved by an employee exercising discretionary authority to give such approval.citation.alvarez,supra,th at,d.the court,however,held that the plans themselves provide evidence that the project design was given the requisite discretionary approval prior to construction.id.at,d.the court rejected the contention that discretionary approval can be proved only by testimony from the person who signed the documents or someone who was present when they were signed.it held that expert testimony was admissible to prove the state discretionary approval custom and practice.id.at,d as an expert,berner could competently testify to the state custom and practice of discretionary design review and approval during the relevant time period.he could competently interpret and explain the project plans,identify the officials involved the review and approval process at the district and state level,and explain their role in the discretionary approval process even though he was not personally involved in the project approval.
in affirming the trial court order granting summary judgment,the court of appeal concluded in summary,the project plans indicate the design was approved prior to construction by at least four state officials whose stated capacities indicate they had the discretionary authority to approve the plans.the evidence,coupled with telesco and berner declarations explaining the custom and practice of design review and approval and identifying the signing parties,was substantial evidence of discretionary approval discretionary approval simply means approval in advance of construction by the officer exercising discretionary authority.citation.a detailed plan,drawn up by a registered professional civil engineer,and approved by four district and state officials in the exercise of their discretionary authority is sufficient to establish the prior approval element of design immunity.alvarez,supra,th at,d.
as the trial court in the present case noted in its memorandum of decision,the burden of proof applied in alvarez seems to be the same as that stated in the third element,that of substantial evidence.therefore,under alvarez the burden is on the state to show substantial evidence of both the second and third elements.
levin state of california 
the trial court memorandum of decision acknowledged that a different result was reached in levin,supra,d,a wrongful death action alleging the lack of a median barrier and guardrails on a portion of state highway constituted a dangerous condition of public property.id.at.in levin the state moved for summary judgment on the ground of design immunity.id.at.in order to establish discretionary approval the state presented evidence that the design changes at issue the changes were approved by legarra,a deputy highway engineer who had approval authority.id.at.the state also proffered the deposition testimony and reports of victor graf,a senior transportation engineer with the state who was a consultant on the relevant design project.ibid.graf testified he specifically considered the placement of a median barrier and exterior guardrails,but concluded that neither was advisable on this particular stretch of highway.id.at.
in opposition to the motion the plaintiffs presented evidence the highway was altered in and the new design was unsafe because the south shoulder was deficient and substandard and should have been provided with guardrails at the edge of a steep embankment.levin,supra,d at.their expert opined that t he conditions described in the division of highways traffic manual,promulgating standards warrants for guardrails fn.omitted were present,and should have been followed.ibid.the state did not challenge the existence and application of the guardrail standards cited by the plaintiffs,yet there was no evidence that legarra had discretionary authority to disregard the standards.id.at.the court of appeal reversed the judgment,stating as our supreme court pointed out in cameron state of california cal d,the rationale of the design immunity defense is to prevent a jury from simply reweighing the same factors considered by the governmental entity which approved the design.an actual informed exercise of discretion is required.the defense does not exist to immunize decisions that have not been made.here,as in cameron,supra,the design plan contained no mention of the steep slope of the embankment.the state made no showing that legarra,who alone had discretionary authority,decided to ignore the standards or considered the consequences of the elimination of the eight feet shoulder.it follows that the state also failed to establish the second element of the defense.ibid.
the trial court in the present case noted that what distinguishes levin from alvarez is that in levin the state failed to show that the official who exercised the discretionary authority to approve the design was aware the roadway did not conform to the governing guardrail standards.alvarez,supra,th at,d.although hernandez presented evidence that,as in levin,the design at issue in the instant case violated the applicable guardrail standards and,also as in levin,caltrans had no evidence that any deviations from the governing standards were knowingly approved,the trial court nonetheless concluded alvarez,rather than levin,was controlling based on its own determination,after weighing the evidence,that the plans did conform to state standards for guardrails at the time built.in denying hernandez motion for a new trial,the trial court explained all three of the issues
