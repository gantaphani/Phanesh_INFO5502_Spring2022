discussion 
t he administrative per se laws are intended to provide an efficient mechanism whereby those persons who drive after consuming dangerous amounts of alcohol can have their driver licenses quickly suspended so as to ensure they will not endanger the public by continuing to drive.lake reed cal th,d.the relevant statutes include vehicle code section,subdivision a which mandates that the dmv immediately suspend the license of a person found to be driving with percent or more of alcohol in his or her blood.the dmv must automatically review its initial decision to suspend a license,subd.a.if requested by the driver,the dmv must hold a hearing on its decision to suspend a license,subd.a.at the hearing,the dmv has the burden of proving the officer had reasonable cause to believe the driver had been driving under the influence the driver was arrested and the driver was driving with percent or higher bac,subd.b,subd.c.a driver who is dissatisfied with the result of the dmv administrative hearing may file a petition for writ of mandate with the trial court.solovij gourley th,d.the trial court then determines,based on its independent judgment,whether the dmv decision was supported by the weight of the evidence.ibid.
on appeal,we need only review the record to determine whether the trial court findings are supported by substantial evidence.citation.we must resolve all evidentiary conflicts and draw all legitimate and reasonable inferences in favor of the trial court decision.citations.where the evidence supports more than one inference,we may not substitute our deductions for the trial court.citation.we may overturn the trial court factual findings only if the evidence before the trial court is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain those findings.citation.citations.lake reed,supra,cal th at,d.
admission of the alcohol analysis report into evidence 
appellant first contends that the only evidence that his bac was percent or higher was erroneously admitted into evidence at the hearing.the alcohol analysis report stating that appellant bac was percent also states that his blood was analyzed on november,but that the report was not typed until november.thus,according to appellant,the report did not qualify for admission at the hearing as an official record,pursuant to evidence code section,because it failed to satisfy that section requirement that the writing be made at or near the time of the act.see,subd.b.hence,appellant claims the report was inadmissible hearsay,which could not be used as evidence to support his license suspension.
the trial court found that the hearing officer had not erred in relying on the alcohol analysis report,stating well,in examining the report of the forensic lab,it does appear to me that it does not comply with of the evidence code in that the report was made november,six days after the analysis was done by wong the forensic laboratory analyst however,the court also finds that the rules regarding administrative hearing s are very different than those that are required in a court of law,and i find that this document is substantially reliable that it a mere postponing of the typing of the report rather than the recording of the analysis.it clear from the way the report was worded that the typist took it from some other entry,a entry,that wong makes,so that objection is overruled.
in lake reed,supra,cal th at page,d,our supreme court explained that one aspect of the accelerated procedures of the administrative per se laws is a slight relaxation of the rules of evidence applicable to an administrative per se review hearing.in particular,it noted that government code section addresses the admissibility of evidence generally in administrative hearings.ibid.
subdivision c of government code section provides the hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses,except as hereinafter provided.any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs,regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of the evidence over objection in civil actions.subdivision d of that section further provides in relevant part hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence but over timely objection shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions,subd.d.
even assuming,as the trial court found,that the report did not satisfy subdivision b of evidence code section because it was typed six days after appellant blood was analyzed compare downer zolin th,fn,d with people martinez cal th,d,substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that the report was nevertheless admissible.the court found the document to be substantially reliable in that the wording of the report reflected a postponement,not in the recording of the analysis,but merely in the typing of a entry.we conclude that the report,although hearsay,was admissible pursuant to government code section,subdivision d,because it supplemented other evidence introduced at the hearing.
