omni air international,terminated anna botz employment as a flight attendant in july after she refused a flight assignment that she believed violated federal safety regulations.botz filed the instant action in a minnesota state court alleging that omni violated minnesota whistleblower statute.supp,by discharging her in retaliation for refusing the assignment and for reporting the alleged safety violation to omni.omni invoked federal diversity jurisdiction and removed botz action to the district court omni then moved to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,arguing that the state whistleblower provisions were both expressly and impliedly by the airline deregulation act of ada and the whistleblower protection program the program or wpp of the wendell ford aviation investment and reform act for the century,a,stat,to be codified as.the district court agreed that botz claims were and granted omni motion to dismiss.because we conclude that the ada expressly botz claims under the minnesota whistleblower statute,we affirm.
for purposes of our review,we accept as true the factual allegations in botz complaint.see hafley lohman,cir,cert.denied,d.omni employed botz as a flight attendant from may until her july discharge.in january,omni assigned botz to work both legs of a flight from alaska to japan.she believed when she received this assignment that it would require her to violate a restriction in the federal aviation regulations far limiting a flight attendant duty period to no longer than twenty hours.see.botz nevertheless apparently completed the january round trip without incident or controversy but,upon her return,contacted an employee at the federal aviation administration,cabin safety division,who told her that in his opinion the assignment did indeed violate the far.botz took no immediate steps to follow up on this information.
at an omni employee meeting on july,botz was again assigned the round trip.she objected,asserting that it violated the far.in response,omni corporate scheduler faxed a copy of an excerpt of the far to omni flight supervisor during the employee meeting.the flight supervisor concluded that the assignment did not violate the far.botz attempted after the meeting to contact the same employee with whom she had spoken earlier that year,but she was unable to reach him.
botz nevertheless informed omni on july,that she would refuse the assignment because she believed it violated the far.on july,botz met with omni representatives who informed her that her refusal was grounds for termination.she,in turn,presented to omni representatives the information she had received earlier in from the employee and asked omni representatives to contact him.botz also offered to carry out her disputed assignment without further objection if the employee confirmed the opinion of omni flight supervisor that the assignment did not violate the far.omni representatives told botz they would take hours to consider her request.on july,omni informed botz that she had been discharged for insubordination and refusal to accept an assignment.
botz then filed this suit in the hennepin county minnesota district court claiming that her discharge violated the minnesota whistleblower statute,see,subd.a,c,because omni discharged her for,she alleges,refusing the flight assignment and for reporting to omni what she suspected was a violation of the far.omni removed the suit to the district court,invoking federal diversity jurisdiction,and moved to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
we review the district court grant of omni b motion to dismiss de novo.see hafley,at.we construe her complaint in the light most favorable to her and determine whether she can prove any set of facts that would entitle her to relief.id.
our task is to determine whether the ada,as amended by the wpp,botz claims under the minnesota whistleblower statute.for our purposes here,then,the key feature of the ada is its provision.the provision states,in pertinent part 
a state may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier 
b the ada also includes a savings clause a remedy under this part is in addition to any other remedies provided by law.c.the supreme court has referred to this as a general remedies savings clause and deemed it a relic of the regime.morales trans world airlines,d.botz nevertheless relies in part upon the existence of this savings clause to support her argument that the ada does not expressly her claims.
omni express and implied arguments,in turn,rely in part upon congress enactment of the wpp in the program protects employees who report actual or alleged safety violations or who file proceedings regarding actual or alleged safety violations.the program is a detailed and comprehensive regulatory scheme.it specifies four classes of protected employee conduct,prescribes both the evidentiary and legal standards the secretary of labor must use to determine whether a violation has occurred and the remedy to be ordered,coordinates the duties and involvement of two separate federal agencies,and even includes modest penalties to deter unfounded or inequitable complaints.the program protects employees from retaliation by their employers for a variety of whistleblowing conduct based on any actual or alleged federal violation.
botz bases her claims on two provisions of the minnesota whistleblower statute that protect an employee who in good faith reports a possible violation of any law or who refuses any assignment that she has an objective,factual basis to believe violates any law see,subd.a,c.the statute forbids any employer from taking an adverse employment action against an as disciplining,demoting,or discharging retaliation for the employee whistleblowing conduct and grants a civil cause of action with its customary legal and equitable remedies to an employee who is so injured.see id.
although omni argued before the district court both express and implied theories of,the court did not analyze omni implied argument because it ultimately concluded that botz minnesota whistleblower claims were expressly by the ada.in determining whether botz minnesota whistleblower claims fell within the scope of the claims congress intended the ada to,the district court looked first to the plain language of the provision,noting that it must be interpreted in context and in light of the overall statutory scheme.the court acknowledged that the supreme court in morales trans world airlines,d,gave the phrase related to a very broad meaning,then focused on the service that a flight attendant provides.because the length of a flight attendant duty period has a significant effect upon the service he provides,any attempt to conceal violations of the far restrictions would seriously compromise the service that an air carrier provides.botz omni air int l,d.the court concluded that the plain language of b botz claims.
turning to the evidence of congressional intent provided by the context and structure of the statutory scheme,the district court noted that congressional policy,when coupled with the wpp comprehensive scheme for protecting whistleblowers who report possible safety violations,provided additional evidence that congress intended to state whistleblower claims based on safety violations.botz,d at.the district court distinguished the handful of cases botz cited that had held that the ada did not state whistleblower claims on the ground that these cases were all decided before congress enacted the wpp,when the evidence of congress intent to state whistleblower claims was scant.
in analyzing the effect of a statutory scheme such as the ada,our ultimate touchstone is the purpose of congress.see cipollone liggett group,d.we begin with the language employed by congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.park n fly,dollar park fly,d accord morales,at.we do not lightly infer in the area of employment law,for it falls within the traditional police power of the state.fort halifax packing coyne,d accord hawaiian airlines,norris,d analyzing the effect of a federal act upon wrongful discharge remedies.we therefore start with the assumption that the states historic police powers are not to be superseded,b ut that presumption can be overcome where congress has made clear its desire for.egelhoff egelhoff ex rel.breiner,d accord rice santa fe elevator.
congress may evince its intent to state law either implicitly or explicitly.cipollone,at.as we have already noted,omni argues theories of both implied and express.we ordinarily do not consider theories of implied where,as here,congress has considered the issue of and has included in the enacted legislation a provision explicitly addressing that issue.id.at.because we conclude that the ordinary meaning of the language of the ada provision adequately demonstrates congress intent to botz claims under the minnesota whistleblower statute,we find no need to consider omni implied arguments.
heeding the supreme court guidance,we begin our express analysis with the plain language of the ada provision,giving effect to the provision plain language unless there is good reason to believe congress intended the language to have some more restrictive meaning.id.at.quoting shaw delta air lines,d.because congress has given us an express provision,our task is to identify the domain expressly.lorillard tobacco reilly,d.more precisely,we must determine whether that domain encompasses botz claim.
the ada provision defines the segment of interstate commerce in which a state attempt to enact or enforce a law here,the minnesota whistleblower statute will be prohibited any state enforcement action or enactment related to a price,route,or service of an air carrier.the phrase related to itself is,to understate the point,neither narrow nor restrictive.as the supreme court noted in morales these words ordinarily have a broad meaning to stand in some relation to have bearing or concern to pertain refer to bring into association with or connection with.at.quoting black law dictionary ed.although congress could easily have selected more restrictive terminology to describe the type of state enforcement action or enactment the ada,the provision as written is without language that would produce a more limited effect.
though by no means,the phrase a price,route,or service of an air carrier is similarly broad.congress did not choose to restrict the scope of the word list price,route,or service by using the kind of qualifying words or phrases that would have made the list three terms more definite or focused.thus,it is apparent from the provision plain language that it has a broad effect on state law claims involving prices,routes,or services.
we are,however,also guided by the supreme court explicit determinations that the ada provision has a broad scope.the court in morales noted that the provision related to language is identical to language that performs a similar function in erisa express provision,language which the court had previously determined had a broad scope and expansive sweep.id.at.because the language is identical,the court therefore adopted and adapted from its erisa express decisions a standard for interpreting the ada provision section b expressly s tate enforcement actions having a connection with or reference to airline prices,routes,or services.id.at.
while the provision broad reach,the court in american airlines,wolens,d,refined and applied the standard it had developed in morales.the court strongly suggested that the ada provision ban on enacting or enforcing any law relating to rates,routes,or services is most sensibly read,in light of the ada overarching deregulatory purpose,to mean states may not seek to impose their own public policies or theories of competition or regulation on the operations of an air carrier.id.at.quoting brief for united states as amicus curiae at.
when applied to the facts surrounding botz discharge,the minnesota whistleblower statute has a forbidden connection with services.it includes broad authorization to flight attendants to refuse assignments,jeopardizing an air carrier ability to complete its scheduled flights.the far set standards for the minimum number of flight attendants that must be on board and available to serve passengers and execute safety procedures.see specifying the minimum number of flight attendants required during flight for each of several classes of passenger aircraft id.specifying same for periods during which aircraft are on the ground but passengers are on board.thus,an air carrier is unauthorized to fly or even board passengers if an aircraft crew does not include the proper number of flight attendants.an air carrier that is confronted with a flight attendant refusal to serve on a flight to which he has been assigned has at least two obvious options for dealing with the scheduled flight.it can replace the refusing flight attendant with another flight attendant it employs,or,if it is unable to replace him in time,it can cancel the flight to comply with the far prescriptions of the minimum number of flight attendants and reschedule the ticketed passengers onto other flights.
a large air carrier employing hundreds of flight attendants might encounter few difficulties replacing a refusing flight attendant,assuming,that is,that the flight attendant provides the carrier with notice of his refusal sufficiently in advance of the flight scheduled departure.replacing a flight attendant even with a few days notice might prove problematic or even impossible,however,for a small carrier with relatively few flight attendants.for any size carrier,a significant likelihood exists that the carrier will have to cancel the flight in order to comply with the far staffing regulations.this is patently true when the flight attendant refuses the assignment within a few hours of the flight scheduled departure.on that day at least,the air carrier will not be providing the service for which its customers have paid at one of its scheduled times.an air carrier can not avoid this possibility even by adhering to every law,rule,and and state,for the minnesota whistleblower statute authorizes refusals based on the flight attendant objective,belief alone that the assignment is violative.this authorization to refuse assignments,and the protections that the whistleblower statute provides,have a forbidden connection with an air carrier service under any reasonable interpretation of congress use of the word service.compare,charas trans world airlines,cir en banc holding that service in the ada provision,when juxtaposed to rates and routes,refers to such things as the frequency and scheduling of transportation,and to the selection of markets to or from which transportation is provided,with hodges delta airlines,cir en banc holding that services refers to elements of the contractual arrangement between the airline and the user of the service,including items such as ticketing,boarding procedures,provision of food and drink,and baggage handling,in addition to the transportation itself quoting hodges delta airlines,cir.
the minnesota whistleblower statute connection with services is quite similar to the connection discussed in morales between prices and the uniform state advertising guidelines that were there under consideration.both relate to the domain of prices,routes,and services indirectly.the guidelines in morales affected prices by restricting and regulating advertising.the minnesota whistleblower statute affects service by authorizing a flight attendant to refuse assignments and protecting her when she does.both are states attempts to impose their own public policies or regulatory theories on an air carrier operations,an imposition that congress intended the ada to.see wolens,at.the statute authorization to refuse assignments is not limited to actual violations.rather,it extends to any assignment which the flight attendant has an objective,factual basis merely to believe is in violation.neither does the statute set any limitation upon the circumstances surrounding the refusal it authorizes a flight attendant to refuse an assignment in any place,at any time.although,as bo
