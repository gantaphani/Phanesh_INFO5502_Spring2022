the city of olmsted falls,ohio,petitions this court for review of the federal aviation administration faa approval of the record of decision for a runway improvement project at cleveland hopkins international airport.see notice of approval of the record of decision for proposed development at the cleveland hopkins international airport,cleveland,ohio,fed.reg.the runway improvement project includes the relocation of one existing runway,the shift and extension of the other parallel runway,and other attendant projects.olmsted falls contends that the faa approval was arbitrary and capricious,in violation of clean air act section c,c the national environmental policy act,et nepa and section f of the department of transportation act,c dot act.olmsted falls also argues that a supplemental environmental impact statement is required under nepa.because the faa approval of the record of decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious,and because no further documentation is required under nepa,we deny the petition for review.
background 
cleveland hopkins international airport cle or the airport is owned by the city of cleveland,ohio,and operated by cleveland department of port control.cle is a major hub for continental airlines and as such serves as an important hub for the national airspace system as defined by the faa.the airport is currently served by three active runways the two parallel runways,which run,are separated by only feet,and a third crosswind runway is primarily used by turboprop craft.due to the extremely narrow separation between the two parallel runways,cle currently uses one exclusively for arrivals and the other exclusively for departures,reducing capacity and increasing airfield complexity.studies conducted by the cleveland department of port control and the faa indicated that the current runway configuration at cle is inadequate and modernization is required to alleviate safety risks and to meet future regional and national air travel needs.these studies indicated that by the existing airport runway system would operate at levels of delay in excess of minutes per aircraft during peak periods.
in,the cleveland department of port control began preparing a master plan update,a study used to develop and evaluate facilities recommendations consistent with the airport character and activity levels.specifically,the department of port control sought to develop solutions for cle that would enhance safety,improve efficiency,and lessen the environmental impacts of the airport.after evaluating various airfield and air traffic alternatives,the department of port control issued its airport layout plan.the airport layout plan proposed updating both runways to ensure they meet current faa design standards and to generally enhance safety,while providing for anticipated demand.the plan recommended relocating and replacing one of the parallel runways feet away from the other.the remaining original runway would be shifted feet southwest and extended feet.this would create greater spacing between the two runways and thus accommodate two parallel taxiways between the runways.
while the master plan update was being prepared by the department of port control,the faa began the public phase of the environmental review process in may.in october,the faa issued the draft environmental impact statement eis for the implementation of the master plan update and the airport layout plan projects.these projects were the preferred alternative in the draft eis,and were the subject of written comments by the city of olmsted falls the city or olmsted falls.following public comment,the faa released the final eis in june,and issued the record of decision on november.the record of decision contains the rationale for all required findings and provides approval for certain projects included in the department of port control airport layout plan.
olmsted falls filed this petition for review of the record of decision on december,pursuant to a.subsequently this court denied olmsted falls motion to stay and motion to expedite.
ii.analysis 
before reaching the merits of olmsted falls petition,we must determine whether the city has standing before this court.to satisfy the constitutional requirement of standing,a plaintiff or petitioner must,at an irreducible constitutional minimum demonstrate that it has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is actual or imminent,caused by or fairly traceable to,an act that the litigant challenges in the instant litigation,and redressable by the court.florida audubon soc y bentsen,en banc internal quotation marks and citations omitted see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the federal contend that the city failed clearly to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate standing.suncom mobile data,fcc,quoting warth seldin,d.it is the responsibility of the complainant clearly to allege facts demonstrating that he is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute and the exercise of the court remedial powers.warth,at.at.according to the faa,olmsted falls failed,in its petition and opening brief,to submit any affidavits or present any factual evidence at all showing that it had suffered an injury specific to itself.
in response,the city first contends that it has the necessary geographic nexus required to bring an action under an environmental statute,in that it is located two miles to the southwest of cle.however,geographic proximity does not,in and of itself,confer standing on any entity under nepa or any other statute.rather,it is the concrete and particularized injury which has occurred or is imminent due to geographic proximity to the action challenged that gives rise to article iii standing.see,lujan,at.at dubois dep t of agriculture,cir.moreover,as a matter of prudential standing,we have squarely held that a nepa claim may not be raised by a party with no claimed or apparent environmental interest.it can not be used as a handy stick by a party with no interest in protecting against an environmental injury to attack a defendant.town of stratford,ct faa,citation omitted.thus,olmsted falls must allege an injury related to an environmental proximity might be necessary to show such an injury,but it is not sufficient.
the city further claims that it may represent its citizens,much as a private association could represent its members interests.according to the city,it may properly be inferred that its citizens will use the water from the same watershed into which abram creek flows and will breathe the air containing the increased construction and aircraft emissions from the project undispersed by any significant distance from its points of emission.the city analogy of its representation of its citizens to a private organization representation of its members misconceives the very concept of associational standing.an association only has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right,the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.fund democracy,llc sec,emphasis added see friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.the city does not have members who have voluntarily associated,nor are the interests it seeks to assert here germane to its purpose.rather the city is effectively attempting to assert the alleged interests of its citizens under the doctrine of parens patriae.arguably,this theory of standing is unavailable because a state may not sue the federal government on behalf of its citizens as parens patriae.kansas united states,see also alfred snapp son,puerto rico,d.although the state,under some circumstances,may sue in that capacity for the protection of its citizens,it is no part of its duty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with the federal government.in that field it is the united states,and not the state,which represents them as parens patriae.massachusetts mellon.internal citation omitted.as municipalities derive their existence from the state and function as political subdivisions of the state,presumably they too can not sue the federal government under the doctrine of parens patriae.
we need not,however,decide that question.in this circuit we have found standing for a city suing an arm of the federal government when a harm to the city itself has been alleged.city of lafayette,sec,the cities satisfy the standing requirement by alleging injury in fact and a claim that the act requires consideration of the cities contentions in an acquisition proceeding.city of los angeles national highway traffic safety,overruled in part,florida audubon soc y bentsen,the polities claim to standing rests upon an entirely different footing.they assert that the caf√© standard of mpg for mys adversely affects air quality in their urban areas,making it more difficult for them to comply,as they must,with the air quality standards imposed upon them by the clean air act.thus,olmsted falls may bring this petition if it alleges harm to itself as city qua city.taking a generous reading of the petitioner materials,we find that olmsted falls has alleged harm to its own economic interests based on the environmental impacts of the approved project.although it is a close question,we conclude that the city has standing to bring this action.
faa approval of the record of decision 
olmsted falls raises four principal objections to the faa approval of the record of decision for the runway improvement projects at cle.first,the city contends that the faa has violated the conformity provisions of the clean air act,section c,c,by omitting analysis of nitrogen oxides nox from at least undisclosed construction projects and improperly determining that emissions from the cle improvement plan will not exceed the tons nox per year de minimis threshold established by the environmental protection agency epa.see.second,arguing that the faa failed to consider adequately the water quality impacts of the cle improvement plan,olmsted falls challenges the faa failure to disclose alleged with the clean water act as a violation of nepa.third,the city insists that the alleged degradation of abram creek,caused by a culverting of a portion of the creek to build the relocated runway,constitutes a use of parkland requiring full analysis under section f of the department of transportation act,c.finally,olmsted falls believes that these alleged errors require a remand for the faa to perform a supplemental eis pursuant to nepa.
these challenges are reviewed under the administrative procedure act apa arbitrary and capricious standard.this standard is applied to review compliance with nepa and to determine the adequacy of an eis,see marsh oregon natural resources council,d,as well as to review of determinations required by the clean air act.see ethyl epa,standard for judicial review under clean air act taken directly from administrative procedure act.under nepa,the role of the courts is simply to ensure that the agency has adequately considered and disclosed the environmental impact of its actions and that its decision is not arbitrary or capricious.baltimore gas nrdc,d.courts review the eis to ensure that the agency took a hard look at the environmental consequences of its decision to go forward with the project.city of grapevine,dot,upholding faa approval of an airport plan.
notwithstanding the city assertion to the contrary,the faa conformity analysis under c is evaluated under the arbitrary and capricious standard set forth in the apa.see,conservation law foundation,busey,cir.section c of the clean air act,c,charges the heads of department s,agenc ies,or instrumentalit ies of the federal government with assur ing conformity.indeed,the implementing regulations specify that a ny federal department,agency,or instrumentality of the federal government taking an action subject to this subpart must make its own conformity determination consistent with the requirements of this subpart and that,if it wishes to,w here multiple federal agencies have jurisdiction for various aspects of a project,a federal agency may choose to adopt the analysis of another federal agency in order to make its conformity determination.emphasis added.thus in reviewing a challenge to such a determination,we apply the same standard we would to any other final agency arbitrary and capricious standard set forth in the apa.see busey,at.petitioner contends that since the clean air act does not vest responsibility for implementation of the clean air act with the faa and the faa sole area of statutorily mandated responsibility under the clean air act is consultation with the environmental protection agency in the establishment and enforcement of aircraft engine emission standards,the faa is not entitled to deference.the city seems to be conflating arbitrary and capricious review with chevron deference.under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,we defer to administrative agencies when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.united states mead,d.it is because of this delegation,express or implied,that we give deference to an agency statutory interpretation.thus,when we are faced with an agency interpretation of a statute not committed to its administration,we give no deference.ass of civilian technicians flra.here,however,the faa has not purported to interpret the conformity provisions of the clean air act,but rather only to apply them.
finally,where the faa is forecasting capacity and predicting demand at an airport,the agency conclusion is due more deference.city of los angeles faa,cir.that such determinations are integral to,indeed,inseparable from,the overall conformity analysis here further confirms that the arbitrary and capricious standard of review applies.with this standard of review in mind,we consider,and reject,each challenge in turn.
clean air act 
petitioner argues that the faa failed to adequately disclose and analyze various air quality impacts of the proposed cle project,in violation of the clean air act.first,it suggests that there are projects which the faa omitted from the air quality analysis in the eis and record of decision,including the nox emissions arising from days of unreported construction equipment operation.according to olmsted falls,these omissions show an additional tons of nox per year could be generated in,tons per year possibly in,and tons per year potentially in,which would exceed the de minimis threshold of tons nox per year,and thus violate the clean air act conformity provisions.c.because even a small use of various pieces of construction equipment could breach the de minimis threshold,the petitioner contends there remains an open question as to whether project emissions will exceed the ton per year nox de minimis threshold in at least.
second,petitioner also contends that the faa acted arbitrarily and capriciously in determining the baseline for emissions if the cle redevelopment is not pursued.in essence,olmsted falls claims that the faa overestimated the natural growth that would occur without improvements and failed to substantiate its claim that the existing airfield capacity could accommodate this supposed natural growth.because the cle redevelopment could attract additional air traffic,it is the city position that the faa underestimated the increase in nox emissions due to the increased capacity arising from the redevelopment project.
finally,olmsted falls asserts that the de minimis exception does not apply to airport expansions because in promulgating its final rule implementing the clean air act conformity provisions,the epa stated that l arger projects,such as an airport expansion would require a conformity review under all of these de minimis levels.determining conformity of general federal actions to state or federal implementation plans,fed.reg,emphasis added.as a consequence,it is olmsted falls position that we must remand and require the faa to perform a full conformity analysis and supplemental eis.
in response,the faa contends that it complied with caa requirements,conformed to relevant regulations,and followed faa own guidance documents,in analyzing construction emissions and reasonably determined that emissions for the project,including construction emissions for the project,will not at any time during the construction or implementation of the project,meet or exceed the thresholds established in the clean air act,and were,therefore,de minimis.according to the faa,the record provides no basis on which to second guess the combined expertise of the faa and the agencies which reviewed its determinations the epa,ohio epa,and the metropolitan planning organization.further,it is the faa position that petitioner has waived this clean air act claim by failing to challenge the faa methodology during the administrative proceedings and never previously arguing that the construction emissions analysis failed to account for these alleged construction projects.see d northwest airlines,dot.even if this claim is not waived,the faa argues that all elements of the construction required for,and related to,the cle runway improvement project were disclosed in the final eis and analyzed as part of faa air quality analysis.the faa also contends that it relied on an appropriate baseline in its calculation of natural growth and that this determination is due substantial deference.
in determining whether olmsted falls is barred from using these projects to challenge the faa conformity analysis,we must consider whether the faa had adequately disclosed the projects.it appears that it did.both the draft eis and the final eis disclose all of the projects approved in the record of decision,though not all of the activities approved include construction activity.the faa grouped all of the projects into four major construction activities and estimated nox emissions from each activity.both the draft eis and the final eis identified various independent utility projects and explained that these projects were not dependent or interdependent upon the approval of the federal actions which were the subject of the eis and would be completed regardless of the approval and progress of the airport development proposed in the eis.thus these projects were included within the baseline alternative as well as within each development alternative.yet,at no point after the draft eis or the final eis did olmsted falls raise claims before the faa involving these construction projects.moreover,olmsted falls could have requested data and calculations supporting the faa conformity determination under,but failed to do so until one day before the record of decision was signed.we agree with the faa that olmsted falls,by not challenging the alleged of these projects before the faa,waived this claim under the clean air act.
even were we to find that these projects were not adequately disclosed by the faa,we would conclude that olmsted falls has failed to carry its burden of proof of showing that this undermined the faa determination.t he party challenging an agency action as arbitrary and capricious bears the burden of proof.lomak petroleum,ferc,quoting san luis obispo mothers for peace united states nuclear regulatory comm n,en banc.indeed,e ven assuming the faa made missteps the burden is on petitioners to demonstrate that the faa ultimate conclusions are unreasonable.national petrochemical refiners ass epa.here petitioner concedes that the emissions from these projects might undermine the faa de minimis determination,not that they necessarily will.thus olmsted falls has failed to show that the faa overall determination is unreasonable.id.as the faa explains,some of the projects petitioner describes were considered as within the major construction categories.some independent utility projects were subject to separate nepa analyses and included as part of the baseline for the project because they were not dependent or interdependent upon the approval of the federal actions requested in the eis.finally,some of these projects were routine maintenance that are the kind that would be conducted with or without faa review or federal approval or funding,and thus were excluded.moreover,the faa explains that in calculating emissions from construction,it conservatively estimated a workday and an average work month of considering likely work stoppage for inclement weather.based on this conservative approach,the operational hours for the replacement runway construction included over additional hours as compared to similar projects at other airports.in short,we can not say that the faa determination was arbitrary and capricious.
nor is the faa determination of the baseline for natural growth at cle,and thus the baseline for nox emissions,arbitrary and capricious.the faa determined that the airport can accommodate the predicted demand for,based on its current airfield configuration and without the proposed improvements.while there may be delays,faa defines capacity without reference to delay goals.here the improvements are to move an existing runway,not the addition of a runway,and thus in the faa judgment they will not induce demand.according to the faa,its forecasts show that the demand for air travel at cle is independent of the proposed improvements at the airport.in other words,if you do build it,they will come anyway.city of los angeles faa,cir see also national parks conservation ass dot,cir.the faa expertise in forecasting air transportation demand and airfield capacity are areas where courts accord significant deference.see national parks,at city of los angeles,at.as the faa is entitled to rely upon its demand and capacity forecasts,and to credit the views of its own are charged with determining demand and capacity issues for the national airspace olmsted falls contrary views,we can not say that the faa determination was unreasonable.see city of bridgeton faa,cir custer county action garvey,cir.in sum,petitioner has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that the faa ultimate conclusion that the de minimis exception applied was unreasonable.
as for the applicability of the de minimis exception,we find nothing in the epa rule implementing conformity provisions that prohibits the faa from applying such an exception.the epa language is merely illustrative,simply acknowledging that l arger projects would generally exceed the de minimis limitations,and airport expansions tend to be larger projects.fed.reg.at.of course,this project is not an airport expansion,but rather a relocation of an existing runway.in any event,this language does not appear in the epa rule,only in the accompanying commentary.see.because the faa finding that the nox emissions resulting from the proposed cle redevelopment fall within the de minimis threshold is not unreasonable,we reject petitioner clean air act claims.
the city contends that the faa failed to disclose that the airport redevelopment project would not meet state or federal water quality standards even though it knew that to be the case,claiming that the evidence before the faa conclusively demonstrates that water quality would be permanently and adversely affected by the development of the project.according to olmsted falls these assertions are not a collateral attack on the decisions of state environmental authorities allowing the redevelopment of the airport to go forward,but merely demonstrate that by failing to disclose this alleged with the clean water act,the faa has failed to comply with nepa.the city then explains that a clean water act section permit,was not obtained from the local authorities,rather they only granted a waiver,which olmsted falls contends they have no power to do under state law.according to the city,although federal law gives the army corps of engineers the power to accept a waiver,b ii a,it is only where state law allows such a waiver and such power does not exist under ohio law.see ohio p ohio.the absence of a valid section permit or waiver is alleged to undermine the section permit issued by the corps of engineers.
respondents contend that this is essentially a collateral attack on the state environmental director decision to grant a waiver to the extent olmsted disagrees with oepa decision,arguments attacking this d
