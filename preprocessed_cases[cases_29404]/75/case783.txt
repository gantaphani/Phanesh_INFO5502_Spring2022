we decide whether an airlines employee has a state common law tort action against a negligent urine testing laboratory.
yasuko ishikawa,a delta flight attendant,got fired for failing a urine test.but the test was negligently performed,and the result had no validity whatsoever.delta rehired her,and paid her the of income she had lost.she sued labone,the urine test laboratory to which delta had sent her urine,for negligence.the jury verdict establishes that labone negligently analyzed and reported her results,causing of economic damages,of noneconomic damages.the jury awarded no punitive damages.
while she was flying from japan to portland,oregon,on september,ishikawa was told she would be required to take a random drug test when the plane landed.the flight took nine hours,and ishikawa drank several liters of water and tea during the flight.when the plane landed,she provided the urine sample.
there have to be safeguards to assure the accuracy of urine tests.someone who has ingested drugs could otherwise substitute someone else urine,that of a cooperative horse,or colored water,to generate a negative result.one method of testing for a substituted sample is to ensure that the urine be neither too watery nor too syrupy to be consistent with human urine,and that it contain an appropriate amount of creatinine,a protein manufactured by the body and ordinarily found in urine.at the time of ishikawa test,two department of health and human services program documents described the proper procedure for testing for substituted urine.a sample,according to the program documents,is properly labeled substituted if the creatinine concentration is less than or equal to and the specific gravity is less than or equal to or greater than or equal to because her sample was reported as substituted,delta treated the result as equivalent to an employee refusal to submit to a drug test,and fired ishikawa.
labone report said that ishikawa sample specific gravity was and its creatinine.thus it reported to delta specimen substituted not consistent with normal human urine.it was not sufficiently heavier than water and had too little creatinine,according to the program documents which required failure of both the creatinine and the specific gravity criteria for her urine to be considered substituted.fortunately,the sample ishikawa provided had been split,and one part preserved.during the litigation,the judge granted an order requiring that the second half of the sample be tested by another federally approved laboratory.this test,on the same urine from when she got off the plane from japan,showed a creatinine level of and specific gravity of.that made it a dilute specimen but not a substituted specimen.
the substantive issue in this litigation was whether labone negligently tested and reported on ishikawa urine.some testing defects are subtle,like the bayes theorem problem we discussed in gonzalez metropolitan transportation authority the bayes theorem problem is that if a test gives false positives of the time,and the tested population has genuinely dirty urine in one case out of ten,then out of a thousand tests,of the positive reports will be true and ten false but if the tested population has genuinely dirty urine in only one case out of a thousand,then the very same test performed with the very same care will yield ten false positives for every true positive some errors are simple,like putting someone else identification on the sample container.labone errors were down at the simple end of the spectrum,to the point of being crude.
among the many things labone was doing wrong was truncating or rounding the creatinine result to an integer.its machine was programmed to give only the integer nothing past the decimal point.there was conflicting evidence about whether the machine truncated or rounded,but it does not matter to the result in this case,as both methods were materially wrong.truncating means cutting off the decimal,so that even a creatinine result would be reported as only.a is substituted,a is not.rounding to the nearest integer would treat a as a,but would treat a,which is not substituted,as a,which is.since the test of the other half of ishikawa split sample yielded a creatinine level,whether labone rounded or truncated is immaterial to her case.what is material is that her passing result of was converted to a failing result of.
we need not decide whether the program documents giving the criteria above were binding as a matter of law on labone.ishikawa did not sue labone for violation of federal criteria,and this is not an administrative law case in which labone resists some administrative action based on violation of the program documents.ishikawa sued simply for the state common law tort of negligence.the trial judge instructed the jury that it could consider the program documents in deciding whether labone was negligent,but did not instruct the jury to consider some sort of federal claim based on violation of the program documents.the case went to the jury as a simple state common law claim.the court instructed that the plaintiff alleges that labone was negligent in analyzing and reporting the results of her urine sample in six different ways.the jury found labone was negligent,and awarded in damages.
labone appeals.
labone principal argument on appeal is that ishikawa was not entitled to sue it at all,because the federal statute and regulations do not provide for a private right of action,and that her state common law action was preempted.these arguments were fully preserved by motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.the district court rejected them and so do we.
preemption.
the argument that the federal scheme does not create a private right of action is a red herring.ishikawa did not pursue some supposed private right of action under the federal scheme.labone argues that the second and sixth circuits have held that there is no private right of action and that we should too.this case affords no occasion to reach the question,because no such claim was made.
labone primary argument,however,is that the omnibus transportation employee testing act of and the regulations promulgated by the faa pursuant to it preempt the state common law,excluding the possibility of a tort action.we took up a similar question in keams tempe technical institute where we were asked to decide whether an elaborate federal scheme preempted a state common law tort action for negligence or negligent misrepresentation.keams holding that the negligence claims were not is instructive here.
there is no express federal preemption by the statute.on the contrary.the statute contains a preemption clause expressly limited to inconsistent state law 
a effect on state and local government laws,regulations,standards,or orders.a state or local government may not prescribe,issue,or continue in effect a law,regulation,standard,or order that is inconsistent with regulations prescribed under this chapter.however,a regulation prescribed under this chapter does not preempt a state criminal law that imposes sanctions for reckless conduct leading to loss of life,injury,or damage to property.
as the first sentence makes explicit,a party claiming preemption under this statute has the burden of demonstrating that the putatively preempted law is inconsistent with the federal regulations.labone argues that we ought not to let the states govern willy nilly and that state tort law could be inconsistent with federal regulations.labone,however,makes no attempt to show that anything about the state law applied in this case actually was inconsistent.and we can not see how the duty the state common law imposed,that labone test urine and report the results with due care,could be inconsistent with the federal guidelines,which require the same thing with more specificity.it is not as though the state law had one creatinine standard,the federal program another.the district court invited and the plaintiff urged that the jury use the federal requirements to evaluate whether labone performed its duties with due care.
conceivably labone might does that the second sentence of the statute,expressly not preempting described
