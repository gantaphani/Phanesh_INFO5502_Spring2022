background 
the three underlying lawsuits sprang from a umbrella lawsuit brought by twelve international airline companies against the immigration and naturalization service ins see air españa,wl june.the air españa litigation challenged the imposition of fines against the airlines for bringing undocumented immigrant and aliens into the united states in violation of the penalty statute id.at.the district court ruled in favor of the ins in that action.see id.at.on appeal in,this court found that the airlines had not yet exhausted their administrative remedies.see air españa brien,cir since that time,the bia has made final administrative decisions on the airlines claims,each of which affirmed the government imposition of fines against airlines that had transported undocumented aliens into the united states in violation of.the airlines challenged those decisions in the three separate lawsuits leading to this appeal.because each lawsuit raises distinct issues and implicates a different set of statutes and regulations,each is addressed separately in this opinion.
united airlines tourist regulation and the parole policy 
united airlines united has challenged the ins imposition of a fine for bringing a who did not possess a valid passport visa needed for entry into the united states.in,united transported a mongolian citizen into the united states for purposes of his catching a connecting flight to montreal.the ins deemed the mongolian citizen inadmissible,but it nonetheless paroled him into the united states so that he could travel on to canada.the ins then fined united for violating the penalty statute by bring ing to the united states any alien who does not have a valid passport and an unexpired visa.a see also united airlines,jones,d.
united challenged the fine.it claimed that the penalty statute did not apply because the alien qualified for an emergency waiver,and if the alien had received a waiver no fine could have been imposed.at the time,the emergency waiver regulation stated that a visa and a passport are not required of a who demonstrates an unforeseen emergency.g.the penalty statute prohibits transporting an undocumented alien if a visa was required under this chapter or regulations issued thereunder.a.under the controlling bia precedent at the time,the relevant language of the emergency waiver regulation are not required negated application of the penalty statute in those cases where the visa requirement was waived because the alien demonstrated an unforeseen emergency.
united also argued that the ins had adopted a policy to parole aliens,such as the mongolian citizen,into the united states,rather than waive the visa requirement and admit them,so as to preserve its ability to apply the penalty statute and collect a fine.it claimed that this policy was illegal and violated the administrative procedures act the apa.as framed by the district court,the question before it was whether the defendant the ins acted lawfully in granting parole rather than a waiver to an arriving undocumented alien and imposing a fine upon the transportation company the airline for bringing that alien to our shores.united airlines,d at.the district court answered that question in the affirmative,finding the ins challenged action lawful.
the district court first addressed united claim that the ins had adopted a policy of paroling aliens into the united states rather than waiving the visa requirement to legitimize the imposition of fines which the grant of waivers would have precluded.id.the court found that under the penalty statute,the airline incurs liability for the fine when it brings an undocumented alien into the united states,notwithstanding any waiver or grant of parole that might occur after the alien has arrived.it was prepared to grant summary judgment to the ins on this basis alone,but it addressed the parties arguments nonetheless,in part to comment on the bia questionable interpretations of the relevant regulations.id.at.
the bia had held in its adjudications that,where a regulation purported to nullify the visa requirement in the event of waiver,such as by stating that the alien is not required to present a visa if in his particular case a waiver of the visa requirement is granted,the penalty statute did not apply.matter of plane cca,bia.the bia had reached this conclusion based on the penalty statute restriction of its application to those cases where a visa was required the district court found this reasoning wholly unpersuasive,as it believed that even in these nullification instances,a visa was required for purposes of considering a particular case under the penalty statute.otherwise,asked the court rhetorically,why was it necessary for those documents to be waived united airlines,d at.
considering the text of the penalty statute,the court noted that the statute applied if a visa was required under the act or implementing regulations.the act expressly requires to be in possession of a valid nonimmigrant visa,a b i ii,further providing that the visa requirement may be waived on the basis of unforeseen emergency in individual cases,id.d a.the district court found these statutory provisions unambiguous.united airlines,d at.the court held that the bia had misinterpreted the phrase or the regulations issued thereunder in the penalty statute in a manner that was plainly inconsistent with the intent of congress.id.the unambiguous penalty statute established the liability of an airline at the moment it brings an undocumented alien to the united states.id.at.such a reading,the court declared,advances the recognized intent of congress in enacting it.id.the court applied the statutory and regulatory scheme temporally,to wit the airline violates the penalty statute and becomes liable for the fine when it brings an undocumented alien to the united states,even though,at a later time,the ins might waive the visa requirement with respect to that individual alien.
according to the district court,the bia interpretation to the contrary abort ed the intent of congress as clearly reflected in the statutory text.id.at.it cited to the house judiciary committee report on the immigration and nationality act ina of,in which the committee stated that it had substantially curtailed the ins authority to waive the visa requirement to preclude the granting of blanket waivers of the documentary requirements on the ground of the existence of an emergency.id.quoting,at,as reprinted in,emphasis omitted.furthermore,reasoned the court,waiving the visa requirement is meant to benefit only the alien,not the airline.drawing on case law,it found its conclusion strengthened by line united states,and penninsular occidental steamship united states,cir.in hamburg,the supreme the penalty statute held that a carrier liability remained unaffected by any subsequent discretionary admission of the alien.at.in peninsular occidental,the fifth circuit held that the grant of a waiver to an alien otherwise within the class of aliens who must have a passport and visa to enter the united states did not negate the carrier liability for bringing the alien to the united states without such documents.at.
the district court found further support in the third clause of the penalty statute,which states that the fine 
shall not be remitted or refunded,unless it appears to the satisfaction of the attorney general that such person prior to the departure of the vessel or aircraft from the last port outside the united states,did not know,and could not have ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence,that the individual transported was an alien and that a valid passport or visa was required.
c.the court noted that the term remit means to refrain from exacting a payment,and it determined that a fine is either forgiven or refunded only if the carrier,prior to departure,could not ascertain with reasonable diligence that the alien it was transporting required a visa or a passport.united airlines,d at.
on the question of whether it should defer to the bia interpretation of the statute under chevron,the district court concluded that i t is beyond cavil that the intent of congress is clear and that should be the end of the matter.id.at.t he construction placed upon the assorted regulations by the board of immigration appeals has been clearly contrary to congress intent and must be,and hereby is,rejected.id.
after noting that it had considered all of united other arguments and found them to be without merit,the district court ruled in favor of the ins,upholding the fine assessed against united for the transportation of an improperly documented mongolian citizen.id.at.
air india lawful permanent residents 
the decision 
air india ai challenged the ins imposition of a fine for bringing a lawful permanent resident lpr to the united states without the required reentry permit or visa.in,ai transported from india to the united states an lpr who did not have the required documentation.under the relevant regulation,which allows ins officers to waive the visa requirement if the alien shows good cause for doing so,b,ins officers waived the requirement and allowed the lpr to enter the united states.the ins nonetheless fined ai for violating the penalty statute.ai argues that it should not be fined,due to the fact that the lpr was granted a waiver of the documentary requirement.
contrary to its later approach in united airlines,in recounting the history of the statutory and regulatory framework governing visa waivers for lprs,the district court wrote approvingly of the bia longstanding rule that when the relevant waiver regulation nullified the visa requirement,the penalty statute did not apply.the district court observed that the bia approach gave effect to the plain meaning of the statute and the regulation.air india brien,slip op.at.it explained that the bia had consistently followed this approach through the penalty statute or not,depending on whether the waiver regulation stated that aliens granted a waiver were not required to present a visa.
in,this waiver was amended to state that an lpr who satisfied the district director that there is good cause for his failure to present an immigration visa may be granted a waiver of that requirement.id.at citing.according to ai,between and the ins did not fine airlines pursuant to the penalty statute in those cases where it granted a waiver.ai believed that the ins had radically changed its enforcement practices,however,when it created a national fines office in and allegedly began fining airlines even when it waived the visa requirement for good cause.id.at.
before the national fines office and the bia,ai argued that the regulations required an lpr to present a visa except when the lpr was able to show good cause,and that the lpr it had brought to the united states,who had shown good cause and received a waiver,was therefore not required to present a visa.see id.at.that is,because the lpr was ultimately not required to present a visa,the penalty statute did not apply.before the bia had issued a decision,however,ai along with eleven other airlines filed the lawsuit.id.at.after this court dismissed the lawsuit as unripe,see air españa brien,cir,ai appeared again before the bia.at that point,for the first time,it challenged the regulation as having violated the apa.air india,slip op.at.the bia found the regulation valid and affirmed the imposition of the fine,interpreting the regulation as not exempting aliens from visa requirements,even if they were granted waivers.id.at.once again before the district court,ai argued that the fines were invalid because lprs granted a waiver were exempt from the visa requirement,and a amendment to the visa regulation was invalid.id.at.
the district court began by commenting that if it were to consider only the text of the regulation,there could be little doubt that the fines imposed by the ins were proper.id.at.it agreed with the ins that nothing in the regulation exempted aliens later granted waivers from the visa requirement,and it found unpersuasive ai argument that a revision of the regulation reflected a preexisting understanding that the regulation did so.thus,if the district court were to consider only the plain language of the ina and the regulation,the fines would appear to have been properly levied.id.at.
the court noted,however,that it was not constrained to consider only the terms of the ina and the regulation.id.at.if the regulation had not been properly promulgated under the apa,it observed,it could not be enforced.in that event,the version of the regulation would remain effective,and the version did exempt from the visa requirement any alien granted a waiver.id.the parties agreed that the regulation had not been subject to a process,and the attorney general had explained the decision not to conduct notice and comment because the amendment was meant to benefit the persons affected thereby.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court found itself at a loss to understand how the agency could have thought that the amendment,which removed the exemption,benefitted lprs.id.furthermore,the regulation affected airlines,and they did not benefit from it.id.at.
the district court concluded,therefore,that the attorney general did not have authority to promulgate the regulation without notice and comment.it dismissed the ins argument that the agency had invoked the good cause exception to the requirement,noting that the government had made no showing that compliance with the requirement was impractical or unnecessary in that case.id.at.because the agency had not complied with the apa,the regulation was void,and the district court applied the regulation instead.see id.at.under the bia longstanding interpretation of that regulation,airlines were not subject to fines when an lpr was granted a waiver of the visa requirement.
finally,turning to ai challenge to the regulation,the district court dismissed the challenge as unripe.id.the regulation had not been enforced against ai,and the ins had indicated that it had no plans to enforce it in the future.id.at.
the reconsideration decision 
after the district court granted judgment to ai,the ins moved for reconsideration under rule.for the first time,the ins argued that ai challenge to the validity of the regulation was because it had not been brought within six years of the promulgation of the regulation.
the district court acknowledged that the federal statute of limitations for claims against the government is six years,and it described the defense as unwaivable because compliance with the statute is a jurisdictional predicate for the court ability to entertain the claim.air india brien,d.the district court cited several courts of appeals decisions addressing the same question that all found that claims based on procedural defects in the promulgation of a regulation accrue when the regulation is published in the federal register.see,royalty park,cir commonwealth of.dep t of welfare dep t of hhs,cir.here,the regulation was published in,and the period of limitations governing challenges to the regulation expired long before ai brought its claim.because compliance with the statute of limitations was jurisdictional,the district court found it appropriate to grant the ins motion for reconsideration notwithstanding its failure to raise the defense at summary judgment.
rejection of ai procedural challenge to the regulation did not,however,dispose of ai substantive challenge.the district court noted that it had already considered and rejected several of ai claims regarding the meaning of the regulation,but it had not consider ed ai claim that imposition of fines under the regulation was improper in that it violated the stated intent of the attorney general in promulgating the amendment.id.at.the regulation was accompanied by a statement that the regulation was not subject to notice and comment because it confers benefits on persons affected thereby.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the district court determined that t his clear expression of intent refutes the argument that the regulation was intended to impose liability on the airlines when none had existed under the prior version of the regulation as amended in.id.moreover,the ins had not imposed fines under the regulation for years,and the agency could not explain why it began imposing fines in.to the extent that any evidence of the ins intent existed,it was in the form of an internal memorandum directing staff to begin enforcing the amendment against airlines and explaining that the agency was shifting policy to maximize revenues.such motivation,found the court,was not a proper basis for a change in enforcement policy.id.at.the district court therefore concluded that the ins decision to begin fining air carriers some years after the regulation was promulgated was arbitrary,capricious and an abuse of discretion,and the fines imposed thereunder must still be vacated.id.
finally,because the period of limitations for challenging regulations begins accruing at the time of publication in the federal register,the district court reversed its earlier finding that ai challenge to the regulation was unripe,at least insofar as ai was challenging the regulation on procedural grounds for lack of a period.the district court determined that the regulation was not merely interpretive,as even if it were designed to correct a technical error in the amendment of the regulation,its correction plainly altered the substantive rights of those affected by it.id.at.in response to the ins invocation of the exception the district court found that the ins had failed to show any good cause existed to dispose of the requirement.because no exception applied and the regulation had therefore been issued in violation of the apa,the district court declared it void.
the ins filed a notice of appeal,but the parties later stipulated to dismissal of the appeal and ai.
the rule decision 
following its march decision in the air india case,the district court issued its opinion in the united airlines case.as explained supra,in its september united airlines decision the district court held that airlines incur liability for a fine under the penalty statute upon bringing an undocumented alien to the united states,notwithstanding any subsequent waiver or parole and regardless of the precise language used in the visa requirement implementing regulations.in so ruling,the court found the bia interpretation of the statutes and regulations flawed.as a result of the united airlines decision,the ins moved on december,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for relief from the march air india decision.
the district court noted that the ins motion potentially implicated two provisions of rule.the first,rule b,allows for relief based on mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect,and it requires that the movant file the motion within one year of the judgment.the second,rule b,allows for relief based on any other reason justifying relief,and it imposes no time limit on the motion.ai argued that the ins motion was properly characterized as a rule b motion and that it was therefore untimely,not having been brought within one year of the march judgment.
the district court found that because the parties had not made arguments related to the penalty statute,it had not erred in focusing only on the regulations thereunder the ins was therefore not seeking relief based on judicial error under rule b.air india,brien.it further found that even if some of the ins arguments were related to judicial error,the ins had also made claims that properly fall under a rule b motion.id.at.for example,the ins asserted that the conflicting opinions issued by the district court have created confusion in the law and would make it more difficult for the ins to enforce immigration laws.id.the court agreed with the ins that the judgment had the potential for creating extreme hardship and that the interest of justice require d reconsideration of the march order.id.it therefore found that the motion was properly brought under rule b and was thus timely.
on the merits,the district court found that its september united airlines decision render ed the march air india decision moot.id.at.the court reasoned that because it had found that the penalty statute did not allow for a blanket waiver of fines in those instances where an alien was granted a waiver of the visa requirement,any regulations purporting to effect such a waiver were void.id.the court recognized that its focus in air india on the attorney general intent in promulgating the regulation missed the point,because regardless of the attorney general intent,the regulation could not be construed as prohibiting the ins from imposing fines on carriers who bring to the united states aliens without the required documentation,even if those aliens are subsequently paroled or receive a waiver,as such a construction would violate the penalty statute.id.
the court concluded that the inconsistency between the air india and united airlines decisions,as well as the substantial overlap in parties between the two lawsuits and the effect the inconsistency would have on the government ability to control its borders constitute d the extraordinary circumstances necessary to invoke relief under rule b.id.at.it therefore granted the ins motion for relief from the march judgment.
the government requested an order that explicitly laid out the result of the district court air india decision and in that order,issued in january,the district court clarified that in granting the ins rule motion for relief from judgment,it had implicitly grant ed the government underlying motion for summary judgment and deni ed the airlines underlying for summary judgment.air india,brien,slip op.at.
finnair the tourist regulation 
finnair challenged the ins amendment of the regulation governing visa waivers for tourists who were able to show an unforeseen emergency.prior to,the relevant regulation stated that a visa and a passport are not required of a nonimmigrant who could show an emergency.g.the regulation,which formed the basis of united defense in its separate lawsuit,had been interpreted as not permitting the ins to impose a fine when the alien was later granted a waiver.the version of the regulation was consistent with a parallel state department regulation,j,which included a similar statement.in,the ins amended the regulation to state that a nonimmigrant seeking admission to the united states must present an unexpired visa and that the district director could waive that requirement if the nonimmigrant showed an emergency.g.this language modified the regulation so that the visa requirement was preserved even when the alien later received a waiver.the state department did not amend its own parallel regulation to reflect these changes until,and it did not seek notice and comment in connection with that amendment.
finnair was fined under the regulatory scheme in effect between and.it argued that the ins amendment was void because it was not jointly promulgated with the state department,as required by statute.finnair further claimed that the ins version conflicted with the parallel state department regulation.the bia upheld the fine,finding that the amendment satisfied the joint action requirement because the state department had delegated its rulemaking authority with respect to tourist visa waivers to the attorney general.the bia further held that if the ins regulation conflicted with the state department regulation,the ins regulation controlled.
without delving into the bia reasoning,the district court granted summary judgment to the ins on december,based upon its united airlines decision.see finnair oy brien,slip op.at.
ii.discussion 
united airlines 
the united airlines case presents two questions whether the district court erred when it ruled that the penalty statute unambiguously imposes a fine on a carrier transporting an undocumented alien,notwithstanding any subsequent receipt of a visa waiver by that alien and regardless of the language of any applicable regulation and whether the ins acted arbitrarily when it paroled aliens into the united states rather than granting them a visa waiver,thereby preserving its ability to fine the carrier for having brought the aliens to the united states.
validity of the bia rule 
the first issue concerns the validity of the bia longstanding rule,originating through its own adjudications,that when a visa waiver regulation states that an alien is not required to present a visa when they receive a visa waiver,and an alien receives a waiver pursuant to that regulation,the carrier may not be fined under the penalty statute,a b,for having brought the alien to the united states the bia rule.it was this bia rule that the district court invalidated,as inconsistent with the penalty statute,in united airlines,and it was on the basis of united airlines that the district court reversed itself in air india and also decided finnair.our decision,therefore,as to the validity of this bia rule will determine our approach to all three cases.
to recap,the district court held that any regulation or interpretation thereof exempting an alien from the visa requirement,thus exempting the airline from the penalty statute based on a waiver,is inconsistent with the penalty statute and congress intent in enacting it.on appeal,the airlines challenge this holding.they distinguish hamburg,relied on by the district court,in which the supreme court held that a discretionary admission of an alien lacking the required documentation has no effect on the fine to be imposed on a carrier,see at,by arguing that the admissions here were not discretionary.the airlines believe that the aliens in these cases were entitled to admission because they satisfied the statutory requisites,a showing of good cause or an unforeseen emergency,and they claim that because the aliens were entitled to admission,the penalty statute does not apply.
the airlines further argue that the district court misread congress intent.they assert that the district court interpretation of the statutory scheme would force airlines to risk a fine when they transport aliens who comply with the regulation exempting them from the visa requirement.they contend that the bia decisions interpreting the regulations and the statute in a way that comports with the airlines position should be respected because those decisions are wholly consistent with hamburg and the statutory and regulatory scheme.finally,the airlines argue that congress inaction in the face of the bia interpretation of the regulations and statutes involved here reflects its acquiescence in that interpretation.
the ins on the other hand asserts the propriety of the district court reliance on line united states,and penninsular occidental steamship,cir,in support of its interpretation of congress intent.that is,congress,through the penalty statute,intended that a fine be levied against a carrier for bringing to the united states an alien who did not possess the proper documentation,regardless of whether or not a waiver was issued.
we conclude that the district court erred when it invalidated the bia rule.we also conclude that the district court should have deferred to the agency interpretation of the penalty statute.
ambiguity of the penalty statute 
the district court first error was finding that the penalty statute unambiguously imposes liability on a carrier at the moment the carrier transports an undocumented alien,notwithstanding any subsequent waiver.
the initial step in determining whether a statute is ambiguous is to begin with the statute text.carcieri salazar,d see also woods empire health choice,cir as always,we begin with the text of the statute.the district court,to find the statute unambiguous,relied instead on supreme court and fifth circuit case law,four words in a amendment to the relevant regulation,and the penalty statute restricting of refunds to those instances where the carrier exercised due diligence.none of these sources render the penalty statute unambiguous.
the court cited hamburg for the proposition that liability for the fine obtains upon the transportation of the alien into the united states,notwithstanding any subsequent discretionary relief.but hamburg does not control in this case.in hamburg,the supreme court held that a carrier was liable for a fine despite the alien later receipt of a discretionary admission by the secretary of labor.at.the court found that the penalty statute applicable at the time preserve d the fine against any discretionary admission.id.at.the problem in applying hamburg analysis to this case is that the penalty statute then in effect categorically prohibited carriers from bringing an alien who had no visa to the united states.id.at.as the supreme court concluded,the penalty statute applicable to carriers in ma de it clear that the occasion for the fine is the bringing in of the alien without an unexpired visa.id.at.
the penalty statute at issue in these cases,however,restricts its prohibition to those instances where a visa was required under this chapter or regulations issued thereunder.a.certain regulations issued thereunder,moreover,expressly state that certain classes of aliens are not required to present a visa.see,g.the textual differences between the current penalty statute and the one at issue in hamburg are precisely the crux of the interpretive dilemma that we must address.
reliance on the fifth circuit peninsular occidental decision is similarly misplaced.in the decision,a steamship company challenged the fine incurred under of the immigration and nationality act of for bringing into the united states four aliens that did not possess valid visas,cir.in its decision,the court referenced broad language regarding congress intent to compel carriers,under the pain of penalties which increase vigilance,to police enforcement of and compliance with many parts of the immigration laws.id.at.there was no regulation in place at the time,however,that removed the visa requirement from an alien who was granted a waiver.see g.instead,peninsular occidental was interpreting the penalty statute directly.at.the fifth circuit had no occasion to consider the effect of a regulation exempting aliens from the visa requirement when it upheld the fine on the carrier.
these cases,relied upon by both the district court and the ins in its arguments to us,do not answer the question here,which is whether imposing the fine provided for in the penalty statute is consistent with regulations exempting certain groups of aliens from the visa requirement based on a waiver.when considered in relation to that question,the statutory language if a visa was required under this chapter or regulations issued thereof is ambiguous.once a statute is determined to be ambiguous,the court must look to the agency interpretation of the statutory provision,to consider the level of deference due the agency interpretation of the penalty statute.kruse wells fargo home mortgage,cir if we decide that we are to defer,we must then decide the appropriate level of deference.see also dynamics land cline,d d eference to an agency statutory interpretation is called for only when the devices of judicial construction have been tried and found to yield no clear sense of congressional intent.sutherland reno,cir w here the relevant statutory provision is silent or ambiguous,a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
b.the level of deference due to the agency interpretation of the penalty statute 
once we determine that a statute is ambiguous,we then consider the level of deference warranted by an agency interpretation of the statute.kruse,at.
the bia rule warrants chevron deference.the bia interprets the penalty statute to mean that the issuance of certain,those which explicitly provide that a visa is not required if the waiver is issued,see,g results in the carrier avoiding a basis for being fined.this interpretation of the penalty statute by the bia,while not evolved through a traditional period,is still worthy of our deference.see shi liang lin dep t of justice,cir en banc katzmann,concurring t he bia should be accorded chevron deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms concrete meaning through a process of adjudication.internal quotation marks omitted.to the extent the bia rule includes an interpretation of a regulation,similar deference is warranted.see auer robbins,d an agency interpretation of its own regulations is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation internal quotation marks omitted.
applying chevron deference,we conclude that the bia rule is reasonable.the bia rule conditions the application of the penalty statute on whether the regulations entirely exempt from visa requirements the transported aliens who are in receipt of a waiver.this interpretation,while not compelled by the statutory and regulatory scheme,is certainly plausible and rational the penalty statute provides for the imposition of a fine if a visa were required pursuant to regulations,and the regulations at issue in turn provide that a visa is not required if a waiver were granted.
moreover,we note that neither party disputes that the bia has for decades interpreted the penalty statute and corresponding ins regulations to exempt carriers from liability when the alien is granted certain waivers.the bia consistency in applying the bia rule has particular force because it is a contemporaneous construction of a statute by the individuals charged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion,of making the parts work efficiently and smoothly while they are yet untried and new.aluminum of am.cent.lincoln peoples util,d internal quotation marks omitted.it might therefore carry the day against doubts that might exist from a reading of the bare words of a statute.good samaritan hosp.shalala,d internal quotation marks omitted.
indeed,congress repeated amendment of the relevant provisions of the statute without expressing any disapproval reinforces the strength of the bia interpretation,because it is persuasive evidence that the agency interpretation is the one intended by congress.commodity futures trading comm schor,d internal quotation marks omitted coke long island care at home,cir,rev on other grounds,d.since,congress has amended the section containing the statutory waiver provisions for,at least four times in,and.congress has also amended the penalty statute four times,and none of those amendments modified the language at issue in this case.
the difficulty with the bia rule concerns the counterintuitive analysis by which a determination by an ins officer to grant a waiver may retroactively modify the alien need to present a visa.this,however,does not lessen the reasonableness of the bia interpretation of the penalty statute.retroactivity is not particularly unusual in regulatory law nor in the immigration context.see orr hawk,cir so long as a change in a regulation does not announce a new rule,but rather merely clarifies or codifies an existing policy,that regulation can apply retroactively.if the ins finds that application of the bia rule creates a disincentive for airlines to make a reasonable,good faith effort to ensure that every alien has a visa prior to arrival in the united states,it may amend the regulations so that a waiver does not nullify the visa requirement.
in sum,we conclude that the language of the penalty statute is ambiguous,and the agency interpretation of the statute is reasonable.accordingly,we defer to the agency interpretation under chevron and uphold the bia rule.
reasonableness of the bia paroling of aliens 
because we uphold the bia rule,we must next address whether the agency acted unreasonably in paroling aliens into this of granting them a order to preserve its ability to fine the airlines.the district court found that the ins had acted within its authority in paroling aliens rather than waiving the visa requirement.we agree.
as an initial matter,the airlines have presented no support for their claim that,in these cases,the ins first determined that the aliens were eligible for a waiver,and only then granted parole rather than a waiver.though united points to its rule statement for support,its rule statement asserts only that when the aliens in question arrived in the united states,each gave an explanation for the absence of a visa or a passport of the sort usually accepted by the agency,but that each was granted parole rather than a waiver despite having presented such an explanation.the rule statement did not assert that the ins district director was satisfied that the alien explanation constituted an emergency,g,and the ins has not conceded that the agency first found the aliens eligible for a waiver and only then granted parole instead.
the real question,therefore,is whether the ins abused its authority in employing its parole power rather than its waiver power so as to preserve its ability to fine the airlines.the airlines contend that the agency had an improper motive for its change in policy.we disagree.a policy directive stated that the agency goal was to maximize revenues and create a deterrent against violations.memorandum from george wetteland,acting apd,immigration naturalization,change in policy regarding carrier fines when a visa waiver is granted on form.congress had recently given the ins power to retain the monies collected from fines,see also ins fines training program,detailing ins policy on collecting fines under,most assuredly knowing that the financial stake would influence the manner which the ins exercised its enforcement discretion.the resulting ins policy change of paroling aliens,versus granting waivers,is thus not an improper motive.however repugnant the idea of financial drivers may be to united,there is no authority for united claim that such motives are improper or contrary to congress intent.
united also argues that the ins shift in its enforcement policy was a legislative act that required notice to carriers under the apa that the very same aliens it had been transporting since would no longer be admitted but paroled,but that claim is also meritless.unless a statute constrains an agency exercise of its enforcement powers,the agency possesses broad discretion in how it enforces statutory and regulatory law.see ass of irritated residents epa,holding that,because the statute did not give any indication that violators must be pursued in every case,or that one particular enforcement strategy must be chosen over another and provide d no meaningful guidelines defining the limits of the agency discretion,the challenger had failed to rebut the presumption that the enforcement decision was committed to the discretion of the agency heckler chaney,d if congress has indicated an intent to circumscribe agency enforcement discretion,and has provided meaningful standards for defining the limits of that discretion,there is law to apply under the apa,and courts may require that the agency follow that law if it has not,then an agency refusal to institute proceedings is a decision committed to agency discretion by law within the meaning of the apa.
here,when making parole decisions,the ins exercises a broad discretionary power pursuant to t he unusually broad congressional power over the admission of aliens into the united states.bertrand sava,cir.those decisions must be viewed at the outset as presumptively legitimate and bona fide in the absence of strong proof to the contrary,a showing that poses a heavy burden for any alien challenging a parole decision.id.at.similarly,the waiver statute states only that the visa requirement may be waived on the basis of an unforeseen emergency.d a emphasis added.it does not require a waiver or otherwise restrict the executive exercise of its enforcement discretion.
with respect to united airlines,therefore,we reverse the district court ruling declaring the bia rule invalid,but we affirm the district court judgment in favor of the ins on the grounds that the agency permissibly chose from among the various enforcement mechanisms available to it when it paroled aliens into this country rather than granted them visa waivers.
the air india case likewise presents two distinct questions.the first is whether the district court made a procedural error when it granted the ins rule b motion,because a the motion was untimely,or b the ins had not shown the type of extraordinary circumstances warranting such relief.the second question is whether the district court erred when it granted the motion,in particular a when it decided that the ins enforcement of the lawful permanent resident lpr visa waiver regulation was arbitrary,and b when it decided that the ins amendment of the lpr visa waiver regulation was valid notwithstanding that it was promulgated without.we review the district court rule decision for abuse of discretion.gey assocs.assocs.in re assocs,cir per curiam.because we find that the district court committed procedural error in granting the rule b motion,we do not reach the second,substantive,question,as the government previously dismissed its appeal of the district court underlying decision.
proper characterization of the rule motion 
the airlines first challenge to the rule motion is that it was untimely,arguing that it was actually a rule b motion,which must be brought within one year of the judgment.the ins contends that the motion was properly brought under rule b,and therefore was not subject to the limit.
rule b allows for relief from judgment based on mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.b.rule b is available for a district court to correct legal errors by the court.in re,at see also parks life credit,cir per curiam the mistakes of judges may be remedied under this provision.rule b,on the other hand,allows for relief from judgment based on any other reason justifying relief.smith sec y of hhs,cir quoting.b a rule b motion must be based upon some reason other than those stated in clauses.internal quotation marks omitted.the two provisions are exclusive and an appellant can not circumvent the limitation of rule b by invoking the residual clause of rule b.serzysko chase manhattan bank,cir per curiam see also warren garvin,cir.
courts of appeals do not appear to have addressed the precise situation presented here the district court issuance of conflicting decisions in two separate lawsuits with substantial overlap in parties and substantial similarity in subject matter.the district court found that the motion was properly brought under rule b because the parties failure to challenge the bia rule meant that the court failure to address that issue was not judicial error,and the ins had also made claims that properly fell under a rule b motion,such as its claim that the inconsistency in the decisions would make border enforcement more difficult for the government.air india,at.indeed,the fifth circuit has suggested that inconsistency claims,where meritorious,are properly brought under rule b.see batts forklift,cir noting that a change in decisional law might sometimes constitute an extraordinary circumstance under rule b,such as in the habeas context or where two cases arising out of the same transaction result in conflicting judgments.
we find that the motion was timely filed under rule b to the extent that it was based on the potential hardship resulting from inconsistent judgments.such a claim is not easily categorized as mistake or inadvertence under rule b,and it should therefore be allowed to proceed under rule b.
whether the motion was properly granted 
the second question is whether the rule motion raised issues sufficiently extraordinary to justify relief.before the district court,the ins argued for relief on three grounds the district court initial decision had been incorrect the district court initial decision prevented the ins from fining airlines and the conflict between air india and united airlines created confusion in the law,thereby making border enforcement more difficult.the ins claimed that the interest in finality did not outweigh these considerations,as the air india and united airlines cases were part of an interconnected trilogy of cases that had all once been part of the same case.
rule b confers broad discretion on the trial court to grant relief when appropriate to accomplish justice.matarese lefevre,cir internal quotation marks omitted.relief is warranted where there are extraordinary circumstances,or where the judgment may work an extreme and undue hardship,and should be liberally construed when substantial justice will thus be served.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.we have warned,however,that a rule motion may not be used as a substitute for appeal and that a claim based on legal error alone is inadequate.id.at see also marrero pichardo ashcroft,cir a mere change in decisional law does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance for the purposes of rule b.in the rule b context,we have also noted that rule does not allow district courts to indulge a party discontent over the effects of its bargain,such as where the party has made a deliberate,strategic choice to settle.andrulonis united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we reverse the district court grant of the ins rule b motion on procedural grounds.the conflict between air india and united airlines was not,by itself,sufficiently extraordinary to justify reopening the judgment in air india,especially given that such conflict resulting from a subsequent circuit court or supreme court decision would very likely not suffice to grant rule b relief.see batts,at a circuit court announcement of a new rule of federal law,like a supreme court pronouncement,is similarly insufficient without more to justify rule b relief.thus,if this court had issued an opinion in united airlines on appeal,that opinion would likely not,by itself,provide a basis for revisiting the air india decision.the ins argument,which is based not on mandatory authority from the circuit but only on persuasive authority from the district court,therefore fails.
with respect to the ins claim that the district court initial decision prevents it from collecting fees and that the airlines accordingly are unjustly enriched,the proper remedy for that problem was direct appeal.the ins knowingly stipulated to dismissal of its appeal,and it thereby gave up any claim it had to the fees it lost as a result of the district court decision.we should not allow it to use the rule motion as a substitute for appeal,matarese,at,particularly given its deliberate,strategic choice to dismiss that appeal,andrulonis,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the ins focuses most on the extreme hardship it claims would result from the district court divergent decisions and the ensuing legal confusion.whereas the united airlines holding gave the ins virtually unfettered discretion to fine airlines regardless of whether the alien was granted a waiver,air india held that the ins could not impose fines where the alien was granted a waiver pursuant to the lpr regulation,and the regulation was void because the agency had not complied with the apa.for decades prior to the united airlines decision,the ins enforced the penalty statute differently depending on whether the relevant visa waiver regulation nullified the visa requirement.in other words,the legal landscape facing the district court when it ruled on the rule the ins was able to impose fines in some circumstances but not others,depending on the regulation being no different from the legal landscape that had existed for decades.the ins has shown itself quite capable of amending its regulations when it found this patchwork approach unworkable,see listing amendments of the section in the federal register,currently numbering over,and it offers no explanation for why it can not do so now.if the ins needs the regulation that was invalidated by the district court so that it can impose fines on airlines even when the alien receives a waiver,it may readopt the regulation after notice and comment.there is nothing extreme about the fact that the agency must respond to judicial decisions invalidating its regulations either by appealing these decisions or changing its regulations.
the agency grounds for the rule b essentially boil down to a claim that the decision was not sufficiently extraordinary to justify reopening a closed case in which the agency voluntarily stipulated to dismiss its appeal.this is especially so here where the two cases were related and any appeal of air india could have been stayed and later consolidated with an appeal in united airlines.we hold that the district court abused its discretion in granting the rule b motion.accordingly,we reverse the rule b motion on procedural grounds and decline to reach the merits of the district court march air india decision.
in finnair,we are presented with what appears to be a novel question of administrative law the meaning of the joint action requirement giving the attorney general and the secretary of state joint authority over visa waivers.
whether the ins amendment violated the joint action requirement 
the airlines challenged a amendment to the tourist visa waiver regulation that preserved the visa requirement when the alien was granted an emergency waiver.the airlines claimed that the amendment was void because it was promulgated by the ins alone and therefore did not comply with the joint action requirement.the district court granted summary judgment to the ins in finnair based on its ruling in united airlines,apparently believing that because united airlines invalidated any agency rule exempting airlines from a fine in certain cases,the ins could fine airlines regardless of which regulation applied.
the visa waiver statute states that the visa requirement may be waived by the attorney general and the secretary of state acting jointly a on the basis of unforeseen emergency in individual cases.d.over the years,these two agencies have treated this statute as giving each of them joint authority over visa waivers.prior to,the state department and the ins exercised this joint regulatory power by enacting parallel visa waiver regulations.the ins version stated that a visa and a passport are not required of a nonimmigrant who satisfies the district director of the existence of an unforeseen emergency.g.the state department version stated that a visa and a passport are not required of an alien if the responsible ins officer concludes that the alien is unable to present the visa because of an unforeseen emergency.j.
in,the ins alone enacted a new version of the regulation,which preserved the visa requirement when the alien was granted a waiver.the regulation required tourists to present a visa even if they received a waiver,thus making the airlines subject to a fine under the bia rule for having brought the tourists to the united states the state department did not issue a new parallel regulation to the same effect until.in the interim,the ins fined airlines pursuant to its amendment.finnair central claim is that the ins amendment is void because it does not comply with a requirement that the ins and state department jointly regulate in this area.thus,the question we address here is whether the fines issued in the interim period between and are valid.
the ins makes two counterarguments.first,it claims that the state department delegated its authority over visa waivers to the ins in.prior to,before granting an emergency visa waiver an ins officer was required to seek concurrence of the department of state visa office.in,to save resources for both agencies and reduce the time it takes to admit certain nonimmigrant aliens,the two agencies amended their parallel regulations so that an ins officer would no longer need to seek the concurrence of the department of state when granting a waiver.see waiver of certain types of visas.july,to be codified at pt.the ins now asserts that the amendment made the joint action requirement for promulgating and amending regulations meaningless in the context of visa waivers because it constituted a delegation of the authority of the department of state over visa waivers to the ins.
we find this argument unpersuasive.in the amendment,the state department arguably delegated to ins officers its authority to execute the relevant visa waiver.it did not,however,delegate its authority to promulgate regulations regarding such waivers.nothing about the amendment suggests that it did anything more than change the manner in which the visa waivers were granted.on the contrary,in the final rule,published in the federal register in,the state department specifically highlighted the limited authority it was conferring on ins 
furthermore,the department wishes to clarify the limited extent of the authority delegated to the immigration and naturalization service.although the proposed rule permits the district director to waive the documentary requirements of ina a b,the department of state will continue to exercise the authority vested in the secretary of state and the attorney general under the provisions of ina d a relating to the joint concurrence in documentary waivers,except in the circumstances described in j of this final rule.consequently,this final rule makes minor modifications to the text of the regulation as discussed in the preamble.
visas documentation of nonimmigrants under the immigration and nationality act waiver by secretary of state and attorney general of passport visa requirements for certain categories of nonimmigrants,to be codified at pt.emphasis added.the amendment gives no indication that it was meant to constitute a delegation by the state department to the ins of the entirety of its regulatory authority over visa waivers instead it limited the delegation of its authority to a determination made by an officer at the point of entry.the state department,furthermore,has done nothing to suggest that it agrees with the ins on this point.when the state department amended its own visa waiver regulation in,it exercised its authority in this area,and it made no reference to having delegated that authority to the ins.without some evidence that a delegation of the sort asserted by the ins was intended by the state department,we are extremely wary of finding that such a delegation occurred.
second,the ins claims that if the ins and state department regulations in this area conflict,the ins regulation should control because the ins has primary authority over the administration of the visa waiver regulation.this argument is inconsistent with the joint action requirement expressly imposed by congress.in effect,the ins is claiming that when it wishes,it is free to displace the state department authority entirely.the statute,however,requires joint action,and the two agencies acted jointly when enacting the version of the regulation.the ins attempt to amend the jointly enacted regulation on its own,therefore,is ineffective,and the version remains in effect.the ins failure to coordinate with the state department in the amendment of the regulations renders the amendment void.
whether the state department amendment was valid 
we must also consider the validity of the state department amendment of its own visa waiver regulation,which made its regulation consistent with the ins regulation.the state department did not conduct a period,and it did not act in concert with the ins.the ins claims that neither of these issues is fatal to the amendment because the state department had delegated its authority in this area to them,its amendment was simply a confirmation of the ins primary authority and the amendment was technical and therefore good cause existed to forgo notice and comment.
neither of these rationales is persuasive.as discussed above,the state department never delegated its regulatory distinguished from its primary enforcement authority.the state departme
