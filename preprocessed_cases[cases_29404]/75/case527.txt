the illinois central railroad company ic sued south tec development warehouse,seeking to recover demurrage charges assessed for rail shipments between september and december.south tec denied liability for the demurrage charges and joined donnelley sons company as a third party defendant,arguing that donnelley and not south tec should pay any charges.following a referral to the surface transportation board stb for determinations on certain issues,the district court granted summary judgment to the ic and donnelley,holding south tec solely liable for the demurrage.south tec appeals.because we believe that key issues remain unresolved,we reverse and remand for reconsideration.
in,the ic was courting the business of donnelley,a printing company which receives a great deal of paper at its facility in mattoon,illinois.donnelley had been using other carriers,but was interested in switching to the ic if the ic could provide a,through rate for paper shipments that would actually make an intermediate stop at a warehouse for storage.the ic introduced donnelley to south tec,a warehouse in kankakee,illinois,that could store donnelley shipments.the entire arrangement was memorialized in two complementary contracts,one between the ic and donnelley and the other between donnelley and south tec.there was no express contract between south tec and the ic.
under the agreements,boxcars of paper ultimately destined for donnelley were first transported by the ic from donnelley paper suppliers to south tec in kankakee.upon arrival in kankakee,south tec was responsible for unloading,categorizing,organizing and storing the paper,after which the boxcars were released.when needed by donnelley,the paper was reloaded onto either railcars or trucks for transportation to mattoon.according to the agreement between the ic and donnelley,the shipments on their way to south tec were to be accompanied by bills of lading stating,car to stop at south tec warehouse,kankakee,il.freight charges cover shipment to ultimate destination,while the shipments as they continued on to donnelley were to be covered by bills of lading stating,this is to certify that product previously moved in roadhaul to kankakee,il.freight charges paid on inbound movement to kankakee.in practice,the consignors of the shipments bound for south tec used a wide variety of language to denote the shipments destination.this arrangement apparently worked well,and south tec and donnelley renewed their contract in.
problems began in late.until then,south tec had promptly unloaded the ic railcars as they arrived in kankakee.however,starting in september and at least through december,due in part to a dramatic increase in the amount of paper shipped,south tec began to accumulate delays in unloading.according to the ic,so many cars piled up in the kankakee railyard that the delay was affecting the ic operations with respect to its other shippers.the ic began to assess demurrage charges against south tec for these delays this assessment was thought to be in line with item of the ic tariff,which provides that demurrage will be billed to the consignor at origin,the consignee at destination and the party for whom the car is held if enroute.ic freight tariff ic issued,memo.of law in supp.of donnelley mot.for entry of an order to stay these proceedings and referral to the stb ex,record at ic tariff.by the end of december,a total of in demurrage charges were billed to south tec but unpaid.because of this balance and because south tec delays were threatening to close down the ic kankakee railyard,the ic imposed an embargo on the donnelley shipments,leading donnelley to assume responsibility for future demurrage charges in order to have the embargo lifted.
there still remains the unpaid in demurrage charges that accrued up to december.the ic sued south tec in the northern district of illinois for these unpaid charges.south tec claimed that it was not liable for these charges because it was not the consignee of the shipments,and joined donnelley as a third party defendant.donnelley moved to stay the district court proceedings and refer the case to the stb,which has exclusive jurisdiction over transportation by rail carriers,and the remedies provided in et with respect to rates,classifications,rules,practices,routes,services,and facilities of such carriers.b.donnelley argued in its motion that three issues should be resolved by the stb whether the ic demurrage charges were unreasonable,because the ic unilaterally modified its demurrage tariff allegedly in order to generate revenue rather than to promote the efficient use and distribution of freight cars,whether the ic tariff was unreasonable and discriminatory because it assessed demurrage charges for enroute delays,making shippers such as donnelley potentially liable for demurrage at more than one location and whether boxcar traffic of the type at issue was deregulated during the relevant time period.south tec joined in this motion,which the district court granted in part.pursuant to its decision,the district court asked the stb,whether the ic demurrage rate was unreasonable,whether the method by which the ic calculated the charges was unreasonable and whether the practice by which the ic demurrage charges accrue is discriminatory with respect to shippers such as donnelley.
the stb rejected all of donnelley and south tec arguments.dev.warehouse,stb docket,available at stb lexis stb decision.however,while the stb found for the ic that demurrage charges could be assessed for the kankakee delays,the stb declined to answer whether south tec or donnelley should be held responsible for these charges 
also argues that it was not the actual consignee of any of the shipments for which ic seeks demurrage,but rather was donnelley agent,and therefore may not be held liable for demurrage charges on shipments destined for donnelley.
w e find that there is a sufficient record before us to determine that ic could properly assess demurrage for undue delay of rail cars,but that liability depends on whether or not it was acting as donnelley agent in its handling of the shipments.because of deficiencies in the record,however,we can not resolve the agency question,which was raised by the parties,but which was not referred by the court.
back in district court,all three parties moved for summary judgment.the district court reasoned that the only way that south tec could have escaped liability was to have complied with a,which requires a consignee that is an agent,in order to avoid liability for charges,to provide a carrier with written notice of its status as an agent prior to delivery.the district court found that because south tec had not complied with the statute notice requirement,it was liable for the demurrage charges even if it was acting as an agent for donnelley in receiving the ic shipments.the district court also found that there was no indemnification agreement between south tec and donnelley and granted summary judgment to donnelley,defeating the third party complaint in a ruling not effectively appealed and therefore affirmed.south tec appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to the ic.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,examining the facts in the light most favorable to the opposing party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.see haywood lucent,cir.the district court grant of summary judgment will be affirmed if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.
we begin our analysis by examining the basis for the district court decision,and then we ask whether,despite its apparent errors,it might have reached the right result.
the district court here relied on two authorities the stb decision and a.we find that the two do not fully support the district court conclusions.
going in reverse order,let us first consider a 
liability for payment of rates 
a liability for payment of rates for transportation for a shipment of property by a shipper or consignor to a consignee other than the shipper or consignor,is determined under this subsection when the transportation is provided by a rail carrier under et.when the shipper or consignor instructs the rail carrier transporting the property to deliver it to a consignee that is an agent only,not having beneficial title to the property,the consignee is liable for rates billed at the time of delivery for which the consignee is otherwise liable,but not for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if the consignee gives written notice to the delivering carrier before delivery of the property 
a of the agency and absence of beneficial title and 
b of the name and address of the beneficial owner of the property if it is reconsigned or diverted to a place other than the place specified in the original bill of lading.
emphasis added.as recounted above,the district court relied on this statute to require that south tec have given notice to the ic of its status as an agent of donnelley.in applying this statute,however,the district court did not answer a critical preliminary question was south tec a consignee as emphasized above,the statute applies only to agents who are also consignees,and not to agents who are not consignees.see middle atl.conference united states,three judge panel noting that a careful reading of a predecessor of speaks only to certain narrow situations of warehousemen who appear as consignees on the bill of lading,but in no way can be read to impose liability on an agent not a party to the contract emphasis in original.in order for us to uphold the application of this statute,the district court or the stb must have found south tec to be the consignee of the disputed shipments.however,whether south tec was a consignee is a question answered by neither the stb nor the district court.
we believe that this question was ignored because somewhat unclear language in the stb decision led the district court to assume that the question of south tec consignee status,or its equivalent,had been answered in the affirmative.in its motion for summary judgment,the ic had argued to the district court that u nder the clear language of the stb order,if south tec is donnell e y agent,then liability passes through south tec to donnell e y,and i f south tec is not donnell e y agent,then south tec is liable directly.ic memo.in supp.of mot.for summary at,record at.the phrasing of this argument suggests that south tec is liable in any event,but can be indemnified by donnelley in the event that south tec was donnelley agent.according to this argument,the ic must recover,from south tec if not from donnelley through south tec,its demurrage charges in the instant lawsuit.apparently,the district court agreed with this reading of the stb decision.see tr.of proceedings,at the question of who owes the amount of the charges is the question of agency.but it is owed.the ic continues to argue before us,consistent with its earlier arguments and the district court order,that the stb dispositively ruled that south tec may be held liable for the ic claimed demurrage charge and that the stb decision stands as res judicata on the issue.ic br.at.
this reading of the stb decision is much too broad.while there is certainly some language in the stb decision to support these conclusions,see,stb decision at o nce accepted the shipments,it or donnelley,if was acting as donnelley agent became liable for the demurrage charges,the stb went to great lengths to explain that donnelley,and not south tec,is liable if south tec was acting as donnelley agent,see,id.at.and,in the language of the stb decision,whether south tec was an agent is directly tied to the question of whether south tec was a consignee.see id.at also argues that it was not the actual consignee of any of the shipments for which ic seeks demurrage,but rather was donnelley agent,and therefore may not be held liable for demurrage charges on shipments destined for donnelley.emphasis added id.at ic primary collection theory as to was the consignee of the shipments delivered to kankakee rather than an undisclosed neither be proved nor disproved on this record.emphasis added.the stb had declined to,since the question was not referred to it whether south tec was an agent and whether south tec was a consignee.both questions remained to be resolved by the district court.
adding to the lack of clarity was the apparent approval by the stb of item of the ic tariff,which provides that demurrage will be billed to the consignor at origin,the consignee at destination and the party for whom the car is held if enroute.
and donnelley also argue that ic demurrage charges do not apply on their face because the tariff does not expressly provide for the collection of demurrage at a point such as warehouse.and donnelley do not explain,however,why the party for whom the car is held if enroute language in the tariff is not broad enough to embrace.moreover,ic points out that was not just a point essential to the transportation,but was in fact identified on the bills of lading as the consignee of the shipments to its kankakee warehouse.in those circumstances,once accepted the shipments,it or donnelley,if was acting as donnelley agent became liable for the demurrage charges.
stb decision at.some of the parties and the district court may have read this passage to mean that parties responsible for loading and unloading at intermediate stopping points,a warehouse such as south tec,could be held responsible for demurrage charges even if they are not consignees or consignors.indeed,such an approach may even have some logical appeal,since south tec was,arguably,most directly responsible for unloading the cars in a timely manner.this reading,however,is inconsistent with the language of both the tariff and the stb decision.
the paragraph of the stb decision quoted above merits detailed analysis.in the second sentence,the stb appears to endorse the collection of demurrage from south tec by stating that the tariff is broad enough to embrace south tec.this sentence,however,must be read in conjunction with the previous sentence and the posture of the case before the stb.the first sentence poses the question being answered by the paragraph whether demurrage can be collected at a point such as south tec warehouse.id.emphasis added.critically,we note that this is not the same question as whether demurrage can be collected from south tec.the stb had before it south tec and donnelley as petitioners and the ic as respondent.in deciding that the tariff was broad enough to apply to delays at warehouses,the stb held that someone could potentially be held liable for the kankakee a sense,that the delays count as did not hold that south tec itself could be held liable.textually speaking,the last word of the second sentence of the passage quoted above refers not to south tec the corporate entity,but to south tec the location of the delays.
the question of who could be billed under the tariff is introduced in the latter part of the paragraph,which asks whether south tec was just a point or a consignee.as the stb decision explains,south tec becomes a properly billed party under the tariff in the circumstance that,as the ic argued,it was not just a point essential to the transportation,but was in fact identified on the bills of lading as the consignee of the shipments.stb decision at.the implication of this statement is that south tec can not be billed under the tariff if it was not the consignee.in sum,while the tariff may be broad enough to include the kankakee delays,see stb decision at noting that the tariff may provide for demurrage assessment at a point such as south tec warehouse,the stb decision imposes liability on south tec only if south tec was the consignee,and not just a point.
a close reading of tariff item supports our understanding of the stb decision.we read the last phrase of the relevant tariff,the party for whom the car is held if enroute,to have two possible meanings.according to the first interpretation,there are two parties in some sense responsible for the demurrage here the party holding the car an agent such as
