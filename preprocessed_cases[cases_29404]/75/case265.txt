the district court held that the parties had limited csx potential liability in the bill of lading to.the parties thereafter entered into a consent judgment,reserving abb right to appeal the district court resolution of the liability limit issue.upon our review,we conclude that the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act,subjected csx to full liability for the shipment,and that the parties did not modify csx level of liability by written agreement as permitted in that statute.we therefore vacate the portion of the district court judgment limiting any liability on the part of csx to.
we begin with a discussion of the complex regulatory scheme governing interstate freight shipments,and the historical context in which the shipment in this case occurred.we also address the role of the carmack amendment,which restricts carriers ability to limit their liability for cargo damage.

to determine whether a carrier has limited its liability consistent with the strictures of the carmack amendment,courts have applied a test,under which carriers must provide the shipper,upon request,a copy of its rate schedule give the shipper a reasonable opportunity to choose between two or more levels of liability obtain the shipper agreement as to his choice of carrier liability limit and issue a bill of lading prior to moving the shipment that reflects any such agreement.onebeacon ins.haas,cir see also chandler aero mayflower transit,cir explaining the requirement of reasonable notice to choose between levels of liability.the carmack amendment exception allowing for limited liability is a very narrow exception to the general rule imposing full liability on the carrier.toledo ticket roadway express,cir citing carmack amendment for motor carriers,as previously codified at.courts will carefully scrutinize any alleged limitation of liability to assure that the shipper was given a meaningful choice and exercised it as evidenced by a writing.acro automation iscont shipping.
in its complaint filed against csx,abb alleged that csx was liable for the actual loss or injury arising from the damage to the t ransformer under the carmack amendment.abb also asserted state law claims for negligence and breach of contract.
csx did not admit liability,but raised as an affirmative defense that any liability on its part was limited to a maximum of csx argued that the bill of lading bol executed by abb had incorporated by reference a liability limitation contained in a separate price list used by csx.
the district court did not consider the issue whether abb had established a prima facie case of liability against csx but,on submissions by the parties,proceeded to consider the liability limitation issue.the court awarded summary judgment to csx based on its defense that it had limited its liability.the court also reasoned that the carmack amendment did not apply to the shipment because the shipper,rather than the carrier,had drafted the bol.pursuant to the consent judgment entered into by the parties,abb timely appealed from the district court determination regarding csx limitation of liability 
before beginning our analysis of the carmack amendment,we describe the two documents central to our resolution of this appeal.first,the bol governing the march shipment is a partially completed copy of abb standardized bill of lading.the bol included general information about the shipment,such as the date of transport,and destination locations,and scheduled transportation route.in the space on the form labeled product value,abb traffic manager,brian brueggeman,entered.although the box labeled prepaid compared with collect was marked,the bol did not include a price for the shipment or indicate the level of liability assumed by csx for lost or damaged cargo the space labeled rate authority was left blank,as was the box that included the following language 
note where the rate is dependent on value,shippers are required to state specifically in writing the agreed or declared value of the property.
the agreed or declared value of the property is hereby specifically stated by the shipper to be not exceeding 
the bol also included certification language,which provided in part 
it is mutually agreed that every service to be performed hereunder shall be subject to all the terms and conditions the uniform domestic straight bill of lading set forth in uniform freight classification in effect on the date hereof,if this is a rail or a shipment 
shipper hereby certifies that he is familiar with all the terms and conditions of the said bill of lading,including those on the back thereof,set forth in the classification or tariff which governs the transportation of this shipment,and the said terms and conditions are hereby agreed to by the shipper and accepted for himself and his assigns.
emphasis added the bol was signed by brueggeman.
the second document at issue in this appeal is csx price list,which was issued by csx on november,and became effective on december.this document sets forth numerous rules applicable to csx transportation of machinery,such as,for example,procedures related to billing and to the loading and unloading of cargo.relevant to this appeal is the section of price list entitled price restrictions.this section lists eighteen provisions,including the following 
carriers maximum liability for lading loss or damage will not exceed per shipment.full liability coverage is only available by calling your sales representative for a specific quote.
csx corporate representative,joseph mccauley,testified in his deposition that price list does not provide varying rates associated with different levels of liability,and that in order to receive coverage for full liability under the list,a shipper must negotiate a rate directly with the carrier.
neither brueggeman nor his predecessor in abb traffic manager position,craig steffey,was aware of the existence of price list prior to the march shipment.during his tenure,steffey had obtained rate information from csx by contacting the carrier directly and obtaining a quote specific to the intended shipment.
with respect to the march shipment at issue in this appeal,brueggeman sought rate information on multiple occasions without success from csx personnel and from the csx website and thus was unable to complete the space designated on the bol for the rate authority.brueggeman explained that because he had been unable to obtain the rate authority in advance,he would only learn the price of the shipment when he eventually received an invoice from csx.
abb argues that the district court erred in failing to apply the carmack amendment to abb shipment.according to abb,because the parties did not agree in writing to limit the carrier liability,csx is liable under the plain language of the carmack amendment for the full value of the cargo damage.
in response,csx argues that abb,as the drafter of the bol,is not entitled to the protection of the carmack amendment and that,regardless,the bol incorporated by reference the limitation of liability included in price list we disagree with csx arguments.
we nevertheless observe at the outset that abb problem in this case is partly of its own making.the record reflects that brueggeman did not exercise due diligence in performing a key aspect of his job,namely,negotiating and obtaining rate and liability information for the shipment of very expensive equipment we also recognize that abb could have prevented many of the problems that occurred in this case not only by properly negotiating the shipping rate,but also by revising its standardized bill of lading to exclude outdated references to tariffs and classifications that were part of the pre regulatory scheme.
despite abb failures,however,the carmack amendment imposed the burden of securing limited liability on the carrier,csx,not on the shipper,abb.acro automation.at.the plain language of the statute provides that in the absence of a clear,written agreement by the shipper,the carrier is subject to full liability for actual losses.see a,c.
to overcome this default posture of full liability imposed by the carmack amendment,the carrier and the shipper must have a written agreement that is sufficiently specific to manifest that the shipper in fact agreed to a limitation of liability.a carrier can not limit liability by implication.there must be an absolute,deliberate and choice by the shipper.acro automation.at citation omitted.without a rule requiring at least some specificity in a written agreement,the shipper would not have a reasonable opportunity to choose between two or more levels of liability,onebeacon ins,at,but instead would be automatically and unwittingly subject to the carrier unilateral choice of a rate authority,new haven hartford nothnagle,binding the shipper by a limitation which the shipper had no reasonable opportunity to discover would effectively deprive the shipper of the requisite choice such an arrangement would amount to a forbidden attempt to exonerate a carrier from the consequences of its own negligent acts.
we disagree with the district court conclusion that,as a general matter,the carmack amendment does not apply when the shipper drafts the bill of lading.the text of the carmack amendment imposes full liability on carriers,without regard to which party prepared the bill of lading.the statute provides that a carrier failure to issue a bill of lading does not affect the liability of a rail carrier.a.
in this case,the parties did not reach a written agreement to limit csx liability and,accordingly,the carmack amendment operated to impose full liability on csx.on its face,the bol governing the march shipment was silent regarding the extent of csx liability.the space on the bol labeled rate authority,where a notation regarding rate and liability normally would be listed,was left blank.moreover,the bol did not contain any references to an identifiable classification,a rate authority code,a price list,or any other indication that the carrier assumed only limited liability.
csx contends,nonetheless,that price list is incorporated by reference into the bol through standardized language appearing on the bol,indicating that the shipper agreed to the terms and conditions in the classification or tariff which governs the transportation of this shipment.in csx view,this standardized language is adequate to meet the written agreement exception for avoiding full liability under the carmack amendment.
we can not endorse csx position urging limited liability under these circumstances,because the language in the bol does not specifically reference price list.under csx proposed rule,shippers would be charged with notice of a private price list created by the carrier,even when the list was not filed for public inspection,the shipper had not previously shipped cargo pursuant to that list,and the shipper had sought the pricing information unsuccessfully from the carrier before drafting the bol.under such a theory,the shipper knowledge of the list could be proved solely by use of the generic and outdated word tariff being employed as standard language in a bill of lading.
prior to deregulation,courts reasonably held shippers to constructive knowledge of a published tariff based on a generic reference to the tariff in a bill of lading.see mech.tech,ryder truck lines,cir.today,however,carriers are not required to file such public tariffs.tempel steel,at.to permit a carrier to assume that a shipper is familiar with a carrier price list,without any manifestation of that familiarity in the bill of lading or in an external agreement limiting the carrier liability,would be contrary to the carmack amendment command that a carrier may only limit liability pursuant to an express,written agreement with the shipper.c.
extended to its logical extreme,csx proposed rule would encourage absurd results.one such example would be a situation in which the bill of lading references a general tariff,but does not specify a particular rate authority or other code indicating the applicable rate and liability level.in the absence of publicly filed tariffs,or a citation to a specific rate authority or code,a carrier could change unilaterally its level of liability,unbeknownst to the shipper,by altering its price list a day before the shipment takes place.
additionally,we observe that a decision in favor of csx would be required if price list had been referenced specifically in the bol,even if abb had not actually been aware of the limitation of liability contained in that price list.in such a circumstance,the shipper reasonably would be charged with notice of the meaning of a precise,currently applicable term that the shipper included in the bol.
the eleventh circuit decision in siren,estes express lines,cir,on which the district court and csx have relied,is distinguishable on this basis.in siren,the shipper prepared the bill of lading and noted twice that the shipment would move under class,a term understood in the trucking industry as limiting liability to a certain amount per pound of cargo,although the shipper maintained it had no actual knowledge that this class designation provided such a limitation of liability.at.nevertheless,the shipper was aware that it had received a significant discount from the carrier full liability rate for the shipment in question,and that the rate it received was based on the class designation.id.the eleventh circuit concluded that,because the shipper drafted the bill of lading,the shipper chose to use the term class,the shipper did not rebut the carrier assertion at trial that class included a limiting aspect,the shipper knew class determined the freight rate charged,and the shipper knew that it received a discount from the full freight rate,the shipper could not avoid the limitation of liability it had included in the contract,because it was not proper or necessary to protect shippers from themselves.id.at.
we agree with the eleventh circuit determination that,by including a specific class designation in the bill of lading,the shipper was bound to the terms and conditions associated with that class designation.hughes aircraft am.van lines,cir holding that a shipper had reasonable notice and an opportunity to make a deliberate,thoughtful choice in selecting a limit of liability when the shipper drafted the bill of lading and negotiated its terms.in the present case,however,the bol is entirely silent regarding any current rate,classification,or other specific authority governing the shipment.there also is no evidence that the parties had a written agreement establishing a limit of liability separate from the bol.therefore,as discussed above,we decline to conclude that a shipper should be held to notice of a privately held price list based only on generic and ambiguous language referencing a tariff or classification.
our conclusion that the parties did not agree to a liability limitation is not altered by csx reliance on its past course of dealing with abb.the carmack amendment requirement of a written agreement undermines csx argument that the parties alleged course of dealing can serve as a substitute for a written limitation of liability for a particular shipment.see mooney farrell lines,cir declining to limit a carrier liability by evidence of the parties course of dealing,when the liability limit was not included in the bill of lading camar preston trucking,d,rejecting argument that the shipper sophistication and the parties course of dealing evidenced an absolute,deliberate and choice by the shipper to limit the carrier liability,in the absence of a bill of lading or other written agreement.
moreover,the present record lacks any evidence that abb previously had shipped under the terms of price list,or otherwise was familiar with that list.of the total bills of lading march in the record,none references price list.indeed,price list was issued in november and became effective in december,only three months before the shipment at issue in this case,and there is no evidence that abb shipped any cargo pursuant to that list in the interim period.
of the nine abb csx bills of lading included in the record,several different rate authority codes were used,and the record contains no evidence regarding the limits of liability associated with those codes steffey,brueggeman predecessor in the traffic manager position,testified that he entered these rate authorities on the bills of lading after being instructed to do so by csx representatives with whom he had negotiated rates for particular shipments,not because he was generally familiar with csx price lists.counsel for csx also conceded at oral argument that csx price lists are regularly changing,further undermining the contention that abb should have been familiar with price list at the time of the shipment 
we appreciate the common sense observation that a shipper drafting an imprecise bill of lading should not stand to benefit from its own lack of precision,as well as the district court reflection that such a shipper need not be protected from itself.nevertheless,we are bound by the express language of the carmack amendment,which puts the burden on the carrier to demonstrate that the parties had a written agreement to limit the carrier liability,irrespective whether the shipper drafted the bill of lading.see a,c.the general contract principle that ambiguous contracts be construed against the drafter,see,wheeler dynamic eng g,cir,is inapplicable in the face of statutory language that unambiguously imposes the risk of error on one particular party,the carrier,to the exclusion of the other party,the shipper 
finally,we note that important practical considerations support the conclusion we reach today.shippers by necessity entrust rail carriers with the safekeeping of expensive cargo and,under the carmack amendment,are entitled to presume that carriers will be held fully responsible for damage incurred during transit unless otherwise agreed.our ruling encourages parties to employ precise bills of lading,which reflect fully and specifically the parties choice of liability terms,and to memorialize these terms in writing as congress intended by passage of the carmack amendment.see.
in sum,we conclude that the district court erred in awarding summary judgment in favor of csx on its claimed liability limitation of.we therefore vacate the portion of the district court judgment fixing that liability limitation and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
vacated in part and remanded.
i concur in the majority opinion except as to those parts of sections iii and iv that conclude that the district court improperly granted csx motion for partial summary judgment.in my view,both the record and circuit precedent support the grant of partial summary judgment in favor of csx.accordingly,i respectfully dissent as to the parts of the majority opinion.
as a preliminary matter,the bol in the transaction at issue was drafted by abb,the shipper,on its own standardized form.the bol clearly stated,
shipper hereby certifies that he is familiar with all the terms and conditions of the said bill of lading,including those on the back thereof,set forth in the classification or tariff which governs the transportation of this shipment,and the said terms and conditions are hereby agreed to by the shipper and accepted for himself and his assigns.
csx effective rate schedule at the time of the shipment,price list,clearly stated,carriers maximum liability for lading loss or damage will not exceed per shipment.full liability coverage is only available by calling your sales representative for a specific quote.
although abb employees testified that they were not aware of price list prior to drafting the bol,csx employees testified that price list was published on the csx company website and was available upon request from any of its sales representatives.abb does not dispute that price list was available on csx company website.abb merely asserts that its employees attempted to contact csx to obtain a price quote,but had no success in receiving rate information by telephone despite its inability to receive price information from csx,abb still chose to ship a million transformer using csx as the carrier.
the majority holds that the parties did not reach a written agreement to limit csx liability and,accordingly,the carmack amendment operated to impose full liability on csx.majority on this point,we disagree.the record shows that the parties made such a written agreement and that the agreement complies with the requirements of the carmack amendment and limits csx liability.
the carmack amendment allows a commercial rail carrier to limit its liability with the shipper written consent.
a rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the board under this part may establish rates for transportation of property under which 
a the liability of the rail carrier for such property is limited to a value established by written declaration of the shipper or by a written agreement between the shipper and the carrier or 
b specified amounts are deducted,pursuant to a written agreement between the shipper and the carrier,from any claim against the carrier with respect to the transportation of such property.
courts determine whether such written consent is effective under the carmack amendment by considering whether the carrier provided a tariff to the shipper upon the shipper request gave the shipper a reasonable opportunity to choose between two or more levels of liability at least one of which was full liability coverage,obtain ed the shipper agreement as to his choice of carrier liability,and issue d a bill of lading prior to moving the shipment.see onebeacon ins.haas,cir 
two of the above requirements are easily disposed of.as to the first requirement,abb does not dispute that csx never,in fact,received a request for its rates or tariff from abb.while abb asserts that it made several telephone calls to csx that went unreturned,abb presented no evidence that it ever made actual contact with an authorized csx agent to request csx rate information.nor does abb present any evidence to rebut csx testimony that its rate information was available on its website.and courts have concluded that the fourth requirement,that a carrier issue a bill of lading prior to shipment,is also satisfied when the shipper prepares the bill of lading.see,siren,estes express lines,cir.thus,at issue in this case is only whether abb had a reasonable opportunity to choose between two or more levels of liability and whether abb agreed in writing to limited liability on the part of csx.
the record reflects that csx provided abb with a reasonable opportunity to choose between different levels of liability coverage.the facts of this case seem indistinguishable from those in werner enterprises westwind maritime international,in werner,the eleventh circuit considered whether a shipper was given a reasonable opportunity to elect full liability coverage when the shipping document incorporated by reference the carrier tariff,which contained a limitation on liability,cir.notably,the tariff at issue in werner instructed a shipper to specifically notify the carrier when it wanted full liability coverage.id.as in the case at bar,the shipper in werner never expressly requested full liability coverage from the carrier.id.at.the shipper in werner argued that it did not have a meaningful opportunity to request full liability coverage because the carrier default coverage was limited.id.at.faced with this argument,the eleventh circuit held that the carrier properly limited its liability within the requirements of the carmack amendment because it provided the shipper with the right to request full liability coverage.id.
abb makes the same argument rejected by the eleventh circuit in werner that csx default policy of limited liability deprived it of a reasonable opportunity to choose full liability coverage.yet like the carrier in werner,csx merely reserved the right to approve the request for full liability coverage and charge a correspondingly higher rate.id.csx effective tariff,price list,incorporated by reference in the bol,provided shippers with the right to elect full liability coverage.
although abb argues that it was not aware of price list,it is undisputed that csx policy requiring its shippers to affirmatively request full liability coverage was not new to price list and was not a change in policy from prior dealings between csx and abb.in fact,abb admits that in its past dealings with csx as well as other carriers,it always had to expressly request full liability coverage in order to receive it and that it was aware that rail carriers limited their liability to amounts as low as prior to the shipment at issue.it is therefore easy to conclude that,as in werner,csx provided abb with a reasonable opportunity to elect full liability coverage,an opportunity abb chose not to avail itself of for reasons known only to abb 
this conclusion is further supported by the fact that abb drafted the bol in this case.abb argues at length that various problems with abb own bol deprived it of a reasonable opportunity to choose full liability coverage.among other things,abb argues that its form bill of lading would not allow the employee filling it out to enter a value in the declared value box of the form.abb entire line of argument,however,completely ignores the fact that abb created the bill of lading form and tendered it as a contract to csx.while a carrier may not require a shipper to use a form that deprives the shipper of a reasonable opportunity to request full liability coverage,any defects in a form created by a shipper are no more than a unilateral mistake that can not later be used against a carrier.sassy doll,at see werner,at stating that,while rejecting a similar claim,the court was particularly persuaded by the fact that the shipper drafted the bill of lading.norton jim phillips horse,cir carriers should not be held to a standard that would impose liability on them due to a unilateral mistake by an experienced shipper.hughes united van lines,cir o nce the shipper was aware that the document signed was a contract for transporting his goods,absent fraud or bad faith,the shipper can not reform the bill of lading without the consent of the carrier on the grounds that they were unilaterally mistaken about the terms of the contract.abb can not rely on its own negligence in introducing its own defective document into the commercial marketplace to avoid the resulting consequences of its contractual covenants.nothing in the carmack amendment requires the carrier to hold the shipper harmless for the shipper negligence,particularly where the carrier has every reason to take the shipper at its word.
moreover,abb agreed in writing to csx limitation on liability.on its face,the bol unambiguously incorporated csx effective tariff,which was price list,and therefore functioned to limit csx liability in accordance with the carmack amendment.specifically,abb certified that it was familiar with all the terms and conditions set forth in the classification or tariff which governs the transportation of this shipment and that it agreed to be bound by those terms and conditions.the majority opinion treats this unambiguous,binding contract language as inoperative,however,because the reference to the tariff which governs the transportation of this shipment is generic boilerplate language and the bol does not specifically mention price list.
abb concedes that the bol is a valid,binding contract between the parties.the court must therefore read that contract consistently with the applicable contract law of the state in which the contract was formed.see,selective ins.of,cir.because abb asserts that the contract was formed in missouri and csx does not argue otherwise on appeal,we apply missouri law.
under missouri law,the parol evidence rule bars courts from considering whether a party to a contract may have intended anything other than what was written in the contract document.see celtic tinnea.one party unilateral mistake can not serve as the basis of rescission under missouri law unless the mistake related to a material fact and the other party to the contract kne
