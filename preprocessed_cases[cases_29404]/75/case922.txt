fort international airport no longer has the capacity to meet existing demand without substantial delays.congestion and delay,indeed,are projected to increase.the parties dispute what to do about it.
the airport now has three runways.two are widely spaced and run parallel in the direction on either side of the airport by main runway and a shorter south runway the third runs diagonally from northwest to southeast.only the main runway is long and wide enough to accommodate larger aircraft.the airport owner,broward county,seeks to extend the south runway to feet by feet and to close the diagonal runway.it applied to the federal aviation administration for federal funding and for the many faa approvals needed to begin construction pursuant to the airport and airway improvement act aaia,and related statutes.after considering several possible alternatives to the county proposal and conducting a lengthy environmental review process,the faa issued a record of decision that with minor modifications approved the county proposal,dubbed alternative,the decision.
the cities of dania beach and hollywood and several individuals challenge the adopted proposal.they argue that instead of approving alternative,the faa should have chosen an alternative that is concededly preferable environmentally,alternative,consisting of a new runway to the north of the main runway.besides a variety of other environmental benefits discussed below,alternative would spare an area called brooks park petitioners describe this as an old neighborhood park containing acres,with picnic tables,parking,and passive open space.pet.br.at.
petitioners invoke two environmental statutes and an executive order c b,a part of the aaia,which conditions faa approval,when a project such as the county is shown to have certain adverse environmental impacts,on a finding that there is no possible and prudent alternative f of the department of transportation act of,c,which somewhat similarly conditions approval of a project that will use a publicly owned park of national,state,or local significance,plus some other publicly owned amenities,on a finding that there is no prudent and feasible alternative and executive order,a.may,which conditions federal assistance for construction in wetlands on a finding that there is no practicable alternative.
in its administrative proceedings and before us,the faa points to airport delays that would continue and even be exacerbated if alternative were adopted,and to safety hazards associated with that option.it regards these problems as extreme enough,in context,to support its finding that alternative was not prudent under either statute,nor practicable under the executive order.it also found brooks park not to be a park of local significance.
after addressing the county arguments that the faa decision is not final and that petitioners lack standing,we consider whether the faa either was required to,or did,give the term prudent in the aaia the same meaning that the supreme court found prudent to have in f in citizens to preserve overton park volpe,we find that it was free to,and did,give it a somewhat laxer construction.applying that construction,we find the faa decision consistent with the aaia.we also find that the faa could reasonably conclude that brooks park was not a park protected by f.finally,we hold that the agency was not arbitrary or capricious in viewing alternative as impracticable within the meaning of the executive order.
finality and standing 
section a of title provides this court jurisdiction to review orders issued by the faa under the aaia.although the faa does not contest jurisdiction,broward county has intervened and objected to subject matter jurisdiction on two grounds lack of finality and lack of standing.
first,the county argues that the faa challenged actions under c b and executive order are not final orders,because they merely determine eligibility for federal funds,rather than actually approving a grant of funds.because the decision does not award a grant,the county says that the petitioners objections are premature with the exception of their f claim.
second,the county objects to the petitioners standing,saying that a favorable decision in this case would not redress their alleged injury.lujan defenders of wildlife,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision internal quotations omitted.the county contends that it has an approved airport layout plan alp approved in the decision itself,see decision at,and could and would make the proposed changes to the airport even without federal funding and thus,it argues,without the contested rulings under c b or executive order.the county is adamant that if federal funding were denied,its intent and ability to proceed with its expansion plans would be just as firm as were shown to be in village of bensenville faa.it says that if the faa approved the alp under a,the challenged faa determinations could only be reviewed in a final award of the grant,which the decision clearly is not.see decision at the decision does not signify an faa commitment to provide financial support,which is a separate future decision.
we discuss the two objections to our subject matter lack of finality and reverse order.the county understanding of c b is mistaken.a number of paragraphs in specifically state conditions for approval of project grant s,including paragraphs a,b,e and g but paragraph c is in this respect far broader.it governs every application for an airport development project involving the location of an airport or runway or a major runway extension,regardless of the applicant interest in federal funding.see town of stratford faa,
assuming the county proceeded without federal funding,its theory would be correct that it and the faa would have had no need to jump through c b hoops,but only if its proposed changes to the alp were minor.here the county proposes a major runway extension,defined in faa regulations as one that causes a significant adverse environmental impact to any affected environmental resource.faa order b.so,even if the county declined federal aid,its airport expansion could proceed only if the faa approved a new alp,which it could do only on a finding that the project complied with c.because the county can not begin the airport expansion without an approved alp,a determination by this court that the faa violated c b would redress the petitioners injury by stopping the expansion in its tracks.lujan,at faa order b,unconditional alp approval signals that the faa has authorized the airport sponsor to begin building the facilities or equipment depicted on the alp.
for the same reasons,the county finality objection must fail.the decision gave its approval to the new alp,decision at,a necessary condition for implementing alternative,and a sufficient one so far as faa approvals are concerned.see united states los angeles,holding that agency orders are final when they determine a right or obligation.see also environmental defense fund,ruckelshaus.
the county also poses finality and standing objections to our reaching petitioners claims that the faa violated the executive order.so far as we can determine,this challenge depends entirely on the county claims,set out in its discussion of the aaia context,that the decision did not establish any right,and that its reversal would not remedy dania beach prospective injury,because it was not a final grant of money.but as we have shown,the decision did afford broward county a right the right to proceed with alternative,and its reversal would correspondingly relieve dania beach of the feared injury,namely the side effects of the airport expansion.the same points are equally true as to the faa ruling under the executive order.
the first issue relating to c b is whether prudent in that section must have the same meaning as it does in f of the department of transportation act of,c,as petitioners argue,or whether it is somewhat less demanding here than in that context,as the faa says.the supreme court in overton park found that f allowed use of the protected parks,recreation areas and wildlife resources for transportation projects only when an alternative was rendered imprudent by truly unusual factors or problems that rose to extraordinary magnitudes.at.petitioners make the seemingly common sense point that a word meaning should be the same across comparable contexts after all,both the relevant provisions allow a federal agency to harm a natural resource only if there is no possible and prudent or prudent and feasible alternative to the proposed project.they also argue that the faa internal rules,order b.e b,a,have assigned the two sections an identical meaning.
petitioners invoke our decision in citizens against burlington,busey,in support of their argument that the faa has no discretion to interpret the term prudent more narrowly than the supreme court interpretation of f.but that case does not resolve the point.having first found that the agency had not violated f,that it found the proposed alternative imprudent under f,we said that we had little trouble deciding that there was no violation of the predecessor of c b.id.at.the proposition that compliance with f necessarily entails compliance with c b does not,however,mean the if f restricts the agency more severely than does c b.
given the range of plausible interpretations,some deference is due the agency interpretation under either chevron natural resources defense council,or skidmore swift,here we need not resolve which.the faa discusses the meaning of prudent in both statutes in its order b,an agency manual adopted pursuant to a process as directed by the vision of aviation reauthorization act,stat.the order,though hardly unequivocal,does not equate the two.paragraph.e a directs faa officials,in determining whether an alternative is prudent for purposes of f,to u se seven listed factors,such as whether the alternative would cause extraordinary safety or operational problems.paragraph.e b addresses prudent in the context of c b it in turn refers to the.e a factors,but does so,we think,more vaguely and with somewhat less insistence,saying that e a defines prudent relative to section f but is still very useful for application of c b.both sections say that prudent refers to rationale sic judgment neither counsel relied on that language or could offer any interpretive help.
in its brief before us the faa explicitly offers an interpretation of c b and order b distinctly laxer than that of overton park reading of f it argues that it may find an option imprudent if it is significantly inferior at serving the faa statutory mandates under the aaia,including the mandates to increase capacity,accommodate demand with less delay,and ensure safety.resp.br.at.as an interpretation of the faa regulation,such an interpretation is entitled to deference so long as it reflects the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question,not just its litigating position.auer robbins.here,the briefs interpretation is not new the faa elaborated a very similar interpretation in its legal brief submitted in may in its brief for respondent at,natural resources defense council faa,cir nrdc faa.the nrdc court substantially accepted this interpretation.see nrdc faa,at 
despite the two statutes general similarity in context,the faa reasons that the greater breadth of resources protected by c b cuts against an idea of prudent identical to that of f.the latter applies only to parks,recreation areas,and wildlife or waterfowl refuges that have been declared significant c b protects natural resources,including fish and wildlife,natural,scenic,and recreation assets,water and air quality,or another factor affecting the environment.section f prohibits use while c b bans significant adverse effect s.
in addition,the nrdc court observed that f protects only publicly owned resources,so their use will almost always be less costly to the public purse,id.at citing overton park,at and because no one normally lives or works in f protected areas,no one will have to be driven from his home or business,id.thus the f context requires exceptional agency if the resources are to have any chance.by contrast,nrdc faa reasoned,the aaia protected privately owned as well as public lands,so that an alternative affecting the protected resources was less likely to have an automatic advantage.
besides the difference in range of protected resources and nrdc faa arguments,c b is part of a larger statute,the aaia,which boosts airport development unusually aggressively.see a airport construction and improvement projects that increase the capacity of facilities to accommodate passenger and cargo traffic should be undertaken to the maximum feasible extent so that safety and efficiency increase and delays decrease.
this case falls somewhere between the conditions for deference to agency interpretations of their regulations under auer and the restricted conditions for deference to interpretations of an enabling statute under mead.united states mead.if order b simply echoed the exact language of c b,the agency brief could enjoy no auer deference.gonzales oregon.but given order b suggestion of a gap between the statutes meanings,the faa briefs apparently consistent articulation of such a difference,and the evident differences in the two provisions scope and purpose,we find the interpretation offered here by the faa within its discretion.
quite apart from questions of degree of prudence or imprudence,the faa invokes order b.e b for the principle that under c b it may consider not only how well each alternative meets the project purpose and need,the faa statutory mandates under the aaia,and the county goals,but also the competing proposals varying levels of environmental harm.as it points out,all the alternatives it considered would have some significant adverse effects on natural resources.while alternative was the environmentally preferred alternative,it would nevertheless cause noise impacts to households,could result in destruction of acres of wetlands in order to relocate displaced airport tenants,and may affect a with noise impacts to households and destruction of acres of wetlands under alternative.decision at tbl.to be sure,c b does not allow the faa to engage in an,fully discretionary balancing of competing interests.but we think that where protected resources are on both sides of the balance,the faa may properly consider not only the defects of the environmentally preferred option,but also the margin by which its environmental advantages exceed those of the alternative.
with these principles in mind,we have little difficulty finding that there was nothing arbitrary or capricious in the faa finding that alternative was not prudent,and that c b demands were satisfied.the faa found that although the selected alternative would have more adverse environmental impacts than alternative,it would have a radical edge in meeting the transportation purposes of reducing delays,ensuring safety and increasing capacity.see id.at.the delay differences alone are striking.alternative would have minutes of average delay per operation and would perform almost as well in conditions average minutes of delay in east flow operations and average minutes of delay in west flow operations.id.at.by contrast,alternative would have average delays of minutes of per operation,skyrocketing in conditions to minutes in east flow operations and minutes in west flow ones.id.
petitioners try to parry the delay figures with the point that delays are rare occurring only of the time.they also argue that c b requires the faa to select the alternative so long as it meets the project purpose and need,which had been set as six minutes of average delay per operation,even if it meets that criterion only minimally.
but projections prepared in the final eis showed that alternative would perform as poorly as the no action alternative in poor weather conditions and worse than alternative by a factor of.final environmental impact statement for the development and expansion of runway and other associated airport projects at fort international airport june,app.f at.and the frequency of poor weather amounts to an average of days a year.we think the faa entirely within its discretion in placing weight on defects in alternative that were not foreseen in the original formulation of goals.
the different alternatives also vary considerably in their fit with the existing airport layout,with the edge decisively in favor of alternative.under it,both the main runway and the extended south runway could operate independently,reducing complexity in coordinating arrivals and departures.decision at.under alternative,no such independent operation would be possible for the main runway and the proposed new one.instead,air traffic control would have to take extra precautions in coordinating takeoffs and landings.id.and under alternative,once airplanes were on the ground they could access the terminal from either runway only by crossing an active runway.id.at.
the petitioners respond that this is nothing extraordinary,and that air traffic control could easily coordinate air traffic and runway crossings.but the fact that air traffic control could choreograph the dance of the airplanes does not suggest that such coordination is not more cumbersome or less safe than the alternative.human error is the most common cause of aviation accidents.see scott shappell et,human error and commercial aviation accidents a comprehensive,analysis using hfacs,at reporting that of aviation accidents are due,at least in part,to human error.the faa can reasonably determine that concerns about safety combined with substantially greater delays would render alternative imprudent under c b.see nrdc faa,at t he aaia entrusts the agency with the responsibility for assessing prudence by deciding for itself the appropriate weight to accord myriad relevant factors order b.e a suggesting that accumulation of adverse factors collectively can render an alternative imprudent.
in sum,we find that the faa was not in violation of law in its construction of prudent for the purposes of c b,nor was it arbitrary or capricious in finding that the use of alternative would not have been prudent.
petitioners brooks park argument has two elements first,a substantive claim that the area qualified for f protection as a public park of local significance second,a motion to supplement the administrative record with draft environmental impact statements eiss prepared in and evaluating a different albeit similar proposal to expand the airport,and with documents submitted during those processes.if admitted,they argue,these would reinforce its argument that the faa determination that the area was not a park was arbitrary and capricious.
the record before the faa indicated that the primary public function of the space in question,lying between the airport fence and a perimeter road on the east side of the airport,was for,though with some later encroachment by commercial vehicles using it as a waiting area.joint appendix.there is no claim that the area featured the sort of natural beauty that is among the values f seeks to protect.see a.invoking the section references to historical sites,however,petitioners suggest that the area was an old neighborhood park that existed for many years,that dania beach comprehensive plan included a reference to it,and that it dates back to a time when the airport was much smaller.pet.br.at.as a result,they argue,its significance must be presumed.pet.reply br.at citing to c.c.
none of this seems to undermine the faa refusal to regard this site as a public park of local significance.petitioners reinforce their claim,however,by invoking an faa handbook provision against manipulative redesignations of sites 
where the use of a property is changed from a section f type use to a transportation use in anticipation of a request for faa approval,section f shall be considered to apply.
order e,app.a,d.they argue that the county,after it bought the area from dania beach in,changed its formal use from park to transportation.under the handbook,they say,it follows that f must be considered to apply.
the petitioners are deeply overreading order e,app.a,d.the fact that the designated use of the area was changed from park to transportation does not convert a non f resource into a f resource.the evidence in the record supports the faa conclusion that the land was never a f resource.the county as its owner never considered the land to be a park.in fact,it has said that the land was used illegally by commercial vehicles as a waiting area a use that prevented use of the picnic tables.id.apart from their assertion,petitioners introduced no evidence that the area had been used as a the faa was obliged to regard any site with picnic tables as a park of local significance.see also stewart park reserve coalition,slater,cir holding that uninterrupted and purposeful use by the public makes particular lands a public park and recreation area within the meaning of f.it was not arbitrary or capricious for the faa to conclude that f did not apply to this tract.
the petitioners have moved before us to supplement the administrative record with hundreds of pages of documents introduced in prior eis processes that contemplated the airport expansion.we deny their motion.as we explained in texas rural legal aid legal services,we do not allow parties to supplement the record unless they can demonstrate unusual circumstances justifying a departure from this general rule.in american wildlands kempthorne,we held that the record can be supplemented in three instances if the agency deliberately or negligently excluded documents that may have been adverse to its decision,if background information was needed to determine whether the agency considered all the relevant factors,or if the agency failed to explain administrative action so as to frustrate judicial review,id.at.none of these conditions is met here.
the faa has been considering the expansion of the airport since.in and,the faa issued a draft eis and two supplemental draft eiss analyzing that proposal.in,the county substantially revised the proposed expansion,and the faa began the process anew,including holding new public hearings and preparing a completely new eis.the petitioners contend that the administrative record nevertheless must include documents produced since the faa first began considering the airport expansion.they claim that the faa selectively excluded adverse documents from the earlier administrative process.those documents would show that the faa once considered brooks park to be a f resource they are also said to show that the alleged problems with alternative were exaggerated.
instead of identifying particular documents adverse to the faa,the petitioners have simply submitted the entirety of the three draft eis statements prepared in and during the prior eis processes.but this vague proffer hardly supplies the requisite unusual circumstances to justify an order supplementing the record with pages of additional material.texas rural legal aid,at.petitioners positions about brooks park and alternative have by no means been scanted,and they make no claim that they were denied a chance to press those positions.in fact,they submitted a number of comments and objections regarding brooks park during the process and the faa properly considered them.see decision,app.a at.as regards problems with alternative,the court is satisfied that faa treatment in the decision under review was complete and thorough.petitioners claim that the supplementary documents would manifest faa exaggeration of the problems with alternative is too generalized to support such a massive inflation of the record.accordingly,we deny the motion to supplement the record.
petitioners final argument invokes executive order,a.may,which conditions federal assistance for construction in wetlands on a finding that there is no practicable alternative in resolving that issue,the agency is to consider economic,environmental and other pertinent factors.id.alternative would destroy acres of wetlands,the faa found,of which acres are mangrove wetlands.alternative would destroy acres of wetlands,but the faa believed the impacts could be reduced with further planning.decision at.
the ninth circuit has found that the standard under executive order is less prohibitive and contemplates more balancing of other factors than f.wildlife federation adams,cir.for reasons similar to those behind our decision about c b the greater breadth of the resources protected,the section application regardless of private or public ownership,and the ubiquity of find that conclusion persuasive.
even assuming for the purposes of argument that alternative would cause no impacts to wetlands,the faa determination was not arbitrary and capricious.as we discussed above,alternative inferiority to alternative,in its longer delays particularly in poor weather and the safety drawbacks of the requisite,render it not only imprudent under c b but impracticable under the executive order.
the motion to supplement the record and the petition for review are accordingly 
i write separately on the question whether the court may properly defer to the federal aviation administration position on appeal that the word prudent has different meanings in section f of the department of transportation act of dot act and section b of the airport and airway improvement act of aaia,codified at c b.the analysis adopted by the majority in deferring to a post hoc litigating position takes a strange turn and is flawed.in section f,congress used the word prudent in an environmental context involving transportation projects.the supreme court construed the word in citizens to preserve overton park,volpe.thereafter congress used the same word in the aaia in a broader environmental context involving transportation projects.the faa formally announced in order b that it interpreted prudent in the two statutes to mean the same thing,and this court previously understood the two statutes the same way.nonetheless,the majority concludes that because the aaia protects more of the environment than section f,there was a gap between the statutes affording the faa discretion,op.at,to adopt an interpretation of prudent that is distinctly laxer,op.at,than the supreme court even though this interpretation can be found only in the faa appellate brief,op.at.precisely why a post hoc statement of counsel for the faa is entitled to deference the majority does not say other than to note that counsel statement is not new.op.at.the majority also draws on a distinction between public and private property that another court adopted in a case where facts belied the validity of the distinction.
it is unnecessary in concurring in the judgment to decide whether the faa order b is consistent with the supreme court analysis of the word prudent in section f.suffice it to say,because the record demonstrates that the faa acted consistently with its regulatory interpretation of prudent in order b in determining whether alternative,favored by petitioners,met the transportation goals of the fort international airport expansion,the faa determination that alternative is imprudent was not arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law.see fed.aviation,record of decision,the development and expansion of runway and other associated airport projects at fort international airport,broward county,florida record of decision.accordingly,except as discussed below,i concur.
section f of the dot act of provides that the secretary of transportation may approve a transportation program or project 
requiring the use of publicly owned land of a public park,recreation area,or wildlife and waterfowl refuge of national,state,or local significance only if 
there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using that land and 
the program or project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the park,recreation area,wildlife and waterfowl refuge,or historic site resulting from the use.
c emphasis added.
in citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,the supreme court addressed the meaning of prudent in section f.it held that to be imprudent and thereby justify the destruction of parkland,the alternative to using a section f protected resource must present unique and truly unusual problems reaching extraordinary magnitudes.at.
in,congress enacted the aaia,stat.section b of the aaia,now codified at c b,provides that the secretary of transportation may authorize a major airport development project that 
is found to have a significant adverse effect on natural resources,including fish and wildlife,natural,scenic,and recreation assets,water and air quality,or another factor affecting the environment,only after finding that no possible and prudent alternative to the project exists and that every reasonable step has been taken to minimize the adverse effect.
c b emphasis added.a recodification in,see,stat,changed the original feasible and prudent to the current possible and prudent,c b,but no substantive change in the law was intended,at,reprinted in see,at.
the supreme court has long considered congress to intend similar or identical language to have the same meaning in two different statutes when the two provisions share a common raison.northcross bd.of educ.of memphis city,quoting johnson combs,cir.thus,as the supreme court held in smith city of jackson,when congress uses the same language in two statutes having similar purposes,particularly when one is enacted shortly after the other,it is appropriate to presume that congress intended that text to have the same meaning in both statutes.at citing northcross see treasury emps.union chertoff,citing smith.further,when judicial interpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision,repetition of the same language in a new statute indicates,as a general matter,the intent to incorporate its judicial interpretations as well.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith dabit,quoting bragdon abbott,modification in original.
applying the presumption,it is clear congress intended prudent in section c b the aaia to mean the same thing as in section f and as construed by the supreme court in overton park.contextually,the term is used identically in the two statutes both provisions limit the secretary of transportation power to approve new transportation projects when they would use as in section f or cause significant adverse effects as in section c b to the protected environmental resources.in the years between enactment of section f and the aaia enactment,the supreme court defined prudent as used in section f in overton park.it is difficult to imagine that congress did not have in mind this settled understanding of the meaning of prudent when it chose to employ the same word and the same concomitant requirement,feasibility in a virtually identical context for the same purpose of protecting environmental resources.congress gave no indication in the aaia that it intended a different meaning,which it easily could have done,much less that it intended to water down the high hurdle that the supreme court identified in overton park.
the faa,which,as relevant here,has been delegated authority for carrying out section f and section c b,reached the same conclusion in formally adopting the interpretation that the word prudent has the same meaning in both statutes.in order b,the faa regulatory announcement of internal policies published upon congressional direction for notice and comment in the federal register,see op.at,the faa stated that prudent as used in the aaia is defined relative to section f.order b.e b,available at.see notice of publication of the preamble to order b.may,notice notice of availability and request for comments on draft order b.the ordinary or natural meaning,bailey united states,internal quotation marks omitted,of the noun relative is a thing having a relation to or connection with or necessary dependence on another thing,collegiate dictionary ed.merriam.order b its own paragraph.e a for more information about the meaning of prudent in section c b,and that paragraph lists seven factors for the faa to weigh in considering a irport actions resulting in use of section f protected resources.the preamble to order b states,moreover,that the faa believes this definition of prudent is appropriate for faa actions under c b as well as section f.notice.at.viewed contextually,the necessary dependence meaning of the word relative applies.
ordinarily,were deference due to the faa interpretation,whether under
