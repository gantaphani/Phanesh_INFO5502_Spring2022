the city of new york,its mayor,and the president of the borough of queens collectively city petition for review of four orders of the secretary of transportation granting and landing slots at new york laguardia and john kennedy international airports.see in re the wendell ford aviation investment and reform act for the century,orders,nos.dep t of transp,hereinafter orders.
the city claims that the orders must be overturned because the secretary failed to i assess the environmental impact of the orders ii exercise discretion in granting the orders by considering additional statutory factors concerning the domestic economic benefits from granting each request and iii review the merits of each application individually.respondents,the secretary of transportation,the deputy assistant secretary for aviation and international affairs,the united states department of transportation,and the federal aviation administration collectively secretary,argue that we have no jurisdiction to review the orders and that,even if jurisdiction exists,no environmental assessment was required and the secretary complied with the relevant statutory requirements.we conclude that we have jurisdiction but agree with the secretary on the merits and deny the petition for review.
background 
the present petition arises from the federal regulation of air traffic at four,kennedy,chicago international,and washington,reagan national.congress phasing out of regulation of aviation routes in the,see airline deregulation act of,stat,removed regulatory limits on the number of flights at all but the four airports named above.these four,because of unusual congestion and delays,remain under the regulation of the federal aviation administration faa.see.
in,the faa adopted the high density rule hdr,which limited the number of flights at these four high density airports and required airlines to obtain slots reservations for takeoffs and offering services during regulated time periods.see id.by the early,however,the hdr was perceived as a barrier to improved service,in part because new air carriers were unable to establish service due to the lack of slot availability.see,at,reprinted at wl.as a result,in,congress enacted a provision giving the secretary discretion to grant exemptions from the slot requirement where the secretary finds it to be in the public interest and the circumstances to be exceptional,c,stat.prior to amendment.by the late,however,congress,dissatisfied with the number of exemptions granted,concluded that e xpanding the current exemptions or adding new exemptions no longer seems to be the best approach,at,and decided to eliminate the hdr at laguardia,kennedy,and,while retaining some limits at reagan national,see id.at.
the new law,the wendell ford aviation investment and reform act for the century,stat.codified in scattered sections of,phases out the hdr at laguardia and kennedy as of january,see a.the act provides interim slot rules to allow new entrants to offer services at the two airports until that date.the legislation is generally intended to increase the number both of carriers offering services and of flights from the two airports to small hub or airports through the use of regional jets.
because the city petition for review requires a close reading of,we set forth in some detail the pertinent provisions of.section provides the interim slot rules at the new york airports 
a subject to section i,the secretary of transportation shall grant,by order,slot exemptions to any air carrier to provide nonstop air transportation,using an aircraft with a certificated maximum seating capacity of less than,between laguardia airport or john kennedy international airport and a small hub airport or nonhub airport 
if the air carrier was not providing such air transportation during the week of november,
if the number of flights to be provided between such airports by the air carrier during any week will exceed the number of flights provided by the air carrier between such airports during the week of november,or 
if the air transportation to be provided under the exemption will be provided with a regional jet as replacement of turboprop air transportation that was being provided during the week of november.
b subject to section i,the secretary shall grant,by order,slot exemptions to any new entrant air carrier or limited incumbent air carrier to provide air transportation to or from laguardia airport or john kennedy international airport if the number of slot exemptions granted under this subsection to such air carrier with respect to such airport when added to the slots and slot exemptions held by such air carrier with respect to such airport does not exceed.
c stage aircraft exemption may not be granted under this section with respect to any aircraft that is not a stage aircraft as defined by the secretary.
emphases added.
the requirements of section are s ubject to section i.that subsection provides that,within days after an application for a slot exemption is filed,the secretary must 
approve the request if the secretary determines that the requirements of the section under which the request is made are met return the request to the applicant for additional information relating to the request to provide air transportation or deny the request and state the reasons for its denial.
i.the period is tolled if the secretary requests additional information from the applicant.see id.i.the subsection also provides 
if the secretary neither approves nor denies the request within the period then the request is deemed to have been approved on the day 
section of governs interim exemptions at and is substantially similar to section regulation of new york airports quoted above.section governs only reagan national and is markedly different in two respects.first,as set out in detail in the margin it limits the total number of slot exemptions that may be granted at reagan national and gives the secretary discretion to develop criteria to determine the distribution of the limited number of slot exemptions.second,section is the only section that refers to the environmental impact of granting more slot exemptions.specifically,subsection e states 
neither the request for,nor the granting of an exemption,under this section shall be considered for purposes of any federal law a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
finally,section,which provides general rules governing the of the slot rules at all four airports,states 
c factors to consider.
in the award of slot exemptions under sections and,the secretary of transportation may consider,among other determining factors,whether the petitioning air carrier proposal provides the maximum benefit to the united states economy,including the number of united states jobs created by the air carrier,its suppliers,and related activities.the secretary should give equal consideration to the consumer benefits associated with the award of such exemptions.
does not apply in any case in which the air carrier requesting the slot exemption is proposing to use under the exemption a type of aircraft for which there is not a competing united states manufacturer.
on april,days after the president signed into secretary issued four orders granting applications for slot exemptions at laguardia and kennedy.see orders.rather than reviewing the applications for exemptions individually,the secretary decided that it would be more efficient to open four for each new york airport and to issue a blanket order in each docket granting slot exemptions to any airline that certified its satisfaction of the criteria set forth in section.in the secretary view,an applicant carrier would be entitled to an exemption simply by providing the required information and to an enforcement action for false it satisfies the criteria for obtaining slot exemptions under section.each order also contained a footnote stating that the secretary was not required to assess the environmental impact of the order prior to its issuance.see id.at orders governing b id.at orders governing a.the orders did not purport to have considered the factors enumerated in subsection c.
all of the applications for slot exemptions at issue on this petition were filed before the president signed the legislation,apparently in anticipation of becoming law.the city submitted comments in response to thirteen of those applications arguing,inter alia,that an environmental assessment was required before the slot exemptions could be granted.after the orders were issued,the city filed papers with the secretary objecting to the orders pertaining to a motion for reconsideration,or so we shall call arguing that an environmental review was required before granting slot exemptions.none of the papers filed by the city disputed any factual assertion in any application for a slot exemption.
however,before the secretary could act on the city motion for reconsideration,the city filed its petition for review in this court,claiming that i a required environmental review was not done ii the issuance of four blanket orders,rather than individual orders reviewing each application,was improper and iii the secretary should have considered the factors listed in subsection c before issuing the orders.after filing its petition,the city filed a motion to withdraw its request for reconsideration with the secretary,which the secretary granted.nevertheless,the secretary elected sua sponte to discuss the city objections.see in re,order,nos,dep t of transp,order on petition for reconsideration.the discussion asserted that,because leaves him with no discretion over the grant of slot exemptions at the new york airports and imposes short,mandatory deadlines,an environmental analysis was not required under the governing statutes.see id.at.it is to these issues that we now turn.
discussion 
a jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction over petitions for review of the secretary orders under.however,our jurisdiction extends only to objections raised in the proceedings before the secretary unless there was a reasonable ground for not making the objection in the proceeding.id.d.the secretary contends that the city petition is jurisdictionally barred because,inter alia i the objections the city raised before the secretary with respect to laguardia are different from those raised in its petition for review ii the city did not raise its objections to the grant of slot exemptions at kennedy in the proceedings before the secretary and iii the city never objected to the secretary decision not to review each application individually.
we conclude that we have jurisdiction.the city objection to the application by continental airlines for slot exemptions at laguardia,filed before the orders were issued,discussed the impact of additional slot exemptions at both laguardia and kennedy.further,that objection specifically stated,a nother meaningful environmental analysis must be conducted before any new slots are awarded at either laguardia or jfk.emphasis in original.motion for leave to file late answer and answer of the office of the queens borough president,city of new york,docket no.march,at.although the city did not discuss the secretary discretion to grant slot exemptions under in particular,had not yet been signed into law either at the time that continental applied for the exemptions or at the time that the city responded.in saying this,however,we note that continental application was obviously drafted in anticipation of imminent signing into law because the application certified that the type of aircraft to be used did not have a competing american manufacturer,a statement clearly related to subsection c.
furthermore,the city also filed eleven other objections to applications for slot exemptions,two of which objected to the grant of exemptions at kennedy in particular.the eleven objections were filed before the effective date of and did not contain arguments based on that statute.however,a supplemental objection to one application was filed by the city during the period between the date was signed and the date the orders were issued.it explicitly argued that required an environmental review before the secretary could grant slot exemptions under that act.
finally,it is uncontested that the city expressly raised the environmental review issue in its motion for reconsideration.although the city withdrew that motion upon filing the present petition,it nevertheless clearly notified the secretary while we are withdrawing our motion,we continue to object to the orders.brief for respondents at appendix a,new york minetta cir.we therefore conclude that the city preserved its objections as to the need for environmental review.see wagner seed daggett,cir a presumption exists in favor of jurisdiction by federal courts over the actions of federal administrative agencies.bd.of educ.harris,cir exercising jurisdiction over objections not raised below where objections could not have been made earlier.
the city concedes,however,that it did not object before the secretary to his decision to issue four blanket orders,rather than orders responding to each application individually.nevertheless,the city argues that it had a reasonable ground,d,for not doing so.prior to the date the orders were issued,it had no notice that the secretary would use blanket orders because the secretary had,until then,assigned individual docket numbers to each individual air carrier application for slot exemptions.the city,moreover,had objected to each application individually we agree with the city that it had reasonable grounds for not raising its objection to the use of blanket orders earlier.see city of new york slater,cir per curiam reaching claim not raised by city in proceedings before secretary.
b the need for an environmental review 
the city argument regarding the need for environmental review is based on the requirements of the national environmental policy act nepa,et,which provides,in relevant part 
a ll agencies of the federal government shall include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,a detailed statement by the responsible official on the environmental impact of the proposed action 
c i.although the secretary failed to make a finding that the granting of slot exemptions is not a major federal action that significantly affect s the environment,the secretary did not prepare or issue an environmental impact statement eis with the orders.rather,the secretary argues that nondiscretionary mandates and its imposition of short deadlines relieves the secretary from having to comply with nepa.
when a court reviews an agency construction of the statute which it administers,it is confronted with two questions if the intent of congress is clear,the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,natural res.def.council,d see skubel fuoroli,cir.although the secretary is not charged with administering nepa,his conclusion that an eis was not required was based not on his interpretation of nepa but,rather,on his construction of,which he is charged with administering.we must,therefore,if necessary,apply chevron deference to his decision.
nepa directs that it is to be applied to the fullest extent possible.nevertheless,courts have fashioned exceptions to nepa requirement of environmental review,two of which are relevant to this appeal.first,where the agency decision does not entail the exercise of discretion,an eis is not required.amer.airlines,dep t of,cir,cert.denied,d internal quotation marks omitted see sac fox nation norton,cir.one rationale underlying this exception is that,where the agency is required to take action,consideration of environmental factors will,its decision.see goos icc,cir restore the woods united states dep t of,flint ridge dev.scenic rivers ass n,d nepa was not intended to repeal by implication any other statute.internal quotations marks omitted.
the second pertinent exception to the eis requirement arises when a statute imposes short,mandatory deadlines on an agency,thereby rendering compliance with nepa eis requirement impossible.see flint ridge,at.w here a clear and unavoidable conflict in statutory authority exists,nepa must yield.id.at.if a timeframe imposed by the statute on an agency is too short for the agency to prepare an eis,therefore,an eis is not required.id.
both exceptions apply in the present case.first,section,which applies only to the new york airports,states that the secretary shall grant slot exemptions,provided that the applicant carrier satisfies the conditions listed in the section.a b.those conditions,quoted supra,relate to the type of aircraft to be used,the route to be offered,the number of flights previously provided by,and the number of slot exemptions previously granted to,the carrier.see id.at a c.section therefore provides objective standards that do not contemplate the exercise of judgment or discretion.if,for example,an air carrier intends to provide nonstop service from laguardia to a nonhub airport,using a stage aircraft that seats fewer than people,and the air carrier was not providing that service during the week of november,section requires that the secretary shall grant,by order,slot exemptions.id.section provides no exceptions to this mandate,much less exceptions that require an exercise of discretion.
the city relies upon two other provisions of to support its argument.first,it relies on subsection c,which lists various factors to be considered in granting slot exemptions.the city argues that the weighing of those factors is the essence of a discretionary judgment.second,it relies on section,which creates an express exemption from nepa for reagan national,and on the lack of a similar provision applicable to either laguardia or kennedy.the city infers a lack of an exemption for laguardia and kennedy from this express exemption for reagan national.
turning to subsection c,subsection c provides before the award of slot exemptions under sections and,the secretary of transportation may consider,among other determining factors,whether the petitioning air carrier proposal provides the maximum benefit to the united states economy the city argues that the express reference in c to section section governing the new york an exercise of discretion involving judgments as to potential economic benefits before granting slot exemptions at those airports.the secretary responds by relying on the canon of statutory construction under which specific provisions trump more general ones,noting a legislative history favorable to his position and,of course,calling for deference to his interpretation under chevron.
we choose to resolve this issue on the narrow ground that the city has waived or forfeited any argument based on subsection c.that subsection requires,actually allows,an assessment of economic benefit only if the intends to use an aircraft manufactured abroad for which there is a competing united states manufacturer.see c.as the conference report stated to the extent that dot has discretion over the award of slot exemptions,it may consider whether the airline seeking the exemption will be using manufactured aircraft.this would not apply where the airline is proposing to use a type of aircraft for which there is not a competing manufacturer.conf,at,reprinted at wl,at.the secretary and two amici have argued that the air traffic at issue uses jets for which there is no competing manufacturer.the city has simply not responded,a failure that we deem dispositive.
because a procedural wrinkle is involved,we will review the history of this issue in some detail.while the city did raise the claim of a need for environmental review in proceedings before the secretary,it never argued in that forum that the need arose because subsection c required an exercise of discretion.in fact,the city never mentioned subsection c before the secretary.nor did the secretary mention it either in his orders or in his response to the city motion for reconsideration.
that is not to say,however,that section was not a visible presence,albeit one lurking in the background.three applications for slot of which are subjects of the present petition for implicated section by expressly stating that foreign aircraft for which there was no competing manufacturer were to be used.the city objections to these applications did not address these statements.this gets to the procedural wrinkle.the applications and all but one of the city objections to exception being in the nature of a supplemental filed before had become effective,april,the date on which the president signed it.the supplemental objection,filed after the effective date of and before issuance of the orders,did not raise the need for a domestic economic assessment under subsection c,even though the application failed to mention the type of aircraft to be used.finally,the city motion for reconsideration also failed to mention subsection c.
the petition for review in this court did mention section in claiming that issuance of the orders without considering the factors enumerated in subsection c was arbitrary and capricious.accordingly,the city brief in support of the petition for review relied heavily upon section as a statutory command ignored by the secretary and thus as grounds for overturning the orders.the brief relied even more heavily,indeed as one of two,upon section in support of its nepa argument that an eis was required.the brief did not,however,refer in any way to whether the conditions for the economic benefit assessment set out in subsection c,namely the use of foreign aircraft and the existence of competing aircraft manufacturers,had been met.
the secretary brief,and those of the two amici,in opposition to the petition for review,asserted in plain terms that subsection c did not apply because of subsection c.the secretary brief stated that n o firm makes regional jets and that v irtually all of the service to small hubs or authorized under a is operated with regional jets.brief for respondents at,new york minetta,cir.the city reply brief once again asserted that subsection c called for an exercise of discretion and,therefore,that nepa applied.however,once again the city made no reference to subsection c.
we thus face the following circumstances.the record before the secretary regarding the use of foreign aircraft by applicants for slot exemptions the existence of competing manufacturers is unclear,except for two applicants.the remaining applications covered by this petition for review never addressed the issue.because the city objections to the applications never mentioned section for any purpose,the secretary and the applicants may have perceived no reason to build a record in this regard.however,was not effective when the applications were filed.while the applicants appear to have been assuming that would govern the secretary consideration of the applications,we are loath to hold that the city waived or forfeited arguments based on section when the legislation embodying it had not yet been signed by the president and all but one of the city objections had been filed.the city failure to mention section in either the supplemental objection or in its motion for reconsideration is more troubling,but the secretary reliance on his lack of discretion as obviating the need for an eis was not made clear until his sua sponte response to the withdrawn motion for reconsideration.
the city petition for review raised section,albeit without a connection to nepa.in the city brief in support of the petition,subsection c took on a starring role.it was repeatedly quoted and was featured both as part of the nepa and arbitrary and capricious arguments.but that brief was also silent as to subsection c.that silence has legal significance because it surely waived both arguments at least as to the two carriers that addressed the existence of a competing aircraft manufacturer in their applications and thereby signaled their claim that subsection c was inapplicable.see pennsylvania dep t of health human,cir holding argument waived on petition for review where not adequately addressed in either main or reply brief commodity futures trading comm c
