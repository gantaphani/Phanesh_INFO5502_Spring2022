in a diversity action,a federal court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant only to the extent permitted by the applicable law of the forum state.see.e,h,and k.in this case,it is that the texas statute authorizes the exercise of personal jurisdiction to the full extent allowed by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.see.civ.prac.ann.west alpine view,at schlobohm schapiro.
