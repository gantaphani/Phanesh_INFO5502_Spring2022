introduction 
plaintiff,johanne dictor doing business as cpci,the assignee of manhattan transportation company,incorporated manhattan,appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of defendants,julian gonzalez doing business as gonzalez trucking,and david simon,incorporated doing business as gtw gtw.plaintiff sought damages for computer equipment that was lost while being shipped in interstate commerce.based upon a bill of lading which was prepared and signed by an employee of plaintiff assignor,manhattan,the trial court held the total amount plaintiff could recover was.because the trial court correctly found this case is controlled by the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act and the computation in the bill of lading must be enforced,we affirm the judgment.
ii.background 
a.the pleadings 
the first amended complaint,which is the operative pleading,alleged that manhattan hired defendant,gtw,to transport by truck computer equipment from carson,california to las vegas,nevada.the computer equipment had a market value of no less than.thereafter,gtw hired gonzalez and bolanos trucking to deliver the computer equipment.the first amended complaint identified bolanos trucking as a defendant.but bolanos trucking has never appeared in this lawsuit.the complaint alleged the existence of an oral agreement between manhattan and gtw.under the terms of the oral agreement,gtw would reimburse manhattan at full replacement value for damage to the computer equipment.it was further orally agreed coverage for such replacement value would be no less than secured by a certificate of insurance naming manhattan as an additional insured for any loss for the shipment.while the computers were in defendants custody,the first amended complaint alleged they were lost.a claim was made by the owner of the computer equipment against manhattan,whose insurer paid as fair and reasonable compensation for the loss.plaintiff alleged that plus interest was due for the total loss sustained.plaintiff sought to recover this amount based on causes of action for contract breach pursuant to federal statutory law,the carmack amendment,title,united states code section et first negligence second and conversion third.
in addition,plaintiff asserted a cause of action fourth to reform the contract between manhattan and gtw.plaintiff alleged that manhattan had arranged the shipping of the computer equipment through a third party broker.manhattan allegedly erred in issuing transportation documents which failed to reflect the following key terms gtw would reimburse manhattan for any loss at full replacement value coverage assuring a replacement value of no less than would be evidenced by a certificate of insurance from a cargo insurer naming manhattan as an additional insured and the shipment would be directly trucked by gtw rather than subcontracted to another trucking firm.plaintiff sought damages in the sum of.
summary judgment motion and the undisputed evidence 
gonzalez and gtw moved for summary judgment or adjudication on the grounds that a bill of lading issued by manhattan limited its assignee damages and no reformation of the contract was warranted.gonzalez and gtw argued that plaintiff was only entitled to judgment in the sum of.the separate answers filed by gtw and gonzalez both alleged that plaintiff damages were limited by the bill of lading issued january,by manhattan.
documents filed in support of and in to opposition the summary judgment motion established the following undisputed facts.john healy,manhattan president,described his company relationship with compaq computer company as well as other trucking firms.this relationship existed prior to the loss which gave rise to the present lawsuit.healy declared that compaq computer company required its carriers to have sufficient insurance to respond to potential claims and agree to indemnify any loss at replacement value.manhattan had such an agreement with compaq computer company in and.in,manhattan established a business relationship with gtw.well prior to the loss which gave rise to the present lawsuit,healy spoke by telephone with lou gomez,gtw employee.healy confirmed that future shipments,for which gtw would be hired,were for the benefit of compaq computer company as shipper and were of high value consisting of computers and related equipment.healy informed gomez that any single shipment would be valued at a range of approximately through.healy also informed gomez that gtw would be required to maintain financial responsibility to cover the full value of replacement cost of any loss or damage to the shipments.gomez furnished manhattan with certificates of insurance.gomez assured healy that gtw had its own employees doing its trucking and did not subcontract its jobs to other truckers.
gonzalez,a truck owner operator,was hired to transport computer equipment for gtw.he was paid a standard rate for the trip from carson,california to las vegas,nevada.gonzalez did not see what was being placed in his truck.gonzalez was instructed to go to the warehouse office where he was presented with a bill of lading,dated january,which had been prepared by manhattan.the bill of lading provided that the sender was q run corporation located in costa mesa,california.the destination of the shipment was an office max store in las vegas,nevada.the bill of lading indicated that the shipment consisted of compaq pc weighing a total of pounds in pallets.the january,bill of lading further provided unless a greater value is declared herein,the shipper agrees and declares that the value of the property is released in an amount not exceeding for any shipment of pounds or less and not exceeding cents per pound for any shipment weighing in excess of pounds.an additional charge of will be assessed for each or fraction thereof,by which the value declared exceeds per pound or whichever is higher.no greater value was declared in the bill of lading.the amount indicated on the bill of lading understated the value of the computer equipment gonzalez was transporting to las vegas.
healy explained why the bill of lading dramatically understated the value of the computer equipment taken from gonzalez truck.healy declared it is common in the trucking industry to have off record agreements concerning values of high value shipments and the responsibility of carriers to fully indemnify any loss or damage of such shipments at replacement values.this is because the inclusion of high valuation information on freight bills often exposes shipments to a higher risk of loss,while lacking any useful purpose.carriers such as gtw set their rates for handling shipments,including the shipments tendered to them by manhattan,without regard to declared values and have no separate rate structures for commodities which are given a declared value.at no time did gomez ever suggest to me that there was any difference in the rate quotes being given to manhattan based upon the requirement that gtw fully indemnify at replacement cost value for any loss or damage to shipments.freight was tendered to gtw to fully indemnify manhattan against loss and gtw rate quotes were received and paid on that basis.
c.the trial court ruling 
the trial court granted the summary judgment motion.the trial court held the contract between gtw and manhattan was the january,bill of lading the contract had no declared value stated the bill of lading had a limitation of liability provision setting any loss at per pound and plaintiff was not entitled to reformation of the contract.the trial court ruling further states the evidence indicates that compaq and manhattan had an agreement between themselves that manhattan would pay full replacement for a loss.there is an absence of evidence to indicate the existence of a contract between manhattan,gtw,or trucking,to pay full replacement.conversations did take place between healy,gomez and schneider about insurance coverage.however,the bottom line is that manhattan did not declare the real value on the b ill of l ading,and the law is clear that a carrier is liable only for the amount asserted on the b ill of l ading civil code section.in accordance with its conclusions,the court summarily adjudicated the amount owed by defendants to be.after the trial court entered judgment on the first amended complaint,plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.
iii.discussion 
standard of review of summary judgment 
in aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,the supreme court described a party burdens on summary judgment motions as follows f rom commencement to conclusion,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.that is because of the general principle that a party who seeks a court action in his favor bears the burden of persuasion thereon.citation.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof t he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.citation.

b.there are no triable issues of material fact 
the carmack amendment 
because the undisputed evidence established that the goods were being shipped from carson,california to las vegas,nevada,there is an issue of whether the action is governed by federal or state law.congress has the constitutional authority to regulate shipments of goods from one state to another,art.i,cl.adams express croninger.enacted as part of the hepburn act in,the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act,title united states code section,applies to motor carrier transportation of property between a location in one state to a place in another state.project hope ibn sina cir.state courts have jurisdiction over carmack amendment claims.d missouri,kansas texas ry.harris.
the effect of the carmack amendment on state laws was described by the court of appeals for the fifth circuit as follows our analysis must begin with the supreme court decision in adams express croninger.in adams,the plaintiff hired the defendant,a common carrier,to ship a package containing a diamond ring from ohio to georgia.the package never arrived.the bill of lading stated that charges for delivering the package were based on the value of the shipment,that the value was to be declared by the shipper,and that failure to declare the value would result in a rate based on a value of.the plaintiff had not declared a value.nevertheless,he brought suit against the defendant in kentucky state court for the full market value of the ring.under kentucky law,the contract to limit the plaintiff recovery to an agreed or declared value was invalid,and the plaintiff was generally entitled to recover the actual value of the ring.the plaintiff prevailed,and the case eventually went to the supreme court.the primary issue before the court was whether a contract for an interstate shipment,as evidenced by a bill of lading,was governed by the local law of the state,or by the acts of congress regulating interstate commerce.adams,at.the court noted that before the carmack amendment,the liability of common carriers for an interstate shipment of property was governed by either the general common law as pronounced by the state and federal the statutory laws of the states.id.at.because of the many varying laws that might apply to a dispute arising out of any given interstate shipment of goods,it was impossible for interstate shippers and carriers to determine their risks and responsibilities with any reasonable certainty.see id.at.the carmack amendment,the court held,made an end to this diversity,for the national law is paramount and supersedes all state laws as to the rights and liabilities and exemptions created by such transactions.accord,air prod,illinois cent.gulf,cir,cert.denied,d.morris covan worldwide moving,cir,see project hope ibn sina,supra,at hughes aircraft north american van lines cir.
the general scope of the carmack amendment federal preemption of state shipping statutes is as follows s tate statutes are preempted by the carmack amendment if they in any way enlarge the responsibility of the carrier for loss or at all affect the ground of recovery,or the measure of recovery.citation.the carmack amendment and the set of federal regulations that complement it cover not only the actual transport of goods,but they also govern the claims process.rini united van lines,cir,quoting charleston western car.varnville.in rini,the first circuit further synthesized the scope of carmack amendment preemption as follows a state law enlarges the responsibility of the carrier for loss or at all affects the ground of recovery,or the measure of recovery,citation,where,in the absence of an injury separate and apart from the loss or damage of goods,it increases the liability of the carrier.preempted state law claims,therefore,include all liability stemming from damage or loss of goods,liability stemming from the claims process,and liability related to the payment of claims.rini united van lines,supra,at,citing charleston western carolina ry.varnville furniture,supra,at.
the carmack amendment applies to the present case in two specific carrier must issue a bill of lading and that document can limit its liability for loss or damage to goods.first,the carmack amendment requires a carrier to issue a bill of lading and subjects it to absolute liability for actual loss incurred during transportations as follows a carrier providing transportation or service shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives for transportation under this part.that carrier and any other carrier that delivers the property and is providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under subchapter i or iii of chapter or chapter are liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading.a missouri elmore and stahl,d hughes north american van lines,supra,at.second,the carmack amendment allows a carrier to limit its liability in a bill of lading.title united states code section c a states in pertinent part a carrier providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under subchapter i or iii of chapter may,subject to the provisions of this chapter including with respect to a motor carrier,the requirements of section a,establish rates for the transportation of property other than household goods described in section a under which the liability of the carrier for such property is limited to a value established by written or electronic declaration of the shipper or by written agreement between the carrier and shipper if that value would be reasonable under the circumstances surrounding the transportation.italics added.the right of a shipper to reduce its potential liability is referred to as the released value doctrine.kemper ins.companies federal exp.cir,klicker northwest airlines,cir.
a condition to the application of the released valuation doctrine is that a shipper must be given a reasonable opportunity to opt for lower or higher liability by the carrier by paying a lesser or greater charge as the case may be.new york,nothnagle.hih marine ins.services,gateway freight services th,d.the requirement that the shipper be given a reasonable opportunity to negotiate a higher rate in exchange for greater liability by the shipper was explained by our colleague associate justice douglas swager of the first appellate district as follows u nder the federal common law governing common carriers,carriers may partially limit their liability for injury,loss,or destruction of baggage on a released valuation basis.citation.i n exchange for a low carriage rate,the is deemed to have released the carrier from liability beyond a stated amount.the federal courts have,however,restricted the application of this doctrine to cases where the carriers give customers a fair opportunity to choose between higher or lower liability by paying a correspondingly greater or lesser charge.citation.therefore,the shipper is bound only if he has reasonable notice of the rate structure and is given a fair opportunity to pay the higher rate in order to obtain greater protection.deiro american airlines,cir,see also klicker northwest airlines,supra,at.hih marine ins.services,gateway freight services,supra,th at,d.
the preemptive effect on the amount of potential liability resulting from the carmack amendment extends to a shipper tort claims against a carrier.as explained by the second circuit,even tort claims are subject to the liability limitations set forth on a bill of lading a valid limitation of liability clause governs not only the nature and extent of the carrier liability,but also the nature and extent of the shipper right of recovery.north american phillips emery air freight,cir.such clauses,therefore,limit recovery not only for breach of contract,but also based on other legal theories,including negligence,bailment,or conversion.see fiberglas.at,valid limitation of liability clause also applies to claims sounding in tort neal republic airlines,holding that w here it is clear plaintiffs seek damages for breach of the carriage contract t hey must proceed,if at all,on a breach of contract theory,and the contractual limitation of liability applies if otherwise valid saul sorkin,goods in transit,at supp contractual limitations of liability may not be avoided by framing the complaint in terms of bailment or tort.nippon fire marine skyway freight systems cir.we do not address or decide whether a carrier can be sued on a tort theory if the bill of lading does not address the issue.but,even if a noncontractual action can be pursued notwithstanding the carmack amendment,the potential amount of tort damages are those in the contractual limitation set forth in the bill of lading.
plaintiff additional damage and tort claims 
in this case,the released value doctrine limits plaintiff damages to those specified in the bill of lading issued by its assignor,manhattan.this case arises out of the interstate shipment by a common carrier of computer equipment.all of plaintiff claims are therefore subject to the preemptive effect of the carmack amendment.adams express croninger,supra,at.morris covan worldwide moving,supra,at.it necessarily follows that the trial court correctly found there was no merit under california law to plaintiff contention it could pursue additional damage claims.plaintiff argues that under california law,a common carrier can not contractually exonerate itself from claims for conversion,gross negligence,fraud,or willful wrongdoing,subd,pratt western pac.d.gross negligence.but plaintiff conversion claim,insofar as it would allow him to seek monetary damages beyond the limitation on liability in the bill of lading,is preempted by the carmack amendment.
plaintiff argues,though,that he is not subject under any circumstances to the limitation on liability appearing in the bill of lading.as discussed earlier,a party can contend that the limitation in a bill of lading is unenforceable if there was no fair opportunity to choose between higher or lower liability by opting to pay a greater or lesser charge for the shipment respectively.klicker northwest airlines,supra,at hih marine ins.services,gateway freight services,supra,th at,d.but in this case,plaintiff assignor,manhattan,the usual courier of the shipper,prepared the bill of lading with full knowledge that it did not reflect the true value of the computer equipment.manhattan had adequate notice of the limitation of liability provision because it prepared the bill of lading which contains the released value limiting the carrier liability.manhattan does not dispute that it is a sophisticated business enterprise well familiar with released values and limitations of liability and it could have declared a higher value.see ruston gas turbines pan american world airlines cir,hih marine insurance services,gateway freight services,supra,th at,d muelder western greyhound lines d.i t may be reasonable to presume that a sophisticated commercial shipper contracts with knowledge of tariff regulations.manhattan itself is in the carrier business.it had an ongoing agreement to transport computer equipment with compaq computer company.manhattan utilized subcontractors to transport cargo when it was unable to perform a job it agreed to do for compaq computer company.in filling out the bill of lading,manhattan could easily have declared a higher value and paid a greater carriage rate.instead,manhattan chose to pay a lower carriage fee and not declare a higher liability rate.according to healy declaration,this was done in part to disguise the nature of the cargo being delivered in order to discourage theft.whatever the basis for choosing the lower rate,it was manhattan decision to utilize the bill of lading with the liability limitation.it was manhattan that created the offer to have gtw deliver the goods at the lower rate without declaring the higher value.in issuing the bill of lading,manhattan expressly agreed to the liability limitations it set forth on the document.moreover,manhattan had the ability and did obtain insurance coverage to protect itself from exposure for loss or damage to the computer equipment.the decision to insure a shipment,as manhattan did in this case,has been found separately in and of itself to demonstrate a conscious decision not to opt out of the liability limitation by federal courts.burlington air express,cir,quoting vision air flight serv.national pride cir.accordingly,manhattan and its assignee,plaintiff,are bound by its failure to declare a value based on a higher rate.
plaintiff reformation claim 
plaintiff argues he is entitled to reform the bill of lading to set forth a greater potential liability on the part of gtw and gonzalez.decisional authority is unclear as to whether federal law would allow for the use of the reformation remedy to alter the terms of a bill of lading subject to the carmack amendment.some opinions recognize that a federal common law has been developed under varying circumstances to fill in gaps in the carmack amendment,project hope ibn sina,supra,at citing hector martinez southern pacific transp.cir,the carmack amendment incorporates common law principles for damages rafaella gallery ups,recognizing federal common law conversion cause of action exception to the carmack amendment but not finding one on facts.other authority holds that federal common law may not be used to increase potential liability under a bill of lading.gordon united van lines,cir,even if we assume that a federal common law rule with respect to punitive damages would be uniform nationally,the punitive damages remedy would displace the package of remedies that the interstate commerce act contains,and would allow precisely the uncertainty the carmack amendment was designed to bar cleveland beltman north american,cir,citing massachusetts mut.life ins.russell,d w here a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies,a court must be chary of reading others into it.the presumption that a remedy was deliberately omitted from a statute is strongest when congress has enacted a comprehensive legislative scheme including an integrated system of procedures for enforcement commercial union ins.forward air,d,i n addition to the fact that no state law claims against carriers survive the enactment of the carmack amendment,no federal common law claim against a carrier may be fashioned either.other courts recognize that it is unclear as to the scope of the application of federal common law in carmack amendment cases,opp wh
