this appeal presents the question whether section,first of the railway labor act rla,first,read in conjunction with other provisions of the rla,imposes a status quo requirement prohibiting carriers from unilaterally altering terms or conditions of employment once negotiations toward an initial collective bargaining agreement have begun,but before the agreement has been completed.following the supreme court holding in williams jacksonville terminal,we hold that it does not.we also hold that the district court acted well within its discretion in denying injunctive relief in this case.see chicago ry.united transp.union,d reg l airline pilot ass wings west airlines,wings west,cir.
north american airlines north american,a delaware corporation,is a certified air carrier engaged in scheduled and charter passenger service,as well as service for the department of defense.see.north american employs approximately employees,including pilots.in january,the national mediation board certified the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt as the collective bargaining representative for the pilots of north american.see ninth.the parties commenced negotiations for an initial collective bargaining agreement in april and negotiations continue to the present 
citing fundamental changes and turbulent times facing the airline industry,north american sent a memorandum to all employees on november,notifying them of its plans to cut costs and increase productivity in order to maintain operations north american announced that it would reduce costs by instituting for health premiums making changes to scheduling and compensation for flight crews,including changes to pilot scheduling and reducing senior management salaries,including those of the chief executive officer and chief operation officer.regarding the pilots,north american sought to achieve a percent reduction in its flight deck costs per block hour,in other words,its costs incurred in operating its aircraft as it relates to the pilots.north american could achieve these cost reductions either through scheduling changes designed to increase productivity or through wage cuts,though it considered the pilots cooperation necessary to execute effectively any scheduling changes.
north american discussed these plans and sought input from ibt during negotiations with the pilots on november and december,though it asserted a prerogative to institute changes unilaterally,irrespective of the pilots approval.after the parties negotiations in november and december,north american deemed the pilots to be unwilling to provide the necessary cooperation for a successful overhaul of the schedule.it therefore made the unilateral decision to reduce its pilot costs through wage reductions.ibt applied to the national mediation board for mediation services on december,and the board instituted mediation proceedings on december.
on december,north american issued another memorandum to its employees,updating and superceding its prior announcements with respect to its plan.with respect to its employees,north american announced a salary reduction for the chief executive officer and chief operation officer a reduction for other senior management and a moratorium on salary increases sharing of healthcare premiums flight attendant payroll reduction of through productivity increases and a freeze of flight attendant wage increases.with respect to the pilots,north american announced a wage reduction of a freeze of increases to hourly wage rates a reduction of the minimum monthly flight hour guarantee from to hours and an overtime flight hour wage rate reduction from to.
ibt filed this action on january,after the first of north american announced changes took effect.by its complaint,ibt alleged that north american violated its obligations under section,first and fourth of the rla,first and fourth by unilaterally altering the pilots rates of pay,rules,and working conditions after the parties had commenced negotiations regarding an initial collective bargaining agreement.ibt sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief from any unilateral alteration to the pilots working conditions and a return to the working conditions that existed prior to the commencement of negotiations.
after a hearing in july,the district court denied the motion for preliminary injunctive relief on september,on the ground that ibt failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits on either of its section claims.the district court ruled that section,first does not require the employer to maintain the status quo before the completion of an initial collective bargaining agreement.the court further held that section,first did not entitle ibt to an injunction to maintain the status quo the district court entered final judgment in favor of north american on november.
on appeal,ibt argues that north american violated its obligations under section,first when it unilaterally altered the rates of pay,rules and working conditions of its pilots in the midst of the parties collective bargaining negotiations,and that ibt was entitled to an injunction to require north american to maintain the status quo

congress initially enacted the rla,in to encourage collective bargaining by railroads and their employees in order to prevent,if possible,wasteful strikes and interruptions of interstate commerce.detroit toledo shore line united transp.union shore line,d.the rla has been amended multiple times since its passage into law,including an amendment in to include coverage of air carriers,see,though its essential structure has not been materially altered.
the supreme court has provided a succinct overview of the rla 
the act provides a detailed framework to facilitate the voluntary settlement of major disputes a party desiring to effect a change of rates of pay,rules,or working conditions must give advance written notice.the parties must confer,second,and if conference fails to resolve the dispute,either or both may invoke the services of the national mediation board,which may also proffer its services sua sponte if it finds a labor emergency to exist.first.if mediation fails,the board must endeavor to induce the parties to submit the controversy to binding arbitration,which can take place,however,only if both consent.first.if arbitration is rejected and the dispute threatens substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive any section of the country of essential transportation service,the mediation board shall notify the president,who may create an emergency board to investigate and report on the dispute.while the dispute is working its way through these stages,neither party may unilaterally alter the status quo.seventh,first.
shore line,at.quoting of trainmen jacksonville terminal,d.
there are four provisions in the rla that preclude the parties from unilaterally altering the status quo while the dispute is working its way through the stages described above.id.during the first stage,beginning when a party gives advance written notice of an intended change to an agreement,section provides that if the services of the mediation board are either requested or proffered,rates of pay,rules,or working conditions shall not be altered by the carrier until the controversy has been finally acted upon pursuant to section of the rla.
in the next phase,after mediation has failed and the parties have refused arbitration,section imposes a cooling off period in which no change shall be made in the rates of pay,rules,or working conditions or established practices in effect prior to the time the dispute arose.first.
the final phase occurs only if the president decides to create an emergency board to investigate and report on a situation that threatens essential transportation service.section provides that after the creation of such a board,and for thirty days after the board makes its report to the president,no change,except by agreement,shall be made by the parties to the controversy in the conditions out of which the dispute arose.
while the three status quo provisions described above relate to specific stages in the settlement of major disputes,section of the rla,which describes the general duties of carriers and employees,also contains a status quo provision.section,seventh precludes the parties from making unilateral changes in working conditions embodied in agreements except as provided in such agreements or through the process described in section,by providing notice of an intended change in agreements,and proceeding through the process described above.seventh.
the statutory section underlying ibt claim in this case,section,first,is also part of the section imposing general duties on carriers and employers.it states 
it shall be the duty of all carriers and employees to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay,rules,and working conditions,and to settle all disputes,whether arising out of the application of such agreements or otherwise,in order to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier growing out of any dispute between the carrier and the employees thereof.
first.under this section,the responsibility to exert every reasonable effort to make agreements commences before any agreement has been formed.id.however,section,first does not expressly impose any obligation on the parties to maintain the status quo during this time frame.
as this review indicates,the rla detailed framework to facilitate the voluntary settlement of major disputes,shore line,at.internal quotation marks omitted,focuses primarily on the period after a collective bargaining agreement is in place,when either the carrier or employees intend to make changes to the existing agreement.williams jacksonville terminal established a critical difference between the and time frames,namely,that the rla does not require a carrier to maintain the status quo before an initial collective bargaining agreement has been completed.at.
in williams,a union argued that after the employees had selected a certified union representative and requested a conference with the railroad to negotiate an agreement,the rla prohibited the railroad from unilaterally imposing a wage plan that would make tips earned by railroad porters a component of their wages.see at.the supreme court rejected this argument,stating that the institution of negotiations for collective bargaining does not change the authority of the carrier to alter working conditions.id.at.the supreme court explained that the rla status quo provisions set forth in section and section,seventh are aimed at preventing changes in conditions previously fixed by collective bargaining agreements.id.at.see also id.at.holding section is phrased so as to leave no doubt that only agreements reached after collective bargaining are covered by the status quo requirements.further,williams rejected the union argument that section,first imposed a status quo requirement before a collective bargaining agreement was formed 
because the carrier was,by the rla,placed under the duty to exert every effort to make collective agreements,it does not follow that pending those negotiations,where no collective bargaining agreements are or have been in effect,the carrier can not exercise its authority to arrange its business relations with its employees in the manner shown in this record.
id.at.in sum,williams leaves no doubt that the rla does not require the parties to maintain the status quo during the time frame before a collective bargaining agreement has been completed,regardless of whether negotiations have been instituted.
the supreme court addressed a different issue in shore line,namely,the scope of the status quo provisions of the rla during the time frame after a collective bargaining agreement had been completed.at.in shore line,a railroad notified a union with which it already had an existing collective bargaining agreement that it planned to require certain employees to report to work in new locations.id.at.the parties had not addressed the work location issue in the existing agreement,and the union proposed an amendment to cover the changed working conditions.id.while the parties dispute was pending before the national mediation board,the railroad attempted to impose its intended changes unilaterally.id.at.the railroad argued that the status quo provision of section precluded changes only to those conditions already set forth in an agreement and that it was therefore free to change any working conditions that were not expressly embodied in the existing collective bargaining agreement.id.at.
the court disagreed.the court reasoned that i t would be virtually impossible to include all working conditions in a agreement,and when a union moves to amend an agreement to address a disputed working condition,it would defeat the purpose of the rla to allow the carrier to make a change unilaterally to the very working condition under dispute.id.at.reading section in conjunction with the implicit status quo requirement in the obligation imposed upon both parties by first,to exert every reasonable effort to settle disputes without interruption to interstate commerce,id.at.quoting first,the court concluded that section prohibition on changing the status quo extended to all working conditions that comprised the status quo,not just those working conditions already embodied in the collective bargaining agreement.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion,the court rejected the railroad argument that such an interpretation of section would conflict with williams.the court noted that williams did not address the question raised in shore line,whether after a collective bargaining agreement had been completed,section status quo provision applied to all working conditions or just the working conditions documented in the existing collective bargaining agreement.id.at.rather,williams considered the period before a collective bargaining agreement had been completed,and considered whether the rla status quo provisions were even applicable in that time frame.id.at.as the court summed it up,
it is readily apparent that williams involved only the question of whether the status quo requirement of applied at all.the court in williams therefore never reached the question of the scope of the status quo requirement in a dispute,such as the one before the court today,to which that requirement concededly applies.
id.accordingly,the court concluded,williams statement that the status quo provisions of section apply only where there is a change in agreements,williams,at,merely clarified the time frame in which section applies.williams did not conflict with shore line holding that once the status quo provisions are applicable,they apply to all working conditions,not just those embodied in agreements.shore line,at.
in this case,no collective bargaining agreement has been completed.underwilliams,neither the rla in general,nor section,first in particular,imposes a status quo requirement on the employer during this time frame,regardless whether negotiations have been instituted.nevertheless,ibt raises a number of arguments as to why section,first,read together with other provisions of the rla,precludes north american from making any changes in the status quo once negotiations have commenced.
ibt begins by noting that the status quo provisions in the rla are not limited to the time frame by their terms.for example,the plain language of section provides that the employer may not alter the status quo i n every case where the services of the mediation board have been requested by either party,or said board has proffered its services.similarly,ibt argues that neither section,first providing that if mediation fails,the parties will maintain the status quo for days after notice of the failure nor section providing that after the emergency board makes its report to the president,the parties will maintain the status quo for days expressly limit their respective status quo requirement to the period after a collective bargaining agreement has been completed.accordingly,ibt argues,these status quo
