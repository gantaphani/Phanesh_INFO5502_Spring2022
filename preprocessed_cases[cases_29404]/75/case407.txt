plaintiff landowners appeal the january,order of the united states district court for the northern district of ohio,which dismissed plaintiffs,and state law claims against defendant public officials and railroad companies for actions taken relative to plaintiffs real property.the district court held that plaintiffs action was not ripe in part,barred by the doctrine in part,and merited younger abstention in part.
for the reasons which follow,we affirm the district court dismissal of this case.
backgrounda.substantive facts 
plaintiffs are landowners along the old milan canal in erie county,ohio.the old milan canal extended,during its period of use,for miles from the town of milan,ohio northward to the mouth of the huron river,at which point the huron river emptied into lake erie.plaintiffs edwin coles,lisa coles,vincent otrusina,robert bickley,warren jones,and buffalo prairie,llc were all parties to a prior state court proceeding in which erie county metroparks sought a declaratory judgment that plaintiffs possessed no property interest in a foot wide corridor along the old canal.metroparks claimed to be the valid assignee of an infinite duration leasehold interest in that corridor and was interested in transforming the corridor into a recreational trail.the state court proceeding ultimately found that metroparks did possess a valid leasehold interest,and further defined the property subject to the leasehold as follows 
the description of the leased property in the lease unambiguously describes it as consisting of all lands then owned by the milan canal company within a foot wide corridor from approximately the intersection of maine and union streets in the village of milan northerly to the north of the mouth of the huron river.the only lands owned by the milan canal company at the time the lease was executed lay within the boundaries of the kneeland townsend property and the ebeneser merry property,neither of which lay north of lock.therefore,the leased property extends from the southern terminus of the old milan canal at or near the southerly end of the milan canal basin in the village of milan to its northerly terminus at the huron river at the former location of lock on premises now owned by wikel farms,immediately north of mason road in section,milan township,erie county.
at emphasis added.
plaintiff wikel farms was not a party to the prior state court proceeding.rather,wikel farms is currently involved in an appropriation action brought by erie county metroparks against wikel farms in state court,which involves portions of wikel farms property along the old milan canal.metroparks initiated that action in and,pursuant to ohio law,deposited in escrow at the onset of litigation,which is metroparks estimated valuation of the disputed property.wikel farms places a much higher valuation on the property,that of.that suit is not yet resolved.
procedural history 
the state court judgment against all plaintiffs save wikel farms,establishing metroparks leasehold interest in the milan canal corridor,was final in september.metroparks then proceeded to take actions to develop the recreational trail.plaintiffs brought the instant suit on october,in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio against defendants jonathan granville of erie metroparks,the erie metroparks board of park commissioners,wheeling lake erie railway,and norfolk southern.plaintiffs sought redress under,and for violations of their rights under the fourth,fifth,and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.plaintiffs alleged that in their efforts to develop the recreational trail,defendants laid claim to property beyond that found by ohio state courts to fall within metroparks valid leasehold interest.plaintiffs further alleged that defendants wrongfully destroyed plaintiffs personal property.plaintiffs also apparently sought a judgment that plaintiffs were the rightful owners to all property under dispute with defendants in the federal action.see at,fifth count,quiet title plaintiffs are the owners of and are in possession of and otherwise have and claim a superior title and interest to that of defendants in the real property described above.plaintiffs also sought damages in tort for slander of title.
after filing their answer,defendants filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b with the district court,arguing that the district court either lacked or should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the case because the doctrine precluded plaintiffs collateral attack on the validity of metroparks leasehold interest those lands allegedly not within the leasehold interest represented a new takings claim for which plaintiffs had not sought redress through state courts,and the issue was therefore not yet ripe for federal judicial review and the claims with respect to wikel farms the only plaintiff not a party to the leasehold litigation were pending in state court proceedings which antedated the instant federal actions,and therefore younger abstention was merited.the district court agreed,dismissing the case without prejudice on january.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in dismissing plaintiffs claims,in part,on the basis of the doctrine because plaintiffs are seeking only to enforce the limitation on the scope of metroparks leasehold interest as decided in the prior litigation with respect to lands allegedly not adjudicated as falling under metroparks lease,plaintiffs takings claim is ripe for review and the district court erred when it chose to dismiss the claims asserted by plaintiff wikel farms in lieu of holding them in abeyance under younger.
analysisa.plaintiffs do not pursue claims which implicate the doctrine 
the district court dismissed plaintiffs case,in part,because the court found that barred federal jurisdiction over some of plaintiffs claims.because we find that plaintiffs case as presented to both the district court and this court does not implicate,we hold that is inapplicable to plaintiffs allegations on appeal.to the extent that the district court decision may have improperly relied on as a basis to dismiss plaintiffs case,we find such error harmless in light of our conclusion that plaintiffs takings claims are not yet ripe for review.this court can affirm the district court on any grounds supported by the record.city mgmt.chem,cir.
the doctrine generally 
plaintiffs argue to this court that they are not seeking review of the state court decision that adjudicated the validity and extent of metroparks leasehold interests.rather,plaintiffs allege on appeal that defendants are misreading the state court decision to give them more property than the decision actually held was rightfully possessed by defendants.in contrast,defendants argue that plaintiffs instant action is an attempted around the state leasehold decision and contend that bars their suit.
is a doctrine with only limited application.the doctrine originates from two supreme court decisions,which were rendered years apart.see rooker fidelity trust.court of appeals feldman,d.in both cases the plaintiffs challenged the validity of state court decisions by filing suit in federal district court.in rooker,the plaintiff asked the district court to render the state court judgment against him null and void.see rooker,at.in feldman,the plaintiffs filed suit against the actual state court that had rejected the plaintiffs applications to practice law.feldman,at.in both cases the supreme court dismissed the suits for lack of jurisdiction,reasoning that pursuant to,only the supreme court,and not the lower federal courts,enjoys appellate jurisdiction over state court decisions.see rooker,at.feldman,at.significantly,the feldman court reasoned that the plaintiffs could challenge the state rules themselves in federal court on constitutional grounds such a challenge would not be asking the district court to exercise appellate authority over a state court,but normal preclusion rules would still apply.id.at.see also todd weltman,weinberg reis,cir discussing the supreme court analysis in the rooker and feldman cases more extensively.the source of the plaintiffs alleged injury,then,was dispositive in feldman on the issue of jurisdiction,a distinction which the supreme court reiterated more than years later in exxon mobil saudi basic industries,d.
after the feldman decision,the lower federal courts began to invoke the doctrine in a variety of circumstances in which the federal and state courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction.because of inconsistencies between the circuits,the supreme court again explained the doctrine in exxon mobil,stating that the doctrine applied only to 
cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.does not otherwise override or supplant preclusion doctrine or augment the circumscribed doctrines that allow federal courts to stay or dismiss proceedings in deference to actions.
exxon mobil,at.exxon mobil dealt specifically with a case where there were parallel state and federal cases on the same issue.the court held that normal preclusion jurisprudence,not,would guide the federal court decision if the state court reached a decision first.id.in dicta,the supreme court also addressed the circumstance where the plaintiff initiated a federal claim after a state court decision,circumstances such as the case at bar 
nor does stop a district court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.if a federal plaintiff present s some independent claim,albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party,then there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion.

this circuit and other circuits have taken the supreme court guidance on the application of and applied the doctrine only when a plaintiff complains of injury from the state court judgment itself.in todd,at,this court rejected a defendant argument that precluded jurisdiction over a plaintiff federal suit that complained that the defendant had lied in an affidavit submitted as the basis for a prior state court garnishment proceeding.we reasoned that the plaintiff was alleging injuries from the defendant deception,and not from the state court judgment itself,which had found that the defendant affidavit was valid.id.we further noted that the rules of preclusion would guide the district court on remand regarding whether the plaintiff could properly litigate the affidavit validity in the federal action.id.
other circuits have agreed with this court approach.see davani.dot,cir exxon teaches that the doctrine applies only when the loser in state court files suit in federal district court seeking redress for an injury allegedly caused by the state court decision itself.because davani suit does not challenge the state court decision,and it instead seeks redress for an injury allegedly caused by appellees,the doctrine does not apply galibois fisher,wl cir.lexis,at exxon requires this court to examine whether the state court loser who files suit in federal court seeks redress for an injury caused by a state court decision itself or an injury caused by the defendant.hoblock albany county bd.of elections,cir finding implicated only when a plaintiff asked the federal district court to review the validity of a state court judgment.the tenth circuit summarized the difference between a suit barred by and normal preclusion principles 
appellate type of judicial action barred by of a review of the proceedings already conducted by the lower tribunal to determine whether it reached its result in accordance with law.when,in contrast,the second court tries a matter anew and reaches a conclusion contrary to a judgment by the first court,without concerning itself with the bona fides of the prior judgment which may or may not have been a lawful judgment under the evidence and argument presented to the first court,it is not conducting appellate review,regardless of whether compliance with the second judgment would make it impossible to comply with the first judgment.in this latter situation the conflict between the two judgments is to be resolved under preclusion doctrine,not.

plaintiffs arguments below and to this court 
in response to defendants motion to dismiss,in part,under,plaintiffs argued to the district continue to argue to this their dispute in federal court concerns property outside of the land adjudicated by the state courts to fall within metroparks leasehold interests.plaintiffs allege that defendants are taking property that the state court held was not within metroparks leasehold interest.having constrained their case by their own argument,plaintiffs seek not to throw out a state court judgment,but to enforce the judgment,because defendants are allegedly exceeding the scope of their property interests under the state court decision.this is precisely the type of claim which is not barred by because plaintiffs are not asking the lower federal courts to exercise appellate review over a state court decision.see part,supra.what plaintiffs are asking this court to do is to interpret the state court,decide between plaintiffs construction and defendants construction of a state court judgment as it pertains to the boundaries of metroparks leasehold.merely requiring a federal court to understand what it is that a state court decided does not implicate,but rather normal preclusion principles and rules of construction.
defendants continue to argue on appeal,however,that precludes jurisdiction over plaintiffs case.in making this argument,defendants contend that plaintiffs suit is an attempted around the state court decision on the extent of metroparks leasehold interest.whether this is true or not,however,does not make more or less applicable.applies only when a plaintiff asserts injury from the state court judgment.see exxon mobil,at.in the instant case,plaintiffs allege that defendants are the ones injuring plaintiffs plaintiffs do not allege that their injury arises from the state court judgment itself or even as a result of the state court judgment.we acknowledge that whether or not defendants are,in fact,injuring plaintiffs depends,in part,on the parties respective property interests.this is an issue which was litigated,at least in part,in the state court leasehold proceedings.should the federal courts need to reach the merits of plaintiffs claims,however,normal preclusion principles would apply to assist us in deciding what has been settled between the parties and what has not been so settled id.
plaintiffs takings claims are not yet ripe for federal judicial review 
standard of review 
whether this court has jurisdiction is a question of law that this court reviews de novo.see,kruse village of chagrin falls,cir.
the extent of metroparks valid leasehold interest is not dispositive on appeal 
plaintiffs allege that the state court language noting that t he only lands owned by the milan canal company at the time the lease was executed lay within the boundaries of the kneeland townsend property and the ebeneser merry property limits metroparks leasehold interest to those lands along the canal path which formerly lay within the townsend and merry property grants.at.plaintiffs further argue that the evidence before the ohio courts was that these grants did not create a contiguous tract along the miles of canal to which defendants now claim a right of possession.defendants counter,however,by noting the language in the ohio decision that states the leased property extends from the southern terminus of the old milan canal at or near the southerly end of the milan canal basin in the village of milan to its northerly terminus at the huron river at the former location of lock.at.defendants argue that this language very clearly indicates that defendants have a valid leasehold interest along the entire length of the canal between the points noted in the state court decision.
if defendants are correct,and the property plaintiffs put at issue in this case was adjudicated as within metroparks leasehold interest by the ohio courts,then res judicata would prevent us from reaching a different conclusion than that reached by the ohio courts on this very same issue,and plaintiffs case with the exception of wikel farms was properly dismissed.if plaintiffs are correct,however,in their belief that the property at issue here was not adjudicated as within metroparks leasehold interest,then plaintiffs claims to this court devolve to new takings allegations.that is,plaintiffs allege defendants are unconstitutionally taking plaintiffs property by invading lands beyond the scope of metroparks leasehold interests.as discussed infra,before seeking relief in federal courts,plaintiffs alleging an unconstitutional taking by a local government entity must first seek compensation for the taking through state measures.because plaintiffs in the instant action have not done this,plaintiffs case is not yet ripe for review.
takings claims in federal courts 
a.the supreme court requires claimants to pursue any reasonable,certain,and adequate procedures in state court prior to seeking federal judicial review 
the takings clause does not prohibit the government from taking private property it prohibits the government from taking private property without just compensation.williamson county reg l planning comm hamilton bank,d.a takings claim is not ripe for review unless a property owner is denied just compensation.id.because the fifth amendment proscribes takings without just compensation,no constitutional violation occurs until just compensation has been denied.waste,of metro.gov t of nashville davidson county,cir hammond baldwin,cir four seasons apartment city of mayfield heights,cir see also eide sarasota county,cir a fifth amendment just compensation claim is not ripe until the landowner has pursued the available state procedures to obtain just compensation.under this reasoning,if a state provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation,the property owner can not claim a violation of the just compensation clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation.williamson,at.in other words,a wronged party satisfies its duty to seek just compensation by pursuing reasonable,certain,and adequate procedures for obtaining compensation.id.at.quoting reg l rail reorganization act cases,d.
ohio now has a reasonable,certain,and adequate procedure for takings claimants to pursue in ohio state courts 
ohio does not have an inverse condemnation or other direct,statutory cause of action for plaintiffs seeking just compensation for a taking.rather,ohio law provides a statutory mechanism by which the government actor seeking to take property is under a duty to bring an appropriation proceeding against the landowner.see ohio shemo city of mayfield heights,ohio.a property owner who believes that his property has been taken in the absence of such an appropriation proceeding may initiate a mandamus action in ohio court to force the government actor into the correct appropriation proceeding id.this circuit has therefore focused on whether ohio writ of mandamus provides a reasonable,certain,and adequate provision for obtaining compensation pursuant to supreme court direction.
this circuit first addressed this issue in silver franklin township,cir.the silver court was presented with a regulatory takings claim and found ohio writ of mandamus procedure to be an adequate mechanism for pursuing just compensation.id.at.just four years later,however,this court appeared to reason differently in kruse,a physical takings case 
we hold that ohio affords no reasonable,certain and adequate provision for obtaining compensation after private property is taken by public authorities without following the mandatory pretaking appropriation procedures set out in ohio.ohio decisional law in this area is anything but certain.ohio has no statutory provision for relief under the circumstances of this case.the fact that the state courts recognize an action in mandamus,where the state has no mandated procedures governing inverse condemnation,can not be equated to a reasonable,certain and adequate provision for obtaining compensation,after the property has been physically taken in violation of the appropriations statutes.an action for the extraordinary writ of mandamus is,at best,a procedure which must be invoked in the absence of any statutory framework in an attempt to obtain wholly equitable relief for an injury already inflicted.
although the silver and kruse holdings appear contradictory,subsequent panels of this court have reconciled the cases by limiting each to its facts.this approach applies the rule in silver to regulatory takings claims,but applies the kruse rule to physical takings claims.see buckles columbus mun.airport,cir,tri corp mgmt.praznik,cir.the buckles decision noted further language in the kruse decision in support of the view that physical takings implicate different procedures 
kruse did not discuss silver,but it did distinguish regulatory from physical takings in arriving at its holding,and this distinction reconciles the two cases 
in regulatory cases,where the government has fulfilled its obligation to provide notice to the property owner,it may be fair to place the burden of making the next move on the landowner.it may make sense to require landowners to pursue relief through administrative appeals and the mandatory injunction process when the landowners know in advance that the government is planning action that threatens their ownership of their property since there are generally numerous opportunities available to landowners to be heard and to attempt to prevent a proposed zoning ordinance from taking effect,or to reach a compromise with the authorities that permits some alternative use of the land.
kruse,at.in contrast,where the landowner simply one day finds his land physically invaded and his title transferred against his will,and yet the government refuses to pay up despite explicit requests,he need not go through dickensian formalities to confirm the government obvious intentions.
buckles.at.
additional language in the kruse decision sheds further light on why the kruse panel found the ohio mandamus action to be an inadequate remedy for physical takings at the time 
the ohio supreme court has very recently stated that a landowner who has been deprived of his property may bring an action in mandamus to require the government to institute appropriation proceedings pursuant to ohio appropriation of property statute.see levin city of sheffield lake ohio.there,the court reviewed some of its prior decisions,which indicated that appropriation proceedings may be compelled through mandamus,but also reiterated the stringent requirements for issuance of the extraordinary writ and explained that prior to issuance of the writ to compel the commencement of appropriation proceedings,the issue of whether the petitioner property had been appropriated had first to be determined by the court in which the writ was requested.id.
levin,however,was not decided until,well after the kruses had begun their heretofore fruitless attempt to obtain compensation from the village for its taking of their property.and levin cited cases which have held that mandamus is the vehicle for compelling appropriation proceedings by public authorities,are all cases in which the court addressed a taking by the state,through the action of the director of highways.
the levin court did not address at all its decision in city of worthington carskadon,ohio,a case which all of the decisions levin relied upon,in which the city of worthington took possession of property pursuant to a quick take ordinance,prior to determination of value by a jury.there,the court held that the proper remedies for illegal entry upon one property are criminal trespass and civil damages against the individuals entering,and injunction against the city and its agents.at.
none of these cases even mentions the remedy of inverse condemnation.the claim by the village that solly city of toledo,ohio,holds that ohio has such a remedy is
