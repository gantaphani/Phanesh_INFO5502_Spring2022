background 
this case has a long and complicated history that largely defines the issues on review.initially,in the city was a party to a complaint filed with the puc asking the commission to deem the wine train a public utility.the complaint reveals helena and others were concerned with the environmental impact of the wine train proposed passenger service.the interested parties claimed the wine train was subject to the provisions of the california environmental quality act ceqa and sought an order asserting the puc jurisdiction over the wine train proposed passenger service.at that time,there was some uncertainty regarding issues of state and federal jurisdiction.some of the original jurisdictional issues were resolved with the enactment of public resources code section added by stats,ch,which designated the puc as the lead agency for environmental review of the wine train operations pub.resources code,subd.a.
in march,the puc certified a final environmental impact report for the wine train project,which contemplated winery stops along the right of way and a minimum of one station,with shuttle service to wineries.in june,the puc approved the wine train project subject to the mitigation implementation program adopted in its decision,which provided for extensive mitigation measures,including limited days and limited hours of operation.see city of helena napa valley wine train,d,wl nvwt i.this decision did not make any findings that the wine train was a public utility.however,the puc did make a finding that t he interurban operation of wine train between napa and helena,including the stops described in the proposed project,is one of statewide,rather than merely municipal concern.id.at.although not stated as a conclusion of law,the puc stated that it viewed its authority over the wine train as being concurrent with local agencies.id.at.in july,the city applied for rehearing.in november,the puc denied the petition for rehearing,but clarified its position on jurisdiction.see city of helena napa valley wine train,d,wl nvwt ii.specifically,the puc stated its authority was paramount to that of any local agency.ibid.again,there were no express findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding the wine train status as a public utility.
in january,the city filed a complaint with the puc,alleging that the wine train was not operating as a public utility,and that,even if the wine train were to operate in the manner authorized by the puc,it would not be a public utility.in its complaint the city alleged that the wine train was demanding that the city approve a station in downtown helena.in august,the puc dismissed the complaint on the basis that the city was seeking an advisory opinion.see city of helena napa valley wine train,cal,wl,cal.puc lexis nvwt iii the puc decision in nvwt iii is the first of four orders challenged by the city.the puc deemed the complaint as essentially relitigating nvwt i and nvwt ii.following the issuance of nvwt iii,the city filed an application for rehearing of the dismissal,the denial of which is also one of the contested orders in the instant action.
in september,the city filed a petition for modification of nvwt ii the city petition asked the puc to designate the wine train as an excursion train not subject to regulation as a public utility.specifically,the city asked the puc to declare that the wine train passenger service was not transportation within the meaning of public utilities code section and,thus,the wine train was not a public utility under section the city also asked the puc to delete language relating to the puc paramount jurisdiction,and to insert language that the puc authority was limited to the role of lead agency for the purposes of environmental review,and to conclude that the local agencies had paramount jurisdiction.
in june,the puc issued a decision regarding the city request for modification.see city of helena napa valley wine train,cal,wl,cal.puc lexis nvwt iv.although the puc found that the city failed to make a case that the underlying facts had changed in any material way,it modified nvwt i and nvwt ii and found that the wine train was not a public utility.relying in part on golden gate scenic steamship lines,public utilities com.cal d,golden gate scenic steamship,the puc found the wine train did not provide transportation,because it did not provide transportation.in golden gate scenic steamship,supra,cal d at page,the court held that ferries carrying passengers in a continuous loop around the san francisco bay,without stopping at any other point,and returning to the point of embarkation did not constitute transportation.the supreme court defined transportation as the taking up of persons or property at some point and putting them down at another.ibid.the puc also relied on two of its own decisions in determining the wine train was not a public utility.the puc cited to re california western railroad,d,wl california western railroad,in which it declared that the skunk train,providing an excursion service between fort bragg and willits,was not a public utility.the puc also cited to western travel plaza,d,wl western travel,in which it held sightseeing is essentially a luxury service,as contrasted with regular route,transportation between cities,commuter service,or service ibid.
in nvwt iv,the puc made the following findings of fact.wine train round trip excursion service can not be distinguished from the skunk train excursion service in any meaningful way.wine train proposal to disembark tourists for more sightseeing to connect with day trip shuttle tours is not a type of regular route,transportation between cities,commuter service,or service.wine train passenger excursion service does not constitute regulated transportation and in providing such service,wine train is not functioning as a public utility.the incidental public utility purpose,if any,of the proposed helena station is de minimis.
in july,the wine train filed an application for rehearing of nvwt iv based largely on procedural grounds.in january,the puc granted rehearing of nvwt iv and reversed itself,holding that the wine train is a public utility.see city of helena napa valley wine train,cal,wl,cal.puc lexis nvwt v nvwt v is the second decision challenged in the current action.this decision made no express findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding the wine train public utility status.in this decision,the puc stated,among other things,that it believed its opinion in california western railroad the skunk train was in error and that its application was not supported by the record in the wine train case.id.at.the puc also found there was little in the record to support the finding that the proposed project,which contemplated stops and use of the train as an alternative to automobile travel,is not transportation.id.at.the puc,however,did not reference portions of the record that supported a finding that the wine train engaged in transportation,other than to state that the proposed project contemplates stops.ibid.additionally,despite its holding in western travel,that sightseeing is not a public utility function,the puc stated the fact that the wine train is described as a recreational,excursion service does not mean that it does not function as a public utility.id.at.
in february,the city filed for rehearing of nvwt v,on the grounds that the decision was contrary to law and the findings were not supported by substantial evidence.in october,a divided commission denied the city petition for rehearing.see city of helena napa valley wine train,cal,wl,cal.puc lexis nvwt vi nvwt vi is
