these consolidated appeals from the district court forfeiture order present the novel question whether the lawful possessor of seized currency who has article iii standing to contest the seizure in a civil forfeiture proceeding is the proper party to make an eighth amendment excessive fines challenge to the amount forfeited.the majority of the panel answers this question in the affirmative.each of the parties asserts other challenges to the district court order.eytan mayzel,the lawful possessor,argues that the district court erred by employing the incorrect standard of proof due to the enactment of the civil asset forfeiture reform act of granting summary judgment against him on all issues except the eighth amendment claim ordering even partial forfeiture of the seized funds as a violation of the excessive fines clause and denying his request for attorney fees under the equal access to justice act.eric amiel,an individual who asserted ownership of the seized funds more than nine months past the deadline,argues that the district court abused its discretion in striking his untimely and unverified claim.the government,in turn,asserts that the district court should have ordered forfeiture of the seized funds in their entirety.
for the reasons we explain below,we hold that the district court employed the correct standard of proof,appropriately granted summary judgment,properly denied attorney fees,and did not abuse its discretion in denying amiel untimely,unverified claim for the funds.the majority further holds that the forfeited amount was not constitutionally excessive.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm the district court order.
background 
on february,eytan mayzel,a israeli citizen,was about to board a virgin atlantic flight from los angeles international airport to london,england when he was stopped by united states customs service senior inspector roberto uscanga,who identified himself as a government official.inspector uscanga explained to mayzel that federal law requires persons transporting any amount exceeding out of the united states to declare the currency by completing a form.mayzel responded that he was in the united states to visit family and friends,and was carrying only.he then handed inspector uscanga a bundle of cash which was later determined to amount to.inspector uscanga noticed a bulge under mayzel jacket,which mayzel removed at his request,revealing a blue shoulder bag.mayzel handed the bag to inspector uscanga,who found inside what was later determined to be in cash sealed in ten clear plastic zipper bags.even before counting the money,inspector uscanga was able to ascertain that the sum exceeded the reporting limit.accordingly,he handed mayzel customs form,printed in english,and requested that mayzel complete it in compliance with the reporting requirement.mayzel refused to do so,informing inspector uscanga in english that he wished to speak with his attorney,that he was not obligated to complete the form,and that he did not speak english 
at this point,mayzel was detained for questioning.the luggage for which he possessed baggage claim tickets was removed from the plane and searched.the search revealed a roll of plastic shrink film,a heat gun,and a heat sealer machine items often used in the packaging of illegal drugs.mayzel refused to speak with the customs investigators thereafter,invoking his miranda rights.
in a bench trial in the district court for the central district of california,mayzel was convicted of knowingly making a false statement,in violation of.on september,mayzel was sentenced to days imprisonment and ordered to pay a special assessment of no fine was ordered because the district court determined that mayzel did not have the ability to pay.the district court acquitted mayzel of attempting to transport unreported currency over out of the united states,reasoning that to violate this statute a person must make a false report in writing.
ii.procedural history 
meanwhile,on march,the united states customs service notified mayzel of the seizure of the,informing him that if he wished to contest the proposed forfeiture of these funds,he would be required as a claimant to submit a petition in support of his claim and a cost bond.mayzel did so on april,stating that he was a lawful possessor of the currency,but failing to identify its owner.the matter was then referred to the united states attorney office,which filed a forfeiture complaint in the central district of california on august,and gave notice of the action by sending certified letters to all parties known to have an interest in the defendant,mayzel and by publishing three notices in the los angeles daily journal.in response to these notices,the government received only one mayzel,via his attorney,michael galey,on september.during a mandatory meeting on november,galey told assistant united states attorney janet hudson that mayzel had obtained the seized funds from several friends and relatives.he did not provide their names or addresses,however,even after hudson told him that persons who illegally transport money for purposes often persuade innocent friends and relatives to perjure themselves by claiming the seized money as their own.a few weeks later,galey submitted a mandatory preliminary list of witnesses and documentary evidence to be offered at trial,identifying mayzel as the only potential witness and listing no documents.
after several postponements,each at the request of mayzel attorneys,the government deposed mayzel on march.the day before mayzel deposition,his new attorney,eric honig,told the government by letter that the owner of the currency was amiel eric levy,and provided a copy of amiel business checking account statement.thereafter,mayzel asserted in his deposition that amiel was the owner of the currency.mayzel testified that his uncle had taken him to meet amiel,a family friend from a small town in israel,at a coffee shop in bonita,california near san diego.according to mayzel,amiel asked mayzel to deliver a blue bag containing in amiel sister in israel.mayzel further testified that he had opened the bag and seen the money,but had not asked any questions about its provenance he had told amiel that he did not wish to be responsible if anything happened to the money.
at his deposition,mayzel was also questioned about his travel plans both before his arrest from israel to the united states and within the united states and his aborted travel plans when he was detained from the united states to london and thereafter.much of his testimony was demonstrably at odds with the travel agency records that the government subpoenaed,including the fact that when mayzel was detained in los angeles,supposedly on his way to deliver the funds to amiel sister in israel,he did not possess any tickets or reservations for travel to israel.
thereafter,amiel submitted a declaration stating that he was the owner of the seized funds,was a family friend of the mayzels,and had obtained the defendant currency as follows 
i built a store in san diego in.the building was lost in a fire,and i received money from the insurance company.i then purchased a second store from yosi parpara,to whom i paid a total of.i later sold the second store to my,who paid me approximately in cash.i then asked mayzel to bring the cash from the sale,plus more,to my sister in israel.
because of the declaration lack of specificity,names of businesses,names of persons,addresses,dates,the government could verify very few of these assertions.the government next attempted to depose amiel.
mayzel moved for summary judgment claiming that the government lacked probable cause to seize the defendant currency a forfeiture of any of the currency would be an excessive fine in violation of the eighth amendment and he was an innocent owner.honig informed the government that he wished to wait until after the court decided the summary judgment motion before scheduling amiel deposition.on august,the district court,sua sponte,granted summary judgment in favor of the government on the issues of probable cause and the applicability of the innocent owner defense,but reopened discovery on the eighth amendment issue.united states currency,d.
on august,amiel filed an untimely claim and answer in the forfeiture action,but failed to move for leave to file or to submit a declaration explaining his untimeliness.on the government motion,the district court struck amiel claim and answer on october,for failure to comply with the procedural and jurisdictional requirements of supplemental admiralty and maritime rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.the court declined to exercise its discretion to entertain the late claim,writing s ince amiel was aware of the seizure in early march and the prejudice to the government would be great if amiel claim and answer were to stand,the government motion is granted.
meanwhile,the government and amiel counsel failed to schedule amiel deposition before the eighth amendment hearing occurred,due to scheduling difficulties on both sides.as a result,no new evidence was submitted at the hearing.the district court determined that forfeiture of the entire would constitute an excessive fine under the eighth amendment,reducing the forfeited amount to.mayzel,amiel,and the government timely appealed.
iii.standard of proof 
mayzel first argues that the government should have borne the heightened initial burden of proof set forth in the civil asset forfeiture reform act of,a,stat,codified at c cafra raising government initial evidentiary burden from showing probable cause for the forfeiture to demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that forfeiture is warranted.cafra was enacted on april,and provided that it would apply to any forfeiture proceeding commenced on or after the date that is days after the date of the enactment of this act.id,stat.at.because this case was commenced within this period,cafra does not apply.united states in currency,cir cafra does not apply to any case pending at the time of the act effective date.therefore,the district court applied the correct standard of proof.
iv.forfeitability 
mayzel next asserts that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against him on the issue of forfeitability because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to his lack of english proficiency,which he contends would show that he did not knowingly violate the currency reporting statute.we review de novo a district court grant of partial summary judgment.delta sav.bank united states,cir,cert.denied,d.
mayzel argument fails because it rests on a misapprehension of the knowledge requirement in the reporting statute.we have held that t he only knowledge requirement in is that the person know that he or she is transporting more than the statutory amount of currency out of the country.united states v.one hundred thousand dollars in united states currency,cir footnote omitted our reading of the plain language of the statutory provisions does not include knowledge of the reporting requirement as an element for forfeiture.accord united states thousand nine hundred eighty dollars in canadian currency,cir,cert.denied,d.
mayzel does not contest that he knew he was transporting more than his offer of proof as to his lack of english proficiency went only to the question whether he knew he was required to report it.thus,mayzel raised no genuine issue of material fact regarding the defendant currency forfeitability and summary judgment was proper.
amiel untimely claim 
nor did the district court abuse its discretion in striking amiel untimely claim.reasoning that amiel was aware of the forfeiture proceedings for several months before filing a claim,the district court ruled that permitting the untimely claim would be at odds with the purpose of the claim deadline.civil in rem forfeitures are governed by the supplemental rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims of the federal rules of civil procedure.united states roundhill drive,cir.at the time,supplemental rule c provided that t he claimant of a property that is the subject of an action in rem shall file a claim within days after process has been executed,or within such additional time as may be allowed by the court.supp.admiralty.cases c we review a district court decision whether to consider an untimely claim under supplemental admiralty and maritime rule c for abuse of discretion.roundhill drive,at.
amiel claim was undeniably late.in in rem cases,seizure of the res and the subsequent publication or service of notice of the seizure constitutes service of process.see republic bank of miami united states,d.the seizure of the defendant currency occurred on august.the newspaper relevant notices with respect to amiel,who was not known to the government at the time of the published on september,september,and october.thus,absent the court leave,amiel claim should have been filed by october.he did not,however,file any claim until august,over nine months later.
amiel argues that the district court could still have accepted his late claim,and in this he is correct.supplemental rule c permits district courts to enlarge the time for filing a claim.supp.admiralty.cases c claims outside the filing window may be filed within such additional time as may be allowed by the court.although we have held that nothing in the rule imposes a time limit on the exercise of the district court discretion,we have also held that the court discretion is not unbounded.it should only exercise its discretion to grant additional time where the goals underlying the time restriction and the verification requirement are not thwarted.united states yukon delta houseboat,cir.
in united states united states currency,cir,we identified certain factors that the district court should consider in ruling on an untimely rule c claim when the claimant became aware of the currency seizure,whether the united states attorney may have encouraged the delay,and the decedent illness and death during this period,which may have caused the estate delay in filing,at.however,we have never exhaustively listed the factors that a district court should weigh when considering an untimely petition.both the fourth and seventh circuits have also adopted what appear to be nonexclusive lists of factors for deciding whether to grant leave to file an untimely claim these lists are not dissimilar.the fourth circuit factors are based on the traditional excusable neglect standard 
when the claimant became aware of the seizure,whether the claimant was properly served,whether the government would be prejudiced,whether the government encouraged the delay or misguided the claimant,whether the claimant informed the government and the court of his interest before the deadline,whether the claimant had expended resources preparing for trial,the claimant good faith,the claimant health problems,whether the government has complied with procedural rules,and whether the claimant was acting pro se.
united states borromeo,cir.the seventh circuit relies on slightly different factors,perhaps more suited to analyzing situations in which the late claim is potentially fraudulent 
the time at which the claimant became aware of the seizure,whether the government encouraged the delay,the reasons proffered for the delay,whether the claimant has advised the court and the government of its interest in the defendant property before the claim deadline,whether the government would be prejudiced by allowing the late filing,the sufficiency of the pleadings in meeting the basic requirements of the verified claim,and whether the claimant timely petitioned for an enlargement of time.
united states in united states funds,citing united states currency in the amount of,cir,aff,cir 
several factors identified by the fourth and seventh circuits,as well as our own precedent,provide guidance here.amiel was aware of the forfeiture proceedings at least as far back as march,when he submitted his declaration in support of mayzel claim,but made no good faith effort to submit his own claim until august.the government did not encourage the delay in amiel filing in fact,for over a year it sought diligently,but unsuccessfully,to discover the identity of the true owner of the defendant currency.it only learned of amiel from mayzel,the lawful possessor,the day before mayzel deposition.certainly,if amiel was the true owner,mayzel could have supplied the government with his name at a much earlier point.amiel himself proffered no reasons before the district court nor justify his delay in filing a claim.neither amiel nor mayzel informed the district court or the government of amiel alleged interest during the window.and at no time did amiel file a motion for an enlargement of time within which to file his claim.
moreover,amiel claim was insufficient for lack of proper verification by his attorney.see.supp.admiralty.cases c the claim shall be verified on oath or solemn affirmation if the claim is made on behalf of the person entitled to possession by an attorney,it shall state that the attorney is duly authorized to make the claim.compliance with this requirement is governed by local rule in the central district of california,which lists strict and specific requirements for claim verification by a party attorney.cal.admiralty.claims e v erification of a complaint may be made by an attorney who shall state the sources of the knowledge,information and belief contained in the complaint declare that the document verified is true state why verification is not made by the party and state that the affiant is authorized so to verify.counsel simple statement that she has been authorized by said claimants sic to file this claim,is plainly deficient.this omission is not insignificant.we have recognized that t he danger of false claims in these proceedings is substantial,requiring courts to demand more than conclusory or hearsay allegations of some interest in the forfeited property.baker united states,cir 
finally,accepting amiel late claim would have prejudiced the government.the government had litigated the case for nearly one year before amiel attempted to file his claim,and several issues had already been definitively resolved by the district court,such as the forfeitability of the currency and the applicability of the innocent owner defense.permitting the late claim would have resulted in costly duplicative litigation for the government,requiring it to litigate the same issues all over again.
vi.excessive fine 
the eighth amendment provides,excessive bail shall not be required,nor excessive fines imposed,nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.const.amend.viii.forfeitures are fines within the meaning of the eighth amendment if they constitute punishment for an offense.united states bajakajian,d.this is true even if the forfeiture is only punitive in part.id.at.because a civil forfeiture under is not limited by the extent of the government loss and is tied to the commission of a crime,it is punitive in part and can be challenged as an excessive fine.united states currency,cir.
owners have standing to challenge forfeitures of their property,see united states in currency,cir,and can raise eighth amendment challenges to such forfeitures.see,united states little canyon,cir.in addition,claimants who assert possessory interests in the forfeited property and provide some explanation for their possession have article iii standing to contest the forfeiture.see united states in currency,cir in order to contest a forfeiture,a claimant need only have some type of property interest in the forfeited items.this interest need not be an ownership interest it can be any type of interest,including a possessory interest.the novel question we face today is whether a claimant who asserts only a possessory interest in forfeited property has standing to challenge the forfeiture under the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment.we conclude that a gratuitous bailee like mayzel has a sufficient property interest in the seized property such that he would be punished by the forfeiture and can therefore bring a challenge in his own right under the excessive fines clause.
in a forfeiture action,we look to state law to determine the existence and extent of a claimant property interest.united states lear jet,model,serial,cir.under california law,a bailment is the deposit of personal property with another,usually for a special purpose.see windeler scheers jewelers,d.a bailment that arises as a personal favor is a gratuitous bailment.see cal.gratuitous deposit is a deposit for which the depositary receives no consideration beyond the mere possession of the thing deposited.see also todd dow,th,d,concluding that the storage of a rifle as a personal favor was a gratuitous bailment.a gratuitous bailee is a lawful possessor,though of a more particular kind.united states in currency,cir as a bailee,a claimant has a possessory interest in the bailed currency,and consequently may assert a claim to the currency against anyone,other than the bailor,who interferes with that interest.citations omitted.
on facts similar to those here,we acknowledged the creation of a bailee relationship in united states,cir,albeit in the context of addressing the legal status of the owners of the seized money.the owners of learned that alcaraz planned to travel to mexico to visit his family and friends.they asked alcaraz to deliver various sums from their savings to their respective families in colima.id.at.there was no indication that the owners had any close relationship with alcaraz,that they paid him anything for his services or that he benefitted in any way from agreeing to deliver the funds.in those circumstances,we recognized that alcaraz was a gratuitous bailee of the funds.id.at.here,mayzel became a gratuitous bailee of amiel when he accepted the funds to deliver to amiel sister in israel,just as alcaraz did when he accepted the funds to deliver to colima.
as a gratuitous bailee,mayzel has rights and obligations with respect to the entrusted funds.a gratuitous bailee must deliver the property to the owner on demand.see todd,d at.if he misdelivers the property to the wrong person,even by accident,he is liable to the owner for conversion.see byer canadian bank of commerce,cal d,holding a gratuitous bailee liable for the bonds entrusted to it when the bailee delivered the bonds to an impostor.moreover,a gratuitous bailee owes a duty to exercise slight care over the property.todd,d at.consequently,he is liable for loss or damage to the property if he is grossly negligent in handling it.see roselip raisch,d.mayzel,by virtue of his attendant obligations as a gratuitous bailee of amiel,would be punished by a forfeiture of the entire.accordingly,we hold that mayzel has standing in his own right to raise an eighth amendment challenge to the full forfeiture amount.
nevertheless,the responsibilities of a gratuitous bailee can be modified by contract.see kaye,d,cal.jur d bailments subject to considerations of public policy,the liability of the bailee under a contract of bailment for loss or damage may be increased or diminished by stipulation.here,when mayzel took possession of the money,he told amiel,s hould anything ever happen to the,that perhaps i would be responsible for it.even assuming that mayzel meant to condition his the perhaps is no evidence that amiel ever assented to this condition,orally or otherwise.even if amiel had assented,it is doubtful either amiel or mayzel understood that this statement freed mayzel from his legal duties to exercise at least slight care in delivering the money to its intended recipient.more likely,the statement was intended to clarify that mayzel would not be responsible for loss or damage which he did not example,if mayzel were mugged on the way to the airport.this interpretation of mayzel statement is reinforced by the context of mayzel testimony.during mayzel deposition,he was asked,were you worried about the money being stolen from you mayzel replied,i told amiel that,should anything ever happen to the,that perhaps i would be responsible for it.by contrast,had mayzel decided to spend the for himself,he could hardly claim that the condition relieved him of liability to amiel.therefore,we can not construe mayzel ambiguous statement as having modified his duties as a gratuitous bailee in any way material here.
we acknowledge the implications of allowing claimants other than the owners of currency to assert eighth amendment challenges to civil forfeitures.for example,owners engaging in criminal activities might hide in the shadows and allow their mules or couriers to press excessive fines challenges for the owners benefit.yet notwithstanding the problems law enforcement might encounter as a result of broadening eighth amendment standing,congress enacted the claimant friendly civil asset forfeiture reform act of cafra,granting any claimant the right to petition the court to determine whether a forfeiture is constitutionally excessive.although mayzel claim is not governed by cafra,that congress has opted to give claimants like him statutory standing to litigate an excessive fines claim weighs against our carving out a prudential barrier to standing in this one that will have a dramatically short due to cafra.
we therefore conclude that mayzel has a sufficient property interest in the full such that he can in his own a party punished by the the entire amount of the forfeiture under the excessive fines clause.the district court properly granted him such standing.
excessiveness of fine 
because mayzel has standing to bring an excessive fines challenge,the next question is whether the forfeiture authorized by the district court is excessive.we review the district court determination of excessiveness de novo.bajakajian,at.however,we must accept the district court findings of fact in conducting the excessiveness inquiry unless they are clearly erroneous.id.
a punitive forfeiture is excessive if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant offense.id.at.in this case,the relevant offense is mayzel failure to report the in violation of see c.when examining the proportionality of a forfeiture to the gravity of the offense,we are not required to consider any rigid set of factors.united states mackby,cir.nevertheless,this court has often looked to factors similar to those used by the court in bajakajian.id.in bajakajian,the supreme court considered four factors in weighing the gravity of the defendant offense the nature and extent of the crime,whether the violation was related to other illegal activities,the other penalties that may be imposed for the violation,and the extent of the harm caused.see bajakajian,at.
in light of these factors,we conclude that a forfeiture of would be excessive but that would not be.first,mayzel crime was solely a reporting offense.id.at.the money would have been lawful for mayzel to take out of the country so long as he reported it.id.
with respect to the second factor,the district court found that there is credible evidence that the money comes from a lawful source.even though mayzel itinerary was unusual and luggage found in his possession contained items often used in packaging drugs mayzel was never charged with any criminal activity other than failing to report the currency and making false statements.see united states nw thurman,cir weighing the fact that the claimant had not been charged with any related criminal activity in determining whether a forfeiture was excessive.moreover,amiel submitted a sworn declaration that the money was obtained from the sale of his store to his,and the government did not refute this evidence.therefore,based on the record as a whole,we can not say that the district court finding was clearly erroneous.
regarding the third factor,we look to other penalties that the legislature has authorized and the maximum penalties that could have been imposed under the sentencing guidelines as measures of the gravity of the offense.id.internal quotation marks omitted.congress has authorized imprisonment of up to five years and a fine of up to for a violation of.see.however,the maximum penalties under the sentencing guidelines should be given greater weight than the statutory maximum because the guidelines take into account the specific culpability of the offender.see nw thurman,at.
under the sentencing guidelines,the maximum fine in mayzel case could have been either or.mayzel base offense level for violating would have been levels for failure to file a currency report and a increase for the value of the currency.see united states sentencing guidelines a.however,his offense level would have been reduced to if four conditions were met mayzel did not know or believe that the funds were proceeds of unlawful activity mayzel did not act with reckless disregard as to the source of the funds the funds were the proceeds of lawful activity and the funds were to be used for a lawful purpose.see id.b.a maximum fine can be imposed for an offense level of,and a maximum fine can be imposed for an offense level of.id.
although the district court found that the funds were the proceeds of lawful activity,it did not make explicit factual findings on the other three conditions.the district court merely noted that in bajakajian was the maximum fine under the sentencing guidelines for violating.however,is not the maximum fine under the sentencing guidelines for all violations of.the determination of the maximum fine must be made on a basis.the culpability of the offender should be examined specifically,rather than examining the gravity of the crime in the abstract.nw thurman,at.
in this case,there is evidence that mayzel acted with reckless disregard as to the source of the funds.for instance,the following colloquy took place during mayzel deposition 
q did amiel explain why he was sending the to his sister 
a no.he did tell me.i did even ask.
q did you ask him why he was sending cash instead of travelers checks or bank checks 
q did amiel tell you anything about where he got that money 
a no.i did ask.
although this evidence may not be enough to support a finding of reckless disregard for purposes of sentencing under the guidelines,it shows more than a minimal level of culpability for purposes of assessing the gravity of mayzel offense under the excessive fines clause 
the fourth factor is the extent of the harm caused by the offense.the district court found,there is no evidence that the government suffered a loss.thus,the only harm was the deprivation of information that left the country.although this information has some value to the government because it may facilitate investigation of other crimes,the harm is minimal.bajakajian,at.in sum,applying the bajakajian factors to this case leads to the conclusion that mayzel offense was in the low range of the gravity spectrum.
finally,comparing the amount of forfeiture to the gravity of mayzel offense demonstrates that would be grossly disproportional to the gravity of the offense.mayzel failure to report the currency and false statements were not connected with other illegal activity,and the violations caused negligible harm.moreover,a forfeiture of is many times more than either the or maximum fine under the sentencing guidelines.
however,a forfeiture of is not grossly disproportional to the gravity of mayzel offense.a forfeiture would not necessarily reflect mayzel level of culpability given his failure to inquire about the source of the unreported currency.nevertheless,his ignorance alone does not compel a forfeiture.the forfeiture is closer to and strikes an appropriate balance between the and options.considering all the circumstances,we conclude that the forfeiture amount the district court selected is not constitutionally excessive.
vii.attorney fees 
the equal access to justice act provides a court shall award to a prevailing party fees and other expenses incurred by that party in any civil action brought by or against the united states unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.d a.although the majority analysis of eighth amendment standing renders mayzel a prevailing party,the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the government litigation position was substantially justified.a substantially justified position must have a reasonable basis both in law and in fact.roundhill drive,at internal quotation marks omitted.the government must have been substantially justified in taking its original action and in defending the validity of the action in court.id.mayzel concedes that the government was substantially justified in its initial seizure of the currency and in filing the complaint.in the end,the government also prevailed on every issue except the question of mayzel eighth amendment standing.this issue presented a novel and close question of law,as to which reasonable jurists disagreed.we therefore conclude the government position had a reasonable basis both in law and in fact.id.
viii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court forfeiture order.
i respectfully dissent from part vi of the majority opinion holding that mayzel has standing to assert a challenge to the amount ordered forfeited based on the eighth amendment excessive fines clause.based on the text,history,and purpose of the eighth amendment,i would conclude that the district court erred in permitting mayzel to assert such a claim.
the eighth amendment forbids the impos ition of excessive fines alongside its more familiar bans on e xcessive bail and cruel and unusual punishments.const.amend.viii.this amendment,and the excessive fines clause in particular,was the subject of very little debate among the framers,and thus little is known about its original meaning.see indus.of,kelco disposal,d.the supreme court has recently held that it applies to some types of civil forfeiture as well as to the imposition of criminal fines.see austin united states,d.the touchstone for whether civil forfeitures are treated as fines for the purposes of the excessive fines clause is the extent to which the forfeitures are punitive.id.at.
the court current test for excessiveness of a civil fine was announced in united states bajakajian,d.once it is determined that a civil forfeiture is at least in part punitive,a court must invalidate it if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant offense.id.at.previously,we had a different test for excessiveness,focusing on the culpability of the owner of the forfeited property,even when that person was not the defendant.united states little canyon,cir.we justified our earlier standard on the basis that t he owner culpability is relevant because it is the owner who is punished by the forfeiture.id.citing austin,at.emphasis in original.
mayzel argues that the switch from relying on the owner culpability to relying on that of the defendant who is more likely to be the claimant signals the court disagreement with the general principle that it is the owner of the property who is punished by forfeiture.thus,he suggests that the court has implicitly granted all possessors of seized property standing to assert an excessive fines challenge to the amount of forfeiture.this is an erroneous interpretation of bajakajian.bajakajian stands for the simple proposition that for purposes of the gross proportionality analysis,the relevant comparison is between the value of the property seized and the conduct of the person from whom it is seized.this is consonant with the theoretical underpinning of civil in rem forfeiture,according to which the forfeited property itself is the subject of proceedings for its involvement in illegal activities committed by the person it is seized from,not necessarily its owner.see generally bajakajian,at.that the defendant conduct is one of the factors in the proportionality analysis has no bearing on the question we face here,determining who is punished by civil forfeiture for eighth amendment purposes.
the bajakajian opinion recognized that owners of seized property and the criminal defendants from whom the property is seized are frequently not the same persons,id.at.explaining that when the government seizes funds from a cash courier it will ordinarily investigate the source and true ownership of the unreported funds,the kingpin,in an attempt to prosecute that person as well,and even cited the fact that innocent owners of seized property normally have a defense to civil forfeiture.id.at.indeed,the very notion of an innocent owner defense is only consistent with the principle that it is the owner who is punished by an unconstitutionally excessive fine.thus,there is no reason to depart from our previous determination that it is the owner of seized necessarily the person from whom the property is is punished by its forfeiture for eighth amendment purposes.
this conclusion is unremarkable.the bill of rights guarantees numerous personal rights to individuals.police dep t united reporting publ g,d a cardinal principle of our constitutional order is the personal nature of constitutional rights emphasis added whitmore arkansas,d only a person himself subject to the death penalty has standing to assert an eighth amendment objection under the cruel and unusual punishment clause to its imposition alderman united states,d fourth amendment rights are personal rights which,like some other constitutional rights,may not be vicariously asserted.the constitutional doctrine of standing guarantees that only those people whose rights are violated may sue for their restoration.see schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war,d standing requir es that the complaining party suffer a particular injury caused by the action challenged as unlawful.
it is possible,however,that in certain cases a person who is not the owner of seized property may nevertheless suffer on account of its forfeiture in a manner sufficient to implicate eighth amendment concerns.such a situation might arise,for example,when the possessor owes a substantial legal or contractual duty to the owner,or even perhaps where there is an immediate familial relationship between the owner and the possessor.there are two different theoretical rubrics that we could use to analyze such a situation we could deem that,in addition to the owner,a possessor of seized property is somehow also always punished for excessive fines purposes by a proposed forfeiture,and thus always entitled to make a constitutional challenge to the amount forfeited or we could use the existing doctrine of standing to evaluate whether the possessor had a sufficient stake in the seized property so as to permit him to assert an excessive fines claim on behalf of the owner.
which of the two approaches is appropriate is a matter of first impression.preliminarily,we must consider two cases cited by mayzel which,he asserts,have already addressed this issue,and resolved it in favor of his position.first,he cites one of our cases involving a currency seizure in which the claimants were two brothers one brother had allegedly wired the currency to the other,and the latter had been arrested and convicted for failing to report the currency before leaving the united states for the united arab emirates.see united states in currency,cir.we remanded the case to the district court for a determination of the actual ownership of the currency,which was in dispute,and thereafter for an excessive fines determination if necessary.id.at.mayzel asserts that the fact that our opinion did not specify in its conclusory remarks whether only the brother who is determined to be the owner will be able to assert an excessive fines defense implicitly condones either brother assertion of such a defense.this contention is without merit.that we ordered the determination of ownership to occur before any hearing of an excessive fines defense,if anything,supports the opposite view that only when the true owner is determined will the district court be in a position to entertain a constitutional challenge to the proposed forfeiture from the correct party.
the other case cited by amiel is an unpublished district court order from the eastern district of new york.see united states currency in the sum of ninety seven thousand two hundred dollars,more or less,jg,wl june.that case examined whether a bailee of seized currency had standing to contest its forfeiture on eighth amendment grounds the court there determined that the bailee had standing under article iii and that he had complied with the jurisdictional procedural requirements of supplemental rule c what the district court termed statutory standing.id.at.the district court did not,however,make any inquiry or pronouncement regarding the propr
