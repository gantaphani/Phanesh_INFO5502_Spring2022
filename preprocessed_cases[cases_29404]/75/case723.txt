background 
delgado was charged in a indictment with conspiracy to distribute cocaine,and possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute.
delgado filed a motion in limine to suppress the evidence found in his truck,premised on fourth amendment violations.during the suppression hearing,officer jerrold brooks,a commercial vehicle officer for the missouri state highway patrol,testified that he was responsible for enforcing missouri commercial vehicle regulations.officer brooks observed that he had limited police powers.the missouri state troopers have full police powers and they enforce all the regulations.officer brooks could not make custodial arrests.instead,it was his responsibility t o make sure the drivers are qualified to drive the trucks,have the right credentials,driver license,logs,hours of service,equipment and to make sure that all their equipment is up to safety standards.according to officer brooks,he has the authority pursuant to missouri code to stop vehicles without observing any traffic violations.
while parked on the side of,officer brooks saw a passing truck with a company name that he did not recognize.he did not notice any violations of the vehicle code,or anything illegal at that time.officer brooks testified that the unfamiliar company name was important because t here a lot of new companies that come up,and we have found that sometimes they do always have the right credentials or permits officer brooks stopped the truck because he just did recognize the markings or did know who it was,and to the best of his knowledge,he had never stopped it before,so he stopped it to do an inspection.
after stopping the truck,officer brooks asked the truck driver,cesar delgado cesar for his driver license,registration permits,shipping papers,and log book.cesar did not respond to officer brooks questions regarding the truck cargo.instead,delgado stepped through the sleeper curtains and stated that they were hauling speakers.delgado confirmed that he was the truck owner and driver.
when reviewing cesar log books,officer brooks observed that cesar only had two days logged,although commercial truck drivers are required to have the day that they operating on and seven previous days of log to show what they been doing in the past period.cesar only had the day that officer brooks stopped him on and the previous day.cesar log books violated the applicable regulations.officer brooks noticed additional discrepancies between cesar and delgado log books regarding the hours.
according to officer brooks,cesar confirmed that he started the trip in phoenix,arizona,as reflected in cesar log books.however,delgado log books indicated that the load was picked up in otay mesa,california,and t he shipping papers showed san diego,california.delgado log book also reflected that cesar was the in california.officer brooks testified that delgado log book appeared to be in order.however,officer brooks was uncertain how cesar got to phoenix,arizona,since he lived in the same place that delgado did.
officer brooks also discovered that cesar had an invalid california driver license,which violated missouri regulations and vehicle code.
officer brooks asked cesar whether the truck contained the required fire extinguisher and reflective triangles.cesar got out of the truck and tried to open the side box to show officer brooks the fire extinguisher and triangles,but was unable to open the door.delgado told officer brooks that he could unlock that door from the inside and he stepped across and asked officer brooks to step back and shut the driver door first.officer brooks found this unusual,because officer brooks could imagine why delgado had to shut that door before he handed officer brooks the fire extinguisher and triangles.
when delgado unlocked the side door,officer brooks saw the fire extinguisher that was laying sic there and he leaned up there to see that it was charged.delgado then slammed or let the bunk down pretty hard,which officer brooks thought was a little odd.
officer brooks testified that this just did seem to appear to be a normal trucking operation.he contacted a state trooper because officer brooks saw some indicators that he had seen in years past that he had been trained in that may be some suspicious activity and because officer brooks was not allowed to search or seize.additionally,officer brooks never did get an answer from cesar or delgado when definitely cesar got in the truck.it appeared to officer brooks that something was out of the ordinary.something was right.so,he called the state trooper to come and investigate.
officer brooks showed state trooper sergeant mcmullin the bills and the log books and something did match,and one driver said he got in in the phoenix area,and the other one had left at the same address or the same town that both drivers stated on their their driver license officer brooks also informed sergeant mcmullin of the three violations officer brooks had found.finally,officer brooks informed sergeant mcmullin that delgado slamming down the bunk bed was very suspicious.it was kind of out of the ordinary and it was normal.
the three violations found by officer brooks were a light that was out the incomplete entries in cesar log book and cesar invalid driver license.officer brooks concluded that the violations did not warrant a citation.however,having false log books was a misdemeanor in missouri.
sergeant jack mcmullin,a state trooper for the missouri state highway patrol,testified that state troopers have more authority in the sense of arrest than commercial vehicle officers cvos.according to sergeant mcmullin,he is contacted by cvos when there is suspected criminal activity.
sergeant mcmullin acknowledged that cvos call him because they suspect drug trafficking.however,officer brooks did not tell sergeant mcmullin that he suspected that this was a drug courier truck.according to sergeant mcmullin,officer brooks and his partner contacted him d ue to their concern about entries in the log book and responses they had got when asked questions about the entries in the log book.sergeant mcmullin was also made aware of cesar invalid driver license.in addition,the log books were indicators that led them to believe there was possible criminal activity.the cvos relayed that cesar and delgado were nervous.the cvos never told sergeant mcmullin that they were not going to issue a citation.
after he spoke with officer brooks,sergeant mcmullin asked delgado to exit the truck.sergeant mcmullin inquired about the discrepancies in the log books,and the phoenix deal.delgado responded that they were in phoenix,but they were there just for a short while and that they remained in the truck.they did even get out.sergeant mcmullin did not get an explanation that satisfactorily explained why there were discrepancies.sergeant mcmullin testified that his suspicions were based on t he log book,the demeanor of the two individuals,the situation itself 
sergeant mcmullin received delgado consent to search the truck.while searching the truck,sergeant mcmullin found a suitcase containing two empty duffle bags.sergeant mcmullin believed that the empty duffle bags were unusual because,in his experience,these were used to bring drugs or money into the vehicle.sergeant mcmullin also located a false wall at the front of the sleeper sergeant mcmullin lifted the lid and saw the drugs inside packages of cocaine,weighing a total of,were seized.
delgado denied giving sergeant mcmullin consent to search the truck.delgado also testified that cesar got into the truck at his house in colton,california,not in arizona.
delgado was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute,and tried in the southern district of california.the district court denied delgado motion to suppress evidence relating to the cocaine discovered in delgado truck.the court also denied delgado motion for reconsideration.
during delgado trial,officer marvin ringgold,a springfield,missouri police officer,testified that he served as a liaison to the drug enforcement administration.after being advised of his rights,delgado agreed to be interviewed by officer ringgold.according to officer ringgold,delgado stated that he picked the cocaine up in southern california and was taking the cocaine to philadelphia,pennsylvania.delgado specified that he picked up the cocaine in san ysidro,california,based on instructions from an individual named sanchotina.delgado admit ted that he knew that the cocaine was in his truck,and that sanchotina was going to pay delgado ten thousand dollars for its delivery to philadelphia.
the district court denied delgado motion for judgment of acquittal based on improper venue.the jury found delgado guilty of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute however,the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the conspiracy charge.
the district court sentenced delgado to months of imprisonment,and three years of supervised release.delgado filed a timely notice of appeal.

iii.discussion 
missouri inspection statute 
delgado contends that,because commercial trucking is not a pervasively regulated industry,missouri inspection statute violates the fourth amendment and fails to satisfy the requirements established in burger 
as a general rule,searches and seizures violate the fourth amendment unless they are based on probable cause and executed pursuant to a valid search warrant.united states mastercases of cigarettes,more or less,cir citation omitted.the protection against unreasonable searches and seizures extends to commercial premises id.citation omitted.the united states supreme court,however,has carved out a limited number of contexts within which a warrant is not required.administrative searches of closely regulated industries are one such exception and may be conducted without a warrant,so long as they meet certain standards of reasonableness.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we do not require a warrant in such situations because the federal regulatory presence is sufficiently comprehensive and defined that the owner of the commercial property can not help but be aware that his property will be subject to periodic inspections undertaken for specific purposes.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
for the stop of delgado truck to be a permissible administrative search,we must determine that commercial trucking is a pervasively regulated industry.see id.we have not extensively addressed the regulatory status of the commercial trucking industry however,the first,fifth,sixth,eighth,and tenth circuits have concluded that commercial trucking is a pervasively regulated industry under burger.see united states maldonado,cir united states castelo,cir united states fort,cir united states,cir united states,cir united states mitchell,cir.
we similarly conclude that commercial trucking is a pervasively regulated industry.commercial trucking is subject to extensive federal regulation.see.numerous states also impose substantial regulatory and inspection standards for commercial vehicles.see.ann.a cal.a ann.a.thus,burger provides the appropriate analytical framework because the myriad federal and state statutes that govern commercial trucking place it squarely within the class of industries to which burger applies.castelo,at citation omitted 
under burger,missouri warrantless inspections of commercial vehicles survive fourth amendment scrutiny if the underlying regulatory scheme advances a substantial government interest warrantless inspections are necessary to further the regulatory scheme and the inspection program provides a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.mastercases of cigarettes,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
although not extensively considered by our court,other circuit courts are in accord that warrantless inspections of commercial trucks are necessary and serve a substantial governmental interest.see fort,at commercial trucks pass quickly through states and out of the jurisdictions of the enforcement agencies.because of the transitory nature of the commercial trucking industry,we conclude that the need for warrantless stops and inspections is even more compelling than the warrantless inspections of automobile junkyards upheld in burger.citations and footnote reference omitted see also maldonado,at b ecause violations of the regulatory scheme often are not apparent to a patrolling officer,inspections are sometimes the only way in which violations can be discovered.we conclude,therefore,that effective enforcement of the regulatory regime would be impossible in the absence of impromptu inspections,at like the stolen cars and automobile parts which pass quickly through an automobile junkyard,trucks pass quickly through states and out of the jurisdictions of the enforcement agencies the facts presented here in support of warrantless inspections are more compelling than those present in burger.
persuaded by this weight of authority,we conclude that the warrantless inspection of commercial vehicles advances a substantial government interest,and is necessary to further the regulatory scheme.mastercases of cigarettes,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
delgado also posits that the missouri statute is an inadequate substitute for a warrant because it provides enforcement officers with unfettered discretion in conducting inspections without observing a regulatory violation.however,delgado argument imports into the burger analysis a requirement that burger does not mandate.in burger,the approved statute did not limit the inspectors discretion only to commercial premises with observable violations.see burger,at.the supreme court observed that i t was unclear from the record why,on that particular day,burger junkyard was selected for inspection.the junkyards designated for inspection apparently were selected from a list of such businesses compiled by new york city police detectives.id.at.citations omitted.despite the lack of clarity,the statute nevertheless functioned as a proper warrant substitute because it inform ed the operator of a vehicle dismantling business that inspections would be made on a regular basis.thus,the vehicle dismantler knew that the inspections to which he was subject did not constitute discretionary acts by a government official but were conducted pursuant to statute.id.at.citations omitted.additionally,the permissible scope of these searches was narrowly defined the inspectors could examine the records,as well as any vehicles or parts of vehicles which were subject to the record keeping requirements of this section and which were on the premises.id.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.burger,therefore,does not support delgado proposition that the enforcement officers must observe a violation before stopping a commercial vehicle for inspection.maldonado,at b ecause violations of the regulatory scheme of
