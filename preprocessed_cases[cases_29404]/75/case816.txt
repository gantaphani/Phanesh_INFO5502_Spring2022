on appeal,airways argues that the airline deregulation act of ada expressly preempts state regulation of airlines alcoholic beverage services provided to passengers.in addition to express preemption,airways argues that federal law impliedly preempts the application of the nmlca to airways.specifically,airways contends that the federal aviation act of faa and the federal regulations promulgated pursuant to the faa occupy the field of aviation safety to the exclusion of state regulation and that nmlca application to an airline implicates the field of aviation safety.exercising jurisdiction under,we conclude that new mexico regulatory scheme is impliedly preempted as it falls within the field of aviation safety that congress intended federal law to occupy exclusively,but that the amendment of the united states constitution requires a balancing of new mexico core powers and the federal interests underlying the faa.accordingly,we reverse and remand for the district court to conduct a amendment balancing.

in january,the alcohol and gaming division agd of the new mexico regulation and licensing department served airways with a citation asserting that airways had served alcohol to an intoxicated person,namely dana papst.id.at.the agd also served airways with a order directing airways to refrain from selling,serving and otherwise dispensing,storing or possessing alcoholic beverages of any kind in the state of new mexico without properly complying with the requirements of nmlca.id.at.

us airways filed this action seeking to enjoin new mexico state officials in the agd and the new mexico regulation and licensing department from enforcing laws that purport to govern airways alcoholic beverage service on flights departing from or arriving into new mexico.id.at compl.at.us airways asserted both express and implied preemption in support of its request for injunction.id.at compl.at.specifically,airways argued that the enforcement of nmlca against an airline violated the supremacy clause of the united states constitution as the ada expressly preempts state regulation of airline services,including the alcoholic beverage service provided to passengers on flights.id.alternatively,airways contended that federal law impliedly preempts the application of nmlca to airlines as the application of nmlca to an airline implicates the field of aviation safety,which federal law regulates to the exclusion of state regulation.id.further,airways asserted that new mexico regulatory efforts could not be otherwise authorized pursuant to the amendment to the united states constitution.id.
the parties filed for summary judgment.see id.at op.at.the district court concluded that federal law neither expressly nor impliedly preempts new mexico regulation of the alcoholic beverage service that airlines provide.id.at op.at.specifically,the district court narrowly construed the explicit preemption provision in the ada,concluding that the provision reference to service did not include an airline alcoholic beverage service.see id.at op.at.the district court reasoned that the narrow interpretation necessarily avoided rendering the ada preemption provision violative of of the amendment.see id.at op.at.further,the district court addressed field preemption and concluded that federal law did not preempt the field of alcohol service on airlines.id.at op.at.in reaching this decision,the district court reasoned that,when enacting the faa,congress was addressing the need for exclusive and complete rules for the physical and mechanical operation of aircraft.id.at op.at.the district court then denied airways motion for summary judgment and granted new mexico motion.id.at op.at.

preemption 
the supremacy clause provides that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art.vi,cl.pursuant to this provision,congress has the power to enact statutes that preempt state law.nw.cent.pipeline state.comm of.thus,preemption is ultimately a question of congressional intent.see altria,good,recognizing that the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every case internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.congress may indicate intent through a statute express language or through its structure and purpose.id.
there are three types of preemption express preemption,which occurs when the language of the federal statute reveals an express congressional intent to preempt state law field preemption,which occurs when the federal scheme of regulation is so pervasive that congress must have intended to leave no room for a state to supplement it and conflict preemption,which occurs either when compliance with both the federal and state laws is a physical impossibility,or when the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.mount olivet cemetery ass salt lake city,cir.in this case,airways asserts that federal law expressly preempts nmlca application to an airline.additionally,airways asserts that the faa,et,and the federal regulations promulgated pursuant to the faa occupy the field of aviation safety to the exclusion of state regulation,including the nmlca.because we conclude that applying new mexico regulatory scheme to airways implicates the field of aviation safety that congress intended federal law to regulate exclusively,we need not reach the question of express preemption.
field preemption occurs when a state law regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively.english.congress intent for federal law to occupy a field exclusively may be inferred from a scheme of federal regulation so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it,or where an act of congress touches a field in which the interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.id.at internal quotation marks,brackets and ellipses omitted.
when conducting a field preemption analysis,we must first identify the legislative field that the state law at issue implicates.see martin ex rel.heckman midwest express holdings,cir explaining that the circuits have generally analyzed faa preemption by looking to the pervasiveness of federal regulations in the specific area covered by the state law at issue.in this case,the district court narrowly construed nmlca as regulating the field of alcoholic beverage service provided on airplanes.at op.at.in our view,however,the regulation of an airline alcoholic beverage service necessarily implicates the field of airline safety.the faa similarly recognized the safety considerations implicated when promulgating to regulate the alcoholic beverage services provided on airplanes.see drinking and serving of alcoholic beverages,discussing the safety concerns associated with an airline alcoholic beverage service.
additionally,nmlca regulatory scheme extends beyond the field of airline alcoholic beverage services.specifically,nmlca prescribes training and certification requirements for flight attendants and other airline crew members serving alcoholic beverages on aircraft.see stat.no person shall be employed as a server on a licensed premises unless that person obtains within thirty days of employment alcohol server training pursuant to the provisions of stat.et.stat.b delineating the subjects that the training program for employees serving alcoholic beverages must cover.thus,we conclude that new mexico regulatory scheme as applied to an airline generally implicates the field of aviation safety.
having identified the legislative field at issue,we must next evaluate whether congress intended to occupy the field to the exclusion of the states.see martin ex rel.heckman,at to find field preemption here,we must infer that congress intended to exclude all state law from this area even though it did say so.thus,in this case,we must determine whether congress intended to occupy the field of aviation safety to the exclusion of the states.while recognizing that the purpose of congress must be clear as we presume that congress does not cavalierly causes of action,medtronic,lohr,the field of aviation safety has long been dominated by federal interests.montalvo spirit airlines,cir.thus,the presumption against preemption does not apply in this case.see buckman plaintiffs legal,explaining that the presumption against preemption did not apply because the field at issue was hardly a field which the states have traditionally occupied internal quotation marks omitted.
while we have previously held that congress did not indicate a clear and manifest intent to occupy the field of airplane safety to the exclusion of state common law,cleveland piper aircraft,cir,our prior holding addressed only the preemption of state tort remedies.see id.in cleveland,our analysis relied in part on the faa statutory savings clause,which leaves in place remedies then existing at common law or by statute.id.at.further,in cleveland,we recognized the possibility that congress may reserve for the federal government the exclusive right to regulate safety in a given field,yet permit the states to maintain tort remedies covering much the same territory.id.at emphases added.in contrast to cleveland,nmlca does not involve state tort remedies and instead imposes substantive requirements.
further,we have recognized that our analysis in cleveland has been called into question based on subsequent supreme court opinions.see choate champion home builders,cir.specifically,our holding in cleveland relied,in significant part,on the premise that implied preemption is generally inapplicable to a federal statute that contains an express preemption provision.cleveland,at.however,the supreme court appears to have rejected this reasoning.see geier am.honda motor,t he express provision imposes no unusual,special burden against implied.see also choate,at.thus,we conclude that cleveland does not dictate the outcome in this case,and we must address whether congress intended to occupy the field of aviation safety to the exclusion of state regulation.
based on the faa purpose to centralize aviation safety regulation and the comprehensive regulatory scheme promulgated pursuant to the faa,we conclude that federal regulation occupies the field of aviation safety to the exclusion of state regulations.the faa was enacted to create a uniform and exclusive system of federal regulation in the field of air safety.city of burbank lockheed air terminal.specifically,congress enacted the faa in response to a series of fatal air crashes between civil and military aircraft operating under separate flight rules,at,reprinted in,noting that t he magnitude and critical nature of airspace use and problems came to general public notice as a result of a series of airplane crashes.in response to the air safety concerns,the house report discussing the faa indicated that the administrator of the new federal aviation agency would be given full responsibility and authority for the promulgation and enforcement of safety regulations,at,reprinted in.further,as documented in the house report,a letter from a representative of the executive branch to the house committee on international and foreign commerce explained that i t is essential that one agency of government,and one agency alone,be responsible for issuing safety regulations,at,reprinted in.
the language of the faa explicitly directs the administrator of the federal aviation administration to promulgate regulations for the safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce.a.beyond the types of regulations specifically enumerated,the faa directs the administrator to regulate any other practices,methods,and procedure the administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce and national security.id.the federal aviation administr
