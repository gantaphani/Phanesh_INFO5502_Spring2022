under the railroad retirement act rra,an employee who works for a railroad employer is entitled to benefits based,in part,on the employee years of service with that employer.the intervening respondents received their paychecks from weyerhaeuser company weyerhaeuser,but they worked for dequeen and eastern railroad dequeen,which is a subsidiary of weyerhaeuser.railroad carriers such as dequeen are covered employers under the rra.weyerhaeuser did not credit these employees for that railroad service.the railroad retirement board board found in favor of four of the employees and credited them for their prior service.weyerhaeuser does not dispute that four of the intervening respondents should be credited retroactively for four years service.the board,however,determined that the four employees were entitled to retroactive rra service credit beyond the four years automatically allowed by statute.the board also concluded that the other two intervening respondents were not entitled to retroactive rra service credit.weyerhaeuser appeals from the board order granting the four employees retroactive service credit beyond four years.the four employees granted retroactive service credit intervened and appeal,claiming they were entitled to additional years of service credit,even beyond the years awarded.the two employees denied retroactive service credit also intervened,claiming they were also entitled to retroactive service credit.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand in part.

the board determined that the petitioner in this appeal,weyerhaeuser company weyerhaeuser,is not an employer under the rra.see weyerhaeuser car shop.may,employer status deter.however,a weyerhaeuser subsidiary,dequeen and eastern railroad dequeen,is a covered employer under the rra.
the intervening respondents and petitioners,ben bramlett,karen neumeier,gil sharp,deborah ruth,carol honea and larry potts were all treated as weyerhaeuser employees for payroll purposes,although they all performed services for dequeen.they each received checks from weyerhaeuser and,in turn,weyerhaeuser charged dequeen for their salaries.weyerhaeuser did not file rra returns reporting compensation for sharp,ruth,honea,or potts,and only started filing rra returns for bramlett and neumeier in the.
in,the board initiated an audit of weyerhaeuser.following the audit,the board concluded that certain employees who were paid by weyerhaeuser,but who performed work for dequeen,should be considered employees of dequeen for purposes of rra coverage specifically,in may,the board concluded the because weyerhaeuser employee potts had provided a portion of his services to dequeen and was integrated into dequeen staff and railroad operations,he was covered by the rra.potts.may,employee serv.deter.the board concluded that potts service should have been credited under the rra and granted him retroactive service credit for four years,as permitted by section.section and its statutory counterpart,both provide for time limits for correcting records of compensation.section provides 
the board record of the compensation reported as paid to an employee for a given period shall be conclusive as to amount,or if no compensation was reported for such period,then as to the employee having received no compensation for such period,unless the error in the amount of compensation or the failure to make return of the compensation is called to the attention of the board within four years after the date on which the compensation was required to be reported to the board as provided for in of this chapter.
in other words,any compensation possibly due but not paid or not credited more than four years before the board receives notice of a deficiency is not recoverable,the is final.because the filing deadline for service records for each calendar year is the last day of february of the following year,when the board issued its may decision as to potts,the service records for the years and earlier were deemed conclusive.accordingly,as a result of the board may decision,potts received retroactive service credit for the years through.potts sought reconsideration of the board decision,requesting additional retroactive service credit beyond the limit based on b.section b provides the board may correct a report of compensation after the time limit set forth in paragraph a of this section where the compensation was posted or not posted as the result of fraud on the part of the employer.potts argued that a efficiency study prepared for weyerhaeuser by anacostia pacific company,anacostia showed that weyerhaeuser fraudulently failed to file rra service records on his behalf.in the efficiency study,anacostia stated that dequeen practice of contracting with weyerhaeuser for the entire mechanical work force as well as certain accounting personnel is subject to challenge by the railroad retirement board rrb.in essence,the rrb position is that railroads can not escape payment of railroad retirement and unemployment insurance taxes by contracting an integral railroad function to an affiliate under common ownership.the board denied potts request for reconsideration,finding that potts allegations of fraud were not meritorious.see potts.may,employee serv.deter.recon.the board added 
t he board regards the contention that fraud was committed as a very serious accusation and does not find that the failure of weyerhaeuser to report potts service and compensation constituted fraud even though a management study stated that certain weyerhaeuser company employees worked exclusively for dequeen and another affiliated railroad.the board notes that the same report also stated that the employees had apparently performed considerable mechanical or maintenance work for weyerhaeuser company and third parties.
then,in may,the board found that sharp,ruth,and honea,who were all supervised by dequeen employees and were subject to the continuing authority of dequeen,were covered employees.accordingly,the board found their service creditable under the rra.see weyerhaeuser car shop,at.may,employer serv.deter.the board further granted them retroactive service credit to the extent permitted by section of the railroad retirement act and section of the board regulations.id.at.that amounted to retroactive service credit for sharp,ruth,and honea for the years through.sharp,ruth,and honea requested additional service credit beyond four years,also relying on b fraud exception.the board denied their request for additional service credit,concluding that as a general rule the board record of compensation and service may not be corrected after four years in the absence of fraud.a majority of the board finds no evidence of fraud in the record see,retro.employee serv.credit,employer status deter.
after the board issued its decision denying sharp,ruth,and honea request for additional service credit,their attorney,who also represented potts,requested reconsideration of the board decisions denying all four claimants retroactive service credit beyond four years the four again argued that weyerhaeuser had committed fraud and that they were entitled to rra service credit beyond the four years already authorized.on june,the board reversed its earlier holding as to all four employees and granted them retroactive service credit back to the limit set forth in section.see weyerhaeuser car shop,ret.bd.june,employer serv.deter.on recon.after noting its prior decisions,in which it found no evidence that weyerhaeuser committed fraud,the board cited the anacostia report and concluded that that report did or should have put weyerhaeuser on notice of the nature of the issue regarding the reporting of service performed by its employees for the affiliated carriers and created reasonable expectations that such service should be creditable under the acts.id.at.the board added that neither section of the rra nor section of the board regulations should be applied to bar the employees from receiving additional retroactive service credit.id.at.accordingly,the board ordered that sharp,ruth,honea,and potts receive retroactive service credit back to,id.at,which in effect added six years of service credit for sharp,ruth,and honea and four years for potts.weyerhaeuser filed a petition for review of the june,decision in this court.sharp,ruth,honea,and potts intervened in this appeal,arguing that the board erred in limiting the retroactive service credit to,maintaining they are entitled to retroactive service credit for every year they worked at weyerhaeuser.
two other employees of weyerhaeuser,ben bramlett and karen neumeier,also intervened in this appeal.bramlett and neumeier both were treated as employees subject to the rra provisions since,but they claim that they were entitled to retroactive service credit for the years from through and through,respectively.in august,the board concluded that bramlett and neumeier were not entitled to retroactive service credit because more than four years had passed and there was no evidence in the record of employer fraud in connection with bramlett and neumeier.see.
bramlett and neumeier sought reconsideration of that decision.the board affirmed its initial determination,concluding again that there was no evidence of fraud for the period of through.at.in so ruling,the board added that bramlett and neumeier are precluded from obtaining retroactive service credit more than twenty years after the alleged conduct by weyerhaeuser.at.bramlett and neumeier seek to overturn the board decision on appeal.

on appeal,weyerhaeuser first claims that the board decision to grant retroactive service credit beyond four years to sharp,ruth,honea,and potts lacks a reasonable basis in the law because the regulations allow for such retroactive service credit only in the event of fraud,and the board concluded that there was no evidence of fraud.we agree.as quoted above,provides that the board records are conclusive unless rra employment taxes previously had been paid and either error correction or principles of equity require that the employee received additional retroactive service credit or the employee erroneous service record is due to employer fraud.the parties agree that the first exception does not apply,thus leaving the fraud exception as the only possible way for the intervening parties to obtain retroactive service credit beyond four years.
in this case,though,the board found there was no evidence of fraud.see potts,at.t he board regards the contention that fraud was committed as a very serious accusation and does not find that the failure of weyerhaeuser to report potts service and compensation constituted fraud even though a management study stated that certain weyerhaeuser company employees worked exclusively for dequeen and another affiliated railroad.at denying sharp,ruth,and honea request for additional years of retroactive service credit,concluding that as a general rule the board record of compensation and service may not be corrected after four years in the absence of fraud.a majority of the board finds no evidence of fraud in the record.significantly,on reconsideration the board did not find that weyerhaeuser had committed fraud.rather,the board concluded that the anacostia report did or should have put weyerhaeuser on notice of the nature of the issue regarding the reporting of service performed by its employees for the affiliated carriers and created reasonable expectations that such service should be creditable under the acts.see at.the board then added that neither section of the rra nor section of the board regulations should be applied to bar the employees from receiving additional retroactive service credit.id.at.
that,however,is exactly what section of the board regulations employees from receiving additional retroactive service credit absent limited circumstances,such as employer fraud.specifically,c provides that e xcept as provided in paragraph b of this section,no employee may be credited beyond the four year period unless the employee established to the satisfaction of the board that all employment taxes have been paid with respect to the compensation and service.because employment taxes have not been paid on behalf of the six claimants,service credit is only creditable beyond four years,as provided in paragraph b,and that section states that t he board may correct a report of compensation after four years where the compensation was posted or not posted as the result of fraud on the part of the employer.b.
on appeal,the board readily admits that it did not find that weyerhaeuser company committed fraud,as that term is commonly used,in connection with weyerhaeuser company failure to report compensation for the individuals for whom it now concedes are or were employees of the dequeen and eastern railroad.board respondent,brief at.the board attempts to sidestep this concession in two main ways.first,it notes that b does not define fraud,and then the board points out that it had previously found that the knowing failure to report compensation and service as required under the railroad retirement act,met the standard set forth in section b and would support the requirement of retroactive crediting of service and compensation.board respondent,brief at.similarly,the intervening respondents point to other board decisions granting retroactive service credit beyond four years,which were based on an employer knowing failure to report compensation.intervening respondents and petitioners brief at.from this,we understand the board and intervening respondents to be arguing that,since the regulations do not define fraud,the board has discretion to interpret that term to mean the knowing failure to report compensation.the problem with this argument is that the board,in this case,did not find that weyerhaeuser had knowingly failed to report compensation.rather,the board found that the anacostia report did or should have put weyerhaeuser on notice of the nature of the issue regarding the reporting of service performed by its employees for the affiliated carriers and created reasonable expectations that such service should be creditable under the acts.see at.thus,rather than apply the knowing standard the board seemingly puts forth for fraud on appeal,the board applied a did or should have had notice standard.and even then,the board did not conclude that weyerhaeuser knew or should have had notice that it was required to report compensation under the merely concluded that the report did or should have put weyerhaeuser on notice of the nature of the issue,and created reasonable expectations that such service should be creditable under the acts.thus,the board decision can not stand even applying its favored definition of fraud.
the board also puts forth an equitable argument for sustaining its decision it argues that because weyerhaeuser company knew or should have known that the individuals should be receiving credit for service performed for dequeen and eastern while they were on the weyerhaeuser company payroll,board respondent,brief at,it is equitable that these individuals receive credit under these circumstances.id.initially,we note that in its decision on reconsideration,the board never found that weyerhaeuser knew or should have known that the individuals should be receiving credit rather,as noted above,the board found that weyerhaeuser knew or should have known of the issue.knowing that something is an issue is quite different than knowing that you are legally required to report service credit.regardless,the regulations that the board itself promulgated do not provide an equitable exception to the bar.rather,the only exception relevant to this appeal is the fraud exception.yet on reconsideration the board did not address the question of fraud,instead stating that it need not make a finding as to whether weyerhaeuser willfully failed to report certain of its employees under the rra.at.the board can not ignore its own regulations merely because it finds them inequitable under the circumstances of this case.see rhodes johnson,cir noting that while an agency has discretion to reasonably interpret its regulations,this must not be confused with the power to rewrite unambiguous regulations pearce director,office of workers comp.programs,cir stating that it is well settled that reasonable regulations promulgated pursuant to statutory authority have the force and effect of law and an agency is bound by its own regulations.see also panhandle pipe line fed.energy regulatory comm n,noting that t he fact that a regulation as written does not provide the agency a quick way to reach a desired result does not authorize it to ignore the regulation or label it inappropriate.therefore,there is no basis in law for the board decision on reconsideration that sharp,ruth,honea,and potts are entitled to retroactive service credit beyond four years.
weyerhaeuser argues that upon overturning the board decision on reconsideration,there is no need for remand because the board had already concluded that there was no evidence of fraud.the board in its earlier decisions had found that there was no evidence of fraud.see.but those decisions are not before this court.rather,the only decision before this court is the board decision on reconsideration.although the board decision on reconsideration can not stand because it failed to apply the fraud standard established in its own regulations,the intervening respondents had sought reconsideration of the board initial decision that there was no evidence of fraud.the board never addressed that question on reconsideration.see at stating that the board need not make a finding as to whether weyerhaeuser willfully failed to report certain of its employees under the rra.accordingly,we must remand this case to the board to rule on the motion for reconsideration applying the proper standard,at least as to intervening respondents sharp,ruth,and honea.there is no need to remand for intervening respondent potts because,as discussed below,the board violated its own regulations in reopening potts case.
as set forth above,the board originally concluded in may that potts was entitled to retroactive service credit for the years through.potts sought reconsideration of that decision,arguing that he was entitled to credit for additional years that he had worked for weyerhaeuser.the board denied potts request for reconsideration in may,and potts did not appeal that decision.however,when the board granted sharp,ruth,and honea request for reconsideration,the board also reopen ed the decision regarding potts request for reconsideration,and then concluded that potts should receive credit back to.see at.the regulations,though,limit the board authority to reopen decisions relating to employee status determination.the board regulations provide for the finality of determinations issued under this part,stating 
any determination rendered by the board at the initial or reconsideration stages shall be considered a final determination and shall be binding with respect to all parties unless reversed on reconsideration or upon judicial review.a final determination may be reopened at the request of a party who was,or could have been,a party to the final determination when the party alleges that the law or the facts upon which the final determination was based changed sufficiently to warrant a contrary determination.
thus,the board only had the power to reopen potts case if the law or the facts upon which the final determination was based changed sufficiently to warrant a contrary determination.id.
on appeal,the board does not claim that the law changed.rather,the board asserts that its decision granting sharp,ruth,and honea reconsideration is a change of facts which justifies the board reopening of its decision as to potts.board respondent,brief at.section of the regulations,however,only allows for the reopening of a decision if there was a change in facts upon which the final determination was based id.but in denying potts request for reconsideration,the board did not base its decision on the fact that sharp,ruth,and honea were also denied retroactive service credit beyond four years rather,the board based its decision on the lack of evidence of fraud.thus,none of the underlying facts upon which the board final determination as to potts request for reconsideration changed.therefore,section of the regulations does not authorize the board to reopen potts case.while the board argues that it would be inequitable to treat potts differently than sharp,ruth,and honea w hen an administrative agency promulgates rules to govern its proceedings,these rules must be scrupulously observed for once an agency exercises its discretion and creates the procedural rules under which it desires to have its actions judged,it denies itself the right to violate these rules.black interstate commerce comm n,cir.we further noted in black,i f an agency in its proceedings violates its rules and prejudice results,any action taken as a result of the proceedings can not stand.id.
the board also attempts to justify its decision to reopen potts case by noting that the board reopened potts case on its own initiative and that the board has the discretion to reopen any case where the board deems it proper to do so.board respondent,brief at.in support of its position,the board cites,entitled discretion of the board to reopen or not to reopen a final decision.potts likewise relies on section as a basis for reopening his case.that section provides 
in any case in which the board may deem proper,the board may direct that any decision,which is otherwise subject to reopening under this part,shall not be reopened or direct that any decision,which is otherwise not subject to reopening under this part,shall be reopened.
while section provides the board with discretion to reopen cases that are not otherwise subject to reopening,that language is modified by under this part.this part is part.further,b provides that a final decision as that term is used in this part means any decision of the type listed in of this chapter section provides for decisions by the board on claims for benefits under the rra potts,however,was not seeking benefits under the rra and the board was not reopening a final decision of the type listed in.rather,the board decision concerned potts status as an employee under the rra and that decision involved part.see.thus,by its own terms,does not apply to this case.
the board does not cite any other statutory or regulatory provisions that would authorize it to reopen potts case,and thus has forfeited any other basis for reopening the case since the only regulation applicable limits the board authority to reopen cases to circumstances not present here,the board acted contrary to the law in reopening potts case,and that decision must be reversed.the board may not like its regulations,but as noted above,w hen an administrative agency promulgates rules to govern its proceedings,these rules must be scrupulously observed for once an agency exercises its discretion and creates the procedural rules under which it desires to have its actions judged,it denies itself the right to violate these rules.black.
that brings us to sharp,ruth,honea,and potts claim that the board erred in limiting retroactive credit to.while we must remand this case for the board to apply the required fraud standard to determine whether sharp,ruth and honea were entitled to retroactive credit to,remand is not necessary to resolve sharp,ruth,honea and potts petition challenging the board refusal to grant them credit for th
