michelle gilstrap has difficulty walking because of osteoarthritis and other health problems.she alleges that,on two airplane trips in and,united air lines united did not provide her with adequate assistance moving through the airport and that she suffered physical and emotional injuries as a result.gilstrap sued united,alleging several causes of action under california state tort law and a violation of title iii of the americans with disabilities act of ada.our questions are whether gilstrap claims are preempted by the federal air carrier access act acaa and,if so,in what respect and whether airport terminals are among the places of public accommodation governed by title iii of the ada.
factual and procedural history 
michelle gilstrap has difficulty walking because she has a collapsed disc in her back,one replaced knee,another knee that needs replacing,and osteoarthritis.in august she flew on united from los angeles to calgary,from calgary to chicago and finally from milwaukee back to los angeles via denver.gilstrap again flew on united in december,this time from burbank,california,to madison,wisconsin via denver when booking both sets of flights,gilstrap requested that united provide her with wheelchair assistance for moving through the airports.
during both trips,united failed repeatedly to provide gilstrap with the assistance that she requested.at one airport,gilstrap located a wheelchair on her own at other airports she was provided a wheelchair by united only after prolonged insistence and up to minutes of waiting and at others she was never able to locate a wheelchair at all and had to walk.gilstrap alleges various physical injuries as a result of having to walk,including,after the august trip,severe pain that was treated with an epidural injection.gilstrap also alleges that united agents yelled at her,expressed skepticism that she actually needed a wheelchair,and twice directed her to stand in line which she could not do because of her disabilities.at one point during her travels,a united agent whom she asked for assistance unilaterally rebooked her onto a later flight,telling her that this was what she got for refusing to stand in line.
gilstrap sued united,alleging several counts under california tort law,including negligence,negligent misrepresentation,breach of duty of a common carrier,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and negligent infliction of emotional distress.in addition,the complaint maintains that united violated title iii of the ada.gilstrap seeks compensatory damages for physical and emotional injuries,including reimbursement for her medical bills,exemplary and punitive damages,and litigation costs.gilstrap does not allege a cause of action under the acaa itself.rather,her complaint cites the acaa as relevant to establishing her negligence claims.under the california evidentiary rule of negligence per se,a violation of a statute,ordinance,or regulation can support a rebuttable presumption of failure to exercise due care.cal.a.
united filed a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted the motion in its entirety,dismissing gilstrap complaint with prejudice.the district court held that all of gilstrap california tort claims were both conflict and by the acaa.
the primary basis for the district court ruling was that t he acaa does not expressly provide a private right of action for violations of the statute or its regulations,but instead provides for administrative investigation of complaints.on that ground,the district court concluded that congress intended the federal aviation act administrative enforcement scheme to be the exclusive remedy for violations of the acaa and its regulations and that state lawsuits against airlines would conflict with that congressional intent.the district court further held that gilstrap claims were by the acaa regulations pertaining to wheelchair assistance codified in part,subpart g.as to gilstrap ada claim,the district court held that title iii of the ada does not apply to airport terminals,because the statute applies only to places of public accommodation and expressly excludes terminals for aircraft from its definition of that phrase.
ii.statutory and regulatory background 
a.the air carrier access act 
the acaa is an amendment to the federal aviation act faa the original faa,passed in,included a requirement that air carriers not subject any particular person to any unjust discrimination or any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever,repealed by,stat.this requirement was repealed by the airline deregulation act of,repealed by,stat,leaving passengers with disabilities without express protection against discrimination by commercial airlines.see shinault am.airlines,cir.
a different statute,of the rehabilitation act of provides generally that individuals with disabilities may not be excluded from or discriminated against by programs.see dep t of transp.paralyzed veterans of,d.in,the civil aeronautics board,the federal agency then in charge of airline regulation,promulgated regulations applying to those commercial airlines that received direct federal subsidies.id.at.organizations representing individuals with disabilities collectively,paralyzed veterans of america,or pva,challenged those regulations,seeking to apply to all commercial airlines,on the ground that airlines not receiving direct federal subsidies were indirect recipients of federal funding for airport construction and for the federally operated air traffic control system.id.the supreme court rejected pva arguments,holding that commercial airlines were beneficiaries,not recipients,of federal grants for airport construction and that the air traffic control system was not a form of federal financial assistance to airlines.id.at.
congress responded to paralyzed veterans by passing the acaa.an amendment to the faa,the acaa provide d that prohibitions of discrimination against handicapped individuals shall apply to air carriers.air carrier access act of,a,stat.see shinault,at.in its original form,the acaa prohibited air carriers from discriminat ing against any otherwise qualified handicapped individual,by reason of such handicap,in the provision of air transportation,and directed the secretary of transportation to promulgate regulations to ensure treatment of qualified handicapped individuals consistent with safe carriage of all passengers on air carriers.air carrier access act of,stat.
in its current version,effective december,the pertinent sections of the acaa read as follows 
discrimination against handicapped individuals 
a in general.in providing air transportation,an air carrier,including subject to section b any foreign air carrier,may not discriminate against an otherwise qualified individual on the following grounds 
the individual has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.
the individual has a record of such an impairment.
the individual is regarded as having such an impairment.
b each act constitutes separate offense.for purposes of section,a separate violation occurs under this section for each individual act of discrimination prohibited by subsection a.
c investigation of complaints.
in general.the secretary shall investigate each complaint of a violation of subsection a.
although the acaa itself no longer includes an express directive that the secretary of transportation promulgate regulations it is covered by the faa general authorization that the secretary may take action consider ed necessary to carry out the faa air commerce and safety provisions,including conducting investigations,prescribing regulations,standards,and procedures,and issuing orders.id.a.
pursuant to that authorization,the department of transportation dot issued regulations,codified at part,specifying the detailed requirements that airlines must meet to comply with the acaa.the regulations impose four general duties on air carriers not to discriminate against any qualified individual with a disability,by reason of such disability,in the provision of air transportation not to require a qualified individual with a disability to accept special services that the individual does not request not to exclude a qualified individual with a disability from or deny the person the benefit of any air transportation or related services that are available to other persons,with certain limited exceptions and not to take any adverse action against an individual,refusing to provide transportation because the individual asserts,on his or her own behalf or through or on behalf of others,rights protected by the regulations or the acaa.a 
with respect to assistance moving through the airport,air carriers must provide or ensure the provision of assistance requested by or on behalf of a passenger with a disability in transportation between gates to make a connection to another flight and in moving from the terminal entrance or a vehicle point adjacent to the entrance through the airport to the gate for a departing flight,or from the gate to the terminal entrance or a vehicle point adjacent to the entrance after an arriving flight,including assistance in accessing key functional areas of the terminal,such as ticket counters and baggage claim.id.a b.such assistance must include,if the passenger requires it,assistance with transporting the passenger or luggage.id.d.carriers must also promptly provide or ensure the provision of assistance requested by or on behalf of passengers with a disability in enplaning and deplaning,including,as needed,the services of personnel and the use of ground wheelchairs,accessible motorized carts,boarding wheelchairs,wheelchairs and ramps or mechanical lifts.id.a.
the dot regulations also explain the training requirements that air carriers must meet carriers must,for example,train all personnel who deal with the traveling public,as appropriate to the duties of each employee,in,among other topics,the requirements of the acaa regulations the airline procedures regarding passengers with disabilities appropriate boarding and deplaning assistance procedures that safeguard the safety and dignity of passengers and awareness and appropriate responses to passengers with a disability.id.a.
the acaa is enforced through three administrative mechanisms.first,the act directs the secretary of transportation to collect and publish data on complaints and to report annually to congress on all complaints received.c.second,the implementing regulations require that each airline maintain an internal dispute resolution program for collecting,responding to,and reporting passenger complaints of discrimination on the basis of a disability.see et.
finally,the faa provides a general administrative enforcement scheme for all its air commerce and safety provisions,which include the acaa.under this scheme,any person may file a complaint with the secretary of transportation about an alleged regulatory violation.a.after investigation notice,and an opportunity for a hearing,the secretary shall issue an order to compel compliance if a violation is found.id.a.the dot may also impose civil penalties upon air carriers of up to per violation.id.a.pursuant to certain procedural requirements,any person disclosing a substantial interest in an order issued by the secretary of transportation may petition for judicial review of that order in a court of appeals.id.
these remedies are not exclusive,however the faa provision cautions that a remedy under this part is in addition to any other remedies provided by law,id.c,and requires air carriers to maintain liability insurance sufficient to pay for bodily injury,death,loss of property,or damage to property resulting from the operation or maintenance of the aircraft,id.
we have not squarely decided in this circuit whether,in addition to these administrative enforcement mechanisms,the acaa may be enforced through private lawsuits shortly after its enactment,two circuits interpreted the acaa to imply a private cause of action.shinault,at tallarico trans world airlines,cir.after those cases were decided,however,alexander sandoval,d,narrowed the framework for evaluating whether a statute implies a private cause of action.all three circuits to consider the question since sandoval have concluded that the acaa does not imply a private cause of action.see lopez jet blue airways,cir boswell skywest airlines,cir love delta air lines,cir.we need not,and do not,reach that question in this opinion,because gilstrap does not allege a cause of action under the acaa.
b.the americans with disabilities act 
congress passed the ada in to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities,stat.july,codified at b.the ada includes three main sections title i,which concerns employment discrimination,et title ii,which governs access to public services,id.et and title iii,which governs access to privately operated public accommodations,such as restaurants and movie theaters,id.et.
title iii prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in public accommodations and includes an express list of the private entities that are considered public accommodations for purposes of the statute.id.the list includes a terminal,depot,or other station used for specified public transportation.id.g.the term specified public transportation is defined,in turn,as transportation by bus,rail,or any other conveyance other than by aircraft that provides the general public with general or special service including charter service on a regular and continuing basis.id.emphasis added.
recognizing that aircraft are expressly excluded from the statutory definition of specified public transportation whose terminals are governed by title iii,the department of justice doj,which implements the ada,interprets title iii as not covering t he operations of any portion of any airport that are under the control of an air carrier,and specifies that such areas are covered by the air carrier access act,not the ada,and thus under the regulatory jurisdiction of the dot,not the doj.see pt.app.concomitantly,p laces of public accommodation located within airports,but not under the control of air carriers,such as restaurants,shops,lounges,or conference centers,are covered by title iii.id 
iii.analysis 
this case was dismissed at the pleading stage,for failure to state a claim.accepting the facts in the complaint as true and in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,we must determine whether the complaint factual allegations,taken as true,state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.united states corinthian,cir.
acaa preemption and gilstrap claims 
federal law may preempt state law in three ways.first,congress may withdraw specified powers from the states by enacting a statute containing an express preemption provision.arizona united states,d.second,states are precluded from regulating conduct in a field that congress,acting within its proper authority,has determined must be regulated by its exclusive governance.id.at.finally,state laws are preempted when they conflict with federal law.id.regardless of the type of preemption involved express,field,or conflict t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone of analysis.cipollone liggett,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the acaa does not contain an express preemption provision we therefore analyze whether it implies a congressional intent to preempt state lawsuits under either field or conflict preemption and,if so,in what respect.
field preemption 
before analyzing whether the acaa has any effect upon state lawsuits,we first review our case law on field preemption under the faa more generally.the faa includes two important statements indicating a general congressional intent not to preempt tort suits against airlines the savings clause providing that a remedy under this part is in addition to any other remedies provided by law,c,and the requirement that airlines maintain liability insurance for injuries and property damage,id.the latter requirement is important as to the statute preemptive status,because the faa does create a federal cause of action for personal injury suits the liability insurance clause therefore can only contemplate tort suits brought under state law.martin ex rel.heckman midwest express holdings,cir.
reflecting these provisions,we have in several instances held that claims are not displaced by the faa.for instance,we held in charas trans world airlines,cir en banc,that the airline deregulation act of,which amended the faa to include an express preemption provision applicable to certain state regulations was intended to preempt only state laws and lawsuits that would adversely affect the economic deregulation of the airlines and not to preempt passengers personal injury claims.although charas did not consider faa preemption in general,its clear implication is that the faa is not broadly of state tort suits charas reversed several district court and panel decisions for interpreting airline deregulation act preemption too broadly,a holding that would have been unnecessary if all the claims at issue were preempted anyway by the faa.martin,at.
later,in martin,we developed with more precision than in charas the overall principles of faa field preemption.first,martin considered whether an earlier case,montalvo spirit airlines,cir,had determined that all personal injury claims related to aviation are broadly by the faa.in montalvo,we had concluded that the plaintiffs negligence claims,premised on a theory,were preempted by the faa.id.at.noting that the faa implementing regulations required certain warnings,we held in montalvo that the plaintiffs tort theory was preempted,because it would have established through state tort liability a more stringent warning requirement for airlines than that established by federal law.id.in the course of so deciding,montalvo,relying on abdullah american airlines,cir,contained some broad language concerning the reach of faa preemption.see montalvo,at.
martin clarified that montalvo should not be read as expansively holding that the faa preempts all state law personal injury claims.martin,at.rather,martin held that where there are pervasive regulations in an area,like passenger warnings,the faa preempts all state law claims in that area.id.at.in areas without pervasive regulations or other grounds for preemption,however,the state standard of care remains applicable.id.in so concluding,martin relied in part on the faa and insurance provisions quoted earlier in part on a second aspect of montalvo,remanding for further consideration other tort claims that would have been preempted had the faa preempted all personal injury claims and in part on the observation that the charas holding could not coexist with a holding that all related state tort claims are preempted.see id.at.
applying its nuanced standard,martin held that the faa did not preempt a state tort lawsuit involving aircraft stairs because,in contrast to the lengthy list of federal regulations on passenger warnings,the only federal regulation on airstairs is that they ca be designed in a way that might block the emergency exits.id.at.that stray regulation,we held,was not enough to deem aircraft stairs pervasively regulated.id.at.
as noted in martin,the third circuit has taken a slightly different approach to faa field preemption.see id.the third circuit leading faa field preemption case,abdullah,held that federal law establishes the applicable standards of care in the field of air safety,but does not preempt state remedies.id.at emphasis added.in so holding,abdullah followed the supreme court reasoning in silkwood kerr mcgee,d,which established,in the context of atomic energy regulation,that f ederal preemption of state and territorial standards of care can coexist with state and territorial tort remedies.abdullah,at.
in our own faa preemption cases,we have cited abdullah approvingly,see montalvo,at,and neutrally,see martin,at.we have also adopted abdullah holding that federal law generally establishes the applicable standards of care in the field of aviation safety.montalvo,at emphasis added.but we have not adopted abdullah implicit distinction between safety and other airline regulations,elaborated in elassaad independence air,cir.the faa governs not only aviation safety,but also aviation commerce.the breadth of the faa is relevant in this case,because the acaa which is codified under the economic regulation,not the safety,subpart of the faa see subt.vii,pt.a,subt.ii is an antidiscrimination imperative,not a safety regulation 
nor,before now,have we clearly indicated whether we would follow abdullah distinction between the faa preemptive effect upon standards of care and remedies,whether we would agree that it may sometimes be possible for state remedies to survive faa preemption even where the state standard of care has been preempted.neither montalvo nor martin needed to reach this question in montalvo,the plaintiffs sought to impose a higher standard of care than the federal standard,rather than to combine the federal standard of care with state remedies as in abdullah,so their suit was preempted altogether.and martin held that the plaintiff tort suit was not preempted at all,either as to the standard of care or the remedy 
we find persuasive,and here adopt,abdullah division of the faa field preemptive effect into two components state standards of care,which may be by pervasive regulations,and state remedies,which may survive even if the standard of care is so preempted.as abdullah persuasively reasoned,the supreme court has held in other regulatory contexts that f ederal preemption of state and territorial standards of care can coexist with state and territorial tort remedies.at citing silkwood.although abdullah relied upon silkwood,an atomic energy case,the same principle emerges from the series of supreme court preemption cases arising under the medical device act mda.in those cases,the supreme court has established that the mda does not preempt a claim for violating a duty that parallels a duty under the mda.stengel medtronic,slip op.at cir,en banc construing medtronic,lohr,d,and subsequent cases.the mda cases are not precisely on point with those applying the faa unlike the faa,the mda contains an express preemption provision specifying that states may not impose requirements different from,or in addition to,the mda requirements for medical devices.a l see stengel,slip op.at.however,these cases do proceed from the general premise that states may provide a traditional damages remedy for violations of duties when those duties parallel federal requirements,stengel,slip op.at quoting lohr,at,absent any express or implied congressional indication otherwise in the statutory scheme at issue.here,not only is there no adverse indication,but the faa sections expressly preserving state remedies and requiring insurance coverage support the conclusion that state law damages actions remain available even when state substantive standards are displaced.we therefore so hold.
in sum,then,our cases culminating in martin,combined with the division between standards of care and remedies discussed above,establish a framework for evaluating field preemption under the faa.first,we ask whether the particular area of aviation commerce and safety implicated by the lawsuit is governed by pervasive federal regulations.see martin,at.if so,then any applicable state standards of care are preempted.even in those areas,however,the scope of field preemption extends only to the standard of care.local law still govern s the other negligence elements breach,causation,and damages,as well as the choice and availability of remedies.elassaad,at construing abdullah and because the acaa is an amendment to the faa and includes no indication that it should be treated independently for preemption purposes,we apply that framework here.
applying that framework,then,we first look to the area of aviation commerce and safety at issue in this case assistance for passengers with disabilities and determine whether,and in what respects,it is pervasively regulated.taking gilstrap allegations as true and in the light most favorable to her,as we are required to do given the procedural posture,her claims concern two aspects of the service provided by united.first,united did not provide the assistance that gilstrap requested for moving through the airports.second,united agents were hostile to gilstrap throughout her travels.we consider the acaa regulations preemptive effect,if any,upon each theory of liability in turn 
first,as to assistance in moving through the airport the acaa regulations are pervasive as to when and where air carriers must provide such assistance.the regulations spell out in detail that air carriers must provide assistance when a passenger with a disability requests it for moving between gates to make a connection to another flight,a moving from the terminal entrance or a vehicle point adjacent to the entrance through the airport to the gate for a departing flight,or from the gate to the terminal entrance or a vehicle point adjacent to the entrance after arriving flight,including accessing key functional areas of the terminal,such as ticket counters and baggage claim,id.b and for enplaning and deplaning,id.a.this assistance must include,as needed,the services of personnel and the use of ground wheelchairs,accessible motorized carts,boarding wheelchairs,wheelchairs,and ramps or mechanical lifts.id 
gilstrap negligence and claims challenge united failure to provide her with assistance at all in traversing the air terminal before,between,and after flights.the acaa and its implementing regulations establish the standard of care or duty that united owed to gilstrap regarding that activity,and so preempt any different or higher standard of care that may exist under california tort law.
but gilstrap may still rely on california tort law to prove the other elements of her claims breach,causation,damages,and remedies.in other words,if the evidence at trial shows that united provided gilstrap with all the assistance required under the acaa and its implementing regulations,then united can not be held liable under state law for failing to do anything further.if the evidence at trial shows that united fell short of compliance with the acaa and its implementing regulations,then whether gilstrap may recover for any injuries that she may be able to prove were caused by united breach will depend upon the degree to which california tort law recognizes the acaa standard of care as applicable in negligence and common carrier claims premised on duties to disabled passengers.
second,gilstrap alleges that united agents were repeatedly hostile to her throughout her travels.to the extent that gilstrap challenges the manner in which united agents responded to her requests for assistance,as in her negligent infliction of emotional distress and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims,field preemption is not implicated.the acaa regulations say nothing about how airline agents should interact with passengers whether gilstrap complaint makes out a prima facie case of either negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress under california law is,of course,a separate matter.
because the district court held gilstrap claims entirely preempted,it did not determine whether the california causes of action would survive under california tort law,incorporating the acaa standards as to negligence and duty of common carriers but not as to negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress.we leave those issues to be determined in the first instance on remand.
conflict preemption 
even if state remedies are not by the acaa,they may still be barred if they would create an actual conflict between state and federal law.cipollone,at.conflict preemption occurs when it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.english,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
it is certainly not impossible for an airline both to comply with federal regulations and to pay damages in state tort suits.the question is whether allowing state tort remedies would pose an obstacle to the achievement of the acaa objectives.united argues,and the district court agreed,that gilstrap claims are because congress did not provide a private cause of action to enforce the acaa.therefore,united argues,and the district court concluded,allowing state tort litigation against airlines would pose an obstacle to congress objective of making the faa administrative enforcement scheme the exclusive remedy for acaa violations.
we need not,and do not,reach here the question of whether the acaa provides a private cause of action because,as a general matter,we do not agree that analysis turns on whether a statute provides a federal cause of action.that congress has not chosen to provide a federal cause of action to enforce a statute does not necessarily mean that all conceivably related state claims are displaced.
the district court relied on aetna health davila,d,to connect the absence of a federal cause of action to conflict preemption of state remedies.davila,however,interpreted the employee retirement income security act.that statute expresses clear congressional intent to make its remedy exclusive,davila,at,and so is not an apt comparison to the faa statutory scheme,which,as noted,states precisely the opposite that a remedy under this part is in addition to any other remedies provided by law,c.the determination whether state remedies conflict with the objectives of a federal enforcement scheme must always be tailored to the specific statutory and regulatory context at issue.
two supreme court cases,read together,provide some guidance in identifying the federal regulatory schemes with which state tort remedies would necessarily impermissibly conflict silkwood,d,and buckman plaintiffs legal,d.silkwood considered the preemptive effect of federal nuclear safety regulations,holding that the federal government had preempted the field of nuclear safety with respect to the substantive standard of care.but silkwood added that state remedies are foreclosed only if there is an irreconcilable conflict between the federal and state liability standards or the imposition of a state standard in a damages action would frustrate the objectives of the federal law.see at.in silkwood,there was no such conflict congress stated purpose was to promote atomic energy only to the extent it is consistent with the health and safety of the public.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.awarding state damages for plaintiffs injured through nuclear development would not frustrate that cabined purpose.id.
buckman,by contrast,did find a conflict between federal regulations and any state tort liability,where the tort claim at issue was uniquely dependent on the federal regulatory regime.alleging that a regulatory consulting company had defrauded the federal drug administration fda in the course of obtaining approval for its client medical device,the buckman plaintiffs brought a claim.at.
the buckman court distinguished silkwood in two ways.first,the state claims in silkwood were based on traditional state tort law principles.buckman,at.in contrast,the very existence of the relevant federal enactments was a critical element of the buckman plaintiffs claim.id.at see also stengel,slip op.at watford,concurring central to the court reasoning in buckman was that the state law claim asserted there exist ed solely by virtue of the federal enactments.quoting buckman,at first alteration and emphasis in original.second,the federal statute at issue in silkwood provided specific statutory evidence that congress did not intend to preclude remedies.buckman,at.the federal statute at issue in buckman,however,provided clear evidence that congress intended that it be enforced exclusively by the federal government.id.citing a.
applying these distinctions,our case is considerably closer to silkwood than to buckman,on both fronts.first,here as in silkwood,the plaintiff claims rely on traditional state tort law.under california law,proving that united violated the acaa regulations may help gilstrap to establish certain rebuttable presumptions regarding the scope of an airline duty to individuals in gilstrap circumstances.but if the acaa and its implementing regulations did not exist,she could sti
