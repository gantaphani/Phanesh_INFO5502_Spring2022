in morillion royal packing cal th,d,morillion,the california supreme court held that employees must be compensated for travel time when their employer requires them to travel to a work site on buses.plaintiff,a former disneyland employee,was assigned parking in a lot one mile from the employee entrance to disneyland.disney provided a shuttle from this lot to the employee entrance.plaintiff brought a proposed class action on behalf of all disney employees who parked in the satellite lot,seeking compensation for their travel time on the shuttle.as it is undisputed that disney employees were not required to drive to work and take the shuttle,we conclude this case falls outside the mandate of morillion.we therefore affirm the summary judgment in favor of disney.
factual and procedural background 
the controlling facts are not in dispute.defendants walt disney world company and walt disney company collectively disney own and operate the disneyland resort disneyland in anaheim.disneyland consists of two theme parks disneyland park and disney california adventure,a shopping district downtown disney,and three hotels.prior to its expansion in,disneyland consisted of the disneyland park only a sizeable parking lot was located directly to the south of disneyland park.employees would park in this lot.they then entered disneyland park from an entrance near the southeast corner of disneyland park,known as harbor pointe employees would simply park in the lot,walk to harbor pointe,and clock in.
when disneyland expanded in,disney california adventure was constructed in the space that had previously been occupied by the parking lot.parking,for both visitors to disneyland and employees,had to be relocated.as disneyland stands today,there are at least four employee parking lots the katella lot,the ball lot,the simba lot,and the team disney anaheim tda lot.there are also several different employee entrances into disneyland.each lot,except the katella lot,is located within walking distance of an employee entrance.employees are assigned to parking lots based on their assigned work sites in disneyland employees assigned to lots other than the katella lot simply walk to the nearest entry,clock in,and proceed to their work sites.employees who enter disneyland at the harbor pointe entrance are assigned parking in the katella lot.disney runs free shuttle buses from the katella lot to harbor pointe the distance is approximately one mile.
plaintiff bobby overton was employed by disney as a disneyland security guard beginning in at that time,he parked in the large lot that was adjacent to disneyland park,and entered at harbor pointe.when that parking lot was demolished to make space for disney california adventure,overton was assigned parking in the katella lot and rode the shuttle to harbor pointe.overton had to arrive substantially earlier to the katella lot to wait for and ride the shuttle in order to arrive on time for work.believing himself to be entitled to compensation for this extra time,overton brought this suit against disney.
overton sought to bring a class action on behalf of all hourly disneyland employees who have been required either expressly during a period of construction,or as a de facto requirement due to disney failure to provide vehicle parking to report for work at various locations designated by disney,including,but not limited to the katella l ot and who thereafter were required to travel on vehicles controlled by disney to and from their place of assignment,and who were not compensated by disney for the time spent in such travel.overton complaint,which was filed september,encompassed the time period beginning on september.
the parties filed for summary judgment or summary adjudication,based on morillion.the following facts were undisputed while approximately ninety percent of disneyland employees drove to work,either alone or in carpools,ten percent chose alternative forms of transportation alternative forms of transportation were not prohibited by disney,and were,in fact,encouraged some of the alternative forms of transportation used were buses,trains,being dropped off by friends or family,and vanpools each of these enumerated alternative forms of transportation enabled disney employees to arrive directly at harbor pointe,bypassing the katella lot altogether vanpools existed from overton city for every shift at disneyland vanpools were given preferential parking in the tda lot employees who parked in the katella lot were not mandated to take the shuttle,and could walk or bicycle from the katella lot to harbor pointe and employees who parked in the katella lot were not required to take any particular shuttle they could choose to come early and have breakfast or lunch at disneyland.
on these facts,the trial court concluded morillion did not apply,and granted summary judgment in favor of disney.overton filed a timely notice of appeal.
contentions of the parties 
overton contends that parking in the katella lot and riding the shuttle were required within the meaning of morillion.disney responds that the undisputed facts prove that parking in the katella lot and taking the shuttle were not required.we agree with disney and therefore affirm.

as this case involves a straightforward application of the supreme court opinion in morillion,supra,cal th,d,we set forth the court analysis at length.the facts in that case involved agricultural employees.their employer,royal,required them to meet for work each day at specified parking lots or assembly areas.after the employees met at these departure points,royal transported them,in buses that royal provided and paid for,to the fields where the employees actually worked.at the end of each day,royal transported the employees back to the departure points on its buses.royal rules prohibited employees from using their own transportation to get to and from the fields.id.at,d.in fact,if an employee drove to the fields rather than riding royal bus,the employee would be warned for a first offense and sent home for a second.id.at,fn,d.
the issue before the supreme court was whether the time spent traveling on royal buses constituted hours worked under the governing industrial welfare commission wage order.that wage order,which is identical to the governing wage order in this case,defined hours worked as the time during which an employee is subject to the control of an employer,and includes all the time the employee is suffered or permitted to work,whether or not required to do so.id.at,d.preliminarily,the supreme court rejected the argument that in order to constitute hours worked,the time must be spent working.instead,the court held that as long as the employee is subject to the control of an employer,the time is considered compensable hours worked.id.at,d.
the court then considered w
