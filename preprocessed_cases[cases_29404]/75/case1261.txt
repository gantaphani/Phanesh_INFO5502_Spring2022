in this appeal,we construe vehicle code section,subdivision c section c pursuant to that statute,an attorney may obtain from the department of motor vehicles dmv an otherwise confidential residential address of a vehicle owner or driver when necessary to represent a client in a pending or potential action that directly involves the use of the vehicle.the attorney at issue in this appeal represents a collection agency for parking garages.we conclude that the attorney may obtain from dmv the confidential residential addresses of those relevant owners and drivers who fail to pay their parking charges,but may not transfer or disclose that information to the collection agency.we therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
the relevant facts are undisputed.
ticket track california,ticket track pursues unpaid charges for parking garages and lots,after the garage or lot has unsuccessfully demanded payment.
while the great majority of parking patrons pay these charges without judicial intervention,ticket track at times has had to use a small claims court action to collect from a few recalcitrants.in august,ticket track retained attorney robert pohls pohls regarding potential legal actions involving the collection of unpaid parking charges.
in october,pohls,in his individual capacity,as counsel for ticket track,submitted an application for a commercial requester account from dmv.upon approval of an application,dmv issues a code,which allows an individual or organization to obtain information from dmv files on a form supplied by dmv,pohls declared under penalty of perjury that he was seeking residential address information for the investigation of potential civil claims or causes of action involving unpaid parking charges directly resulting from the use of a motor vehicle.
as part of the application process,pohls also submitted a letter to dmv dated october,explaining that he planned to use the requester code for a limited purpose to obtain the names and addresses of those individuals who have refused to pay parking charges to ticket track assignors.in this letter,pohls continued once i obtain those names and addresses,i plan to forward that information to ticket track so that it can proceed with its efforts to collect those unpaid parking charges.while such efforts generally succeed without the need to initiate a civil action,ticket track initial effort to collect these unpaid charges constitutes a demand letter,which marks the first step towards initiating a civil action in small claims court to enforce the collection of these charges.as set forth in my application,then,ticket track and i will use the information obtained from your office to investigate and,if necessary,pursue a potential civil action for unpaid parking charges.
dmv denied attorney pohls application for a requester account and code.
pohls and ticket track,relying on the attorney exception to residential address confidentiality set forth in section c,then successfully petitioned for a writ of mandate against dmv and its information services branch chief,peggy george this allowed pohls to obtain a dmv requester code for residential addresses under the circumstances described above.we will refer to dmv and george collectively as dmv.
dmv then appealed the judgment granting the writ of mandate.
discussion 
this appeal involves the task of construing section c against a backdrop of undisputed facts.this task presents a question of law which we determine independently on appeal 
the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the legislature intent to effectuate the law purpose.in determining intent,we look first to the statute words and give them their usual and ordinary meaning.when the language is unambiguous,there is no need for judicial construction.when the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,however,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part and the legislative history 
before we turn to section c,we need to set forth two statutes for context.section a allows dmv to issue requester codes to individuals or organizations for the purpose of obtaining information from dmv files,except as prohibited by section.
section,subdivision a states in part any residence address in any dmv record is confidential and shall not be disclosed to any person,except a court,law enforcement agency,or other government agency,or as authorized in section 
with these two statutes in mind,section c provides 
c section does not apply to an attorney when the attorney states,under penalty of perjury,that the motor vehicle or vessel registered owner or driver residential address information is necessary in order to represent his or her client in a criminal or civil action which directly involves the use of the motor vehicle or vessel that is pending,is to be filed,or is being investigated.information requested pursuant to this subdivision is subject to all of the following 
the attorney shall state that the criminal or civil action that is pending,is to be filed,or is being investigated relates directly to the use of that motor vehicle or vessel.
the case number,if any,or the names of expected parties to the extent they are known to the attorney requesting the information,shall be listed on the request.
a residence address obtained from dmv shall not be used for any purpose other than in furtherance of the case cited or action to be filed or which is being investigated.
if no action is filed within a reasonable time,the residence address information shall be destroyed.
no attorney shall request residence address information pursuant to this subdivision in order to sell the information to any person.
within days of receipt of a request,dmv shall notify every individual whose residence address has been requested pursuant to this subdivision.
thus,section c constitutes an exception for attorneys to the general rule of section that makes residential addresses in dmv files confidential.in interpreting this exception,there are some rules of statutory construction to follow.when a statute sets forth an exception to a general rule,that exception is to be strictly construed other exceptions are not to be implied or presumed moreover,the enumeration of acts,things,or persons as coming within the exception of a statute forecloses the inclusion of other acts,things,or persons in the class however,a statutory exception is not to be construed so narrowly as to exclude situations that are within the words and reason of the exception,or that fall fairly within its terms.
two issues of interpretation are presented here.the first is whether attorney pohls is representing ticket track in an action within the meaning of the section c exception.the second is,if so,whether pohls may transfer or disclose the confidential dmv residential address information to ticket track as his client.the parties agree that the failure to pay vehicle parking charges directly involves the use of the motor vehicle.
as for the first attorney pohls is representing ticket track in an maintains the section c attorney exception does not apply because pohls is not represent ing ticket track in an action that is pending,is to be filed,or is being investigated.instead,dmv argues,the representation involves only the mailing of parking bills,punctuated once in a great while by a small claims court action from which pohls is foreclosed by statute from representing ticket track.we disagree.
if attorney pohls,as counsel for ticket track,obtains confidential dmv residential address information for an unpaid parking charge and sends a demand letter for payment,that activity involves the representation of ticket track in a potential action that directly involves the use of the motor vehicle.such activity falls within the representational requirement of the section c attorney exception,which provides as pertinent t he attorney states that the residential address information is necessary in order to represent his or her client in a civil action which directly involves the use of the motor vehicle that is pending,is to be filed,or is being investigated.as the state farm court put it,the section c exception permits attorneys to seek information while a civil action is being investigated,before the facts and the precise claims to be filed in the action are fully known.citation.the exception thus authorizes the release of address information in situations in which an attorney is investigating a potential claim or cause of action which directly involves the use of the motor vehicle 
and while it is true that an attorney may not appear on behalf of a client in small claims court,an attorney may advise a small claims client before or after the action is begun,and may appear and represent that client in a small claims appeal which is a de novo hearing in superior court or in connection with the enforcement of a judgment 
we conclude that attorney pohls is representing ticket track in at least a potential action within the meaning of the section c attorney he sends out demand letters for payment using confidential dmv residential address information,while investigating or generally overseeing payment compliance and,if necessary,advising on small claims actions for the recalcitrants.
the concurring and dissenting opinion dissent disagrees with this interpretation of the section c attorney exception.focusing on the preposition in,the dissent reads the exception qualification the residential address information is necessary in order to represent his or her client in a civil action that is pending,is to be filed,or is being investigated to mean that the actual or potential civil action must be one in which the attorney can appear to represent a client.
we find the dissent interpretation too restrictive.the language at issue in section c says nothing about releasing residential address information only to attorneys for civil actions in which they can appear in fact,the language plainly extends to a potential civil action in which an attorney is representing a client by investigating the matter as the legislative history shows not to mention the legislative language,investigation is a central feature of the section c attorney exception this feature allows attorneys to effectively represent their clients by locating hit and run drivers or other responsible parties involved in auto accidents or matters moreover,an investigation may disclose myriad example,no claim,no defense,settlement,or a small claims foreclose an actual appearance by an attorney.that leaves the dissent interpretation of when the section c exception applies hanging by the theoretical thread that an attorney could have appeared in the potential action,even though the attorney did not appear.that interpretation finds no support in the language of the statute.
the section c attorney exception uses the broader verb represent rather than the more limited verb appear,and does so while contemplating the importance of attorney investigation.the exception does not say the residential address information is necessary in order to appear for his or her client in a civil action,or in order to represent his or her client by appearing in a civil action,that is pending,is to be filed,or is being investigated.the exception simply says the information is necessary in order to represent his or her client in a civil action that is pending,is to be filed,or is being investigated.in short,the language of the exception extends to representation through investigation,but the dissent interpretation is confined to whether the attorney has appeared,will appear,or can appear in the action.
the problems with the dissent restrictive interpretation of the section c exception do not stop with these language incongruities.they extend to practical incongruities as well.under the dissent interpretation,an attorney can not use the section c exception in investigating a potential small claims action because attorneys can not appear in the initial small claims trial however,that same attorney,investigating that same case,may use the section c exception by bypassing the small claims court and characterizing the action being investigated as a limited civil case,because attorneys may appear in limited civil cases furthermore,attorneys may appear on behalf of a client in a small claims appeal a de novo hearing in superior court,and therefore they can use the section c exception,under the dissent interpretation,at that belated moment these incongruities disserve the lawyer,the client and the court system.
our interpretation avoids these incongruities,and allows attorneys to use the section c exception to investigate potential small claims actions like the potential civil actions that they are under our interpretation of the section c exception,attorney pohls dmv declaration was sufficient in stating that he needed the residential address information to investigate,and if necessary,to pursue potential civil actions on behalf of his client involving unpaid parking charges directly resulting from the use of a motor vehicle.
as for the second issue before attorney pohls may transfer or disclose the confidential dmv residential address information to his client,ticket must once again look to the language of section c.that section states in relevant part that the general rule of confidentiality set forth in s ection does not apply to an attorney when the attorney states,under penalty of perjury,that the residential address information is necessary in order to represent his or her client 
this language is plain.the confidentiality exception applies to an attorney.italics added.it does not apply to the attorney client.attorneys,then,have been enumerated as coming within the exception.since additional exceptions are not to be implied or presumed,section c contemplates that dmv residential addresses are only for the eyes of attorneys and,as we shall see,their agents who meet the criteria of that section 
lest there be any doubt about this,companion provisions to section and section itself,as well as the section legislative history,dispel any anxiety.
as for the companion provisions,section states in part that a ny person who has access to confidential or restricted information from dmv shall establish procedures to protect the confidentiality of those records.if any confidential or restricted information is released to any agent of a person authorized to obtain information,the person shall require the agent to take all steps necessary to ensure confidentiality and prevent the release of any information to a third party.ticket track can not consider itself to be attorney pohls agent.an agent is defined legally as one who is authorized by a party to act on that party behalf here attorney pohls is acting on ticket track behalf and is therefore ticket track agent,not the other way around.
section adds in part that n o person or agent shall distribute restricted or confidential dmv information to any person the section sets forth a stiff penalty for such distribution.
section c itself places conditions on an attorney request for dmv residential address information that indicate the attorney is to keep such information within his or her domain.most notably,those conditions specify that i f no action is filed within a reasonable time,the residence address information shall be destroyed,and that n o attorney shall request residence address information in order to sell the information to any person.a knowing violation of these conditions is a misdemeanor 
furthermore,subdivisions a and b of section,subdivisions a and b of section,and subdivision a of section specifically exempt certain entities from the section general rule making dmv residential address information confidential.these specifically exempted entities are private colleges enforcing their parking restrictions,financial institutions,insurance companies,and vehicle manufacturers and dealers,if they meet certain statutory criteria.if we were to approve of the transfer of confidential dmv residential address information from attorney pohls to ticket track here,that would mean that motor collection agencies routinely would obtain this confidential information from their attorneys.in effect,we would be creating another exception for a specific business.that is not our job.that is a task for the legislature.
the legislative history of the section c attorney exception discloses that the exception was tightened considerably from its originally proposed language,which read c section does not apply to an attorney when the attorney states,under penalty of perjury,that the information is necessary in order to effectively represent his or her client.this tightening no doubt reflected,at least in part,the legislative findings that accompanied the adoption of the section confidentiality scheme.those findings noted that the california constitution guarantees the right to privacy and stated that the personal privacy and security of one home is fundamental to this right of privacy,and that i n order for individuals to be able to exercise their right to privacy,they must be able to choose when to release personal information,and to whom,and reasonable laws requiring the individual to surrender control should be enacted only when it is deemed absolutely necessary for society welfare.
ticket track notes that the section c exception applies to attorneys seeking information in order to represent his or her client such language,ticket track maintains,anticipates and assumes that attorneys who obtain address information from the dmv are working in a representative capacity and will necessarily be communicating with their clients about the information obtained.
ticket track argument,however,treats the dmv residential address information as routine information between attorney and client,and not as statutorily restricted confidential information that only the attorney and the attorney agent may see.as dmv points out,it is not integral to the relationship that the client know the residential address of an opposing party.it is safe to say that a client ignorance in this respect is generally the wisest course in an adversarial milieu.as dmv also notes,attorneys may withhold information from their clients when legally required to do so one treatise on professional responsibility states that laws or court orders may prohibit counsel from disclosing information to the client,trade secrets,customer lists.confidential residential addresses are akin to these prohibited disclosures if anything,the disclosure of residential addresses of opposing parties would generally seem less important to furthering a relationship than the disclosure of more substantive trade secrets or customer lists.as we read the confidentiality exception of section c,attorneys are legally required to withhold dmv residential address information from their clients because the exception applies only to attorneys and their agents.
we conclude that only attorney pohls or his agent may receive the confidential dmv residential address information neither pohls nor his agent may transfer or disclose this information to ticket track.
the judgment here specifies that dmv is to grant attorney pohls a requester code as permitted under section c,which authorizes the release of residential address information under the circumstances presented by th e petition for writ of mandate.one of those circumstances is that attorney pohls obtains the confidential dmv residential address information and forwards that information to ticket track ticket track then sends out a demand letter for payment.in light of our analysis,this aspect of the judgment must be reversed because only attorney pohls or his agent may see the confidential dmv residential address information.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed to the extent it allows attorney pohls to transfer or disclose the confidential dmv residential address information to his client,ticket track.in all other respects,the judgment is affirmed.each side shall pay its own costs on appeal.
for reasons that follow,i respectfully dissent from the majority conclusion that attorney robert pohls was entitled to receive residential addresses from the department of motor vehicles dmv.because i do not think that pohls was entitled to receive any information at all,i necessarily concur in the majority conclusion that pohls should not forward that information to ticket track california.
as i shall explain more fully,pohls was not entitled to the information because he did not provide to dmv,under penalty of perjury,information that is required by vehicle code section,subdivision c.statutory references are to the vehicle code unless otherwise noted.in short,pohls supplied dmv with an insufficient application for the information,and dmv correctly denied his application.
at issue is the proper interpretation of section,subdivision c.before discussing the language of that statute,it may be helpful to set out certain rules of statutory construction that apply in this instance.
our role in construing a statute is to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.in determining intent,we look first to the words of the statute,giving the language its usual,ordinary meaning.if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.hunt superior court cal th,d.furthermore,we consider portions of a statute in the context of the entire statute and the statutory scheme of which it is a part,giving significance to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.curle superior court cal th,d.
if possible,we must give effect and significance to every word and phrase of a statute.garcia mccutchen cal th,d.we must presume that the legislature intended every word,phrase,and provision in a statute to have meaning and to perform a useful function.ibid.
in construing the words of a statute,a reviewing court is required to read the statute in the light of the legislative objective sought to be achieved,and the evil to be averted.citation.people fierro cal th,d.
section,subdivision c provides an exception to the general rule of confidentiality of residence addresses that is set forth in section,subdivision a as follows any residence address in any record of the department is confidential and shall not be disclosed to any person,except a court,law enforcement agency,or other government agency,or as authorized in section or.
section was enacted by statutes of,chapter,section.in enacting that chapter the legislature stated in section the legislature hereby finds and declares that 
a section of article i of the california constitution guarantees the right to privacy.
b in order for individuals to be able to exercise their right to privacy,they must be able to choose when to release personal information,and to whom,and reasonable laws requiring the individual to surrender control should be enacted only when it is deemed absolutely necessary for society welfare.stats,ch.
in light of the foregoing declaration of legislative intent,section,which provides for disclosure of private information,must be read narrowly,at least in the sense that its plain language should not be disregarded and that any ambiguities in the statute should be construed in favor of privacy 
with this background,i turn to the language of section,subdivision c.in pertinent part,it provides as follows 
section does not apply to an attorney when the attorney states,under penalty of perjury,that the motor vehicle or vessel registered owner or driver residential address information is necessary in order to represent his or her client in a criminal or civil action which directly involves the use of the motor vehicle or vessel that is pending,is to be filed,or is being investigated.emphasis added.
the ordinary meaning of represent his or her client in a civil action means that the attorney has appeared or will appear in a civil action as the attorney of record representing the client.see,blanton womancare cal d,attorney retained to represent client in litigation code of civ,in all cases where a party has an attorney in the action the service of papers must be upon the attorney.
