the plaintiff,vito tufariello,was until his retirement in,employed by the long island rail road company the lirr as a mechanic in one of its rail yards.locomotives would sound their horns whenever they entered or exited the railroad station adjacent to this yard.in and,the lirr introduced new locomotives into service.in june and july,it modified the new locomotives horns in response to complaints that they were too loud and too shrill.
in,tufariello brought this action under the federal employers liability act fela,et,alleging that the repeated sounding of the horns had caused him permanent hearing loss and that the lirr had negligently exposed him to those sounds at his workplace.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the lirr,concluding that tufariello fela action was preempted by the federal railroad safety act of frsa,et repealed in and reinstated in substance in et.the court further concluded that even if this claim were not preempted,tufariello could not make out a prima facie case of negligence because he did not offer expert testimony or objective measurements of the horns decibel levels necessary to establish either that the train horns caused his hearing loss or that the lirr breached its duty of care to him.we disagree with both conclusions and therefore vacate the judgment of the district court.we remand the matter to that court.

the train horns 
tufariello worked for the lirr from until as a b and b mechanic.in that capacity,he installed and replaced windows,painted doors,fixed shingles on roofs,and installed tile and linoleum.in and,tufariello was assigned to the lirr patchogue yard,where he built parts for a bridge project at that time,the lirr placed into service its new de and dm locomotives,which were equipped with warning horns that were sounded as the locomotives entered and exited patchogue station.
according to tufariello,these horns were so loud that a person speech could not be heard by another person within one arm length when spoken at normal levels in the yard.plaintiff statement.he also asserts that each time a horn would sound,it caused physical discomfort and my ears would continue to ring after the horn stopped.aff.of vito tufariello,at.tufariello contends that he asked the lirr building and bridge supervisor,keith mcfarland,for hearing protection three or four times but was never provided with it.
tufariello was not the only person employed at the yard who complained about the horns.mcfarland testified that everyone in the yard did.dep.of keith mc f arland,at mcfarland dep.he also stated that upon hearing the blasts,y ou would have to put your hands over your ears b ecause it was incredibly loud.id.at.somewhere between six and twelve locomotives would sound their horns each day,with each blast lasting about ten to fifteen seconds.
community residents and local political representatives also complained to the lirr about the loudness and shrillness of the horns.in response,the lirr agreed to test them in order to ensure their compliance with federal standards.the lirr conducted such tests in may and june at its richmond hill and morris park yards,but it conducted no such tests at patchogue yard.the tests showed that when measured feet in front of the locomotive on the track,the horns sounds were,at their loudest,a average of db a when the same horns were measured from feet at a degree angle from the track,the loudest level recorded was db a.
as a result of the tests,the lirr decided to reduce the frequency or pitch of the horns and to reposition them on the locomotives.after the modifications,the horns recorded a decibel level of db a when measured feet in front of the locomotive on the track.they recorded a decibel level of db a when measured from feet at a degree perpendicular angle from the track.
throughout this time,the lirr was conducting a hearing conservation program pursuant to regulations promulgated by the occupational safety health administration osha.see c.under this program,hearing protection was made available to all lirr employees who were exposed to an average sound level twa of db a or greater.the lirr asserts that it further ensured that such hearing protection was worn by any employee exposed to a twa of db a or greater.tufariello testified,however,that he was never provided with any such protection.dep.of tufariello,may,at.mcfarland testified that he discouraged the workmen from wearing hearing protection for safety reasons,lest it prevent them from hearing vehicles and equipment in the yard.mcfarland dep.at.it was,however,never established what decibel level of sound tufariello was exposed to while working in the yard.
according to tufariello,in september,he began to notice that he was having trouble hearing.an examining physician,eliot danziger,told tufariello that he had suffered permanent hearing loss and referred him to another doctor,who provided tufariello with a hearing aid.danziger later averred that based on his audiological testing,tufariello suffered from a severe sensorial impairment bilaterally.aff.of eliot danziger,at.he further stated that it was his opinion with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the injury to tufariello ears was caused by exposure to train horn blasts per day in the patchogue yard in late and.id.at.
the district court opinion 
on july,tufariello filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.he alleges that the lirr was negligent for,among other things,failing to provide proper hearing protection to him in light of his exposure to excessive noise and for not providing him with reasonably safe conditions in which to work,and reasonably safe tools and equipment.compl.at.such negligence,he asserts,caused him permanent hearing loss for which the lirr was liable under fela.on january,the lirr filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.
the district court cheryl pollak,magistrate judge granted the lirr motion.it first concluded that tufariello claims were preempted by the frsa.tufariello long island,d.the court recognized that the preemption provision of the frsa,affects only the propriety of applying provisions of state law,but it reasoned that the frsa goal of uniformity in the law relating to railway safety required that it also trump fela insofar as the two federal statutes conflict.id.at.because regulations promulgated pursuant to the frsa provide for a minimum decibel level for train,the court concluded,such a regulation cover ed the subject matter of warning devices,thereby precluding tufariello cause of action under fela.id.at.
the district court then concluded that even if tufariello claims were not precluded by the frsa,he had still failed to make out a prima facie case of negligence.without expert testimony,tufariello could not establish that the horn blasts caused his injury,and without objective evidence of the decibel level of the horns,tufariello could establish neither causation nor that the lirr breached its duty to maintain a safe workplace.id.at.

ii.preserved claims 
tufariello has advanced three bases for recovery,only one of which has been properly preserved for our review.first,in the district court,tufariello argued that the lirr was negligent either because the sound of the locomotive horns was too loud or because the lirr had failed to offer him sound protection for his ears.but he now contends that he is not claiming defendant was liable to him because its new locomotives had a loud horn blast,effectively waiving the first part of that claim.appellant br.at.
second,tufariello asserts for the first time before us that the lirr was negligent for having plac ed its worksite in such close proximity to the location where the new locomotive passed,thus exposing him to the extremely loud horn blasts.id.because t he law is well established that a federal appellate court will generally not consider an issue or argument not raised in the district court,in re enron,cir internal quotation marks,citation and brackets omitted,tufariello may not now assert a new theory based on the location of the rail yard.
throughout the litigation,however,tufariello has maintained a third argument that the lirr was negligent in failing to provide him with hearing protection.see compl.at tufariello mem.of law in opp to mot.for summ,at appellant br.at.he has thus asserted that theory of negligence in the district court and preserved it on appeal.
iii.preemption 
fela provides that any railroad engaging in interstate commerce shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers,agents,or employees of such carrier.the district court concluded that fela was preempted by the frsa.tufariello,d at.but the preemption doctrine flows from the constitution supremacy clause,art.vi,cl,which invalidates state laws that interfere with,or are contrary to,federal law.sprint spectrum mills,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the doctrine is inapplicable to a potential conflict between two federal statutes.
courts have concluded,however,that the frsa may,in certain circumstances,preclude a cause of action under fela.several courts have decided,for example,that the frsa precludes an action under fela where a railroad employee claims that he or she was injured because of a negligently excessive train speed,and where the train was not exceeding the speed limit set by frsa regulations.these courts have reasoned that permitting such fela claims would be contrary to congress intent in passing the frsa that railroad safety regulations be nationally uniform to the extent practicable.lane sims,cir see also waymire norfolk ry,cir rice cincinnati,new orleans pac.ry,thirkill hunt.but see earwood norfolk ry,concluding that a fela action based on excessive speed was not precluded by the frsa.the district court relied on this line of cases in concluding that,which establishes minimum sound levels for warning devices on trains,substantially subsume s the subject matter of the decibel level of horns and thus precludes tufariello fela action.tufariello,d at quoting csx,easterwood,d 
the frsa regulations here,though,do not address the circumstances under which railroad employees must be provided hearing protection thus,irrespective of whether,in order to establish uniform national standards as to minimum train horn volumes,the frsa precludes a negligence action brought under fela based on excessive volume of the locomotive we need not and do not frsa does not preclude a suit based on the alleged failure to equip an employee with hearing protection.we think that the district court was therefore mistaken in concluding that the frsa precludes tufariello cause of action based on the lirr failure to provide him with safety equipment,the only claim that remains before us on appeal.
iv.prima facie case of negligence 
fela provides,as noted,that any railroad engaging in interstate commerce shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers,agents,or employees of such carrier.in fela actions,the plaintiff must prove the traditional common law elements of negligence duty,breach,foreseeability,and causation.see sinclair long island,cir citing robert consol.rail,cir.at the same time,the plaintiff burden in making a showing of causation and negligence is lighter under fela than it would be at common law because the theory of fela is that where the employer conduct falls short of the high standard required of him by the act and his fault,in whole or in part,causes injury,liability ensues.kernan am.dredging,d.thus,under fela,an employer has a duty to provide its employees with a safe workplace,which it has breached if it knew or should have known of a potential hazard in the workplace,and yet failed to exercise reasonable care to inform and protect its employees.ulfik commuter,cir.accordingly,we have observed that an employer may be held liable under fela for risks that would otherwise be too remote to support liability at common law.id.
the district court appears to have concluded that tufariello failed to make out a prima facie case of negligence because he did not provide expert testimony as to whether his exposure to the horn blasts caused his hearing loss and he did not offer an objective measurement of the horns decibel level,which the court deemed necessary to show both causation and a breach of the lirr duty of care to tufariello.see tufariello,d at.
expert testimony and causation 
to establish causation in a common law negligence action,a plaintiff generally must show that the defendant conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm.restatement of torts a derdiarian felix contracting,to carry the burden of proving a prima facie case,the plaintiff must generally show that the defendant negligence was a substantial cause of the events which produced the injury.under the federal common law of fela actions,see morant long island,cir,though,the plaintiff carries a lighter burden.williams long island,cir the supreme court has said,based on the explicit language of the statute,that with respect to causation,a relaxed standard applies in fela cases.thus,the test of a jury case in a fela action is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part,even the slightest,in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.rogers.pac,d.
the lirr argues that the question of whether tufariello exposure to the sound of train horns caused his hearing loss is a technical issue that requires expert testimony.appellee br.at.see.prohibiting witnesses from offering opinions or making inferences based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge within the scope of rule.we disagree.we think that our decision in ulfik,supra,is controlling on this point.
in ulfik,the plaintiff was an employee of the railroad.while working at grand central station,in new york city,ulfik fell down a flight of stairs as a result of dizziness allegedly caused by his having inhaled paint and solvent fumes in the railroad tunnels a few days earlier.he brought an action for negligence under fela.in reversing the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendant at the close of the plaintiff,we concluded that the trier of fact could reasonably determine,without expert testimony,that prolonged exposure to paint fumes would cause headache,nausea,and dizziness.ulfik,at.
the evidence tufariello proffered to the district court here is analogous.here,as in ulfik,there is a generally understood causal connection between physical this case,very loud sounds,which we refer to colloquially as deafening and the alleged injury that would be obvious to laymen.simpson northeast.reg l commuter.and here,as there,the right of the jury to decide the issue of causation must be most liberally viewed.marchica long island,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted we therefore think that tufariello ulfik may be decided by a factfinder even in the absence of expert testimony.
