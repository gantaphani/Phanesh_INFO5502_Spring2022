eight automobile dealers appeal the district court dismissal of their claims against the ford motor company for lack of standing.because their complaint alleges concrete and particularized injuries that are fairly traceable to ford behavior and redressable in court,we reverse and remand.
in november,a putative nationwide class of ford dealers brought suit,claiming that ford recently introduced blue oval program bop violated state and federal law.a district court dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of standing.danvers motor ford motor,d danvers i.
instead of appealing danvers i,the plaintiffs revised their complaint and filed it anew on may.ford responded with a motion to dismiss,which prompted plaintiffs latest effort,an amended and supplemented complaint filed on january.in an unpublished opinion we will call danvers ii,the district court held that eight of the nine named plaintiffs do not yet have an injury that will support constitutional standing.joint appendix app.at.the ninth plaintiff is not a party to this appeal.
when reviewing an order of dismissal for lack of standing,we accept as true all material allegations of the complaint and construe them in favor of the plaintiff.conte.automotive,quaker,cir.we therefore relate the facts as alleged in the plaintiffs complaint.
plaintiffs sell ford automobiles in accordance with the terms of a standard ford franchise agreement.complaint.they claim that ford bop is part of a coordinated objective to control and micromanage all ford dealerships.id.ford describes its bop,introduced in april,as a nationwide customer service and satisfaction incentive program designed to improve dealer performance.it is technically voluntary,but every ford dealer is forced to bear the costs of the program,while only those who are bop certified may reap its benefits.all eight dealers on appeal have been certified 
in order to finance its bop,ford charges an additional for its automobiles,leaving the manufacturer suggested retail price unchanged.when dealers sell the vehicles,ford essentially reimburses them by giving them a bonus of if the dealers met the initial certification requirements by april.the bonus drops to if the dealer applied on or after april,and achieved certification prior to april.ford originally planned to drop the bonus to in april,and to in,but it has since abandoned this plan.see app.at.
certification entitles dealers to a number of benefits beyond these reimbursements.according to the complaint,dealers also receive transportation assistance allowance bonuses discounts on all retail invoice messages plans for dealers employees access to the blue oval certified healthcare plan and blue oval national advertising.see id.at.
plaintiffs allege that the certification process is onerous,requiring significant expenditures of time and money,and resulting in a substantial loss of control over dealership activities.certification requires dealers to meet standards under a number of performance criteria,including leadership,concern resolution,sales,service,facilities,and customer service.see id.at.as explained at length in the complaint,the criteria are detailed,comprehensive,and difficult to meet.
a necessary condition for bop certification is the national voice of the consumer target,a creation of jd power associates.to become certified,most dealers must receive sufficiently high survey scores from customers on four survey questions.see danvers i,d at app.at.if their scores are high enough,all other certification requirements are waived.plaintiffs aver that the only way a dealer score can increase is if a customer marks completely satisfied in response to every question.complaint emphasis in original.
another criterion for bop certification is a set of facilities requirements,which allegedly encompass all the ordinary routine aspects of running a dealership which are normally within the responsibilities and concerns of the dealer,safe from the intrusion of ford or its agents.danvers i,d at.see also app.at.under the current standard,in densely populated areas,power must deem the dealers facility equal to or better than two of four dealerships within a radius.complaint.
bop certification does not end a dealer obligations.according to the complaint,the program requires annual recertification,which may involve unilaterally altered standards.see app.at.for example,from to,ford increased the voice of the customer survey scores necessary to remain certified,and demanded o service appointment availability,down from two business days.complaint.a dealer had to satisfy ford requirements each and every year or ford will decertify the certified dealers,withhold the reimbursements,and withdraw most benefits.id.in,due to increased certification targets,dealers fell off the program,and as of november,about remained uncertified.id.
the complaint states that the bop certification and recertification processes constitute nine violations of federal and state law more generally,it claims that ford intent,through the blue oval program is,has been and will continue to be,to constructively terminate virtually at will the number of dealers it chooses and to increase control of the operations of the remainder.id.it seeks declaratory relief,an injunction against the bop in its entirety,damages,and attorneys fees.
plaintiffs allege that the bop caused them at least four types of injuries.they say it caused them to spend money against their will to comply with its certification requirements to relinquish control over certain aspects of dealership operations to forfeit interest payments which would be otherwise earned on money spent covering the bop mandatory fee and to face the constant threat of losing certification if ford chooses to ratchet up bop standards in the future.
ford responded to plaintiffs complaint with a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.see.b.limiting its discussion almost exclusively to the fourth species of alleged harm,the district court granted the b motion,holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing.it reasoned that the ongoing threat of termination is simply too speculative and remote to support a finding of constitutional standing.app.at.the court detected no affirmative intent by ford to terminate any dealer who does not achieve blue oval certification.id.although it seems clear that many of the dealers who are currently certified will fall off the program by,the court concluded that these dealers do not yet have an injury that will support constitutional standing.id.
only one sentence in the district court opinion arguably touches on the plaintiffs allegations of past and present harms.this sentence states plaintiffs allegations pertaining to the cost of maintaining their certification in order to avoid potential termination are just not enough to establish a concrete and imminent,rather than conjectural,harm.id.citing complaint,emphasis in original.
the danvers ii opinion relied heavily on the reasoning of danvers i as further justification for its holding.in danvers i,the plaintiffs claimed that they suffered by the diversion of dealers funds,personnel,equipment,and time to the application for blue oval certification,as well as from the severe financial losses attributable to the inequities of the program.d at.nevertheless,the court held that the plaintiffs have not articulated that they themselves have suffered any concrete harm arising from the mere attempt to certify.id.at.
for example,plaintiffs aver that in order to satisfy the facilities criteria,the dealer investment could have to increase sizeably.additionally,plaintiffs allege that the process performed by power,as part of blue oval certification,is subject to manipulations and to annual unilateral change.plaintiffs further allege that the attempts to conform to the boc program will exact a financial burden that may jeopardize the viability of their dealerships.finally,plaintiffs declare that the hurdles of the blue oval program will predictably bring about over time the termination of a significant minority of dealers.thus,even accepting plaintiffs allegat
