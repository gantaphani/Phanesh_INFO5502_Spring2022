when a container of tools disappeared while it was in transit between china and the indiana warehouse of the ultimate purchaser,sourcing,the inevitable process of began.the cargo,as is common today,was shipped under an intermodal waybill and was packed in a container that could easily be transferred from one carrier to the next.all went well until the customs service decided to inspect the container in a facility near chicago international airport.while in the custody of private agents of the customs service,the container vanished.it was found some time later in a nearby city,empty.the purchaser received full payment for the loss from its insurer,indemnity insurance company.indemnity,standing in the shoes of its customer,in turn sued the shipping company,hanjin,and the various parties involved in the diversion to the customs inspection facility,seeking indemnification.
after a bench trial,the district court ruled that hanjin was responsible for the full amount of the loss.indemnity ins.of north america hanjin shipping,d.our review of the relevant language in the waybill,in the light of the law governing this type of transaction,convinces us that this was error.we therefore reverse the verdict against hanjin.in addition,indemnity has from the district court judgment dismissing its claims against services and channel distribution,two of the companies involved in the customs inspection process.we also reverse that judgment,and remand for further proceedings.
sourcing,a subsidiary of lowe companies,wanted to purchase some black decker power tools that were manufactured in a plant located in shenzhen,china.for convenience,we generally refer to both sourcing and lowe itself as lowe,as there is no material distinction between them for present purposes.as part of the deal,lowe contracted with hanjin shipping company to transport a container holding the tools from china to lowe warehouse in north vernon,indiana.the waybill covered all legs of the journey and thus involved both sea and land short,it was an intermodal contract.it named bdc international limited,black decker international,as the shipper,and sourcing,as the consignee.in a space on the waybill labeled notify party,it gave the name of fritz companies,of savannah,georgia.in some of the fine print,the waybill said 
d elivery will be made to the consignee named,or the authorized agents,on production of proof of identity at the place of delivery should the consignee require delivery elsewhere than at the place of delivery shown above,then written instruction must be given by the consignee to the carrier or his agent.should delivery be required to be made to a party other than that named as consignee authorization must be given in writing by the shipper to the carrier or his agent.
finally,as we explain in greater detail below,the waybill provided that it was to be governed by the international convention for the unification of certain rules of law relating to bills of lading,concluded in brussels on august,commonly known as the hague rules,which is generally in force in the united states.see stat.
initially,the shipment proceeded uneventfully.after the container arrived by ship in long beach,california,it was transported by rail to chicago,where it was scheduled to be picked up by a motor carrier and taken to the indiana warehouse.prior to its arrival in chicago,however,the customs service notified fritz,which was lowe agent and customs broker,that this particular container had been selected for an intensive customs examination.fritz,which had a written power of attorney from lowe to perform all services necessary to effect the entry and clearance of lowe goods,accordingly notified hanjin in writing that the goods were to be released to land container,a trucking company,for delivery to services.services was one of four companies operating a centralized examination station for customs in the chicago area.services in turn subcontracted with a company called channel distribution for the performance of the tedious work of inspecting the contents of the container and storing it until it could resume its journey to the ultimate consignee.
in order to carry out the required inspection,fritz began on august,by paying hanjin the collect ocean freight due on the shipment.it then instructed hanjin to deliver the container to land container,which on august,in accordance with fritz order,took the container to the centralized inspection station operated by channel used by services.on august,customs service officials examined the contents of the container and released it from custody.at that point,the shipment was intact and in good order.channel then moved the container from the bonded customs area of its lot to the open yard.the district court found as a fact that a fter customs completed its inspection,it notified both fritz and hanjin that the container and its contents were released and ready to be picked up.this finding is troublesome,as all of the testimony at the trial indicated that customs notified fritz,but not hanjin,and that fritz may have communicated this message to hanjin.nevertheless,this discrepancy does not matter in the end,because the testimony from the witnesses called by channel and services was that channel would release the container only upon receipt of a delivery order from fritz.no such order was forthcoming.one fritz employee testified that they were waiting for a number from hanjin,but she never explained why hanjin would have had such a number.
for over a week,the container sat in channel unprotected yard,awaiting pickup from an authorized party.as of september,channel yard check report showed that it was still on the premises in apparent good condition.the news was not so good at the next yard check,which occurred on september.by then,the container was missing.on september,the indiana state police notified hanjin that they had discovered the empty container in calumet city,indiana.hanjin verified the fact that the container was no longer in channel lot.the goods were never recovered.
lowe submitted a claim for the lost shipment with its insurance company,indemnity,which paid the claim and became subrogated to lowe rights to recover.in its capacity as subrogee,indemnity filed this suit against hanjin,services,and channel.at one point fritz was also a defendant,but it was dismissed before trial and is no longer involved in the litigation.count i asserted a claim against hanjin under the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa,app.et.count ii was against fritz,and thus no longer relevant.count iii raised a common law bailment claim against services,and count iv raised a common law negligence theory against services.counts v and vi,respectively,raised the same two theories against channel.finally,counts vii and viii asserted that indemnity was entitled to recover from hanjin and services again,respectively under the carmack amendment.
with the exception of the claim against fritz,the remainder of indemnity case was heard in a bench trial.the district court jurisdiction rested on,because of the cogsa and carmack amendment allegations in the complaint.it exercised supplemental jurisdiction,see,over the common law theories.the court rejected the argument that it also had admiralty jurisdiction over the case,under,because it concluded that this was a mixed contract involving elements of both ocean and land carriage,and because the loss occurred during the inland carriage portion of the transaction.it also commented that the parties were not seeking to invoke its diversity jurisdiction under and that the record is devoid of the necessary evidence to determine whether diversity even exists.
on the merits,the district court first concluded that hanjin could not be liable under the carmack amendment,because that law is inapplicable to a contract of carriage like this one,which originated outside the united states and was handled under a foreign through bill of lading.capitol converting,lep transport,cir.the court also rejected the suggestion that there is a body of federal common law governing indemnity claim against hanjin,and that this law supports a finding of liability.next,it ruled that cogsa by its terms did not apply to this loss,because it covers only the period during which goods are aboard a ship.because of a clause paramount in the waybill,however,the court ruled that the parties had effectively adopted cogsa as the rule governing the entire transaction.this meant that the case against hanjin was ultimately a simple breach of contract action and was governed by state law either illinois or indiana,with no material difference between the two.the contract required hanjin to deliver the goods to lowe in indiana it did not do so,and the court found nothing in cogsa that excused hanjin nonperformance.it therefore entered judgment in indemnity favor for.it dismissed indemnity bailment and negligence claims against channel and services,thereby resolving the entire case.hanjin has appealed from the judgment rendered against it,and indemnity has from the adverse judgment in favor of channel and services.
we take up hanjin appeal first.hanjin urges us to find that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that it did not make a valid delivery of the goods when it turned them over to land container in accordance with the written instructions it had received from fritz.since neither fritz,as lowe agent,nor lowe itself,ever issued the further written instructions that would have permitted hanjin to complete the shipment,hanjin claims it is not responsible for the fact that the goods never reached their ultimate destination.in the alternative,hanjin argues that the law of the contract excused it from delivering the goods to lowe indiana warehouse,because the owner of the goods through its agent fritz diverted them to services.this diversion,it continues,amounted to an act or fault of the owner of the goods under all applicable laws.either way,hanjin claims that it should not be liable for any of the loss,and that the district court judgment for must be reversed.
we agree with the district court that when all is said and done,this is a simple contract action,and that an illinois court applying its own rules would have selected either indiana law or the law of the forum.no one has pointed out any salient differences between those two bodies of law,and so we will look to both,as the district court did.both illinois and indiana require contracts to be interpreted as a whole.see,major,martindell lake shore bank,premier title donahue,d,indiana gaming,lp blevins.in so doing,the courts of both states stress that meaning must be given to all terms of the contract,and that the court should accept the interpretation that best harmonizes its provisions.see martindell,supra,supra.furthermore,both illinois and indiana permit parties to choose an applicable law for their contract.see,allen great am.reserve ins,indiana choice of law doctrine favors contractual stipulations as to governing law cap gemini america,judd,int l surplus lines ins.pioneer life ins.of,d,indicating that illinois follows the restatement second of conflicts regarding the freedom of parties to choose applicable law.
while the situation before us does not present a conventional contractual choice of law clause,in which the parties select the law of state x or country y as the applicable law,we think that the choice of the hague rules in the agreement is closely analogous to those conventional clauses and thus enforceable.to say that the hague rules apply,however,does not answer another question,which is to how much of the contract do they apply two possibilities exist the parties might have been stipulating that the hague rules applied only to the international ocean shipment portion of the transaction,or they might have been stipulating that the hague rules applied to the entire transaction,including the overland legs.in order to answer which of these is the proper interpretation of the contract,we turn first to the language of the agreement.
the contract of carriage is contained in the waybill that hanjin issued to sourcing,which named fritz as the party to notify on sourcing behalf.whether the district court interpreted this waybill correctly is a question of law,which we review de novo.see,service,lozen int l,llc,cir de novo review of bill of lading see also shelby county state bank van diest supply,cir interpretation of contracts subject to de novo review.the waybill contains a paramount clause,which reads in part as follows 
a this waybill is not a bill of lading and no bill of lading will be issued.however,it is agreed that the hague rules contained in the international convention for the unification of certain rules relating to bills of lading,dated brussels the august as enacted in the country of shipment shall apply to this waybill.when no such enactment is in force in the country of shipment,the corresponding legislation of the country of destination shall apply,but in respect of shipments to which no such enactments are compulsorily applicable,the terms of the said convention shall apply in exactly the same way.
c the carrier shall in no case be responsible for loss of or damage to the goods howsoever arising before receipt of the goods by the carrier at the place of receipt or after delivery by the carrier at the place of delivery.
d it is agreed that whenever the brussels convention and the brussels protocol or statutes incorporating same use the words bill of lading they shall be read and interpreted as meaning waybill.
the hague rules to which the waybill refers were,for all purposes relevant to this case,incorporated into law in cogsa.see,groupe.de chalus p o containers,cir spartus yafo,cir.see also carriage of goods by sea hearing on before the senate committee on commerce,sess,sess,sess.
the first question we must address is whether the parties,through the language in this waybill,effectively extended the hague cogsa the overland part of the voyage.there is nothing in cogsa itself that would preclude such an agreement.to the contrary,the statute specifically states 
nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent a carrier or a shipper from entering into any agreement as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier or the ship for the loss or damage to or in connection with the custody and care and handling of goods prior to the loading on and subsequent to the discharge from the ship on which the goods are carried by sea.
app.indemnity argues that,notwithstanding this possibility,the language of the waybill set forth above does nothing more than state the truism that cogsa applies to the ocean shipping portion of this transaction.
as the supreme court made clear in vimar seguros y reaseguros,sky reefer,d,the substance of cogsa is mandatory law that the parties to a transaction within its scope can not modify by agreement.cogsa applies to e very bill of lading or similar document which is evidence of a contract for the carriage of goods by sea to or from ports of the united states,in foreign trade app.emphasis added.thus,no matter what law a chinese court might have applied to this matter had a problem arisen before the shipment left china,cogsa provided the governing law for a tribunal in the united states with a dispute before it concerning a shipment on board a vessel bound to a port in the united states.any clause purporting to relieve the parties of liability under cogsa would have been null and void and of no effect.thus,with respect to the ocean voyage,the parties had no power either to stipulate to some other body of contract law or to some other version of the international rules governing bills of lading,such as the later or the hamburg rules 
other things being equal,this suggests that the parties were trying to accomplish something beyond a stipulation that the hague rules applied to the ocean portion of the contract of carriage.otherwise,their agreement would have accomplished little or nothing.we realize that hanjin might have used this waybill for shipments to destinations other than the united states,however,and so it is important to look further.reading the waybill as a whole,we conclude that it can be read only as a document adopting the hague rules for the entire shipment,both inland and ocean.on the face of the
