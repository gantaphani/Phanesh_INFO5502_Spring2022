we have on appeal a decision of the third district court of appeal declaring invalid a state statute.see mcgrath city of miami,so d dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.because we conclude that section a,florida statutes,constitutes a special law authorizing the imposition of valorem taxes in violation of the florida constitution,we affirm the third district decision in this case.
background 
in the florida legislature enacted section,which authorizes a municipality to impose a parking tax but restricts which municipalities may impose the tax as follows 
a the governing authority of any municipality with a resident population of or more by april,and which has been declared in a state of financial emergency pursuant to this section within the previous two fiscal years may impose a discretionary per vehicle surcharge of up to percent on the gross revenues of the sale,lease,or rental of space at parking facilities within the municipality that are open for use to the general public.
c this subsection is repealed on june,
in july,the city of miami city implemented the statute by passing an ordinance authorizing the levying of a parking tax,which became effective september.
patrick mcgrath,iii,filed a complaint against the city,challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance and section a.mcgrath claimed that the statute constitutes a special law passed under the guise of a general law,and thus is unconstitutional under article vii,sections a and a,of the florida constitution county county,and one of its employees,laureen varga,challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance and section a in another case,and intervened as plaintiffs in this case.
the city and mcgrath filed for summary judgment,and the county and varga joined in support of mcgrath motion.the trial court granted the city motion for summary judgment,upholding the constitutionality of the ordinance and section a.the third district reversed,however,holding that section a is an unconstitutional special law,
because by anchoring the population classification to the specific date of april,it does not operate uniformly among all cities that reach the population threshold as is required by general law.cities that reach the population threshold after april,are forever excluded from the class.as worded,the statute is no different than if it had identified by name the three particular cities to which it relates.see fort dekle,so.walker pendarvis,so d ocala breeders sales company,florida gaming centers,so d dca.
since a statute which constitutes a special law can not impose a valorem tax,the statute is unconstitutional.see alachua county adams,so d.accordingly,the trial court erred in finding the ordinance was validly enacted and in granting summary judgment for the city.therefore,the case must be reversed and the cause remanded to grant summary judgment in favor of the.
mcgrath,so d at.
the issue in this case is whether section a,which authorizes only certain municipalities to impose a parking tax,constitutes a special law in violation of the florida constitution.section a comes before this court clothed with a presumption of constitutionality,department of legal affairs kennel club,so d,and this court review of the third district decision is de novo.see florida fish wildlife conservation comm caribbean conservation,so d,dca holding that whether a state statute is constitutional is a pure question of law subject to de novo review.
rather than applying to all municipalities,the statute applies only to municipalities that have a resident population of or more on april,and have been declared in a state of financial emergency pursuant to this statute within the previous two fiscal years.by virtue of the limiting date of april,only three,tampa,and jacksonville potentially qualify as being able to impose the parking tax thus,appellees contend that the statute is effectively no different than if those three municipalities had been identified by name in the statute.
the florida constitution allows a local government to impose a valorem tax only as authorized by general law.see art.vii,a,a.const.in other words,the florida constitution prohibits the legislature from authorizing a local government from imposing a valorem tax by special law.we explained the purpose of the constitutional prohibition against the legislature passing a special law authorizing municipalities to levy valorem taxes in alachua county adams,so d,
the overriding purpose of article vii,section a is to make a constitutional division of tax revenues between those available for state uses and those reserved for local government.the phrase all other forms of taxation obviously refers to any tax other than those previously designated ad valorem taxes on real property and tangible personal property.this provision is designed to prevent the legislature from undermining valorem tax sources needed to support state government by the enactment of special laws authorizing local governments to impose valorem taxes for local purposes.
article vii,section a permits the legislature to authorize counties to levy valorem taxes,of whatever form or description,but only by general law.a determination that a special law may allow a county to redirect the tax proceeds in a manner explicitly contrary to the general law which authorized the tax in the first place would clearly undercut the purposes of article vii,section a.
emphasis supplied.
in this case,it is undisputed that the city parking tax constitutes a valorem tax that was authorized by the legislature passage of section a.therefore,the only question in this case is whether section a constitutes a special law.this court has explained the distinction between general laws and special laws 
a law that operates universally throughout the state,uniformly upon subjects as they may exist throughout the state,or uniformly within a permissible classification is a general law.state ex rel.landis harris,so.we recognize that the legislature has wide discretion in establishing statutory classification schemes and that a law applying uniformly within a permissible classification is a general law.shelton reeder,so d.a statute relating to a subdivision of the state,based upon proper distinctions and differences that inhere in or are peculiar or appropriate to a class,is a general law.department of legal affairs kennel club,so d shelton.statutes that employ arbitrary classification schemes are not valid as general laws.west flagler shelton.

we then explained the definition of a special law 
the constitution defines a special law as a special or local law.art.x,g.const.as explained in case law,
a special law is one relating to,or designed to operate upon,particular persons or things,or one that purports to operate upon classified persons or things when classification is not permissible or the classification adopted is illegal a local law is one relating to,or designed to operate only in,a specifically indicated part of the state,or one that purports to operate within classified territory when classification is not permissible or the classification is illegal.
state ex rel.landis harris,so,citations omitted state ex rel.gray stoutamire,so.state ex rel.buford daniel,so.see generally.jur d constitutional law.
to determine whether section a constitutes a special law,we must decide whether the law is designed to operate upon particular municipalities through its restrictive classification system,and whether the classification in this case,which limits application of the statute to municipalities with over residents on or before april,is arbitrary.in other words,we must determine whether this statute is based upon proper distinctions and differences that inhere in or are peculiar or appropriate to a class,classic mile,so d at,or whether this statute is designed to operate upon or benefit only particular municipalities and thus is essentially no different than if the statute had identified the particular municipalities by name.
over sixty years ago,this court held that a statute that applied to a particular population size and was tied to a specific date,so that no other entities could ever fall within the confines of the statute,constituted an invalid special law.see fort dekle,so.in fort,the court considered the constitutionality of a statute requiring residents in counties having a population of or more according to the state census to as voters for all elections to be held in and each election thereafter.id.at.the court rejected the argument that because the statute applied to three counties,it did not constitute a special law,explaining the act is just as much a special and local act as if the counties of hillsborough,duval and dade had been named in the act because those are the only three counties in the state to which the act could ever be applicable,as no other counties in the state had a population of more than according to the state census of.id.at emphasis supplied.
similarly,in walker pendarvis,so d,the court held that several statutes that limited their application to a specific population size and a specific date constituted invalid special laws.the court first considered a statute that set the maximum salary for justices of the peace in all counties in florida having a population in excess of according to the preceding official census.see id.at.the court held that the statute constituted a special law because its application is limited to duval county,and can not be a general law by classification because the classification factors bear no reasonable relation to the subject regulated.id.at.the court cited its earlier decision in carter norman,so d,in which the court stated the classification of counties for governmental purposes according to population is entirely permissible in the enactment of a general statute,so long as the classification used is just and reasonable.walker,so d at 
the court also considered two statutes,one of which provided that constables in all the counties of this state which now have a population of not less than,according to the last federal census,could employ,appoint,and deputize one deputy constable as a law enforcement officer to serve under the supervision,direction,and control of the constable so making the appointment.id.at.the other statute provided that constables in all the counties of this state which now have a population of not less than,according to the last federal census,could employ,appoint,and deputize not more than two deputy constables as law enforcement officers to serve under their supervision.id.the court held that the statutes constituted invalid special laws because the word now used in the statutes could be construed only to restrict application of the act to the counties having the stipulated population at the specific time of the enactment of the law.id.therefore,the court concluded that because the use of the word now tied the applicability of the statutes to the date of enactment,the statutes were tantamount to the legislature specifically naming counties in the legislation.see id.
more recently,this court reaffirmed the principles articulated in fort and walker in classic mile,so d at,where the court held that a statute that applied to only one county and had no possibility of ever applying to any other county constituted a special law.the statute at issue in classic mile authorized the receipt and display of simulcast thoroughbred horse racing,and wagering thereon,at licensed facilities.see id.at.the statute provided criteria for establishing a class of counties in which a facility could be licensed,including requiring the existence of two unused quarter horse racing permits before january.see id.the court noted that all parties in the case agreed that marion county was the sole county that would ever fall within the statutorily designated class of counties eligible for licensure of a facility.see id.
the court held that the statute constituted an unconstitutional special law,despite the legislature treatment of the law as a general law,because it applied only to marion county,and there was no possibility that it would ever apply to any other county.see id.at.moreover,the court concluded that because of the classification scheme employed by the statute,it could not be classified as a valid general law.see id.
the court cited with approval its earlier opinion in shelton reeder,so d,which explained that classifying counties on the basis of population must be reasonably related to the purpose of the statute in order for a statute to constitute a valid general law.see so d at.the court concluded that no reasonable relationship existed between the statutory classification scheme in this case and the subject of the statute,explaining that i n determining if a reasonable relationship exists t he fact that matters is that the classification is potentially open to other tracks.id.at quoting department of legal affairs kennel club,so d.the court also relied on department of legal affairs in further explaining that a statutory classification scheme incapable of generic application to members of a class,and fixed so as to preclude additional parties from satisfying the requirements for inclusion within the statutory classification at some future point in time,indicates an arbitrary classification scheme in the context of parimutuel legislation.classic mile,so d at citing department of legal affairs,so d at.
furthermore,the court explained that a statute is invalid if the descriptive technique is employed merely for identification rather than classification.classic mile,so d at citing west flagler kennel club,florida state racing comm n,so d.the court held that the statutory classification scheme at issue in classic mile constituted a descriptive technique used to identify marion county,because 
t he classification scheme fails to distinguish among the counties of florida in any meaningful way with respect to the subject of the statute and establishes a class open only to marion county,now and in the future.because the statutory classification scheme is wholly arbitrary,having no reasonable relationship to the subject of the statute,the statute is not a valid general law.
in this case,section a falls squarely within the definition of a special law as articulated by this court in fort,walker,and classic mile.first,the population classification in this case constitutes nothing more than a descriptive technique used merely to identify three particular municipalities to which the statute applies.see classic mile,so d at.limiting the statute to only those municipalities with populations of more than on april,is tantamount to restricting the statute to those particular municipalities that met this population threshold on that particular date.
second,section a does not operate uniformly among similarly situated municipalities because it does not uniformly apply to all municipalities that have a population of or more rather,section a applies only to those municipalities that have a population of or more on or before april.moreover,the legislature passed the amendment on april,and the legislation had an effective date of july.therefore,the qualifying date of april,had already expired even before the time the legislation was passed and before the legislation became law.thus,as a result of the combination of the population threshold and the limiting date,the statute by its express terms forever excludes any other municipalities that increase in size to meet the population threshold after april.consequently,no other municipality can ever grow into the population classification.furthermore,because of the anchoring date,miami,tampa,and jacksonville will always remain within the qualifying population classification,even if their populations fall in the future to below.therefore,the population classification in section a lacks uniformity in application.
third,section a employs an arbitrary classification scheme because it contains a statutory classification scheme incapable of generic application to members of a class,and fixed so as to preclude additional entities from satisfying the requirements for inclusion within the statutory classification at some future point in time.classic mile,so d at.section a is incapable of generic application to all municipalities that have a population of or more because municipalities that reach this population threshold after april,are not eligible for inclusion in the class.therefore,the april,deadline contained in the statute creates an arbitrary population classification.thus,for the reasons discussed above,we hold that the statute constitutes an invalid special law under fort,walker,and classic mile 
the city contends,however,that this court decisions in golden nugget group metropolitan dade county,so d,and state city of miami beach,so d,upheld legislation substantially similar to that at issue in this case.although city of miami beach involved a population classification,the statute in that case was not substantially similar to section a.in city of miami beach,so d at,the court considered whether a statute granting all cities and towns with a population of not less than and not more than and counties having a population of more than,according to the latest official decennial census,the right to impose a two percent resort tax constituted a special law.the statute stated that it would be applicable only to those cities and towns whose charters specifically provided for allowing the levy of the resort tax at the time of the statute passage,or whose charters were subsequently amended before january.see id.the court explained that,based upon the federal census,only dade county and broward county fell within the population brackets of the statute,but that the same census indicated that other counties were potentially within the population bracket of the statute.see id.at.
the court concluded that the statute constituted a general law because the population classification was reasonable based on the state interest in the promotion and further development of the tourist industry.see id.at.furthermore,the court explained that the statute was not limited to a specific census,as was the statute the court invalidated in walker.see city of miami beach,so d at.
city of miami beach is thus distinguishable because the court explicitly recognized in that case that the statute was not tied to a particular census,as was the statute the court struck down in walker.city of miami beach,so d at.therefore,the court upheld the validity of the statute in city of miami beach precisely because the population classification was not limited to a census or other particularly designated date.id.moreover,the court in city of miami beach interpreted the statute to permit the enactment of charter amendments between the effective date of the act and january,by cities and towns located in all counties,regardless of whether the county met the population requirement by january.id.consequently,the court concluded that the statute did not effectively limit the population classification to a particularly designated census,because cities and towns located in counties that failed to meet the population requirement by january,were not on the effective date of the statute,or at some subsequent date,prohibited from collecting the resort tax once the county met the population classification according to the latest census.id.therefore,unlike the statute at issue in this case,the statute in city of miami beach was open to other similarly situated cities and counties.
further,golden nugget group,so d at,did not involve either a population classification or a substantially similar classification rather the legislation employed a classification based on home rule charters.in golden nugget group,this court considered whether a statute that allowed e ach county,as defined in to levy a three percent convention development tax on payments made to rent,lease or use any living quarters or accommodations constituted a special law.the statute was limited to those counties that operated under a home rule charter adopted pursuant to ss,and of art.viii of the constitution of,as preserved by art.viii,e of the constitution of.id.the court noted that dade,hillsborough,and monroe counties potentially met the statutory definition,but only dade county had adopted a charter.see id.the court fully approved the decision of the third district,which held that the statute satisfied the criteria for a general law set forth in this court decision in department of legal affairs,so d at.golden nugget group,so d at.the third district explained that the classification was reasonable in that case because the three counties potentially eligible for the tax had substantial economies and the counties had concentrated on developing facilities that would attract convention tourists in order to improve the counties tourist industries.see id.
rather than focus on whether the statutory classification of home rule charter counties was reasonably related to the purpose of allowing these counties to impose a three percent convention development tax,the court focused on a characteristic shared by the counties in the statutory classification that is,that each county happened to have a substantial economy.thus,the court never addressed the question as to whether the classification based on a charter was an impermissible closed class because it potentially applied to only three counties.however,the court cited with approval to department of legal affairs,so d at,which also was relied on by this court subsequent opinion in golden nugget group.in addition,the court in golden nugget group does not cite to any of its prior opinions in fort,walker,and city of miami beach.accordingly,there is no indication that the court in golden nugget group intended to recede from its prior approach to analyzing when a statute is an impermissible special law.puryear state,so d,stating that this court does not intentionally overrule itself sub silentio.
the city further argues that with the addition in the florida constitution of article iii,section b,which occurred after fort and walker,and before golden nugget group and city of miami beach,all that is required to satisfy the special law prohibition is that a classification be reasonably related to the subject of the statute we disagree.although the reasonable relationship test is part of determining whether a closed population classification is arbitrary,article iii,section b does not alter the prohibition against special laws.
first,as noted above,this court in classic mile explained 
shelton reeder,so d,and west flagler kennel club,florida state racing comm n,so d,test a reasonable relationship between the statutory classification and the purpose of the statute we note that art.iii,b applies a different test requiring that a valid general law classify only in a manner reasonably related to the subject of the statute.this distinction in terminology does not affect our conclusion in this case.
second,the city basic premise that city of miami beach is controlling because it applies the amended constitutional test for reviewing population classifications is flawed because the legislature enacted the statutes under review in city of miami beach in,and the court stated that t he organic demands of the constitution of did not forbid the enactment of general laws containing reasonable classifications as to population or otherwise.so d at.thus,contrary to the city contention,the court in city of miami beach did not rely upon the amendment to the florida constitution in upholding the statute in that case.
third,decisions decided before the amendment are easily reconciled with decisions decided after the amendment.in walker,this court explained that a classification of counties may be upheld as a general law so long as the classification used is just and reasonable.so d at.the arbitrary classification of counties by population for the purpose of avoiding the organic requirement of publication of notice of intention to apply to the legislature for the passage of proposed local or special law,however,is not permitted or sanctioned by the constitution.walker,so d at quoting carter norman,so d.therefore,this court applied a reasonable relationship test to the statute,concluding that fixing a population classification to a specific date constituted an arbitrary classification.see id.at.this analysis is consistent wi
