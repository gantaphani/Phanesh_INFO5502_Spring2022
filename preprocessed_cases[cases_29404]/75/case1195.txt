the jury in this case determined that in locating and in negotiating the purchase price of aircraft on behalf of the plaintiff,the defendant aircraft dealers owed the plaintiff the duties of a fiduciary.the jury further found that in providing the plaintiff with misleading information about the negotiated price of the aircraft,the defendants breached their fiduciary duty to the plaintiff.
there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury finding of liability.although the parties did not have a written agency contract,their course of conduct and the customary practice in the aircraft industry fully supported a finding the aircraft dealers were the plaintiff agents and therefore obligated to provide the plaintiff with accurate information about the price the aircraft dealers had negotiated with the sellers of the aircraft.
although we agree the trial court erred in instructing the jury that both brokers and agents owe purchasers the duties of a fiduciary,in light of testimony from the aircraft industry experts offered by the parties and the record of willful deceit on the part of the defendants,the error was harmless.moreover,the record contains ample evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer the aircraft dealer had retained concealed secret profits equal to or greater than the compensatory damages awarded to plaintiff.
however,we reverse and remand as to the award of punitive damages with instructions that the trial court limit them on a pro rata basis to an amount which in total does not exceed the compensatory damages awarded.where,as here,substantial compensatory damages have been awarded,and the conduct in question only involves economic damage to a single plaintiff who is not particularly vulnerable,an award which exceeds the compensatory damages awarded is not consistent with due process.

according to mcwilliam,doherty informed him that mach i did not have the money to fund purchases or pay the expenses of inspecting aircraft.mcwilliam understood that mach i was offering to act as jet source broker in acquiring aircraft for jet source and being paid an enhanced commission on the resale of the aircraft.mcwilliam,on behalf of jet source,agreed to have mach i act as its broker.
between april and august,mach i assisted jet source in six aircraft transactions.according to mcwilliam,mach i located aircraft for purchase by jet source,negotiated the lowest possible price for the aircraft,and used jet source funds to acquire the aircraft for jet source.jet source would then pay mach i a commission of between and percent on the resale of the aircraft to third parties.in some instances jet source also paid mach i a commission on the acquisition of the aircraft.in all cases jet source paid mach i expenses in connection with the transactions.
in the first transaction in may,mach i negotiated a price of million from philips electronics for the purchase of a falcon,serial number.however,mach i represented to jet source that the price of the aircraft was million and in fact produced a sales contract which reflected the higher price.jet source paid million for the falcon and eventually resold it.during the course of discovery jet source obtained a sales contract which was largely identical in form to the sales contract initially provided by mach i,except that it showed that mach i only paid million for the falcon.an escrow statement jet source obtained through discovery showed that an entity known as aircraft dealer services received from the transaction.mouyos conceded that mach i controlled aircraft dealer services and ultimately received the.

in the sixth and final transaction jet source purchased a cessna citation from cessna for million and leased it back to mach i.the parties agreed mach i would bear the costs of maintaining the cessna citation as part of jet source charter fleet,that they would split any profits upon resale,and that mach i would bear the risk of any loss on the resale.after mach i had failed to pay the expenses of the cessna citation,jet source sold the aircraft back to cessna for.it incurred a million loss on the transaction.
according to bogner,mach i brought several proposed transactions a week to him during the period mach i was acting as jet source agent.during this period doherty and mouyos used jet source credit cards to pay for approximately in expenses they incurred in locating aircraft and negotiating with their owners.although mach i found propeller driven aircraft for other clients during this period,jet source was the only client to whom it provided jet aircraft.
