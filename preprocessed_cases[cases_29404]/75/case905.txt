this is an appeal from a judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff after a bench trial.we affirm.
background 
procedural history 
the nose gear of a beechcraft airplane collapsed during its initial taxi out of pensacola naval air station.one of the aircraft nose gear wheel valves broke off and hit plaintiff william miles,plaintiff,injuring his leg.following the accident,surgeons amputated plaintiff leg above his right knee.plaintiff sued the united states army government under the federal tort claims act,ftca,asserting that the government negligently performed mandatory inspections and negligently failed to train and certify its mechanics as required by federal regulations.in a motion for summary judgment,the government requested that the district court dismiss the case under the ftca discretionary function exception or,alternatively,dismiss the case because the government did not owe plaintiff a duty under florida negligence law.the district court denied the government motion,and the case proceeded to trial.after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment for plaintiff in the amount of.the government timely appealed.after benefitting from the parties briefs,oral arguments,and an independent review of the record,we affirm the district court judgment.we hold that,in this case,the ftca discretionary function exception does not shield the government from liability for its negligent inspection and that the government did owe plaintiff a duty under florida negligence law.
in,the government acquired the aircraft in this case,a beechcraft queen air,model queen air,through a criminal drug forfeiture.until,the united states army operated and maintained the queen air at the naval air station in glenview,illinois.in,the government transferred the queen air to the national museum of naval aviation museum in pensacola,florida.after the transfer,the government registered the queen air title in the navy name.at the museum,the queen air remained in outdoor storage for two years.
in,fred sorenson sorenson,a museum volunteer,negotiated with the museum to purchase the queen air,along with seven other aircraft.the museum transferred the aircraft to the naval aviation museum foundation foundation under an as is contract the foundation agreed to 
hold the government harmless from any and all loss or liability whether in tort or in contract which might arise from the use of the equipment exchanged under the contract results in injury to or parts of personnel of the foundation or third parties or damages to or destruction of the personal property of the foundation or third parties.
contract between national museum of naval aviation and naval aviation museum foundation at.at.the foundation transferred the aircraft to cub enterprises,a trade name for sorenson.sorenson then attempted to transfer the queen air to perkins smith,a corporation formed by james smith.the contract required that sorenson deliver the queen air to the pensacola regional airport,where mechanics would fully inspect the aircraft for its annual airworthiness inspection.to deliver the aircraft,the federal aviation administration faa issued sorenson a special flight permit allowing a pilot to ferry the queen air from pensacola naval air station to the pensacola regional airport,a flight.sorenson requested that bill miles,the plaintiff father,pilot the queen air on this ferry flight.
the accident occurred on may,when the aircraft nose collapsed during the initial taxi out of the parking area.on that day,sorenson and bill miles,conducted a visual inspection.the plaintiff was acting as the queen air safety observer,standing fire watch,during his father initial taxi out of the parking area.after the queen air taxied about feet,during a left turn,the nose gear collapsed.the nose wheel valves exploded and flew off in opposite directions,one of them hitting plaintiff.after the accident,doctors surgically amputated plaintiff leg above his right knee.
during the time the government possessed the queen air,federal regulations required that the aircraft owners have trained,certified mechanics perform tests to detect nose fatigue cracks on the aircraft at specified time intervals.the queen air manufacturer,the faa,and the department of defense dod required this test specifically to prevent accidents similar to that which injured plaintiff.although the government mechanics did perform this test,the government failed to meet the faa and dod standards because it used untrained,uncertified mechanics.because these mechanics improperly performed a nondestructive inspection ndi,a crack in the aircraft nose caused the accident.
in,beechcraft,the aircraft manufacturer,issued a mandatory service instructing that the owners of beechcraft queen air aircrafts to inspect the nose landing gear fork for slippage and cracks.the bulletin stated,in pertinent part,the following 
beech aircraft corporation beechcraft considers this to be a mandatory inspection modification 
part ii on all airplanes with or more flight hours on the nose landing gear lower shock absorber assembly,an initial fluorescent liquid penetrant inspection for cracks around the weld area on the fork assembly,should be accomplished within the next service hours after receipt of this service bulletin,but no later than the next scheduled airplane inspection.a recurring flourescent liquid penetrant inspection for cracks around the weld area on the fork assembly should be performed at the following regularly scheduled or hour as applicable airplane inspection and at each or hour inspection thereafter.
it is further recommended that only qualified personnel perform the flourescent liquid penetrant inspection to reduce the possibility of misinterpretation of indications.
see beechcraft service bulletin,july plaintiff ex.the flourescent liquid dye penetrant inspection is a form of ndi that tests for tiny cracks in the aircraft nose.the dye penetrates the crack and glows when viewed by flourescent lights.the beechcraft bulletin also contained accomplishment instructions,which directed the owner to perform this ndi test as instructed.see beechcraft service bulletin.
following beechcraft bulletin,the faa issued airworthiness directive ad,requiring that owners of all beechcraft airplanes perform the ndi test in accordance with the instructions in part ii of beechcraft bulletin.faa ad,plaintiff ex.the faa required the testing to prevent failure of the nose landing gear due to undetected fatigue cracking.faa ad.
prior to the time that beechcraft issued its bulletin and the faa issued its ad,the dod had issued regulations governing the performance of ndi tests on military aircraft.military standard,nondestructive testing personnel qualification and certification,july,plaintiff ex.according to military standard,the dod requires that personnel who perform ndi tests be both qualified and certified.military standard foreword states that specifies the qualification and certification requirements for nondestructive testing personnel performing eddy current,liquid penetrant,magnetic particle,radiographic and ultrasonic test methods.at iii emphasis added.military standard divides personnel into three levels,according to their qualifications and training.military standard also requires that the personnel pass a written examination of appropriate,multiple choice,and mathematical questions,covering the applicable method.in addition,the employer must certify that the personnel are qualified to perform the ndi test in accordance with the written procedures.the employer written procedures must establish a training course outline,define time requirements for each phase of the training,and describe the pertinent examinations each candidate must pass.
military standard training and certification requirements also apply to any civilian personnel who performs ndi tests on military aircraft.the ndi technical manual requires that all 
civilian department of defense personnel and of defense personnel performing inspections in accordance with this technical order they shall be qualified and certified to the current at a minimum,the local organization shall document its procedure on tra
