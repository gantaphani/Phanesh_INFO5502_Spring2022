aircraft safety is a matter of significant public importance,and the federal aviation administration faa plays a central role in monitoring safety through its certification of commercial aircraft.at issue in this case is whether the united states is immune from liability under the federal tort claims act,ftca,for the faa alleged negligence in issuing aircraft certifications.company airlog brought suit against the united states under the ftca after the faa issued a directive modifying the terms of two design certificates for converting passenger airplanes to cargo freighters.the district court dismissed airlog complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the discretionary function exception to the ftca.see united states,d.we affirm.
background 
faa design certification 
under the federal aviation act of,et.supp.iv the faa is charged with promoting flight safety by establishing minimum standards for,among other things,aircraft design.see a supp.iv.accordingly,the faa has prescribed a comprehensive set of rules and regulations,including a certification process,for aircraft design and production.a detailed description of this certification process is set out in the supreme court decision in united states empresa de viacao aerea rio grandense varig airlines,d.three aspects of the design certification process are relevant here the type certificate,supplemental type certificate,and airworthiness directive.
the first stage of this process is type certification,in which airplane manufacturers seek approval of new aircraft designs.under federal regulations,aircraft manufacturers must analyze and test their new aircraft designs.see b,b.based on the resulting engineering and test data,the faa then determines the airworthiness of those designs.see b.if the manufacturer demonstrates that the design complies with federal regulations,the faa issues a type certificate.see a b.in most instances,the type certificate covers an aircraft model,rather than an individual airplane.see supp.iv.
any major change to an design then requires additional certification in the form of a supplemental type certificate,also known as an stc.see.by issuing an stc,the faa approves a modification to a aircraft design.see b supp.iv.stcs are obtained through the same process as type certificates the applicant must provide the faa with sufficient engineering and test data to demonstrate compliance with federal regulations.see see also b.
after issuing a type certificate or stc,the faa continues to monitor the safety of the certified aircraft.see a.the faa may amend,modify,suspend or revoke a certificate for airworthiness reasons.such an order takes the form of an airworthiness directive and may require the aircraft owner to alter the aircraft to maintain its certification.see b.after the faa issues an airworthiness directive,the particular aircraft may only be operated in compliance with that directive.see a.
b.the faa issuance of the stcs and an airworthiness directive 
airlog is in the business of converting passenger airplanes into cargo freighters.airlog predecessor entered into a contract with hayes international corporation hayes,an aeronautical engineering company,to design the cargo conversions for boeing passenger airplanes,and to obtain stcs from the faa.because airlog did not have an engineering staff,it relied on hayes for engineering expertise.
the approval process involved faa offices in seattle and atlanta and took place over a period.according to airlog,an important part of this particular approval process was the selection of the engineering methodology that would generate the necessary compliance data,as the methodology would greatly affect the cost and schedule of the project.two methods were considered the comparative or equivalent strength method,and the original loads method.
under the equivalent strength method,each component or section of the proposed modified aircraft is compared to similar components or sections of a aircraft.in contrast,the original loads method does not involve or analysis.rather,it requires the designer to determine what forces are actually applied to the airplane structure under various flight scenarios external loads how those external loads are distributed within the structural elements of the airplane internal loads and whether the structure is strong enough to withstand the internal loads,within the margin of safety required by federal regulations.according to airlog,the original loads method is more costly and than the equivalent strength method.
airlog claims that in,the faa determined that the equivalent strength method was acceptable from an engineering standpoint to assure that hayes conversion design complied with federal regulations.the faa reaffirmed this conclusion in and.in,based on data provided by hayes and generated by the equivalent strength method,the faa issued hayes two stcs,thereby approving its conversion design.hayes,with the faa authorization,assigned the stcs to airlog.between and,the certified design,which related to the cargo door and cargo compartment,was then used to convert ten boeing airplanes into cargo freighters.
following conversion,the faa received multiple reports that the converted airplanes were experiencing potentially problems.in one incident the pilot had to recover from a dive maneuver in others,the airplanes suffered substantial structural damage.consequently,the faa reconsidered the conversion design and determined that its deficiencies required a reduction in the airplanes maximum allowable payload.the faa issued an airworthiness directive to this effect in in which it reduced the allowable payload by approximately pounds.see airworthiness directives.
in the airworthiness directive,the faa concluded that a irplanes modified in accordance with all of the stc are unsafe,and the faa approved these stc in error.id.at.specifically,the faa stated that the ultimate strength of the main deck floor and the surround structure of the main deck and side cargo door are inadequate.id.the faa went on to note that because there would be no warning prior to collapse of the main deck floor the only immediate option would be to reduce the weight of the cargo on the main deck.id.the faa also concluded that,as a result of the lack of reinforced fuselage near the side cargo door,i n the worst case,the aft fuselage may collapse and separate from the airplane without warning.id.finally,the faa stated that in order to reinstate the full load capacity,additional data would have to be generated under the original loads method,rather than the equivalent strength method.see id.at.the equivalent strength method was insufficient because,as it turned out,the hayes design was not sufficiently similar to the design that the faa had previously approved.see id.at.
the practical effect of the airworthiness directive was that the cargo capacity of the converted airplanes was significantly reduced.as a result of the reduction in payload,owners of the converted airplanes brought suit against airlog.airlog then brought this action against the united states,claiming that the faa had been negligent in approving the equivalent strength method,and in issuing stcs based on that method.the government moved to dismiss airlog complaint,arguing that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,because the faa alleged conduct was protected by the discretionary function exception to the ftca.the district court granted the government motion.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review de novo a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the discretionary function exception.gager united states,cir,cert.denied,d.in reviewing the district court dismissal,we must accept as true the factual allegations in the complaint.see united states gaubert,d.
the federal tort claims act grants federal courts jurisdiction over damages claims against the united states for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.b supp.iv.under the ftca,the government may be held liable for negligence in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.the government has not waived its immunity under the ftca,however,for claims 
based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.
a.this discretionary function exception is designed to prevent judicial of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social,economic,and political policy.gaubert,at.quoting varig airlines,at.where the exception applies,the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.reed united states dep t of the interior,cir vickers united states,cir.
in berkovitz united states,d,the supreme court laid out a test that governs application of the discretionary function exception.first,for the exception to apply,the challenged conduct must be is,it must involve an element of judgment or choice.this requirement is not the suit may therefore a federal statute,regulation,or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow,because i n this event,the employee has no rightful option but to adhere to the directive.id.in short,where alleged conduct violates a mandatory directive,it is not discretionary.gaubert,at.in re glacier bay,cir.thus,discretion is the benchmark of this prong of the discretionary function test.
if the conduct involves choice or discretion,the court must then determine whether that judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.berkovitz,at.the focus is on the nature of the actions taken and on whether they are susceptible to policy analysis.gaubert,at.the decision need not actually be grounded in policy considerations so long as it is,by its nature,susceptible to a policy analysis.nurse united states,cir quoting miller united states,cir.when a statute or regulation allows a federal employee to act with discretion,it must be presumed that the agent acts are grounded in policy when exercising that discretion.gaubert,at.
whether a challenged action falls within the discretionary function exception requires a particularized analysis of the specific agency action challenged.see glacier bay,at.the government bears the burden of proving that the discretionary function exception applies.reed,at.
with respect to the specific act or actions challenged in this appeal,airlog does little to differentiate between the faa alleged negligence in issuing the stcs and its alleged negligence in approving the equivalent strength testing method.we would be inclined to agree that the latter decision was merely an aspect of the larger stc process.however,when determining whether the discretionary function exception is applicable,t he proper question to ask is not whether the government as a whole had discretion at any point,but whether its allegedly negligent agents did in each instance.glacier bay,at.therefore,we endeavor to analyze these decisions separately.
issuance of the stcs.
under the first prong of the berkovitz test,the faa decision to issue hayes the stcs was discretionary,as no federal statute,regulation,or policy prescribes a specific course of action for the faa to follow when issuing these certificates.the faa receives information from aircraft manufacturers,who are responsible for conducting inspections and tests necessary to demonstrate that proposed design modifications comply with federal regulations.see see also b.based on that data,the faa exercises its discretion to determine whether to issue an stc.
airlog argues that faa order eliminates the faa discretion in the stc process.airlog points to no other statute,regulation or order as the basis for its challenge.section three of faa order governs stcs,and provides in relevant part 
a supplemental type certificate will be issued only if the pertinent technical data have been examined and found satisfactory,all necessary tests and compliance inspections have been satisfactorily completed and the modification has been found to conform with the technical data.
emphasis added.according to airlog,under this regulation,the faa had no discretion to issue stcs based on the equivalent strength method,because that method did not generate pertinent technical data.
airlog argument is misplaced,as faa order does not specifically prescribe a course of action for an employee to follow when deciding whether to issue an stc.berkovitz,at.even the question of what constitutes pertinent technical data necessarily involves a judgment call.the order does not dictate the nature or extent of the data,nor does it mandate any particular method of analysis.to argue,as airlog does,that the faa violated its mandate on pertinent technical data because it reviewed data generated by the equivalent strength method simply begs the question.the faa was under no mandate to examine a specific type of data,nor to benchmark the data against any particular standard.
in short,although the faa must examine pertinent technical data before issuing an stc,the faa has discretion to determine what constitutes pertinent technical data and whether to issue an stc because the faa conduct involved judgment or choice,the government has satisfied the first prong of the berkovitz test.
the government also meets its burden under the second prong of the berkovitz test the faa conduct is susceptible to policy analysis.as a starting point,we turn to the presumption articulated by the supreme court in gaubert when established governmental policy allows a government agent to exercise discretion,it must be presumed that the agent acts are grounded in policy when exercising that discretion.at.we conclude that airlog has not overcome this presumption.
airlog challenges the faa conduct in connection with its responsibility to establish and enforce federal air safety,the faa decisions to issue the stcs and,thereafter,an airworthiness directive that amended the conditions of those stcs.see a,b,b.our analysis therefore fits squarely within that of the supreme court in varig airlines.
in varig airlines,the court held that the discretionary function exception protected the government from liability for the faa alleged negligence in connection with its issuance of a type certificate and an stc.at.after the crash of two commercial airplanes,the plaintiffs brought suit against the government under the ftca,arguing that the faa and its predecessor,the civil aeronautics agency,were negligent in certifying the airplanes because the airplanes did not comply with safety regulations.id.at.the government argued that the responsibility for satisfying air safety standards rests with the manufacturer,not with the faa.id.at.the role of the faa,according to the government,is merely to police the conduct of private individuals by monitoring their compliance with federal regulations,which it does through a program.id.the government argued that such regulatory activity is the sort of conduct protected by the discretionary function exception.id.
the court agreed with the government and held that the discretionary function exception shielded the faa from liability.id.at.the court noted that the duty to ensure that an aircraft conforms to faa safety regulations lies with the manufacturer,while the faa retains the responsibility for policing compliance.id.at.recognizing that only a relatively small number of engineers is available to evaluate data submitted by applicants for compliance with air safety regulations,id.at,the court concluded that the faa decision to use a system was an exercise of discretion based on policy considerat
