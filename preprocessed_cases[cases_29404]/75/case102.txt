we consider the constitutionality of a policy of the new york thruway authority that provides a toll discount to residents of grand island,new york,who must use bridges jointly,grand island bridge or the bridge in order to travel by car between their homes and any location not on grand island,while denying the discount to all other motorists.plaintiffs in this putative class action are motorists who use the grand island bridge but,because they are not residents of grand island,do not qualify for the lowest toll rate.they seek a judgment declaring that the toll discount policies violate the dormant commerce clause as well as the constitutional right to travel that courts have located in the privileges or immunities and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment,both in violation of 
we first encountered this case in when we held,in substance,that plaintiffs complaint survived defendants motion to dismiss.see selevan thruway,cir selevan i.in particular,we affirmed the judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york gary sharpe,judge,insofar as it dismissed plaintiffs challenge to the thruway toll policy under the privileges and immunities clause of article iv of the constitution but we vacated the district court judgment insofar as it held that plaintiffs had failed to establish article iii standing were not proper parties to allege a violation of the dormant commerce clause under the supreme court prudential standing doctrine and had not stated claims under the dormant commerce clause or under the equal protection and privileges or immunities clauses of the fourteenth amendment of the constitution.id.at.we also remanded the cause to the district court for further proceedings.after the filing of a second amended complaint sac,a course of discovery,and entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants,the case returns for us to consider the merits of plaintiffs remaining constitutional claims.
robert selevan,anne rubin,david talarico,and samuel taub jointly,plaintiffs challenge the november,memorandum decision and order of the district court which,among other things,granted judgment in favor of the thruway and its chief executive and chairman,john buono jointly,defendants or nyta.in this appeal,we are asked to consider whether the district court should have reviewed plaintiffs claims under the test of strict scrutiny and properly applied the test established by the supreme court in northwest airlines,county of kent,d northwest airlines,to plaintiffs and dormant commerce clause claims.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the municipality of grand island,new york is located on an island in the niagara river,approximately halfway between niagara falls,new york and buffalo,new york see selevan i,at.grand island is connected to the surrounding mainland,to the north and south,by the grand island bridge,which is maintained and operated by nyta as part of interstate.id.each noncommercial vehicle crossing the bridge must pay a toll at one of three rates a general passenger rate of per trip passenger rate a commuter rate of cents per trip commuter rate or a grand island resident rate of cents per trip resident rate any motorist may qualify for the cent commuter rate by for a bundle of at least trips.only residents of grand island,however,may qualify for the cent resident rate.of grand island who do not for a commuter rate bundle must pay the passenger rate.
plaintiffs robert selevan and anne rubin jointly,original plaintiffs,residents of nassau county,new york and ontario,canada,respectively,commenced this putative class action in march.see id.at.the original plaintiffs allegedly paid the passenger rate to use the grand island bridge,id.at,and claimed that the nyta toll scheme violated their constitutional rights,id.at.in a careful opinion dated january,the district court dismissed the complaint of the original plaintiffs.id.at.
in selevan i,we affirmed in part,vacated in part,and remanded the action to the district court for further proceedings,holding that the original plaintiffs had stated claims under the dormant commerce clause and pursuant to their constitutional right to travel under the fourteenth amendment privileges or immunities and equal protection clauses.id.at.we directed that on remand plaintiffs dormant commerce clause and right to travel claims must be analyzed under the test set forth by the supreme court in northwest airlines id.
following our remand of the cause to the district court,the original plaintiffs amended their complaint to add david talarico and samuel taub,two residents of erie county,new york,who allegedly paid the commuter rate.plaintiffs also restated their dormant commerce clause and claims.on november,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment in its entirety.this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
we review a district court summary judgment de novo,see niagara mohawk power hudson river black river regulating,cir,with a ll evidence submitted on the motion construed in the manner most favorable to the nonmoving party,horvath westport library ass n,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the moving party shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.georgitsi realty,llc penn star ins,cir quotation marks omitted.a defendant is entitled to summary judgment where the plaintiff s have failed to come forth with evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable juror to return a verdict in his or her favor on an essential element of a claim on which the plaintiffs bear the burden of proof.in re omnicom.sec,cir quotation marks omitted.
on appeal,defendants reassert the claim that plaintiffs lack standing to bring this action.we rejected this argument in selevan i,before the parties conducted discovery,but defendants now renew their standing argument by asserting that plaintiffs have failed to sustain their evidentiary burden.plaintiffs,in turn,claim that the district court erred by not reviewing their claims under the test of strict scrutiny,and misapplied each of the three factors set forth in northwest airlines,at,with respect to both their and dormant commerce clause claims.
to establish article iii standing,plaintiffs must demonstrate an,which is a concrete and particularized harm to a legally protected interest causation in the form of a fairly traceable connection between the asserted and the alleged actions of the defendant and redressability,or a likelihood that the injury can be remedied by the requested relief.huff asset mgmt.deloitte touche ll p,cir emphasis omitted quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
in selevan i,we held that i nasmuch as plaintiffs had alleged that they have paid higher tolls as a result of nyta policy,they have articulated a commercial,economic injury that is concrete and specific to them,and is caused by nyta alleged violation of the commerce clause.at quotation marks omitted.defendants nevertheless ask us to revisit our holding based on an affidavit of the nyta chief financial officer,which states that the financial impact of the resident discount on nonresident motorists is negligible and that the nyta does not charge higher tolls to other users of the grand island bridge or the overall thruway system because of the resident discount.appellees br.emphasis supplied.in short,defendants argue that because the plaintiffs have offered no proof that the tolls they pay are inflated because of the resident discount or that termination of the resident discount would likely result in a reduction of the passenger rate or the commuter rate paid by plaintiffs,they lack standing.id.at.
as we noted in selevan i,however,plaintiffs define their injury as the burden of paying higher toll rates than grand island residents and the denial of toll discounts based on their residency status.at alterations and quotation marks omitted.the asserted fact that plaintiffs pay higher tolls than the grand island residents is not disputed,and it is sufficient to establish article iii standing,regardless of how the nyta would establish tolls for the grand island bridge absent the discount for island residents.see id.at article iii standing,prudential standing.
ii.standard of review strict scrutiny 
on appeal,plaintiffs claim that the grand island bridge toll scheme infringes upon a fundamental right their constitutional right to travel and therefore must be analyzed under the test of strict scrutiny.courts have long recognized that the constitution protects a right to travel within the united states,including for purely intrastate travel.see,saenz roe,d noting that the right to travel protects the right of a citizen of one state to enter and to leave another state,the right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien when temporarily present in the second state,and,for those travelers who elect to become permanent residents,the right to be treated like other citizens of that state williams town of greenburgh,cir.
generally,w hen a local regulation infringes upon a right,we apply the test of strict scrutiny,requiring the municipality to show that the regulation is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.selevan i,at quoting town of southold town of hampton,cir.this principle,however,is not applicable to the current context because minor restrictions on travel simply do not amount to the denial of a fundamental right.id.at quotation marks omitted.indeed,in selevan i,we held that the grand island bridge toll scheme was a minor restriction on plaintiffs right to travel and not a penalty.id.p laintiffs do not allege that they pay the full toll in order to commute to work or that the toll has otherwise had a substantial financial impact on them t hey allege that they paid the toll en route to new jersey for shopping and other activities.these facts suggest at most a minor restriction on plaintiffs right to travel,rather than a penalty.relying on our comments in selevan i,plaintiffs now claim that the addition of plaintiffs talarico and taub both of whom allegedly pay the commuter rate on a weekday basis transforms the toll into a penalty rather than a minor restriction.
plaintiffs misread selevan i.our discussion of the facts alleged in the original complaint was merely illustrative of how and why the toll did not constitute a penalty.contrary to plaintiffs view,we did not indicate that the district court could and should apply strict scrutiny if the plaintiffs included individuals who traveled the grand island bridge in the course of commuting to work appellants br.rather,in contemplation of a remand to the district court,we drew the attention of the trial court and the parties to evansville vanderburgh airport authority district delta airlines,d evansvile,where the supreme court recognized a difference between the sort of invidious distinctions that penalize the right to travel and cases in which a state has simply levied a charge designed only to make the user of facilities pay a reasonable fee to help defray the costs of their construction and maintenance.selevan i,at citations omitted quoting evansville,at.indeed,the evansville court permitted the imposition of fees designed to offset the cost of maintaining a facility so long as the fees reflect ed a uniform,fair and practical standard relating to public expenditures.selevan i,at quoting evansville,at.
in selevan i,we instructed the district court on remand to reexamine the grand island bridge toll policy with an eye to determining whether the toll policy implicates the right to travel in the context discussed in evansville.at.we explained that,if the district court were to find that the toll policy involved invidious distinctions,then the test of strict scrutiny would apply if it were to determine that the toll policy was merely a minor restriction on travel,then the test announced in the supreme court subsequent decision in northwest airlines,at,would govern.id.on remand,the district court concluded that since the toll structure constitutes a reasonable user fee designed to defray the costs of maintenance and construction strict scrutiny is inappropriate.selevan thruway,cv,wl,at.in short,the mere addition of plaintiffs who pay the commuter rate did not transform a minor restriction on travel into an instance of invidious distinctions.see selevan i,at.hence,as the district court held,the toll policy is subject to the northwest airlines test and not the test of strict scrutiny.
iii.northwest airlines three part test 
under northwest airlines,the constitutional permissibility of fees charged for the use of state facilities is evaluated under a test,which asks whether the fee is based on some fair approximation of use of the facilities,is not excessive in relation to the benefits conferred,and does not discriminate against interstate commerce.northwest airlines,at.on remand,the district court determined that the grand island bridge toll scheme satisfied all three parts of the test.selevan,wl,at.plaintiffs challenge that holding,requiring us,in turn,to analyze each part of the test.
to determine whether the grand island bridge toll policy is based on some fair approximation of use of the facilities,northwest airlines,at,we directed the district court to consider whether the nyta policy at issue reflects rational distinctions among different classes of motorists using the bridge,so that each user,on the whole,pays some approximation of his or her fair share of the state cost for maintaining the bridge.selevan i,at emphasis added quoting evansvile,at.the district court concluded that the resident discount is meant to alleviate both the severe geographic isolation faced by grand island residents and the residuary effects of nearly million travelers bisecting the island annually.selevan,wl,at.
we find these factors to be not a wholly unreasonable basis upon which to draw a distinction between grand island residents,who,because of the small size and isolation of grand island,may need to use the bridge and pay the toll several times a day,and other motorists using the bridge.evansville,at and we agree that under the grand island bridge toll scheme,motorists on the whole,pay some approximation of their fair share for use of the bridge.selevan i,at.even while acknowledging that an imperfect estimate of a motorist fair share is constitutionally permissible,plaintiffs argue that the toll scheme provides a near exemption for residents and is therefore a grossly unfair misallocation of costs.but it is the amount of the toll,not its formula,that is of central concern.evansville,at.even assuming arguendo that some degree of inequity exists in the very small difference between the resident rate and the rates for others,no evidence in the record suggests that the district court erred in finding that plaintiffs are paying some approximation of their fair share of the costs of using the grand island bridge.selevan,wl,at.
accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not err in deciding that the grand island bridge toll scheme is a fair,if imperfect,approximation of the use of facilities for whose benefit they are imposed.evansville,at.
to satisfy the second part of the northwest airlines test,the grand island toll can not be excessive in relation to the benefits conferred.at.as we emphasized in selevan i,however,there need not be a perfect fit between the use of the bridge and the support of the bridge by the toll.the northwest airlines test is not inflexible it simply requires reasonableness.selevan i,at quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.after discovery,and based on evidence regarding nyta costs and expenditures,the district court determined that the nyta had not been collecting excess revenues from its grand island tolls.selevan,wl,at.this conclusion was based,in part,upon the reasonable view that any revenues collected did not exceed proper margins,given the nyta public safety responsibilities and its expenses for construction and maintenance.id the district court concluded that the cents and charged per trip under the commuter and passenger plans,respectively,are not excessive in relation to the benefits which they confer namely access to a well maintained,high
