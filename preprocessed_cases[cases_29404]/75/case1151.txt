after respondent sandra molenda was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol,the arresting officer issued an administrative order suspending her driving privilege.after an administrative hearing,the department of motor vehicles dmv upheld the suspension of molenda driving privilege.molenda petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate,challenging the dmv order on the ground that the forensic laboratory report of her blood test results,which the dmv used to prove that molenda was under the influence,was hearsay and did not meet the requirements of evidence code section,the public employee records exception to the hearsay rule.the court held that the laboratory report of the blood test results did not meet the requirements of the public employee records exception to the hearsay rule because the report was not made at or near the time of the testing as required by evidence code section,subdivision b.the court also excluded the evidence of molenda preliminary alcohol screening pas test results because the foundational facts necessary for their admission had not been established.the court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the dmv finding that molenda was driving with a blood alcohol level of percent or more and granted the writ.
the dmv appeals,arguing that the trial court erred in excluding the lab report of molenda blood test results because the report was admissible under vehicle code section,subdivision g,which the dmv contends prevails over both evidence code section and government code section,subdivision d,the statute that governs the admissibility of hearsay evidence in administrative proceedings.the dmv also argues that the court erred when it refused to consider the pas test results.we hold that the blood test results were not admissible under evidence code section or vehicle code section and that under the circumstances of this case,the dmv may not rely on the presumptions in evidence code section to establish the foundation necessary for the admission of the pas test results.we therefore conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded the lab report of the blood test results or when it excluded the breath test results that were obtained using a pas device.we shall therefore affirm the trial court judgment.
on august,california highway patrol chp officers responded to the scene of a rollover accident near the entrance ramp from state park drive to southbound highway in santa cruz county.
officer geddes was the first officer on the scene.when he arrived,he found a dodge durango on its wheels in the median between the and the highway.molenda,who was alone in the car,was seated in the driver seat,trying to start the engine.because of the damage to the durango,officer geddes instructed molenda to get out of the car through the rear door.officer geddes observed signs of intoxication and smelled a strong odor of alcohol on molenda.
officers barry and lloyd were dispatched at approximately they arrived on the scene at either or.when they arrived,molenda was outside the car.molenda admitted to officer barry that she had been driving and that she had lost control and crashed.officer barry observed signs of intoxication and smelled a strong odor of alcohol on her breath.molenda also admitted drinking wine with dinner.officer barry conducted field sobriety tests,which molenda failed.he tested molenda with a pas device at and,which produced readings of percent and percent blood alcohol content.officer barry determined that molenda had been driving under the influence dui of an alcoholic beverage and arrested her.officer barry issued an administrative order suspending molenda driver license on the ground that she had percent or more of alcohol in her blood and molenda surrendered her license to him at the scene.
molenda was transported by ambulance to dominican hospital.officer barry advised her of the implied consent law and she agreed to provide a blood sample.molenda blood was drawn by a hospital lab technician at on august.officer barry placed the blood sample into chp evidence for analysis by the doj department of justice crime lab.molenda was subsequently transported and booked into jail.
the doj bureau of forensic services laboratory lab received the blood sample on august.the lab completed its analysis on september its report was dated september.according to the lab report,molenda blood alcohol level was.
procedural history 
administrative per se hearing 
molenda requested an administrative hearing regarding the suspension of her driver license.the hearing was conducted by telephone on november.molenda was represented by counsel,but did not appear at the hearing.
officer barry testified regarding his observations at the scene.with regard to the blood alcohol testing,officer barry testified that he administered the pas test and that it showed the presence of alcohol.the hearing officer did not ask officer barry for the numerical results of the pas test.officer barry also stated that he arrested molenda and that after he admonished her regarding the implied consent law,she chose a blood test.
the hearing officer introduced and received the following documents into evidence officer barry sworn statement on a dmv ds form,officer barry unsworn investigation report on chp forms,the suspension order,the declaration of the lab technician who took the blood sample,the lab report,an unsworn traffic collision report prepared by officer lloyd,the notice of the hearing,a temporary license issued to molenda,the dmv request for discovery,and molenda driving record.
molenda counsel objected to any evidence of molenda blood alcohol level as a result of the testing with the pas device on the grounds that there was no foundation to support the accuracy of the readings and under the authority of coniglio department of motor vehicles th,d coniglio which held that pas devices are not subject to the compliance standards set forth in california code of regulations,title,sections hereafter title.the hearing officer sustained both objections and stated that he would not consider the pas test results for numerical proof of molenda blood alcohol level.however,he did consider the pas test results to the extent that they confirmed the presence of alcohol and supported the officer conclusion that molenda was intoxicated.
citing downer zolin th,d downer,disapproved on other grounds in lake reed cal th,footnote,d,lake,molenda also objected to the admissibility and sufficiency of the blood test results.her counsel argued that since the report was completed one week after the lab tested the blood sample,the report did not meet one of the foundational requirements of evidence code section,the public employee records exception to the hearsay rule,since the report was not prepared at or near the time of the reported event,subd.b.the hearing officer took the objection under submission.
the hearing officer determined that the blood test results were admissible.with regard to molenda objection,the hearing officer held that this case was distinguishable from downer because the report in downer was not dated and thus did not indicate when it was prepared,while the report in this case was dated.the hearing officer noted that no evidence had been submitted to show that the blood result is invalid or that the chain of custody was broken and concluded that seven days is at or near the time of the analysis.the hearing officer upheld the suspension of molenda driver license.
ii.petition for writ of mandate in the superior court 
molenda petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate to set aside the suspension.in her petition,molenda argued that the lab report was not admissible under the public employee records exception to the hearsay rule because it was not prepared at or near the time of the testing and consequently,there was no admissible evidence that established her blood alcohol level.
the dmv opposed the petition,arguing that the admissibility and sufficiency of the lab report was governed by vehicle code section,subdivision g,which as the more particular statute prevails over both evidence code section and government code section.the dmv also argued that even if the lab report was not admissible,the pas test results were admissible and sufficient by themselves to establish molenda blood alcohol level.
the trial court excluded the pas test results because the foundational facts necessary for their admission had not been established.citing glatman valverde th,d,the court also held that the delay in preparing the report of the blood test results rendered the lab report inadmissible.the court therefore concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the dmv finding that molenda was driving with a blood alcohol level of percent or more.the court granted the writ,ordered the dmv to set aside its order suspending molenda license,and ordered that molenda driving privilege be reinstated.the dmv appeals.
discussion 
in a dmv administrative hearing,the dmv is required to suspend a person driving privilege if it determines by a preponderance of the evidence that a peace officer had reasonable cause to believe that the person had been driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs,the person was placed under arrest,and the person was driving with percent or more,by weight,of alcohol in his or her blood.lake,supra,cal th at,d.the dmv bears the burden of proof.id.at,d.
molenda contends that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that she was driving with a blood alcohol level over percent,since the lab report was inadmissible hearsay and the hearing officer had ruled that the pas test results were inadmissible.the dmv contends that the lab report,although hearsay,was admissible under vehicle code section,subdivision g,and was sufficient by itself to support the dmv finding that molenda was driving with a blood alcohol level in excess of percent.the dmv also contends that even if the lab report was inadmissible,the pas test results were admissible and sufficient by themselves to support the dmv finding.
standards of review 
generally,when ruling on a petition for a writ of mandate challenging an order suspending a driver license,a trial court exercises its independent judgment to determine whether the weight of the evidence supported the administrative decision.lake,supra,cal th at,d.on appeal,we review the record to determine whether the trial court findings are supported by substantial evidence.id.at,d.
however,when the appellant challenges a court evidentiary ruling,a different standard of review applies.generally,we review the trial court rulings regarding the admissibility of evidence under the deferential abuse of discretion standard.city of ripon sweetin th,d.t he appropriate test of abuse of discretion is whether or not the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances before it being considered.in re marriage of connolly cal d.appellate courts will disturb discretionary trial court rulings only upon a showing of a clear case of abuse and a miscarriage of justice.blank kirwan cal d.
specifically,we review the trial court ruling that the lab report did not meet the requirements of evidence code section for an abuse of discretion.a trial court has broad discretion in determining whether a party has established the foundational requirements of evidence code section.citation.its ruling on admissibility implies whatever finding of fact is prerequisite thereto a separate or formal finding is,with exceptions not applicable here,unnecessary,subd.c.citation.a reviewing court may overturn the trial court exercise of discretion only upon a clear showing of abuse.people martinez cal th,d,martinez,citing people williams cal th,d.
to the extent that the issues presented here require us to interpret one or more statutes,we apply the de novo standard of review.since the interpretation of a statute presents questions of law,appellate courts independently determine the meaning of a statute and are not bound by the trial court interpretation.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d,in re clarissa th,d.
ii.admissibility of forensic lab report regarding blood test results 
general rules governing admissibility of evidence in dmv proceedings 
the rules governing the evidence available for use in dmv administrative per se hearings are set forth in division,chapter,article of the vehicle code,commencing with section,subd.a.two provisions are especially relevant.first,vehicle code section states in pertinent part at any hearing,the department shall consider its official records and may receive sworn testimony.italics added.second,for all matters not specifically covered by the vehicle code provisions,vehicle code section incorporates the provisions of the administrative procedures act governing administrative hearings generally,et see also,subd.b administrative procedures act applies to dmv.lake,supra,cal th at,d.
government code section addresses the admissibility of evidence generally in administrative hearings.lake,supra,cal th at,d.it provides in relevant part c the hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses,except as hereinafter provided.any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs,regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of the evidence over objection in civil actions.d hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions,subds.c d.under subdivision d of the statute,a forensic lab report,although hearsay,may be used to supplement or explain other evidence.but it shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over a hearsay objection in a civil action.thus,to support a finding by itself,the forensic lab report must fall within an exception to the hearsay rule.
in lake,the california supreme court held that despite their hearsay nature,blood and urine test reports prepared by government forensic laboratories are admissible in dmv administrative review hearings as official records under the public employee records exception to the hearsay rule,provided they meet the requirements of evidence code section,which sets forth the exception.lake,supra,cal th at,d.this is true even when the forensic reports are not certified under penalty of perjury ibid.
evidence code section provides evidence of a writing made as a record of an act,condition,or event is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered in any civil or criminal proceeding to prove the act,condition,or event if all of the following applies a the writing was made by and within the scope of duty of a public employee.b the writing was made at or near the time of the act,condition,or event.c the sources of information and method and time of preparation were such as to indicate its trustworthiness.as this court stated in furman department of motor vehicles th,d,to come within the hearsay exception in evidence code section,a forensic laboratory report must be a record made by a public employee with a duty to perform,and record the result of,a forensic alcohol analysis,have been made at or near the time of completion of the analysis,and have been made under circumstances that reflected that it was trustworthy.furman,at,d.
the dmv acknowledges that to be sufficient by itself to support a finding regarding a licensee blood alcohol level,a forensic lab report must meet the requirements of an exception to the hearsay rule and that,ordinarily,that exception is found in evidence code section,the public employee records exception.the dmv contends,however,that the lab report was admissible and sufficient by itself to support the hearing officer finding regarding molenda blood alcohol level under vehicle code section,subdivision g and that consequently,the court erred in excluding the report under evidence code section.
vehicle code section,subdivision g provides in relevant part if the person submitted to a blood or urine test,the peace officer shall forward the results immediately to the appropriate forensic laboratory.the forensic laboratory shall forward the results of the chemical tests to the department within calendar days of the date of the arrest.a notwithstanding any other provision of law,a document containing data prepared and maintained in the governmental forensic laboratory computerized database system that is electronically transmitted or retrieved through public or private computer networks to or by the department is the best available evidence of the chemical test results in all administrative proceedings conducted by the department.in addition,any other official record that is maintained in the governmental forensic laboratory,relates to a chemical test analysis prepared and maintained in the governmental forensic laboratory computerized database system,and is electronically transmitted and retrieved through a public or private computer network to or by the department is admissible as evidence in the department administrative proceedings.in order to be admissible as evidence in administrative proceedings,a document described in this subparagraph shall bear a certification by the employee of the department who retrieved the document certifying that the information was received or retrieved directly from the computerized database system of a governmental forensic laboratory and that the document accurately reflects the data received or retrieved.italics added.the word department in the statute refers to the dmv.
admissibility of forensic lab blood test results under evidence code section 
molenda contends the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded the lab report of the blood test results because the lab report was not completed at or near the time of the act,condition or event reported the analysis of the blood sample and therefore did not comply with the requirement for admission as a official record under evidence code section,subdivision b.without expressly conceding the point,the dmv seems to agree that the report was not admissible under evidence code section.
how soon a writing must be made after the act or event is a matter of degree and calls for the exercise of reasonable judgment on the part of the trial judge.martinez,supra,cal th at,fn,d.t he timeliness requirement is not to be judged by arbitrary or artificial time limits,measured by hours or days or even weeks.citation.rather,account must be taken of practical considerations,including the nature of the information recorded and the immutable reliability of the sources from which the information was drawn.citation.whether an entry made subsequent to the transaction has been made within a sufficient time to render it within the hearsay exception depends upon whether the time span between the transaction and the entry was so great as to suggest a danger of inaccuracy by lapse of memory.id.at,d,italics added.in martinez,the court held that the doj entry into clets california law enforcement telecommunications system of criminal information it receives does not depend on memory,but simply involves a transfer of information from one form of disposition clets database.under these circumstances,the doj statutory recording duties are sufficiently specific to support the trial court discretionary determination that the clets printout met the timeliness requirement of the official records exception.ibid.
in downer,a motorist urine sample was analyzed twice,by two different analysts in the government forensic lab.there were no signatures near the statement of certification and there was a factual issue regarding whether the analysts report was dated.downer,supra,th at,d.the appellate court concluded that the superior court had not erred when it found that the report was undated and observed that there was no other information which the trial court could rely on to deduce its date of preparation.id.at,d.the court held that the absence of evidence showing the report was made at or near the time of the reported event renders this report inadmissible hearsay under evidence code section.ibid.
in a footnote,the court discussed the evidence relating to the factual question whether the report was dated and concluded we can not say the court factual finding was clearly erroneous.but even if it were,a report prepared nearly a week after the forensic tests were completed does not fall within the statutory requirement that the report be prepared at or near the time of the reported event.downer,supra,th at,fn,d.since the court upheld the trial court finding that the report was undated,the latter conclusion is dictum.
in glatman,which was decided after the administrative hearing in this case,the motorist blood sample was analyzed on july,and analyzed a second time a day later.glatman,supra,th at,d.both analysts signed the report,which was dated august,one week after the first test was done.ibid.the dmv argued that the analysts entered the test results into the lab computer database shortly after completing each test and that the preparation of the report one week later simply involved retrieving the data from the database.glatman,supra,th at,d.the appellate court disagreed and observed that the record was silent regarding the procedures that the analysts used to record their test results and that there was no evidence that the test results were recorded in a computer database or anywhere else before the date the report was prepared.id.at,d.the court held that the case presented a danger of inaccuracy by lapse of memory and observed that memory is subject to erosion with every day that passes.id.at,d.the court concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion in finding that the forensic report was not prepared at or near the time of the recorded event.id.at,d.
in our view,this case is distinguishable from martinez and similar to glatman.as in glatman,there is no evidence the test result was entered into a computer database or recorded in any manner prior to the preparation of the written report,which was done one week after the analysis was completed.the report states that i nformation regarding the examination and conclusions are entered into and are maintained within the doj laboratory information management system lims database.however,it does not state when the test results were entered into the database.moreover,the record is silent regarding the lab policies and procedures for recording test results.
furthermore,we can not presume the test results were timely recorded under evidence code section the presumption that an official duty has been regularly performed,since no statute or regulation imposes a timeliness duty with regard to the recording of test results that could be presumed to have been met.glatman,supra,th at,d.
for these reasons,we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it held that the lab report was inadmissible because it was not prepared at or near the time of the recorded event,as required by evidence code section,subdivision b.
admissibility of blood test results under vehicle code section 
the parties contentions regarding vehicle code section 
the dmv argues that by adopting vehicle code section,the legislature intended to clear away any obstacles presented by evidence code section so that the doj lab reports would be sufficient in dmv administrative proceedings to establish a driver blood alcohol level.it contends that the only reason for adding subdivision g to vehicle code section was to ensure that the doj lab reports would be sufficient to support findings in dmv administrative proceedings under government code section d,notwithstanding the foundational requirements of evidence code section.the dmv asserts that the only requirement that the legislature imposed for the use of a forensic lab report by the dmv is that the report bear a certification from the dmv employee who retrieved the report from the doj computer as set forth in vehicle code section,subdivision g a.the dmv also contends that that requirement was met in this case and that the lab report was therefore both admissible and sufficient to support the hearing officer finding that molenda blood alcohol level exceeded the legal limit.
at oral argument,the dmv argued that vehicle code section,subdivision g prevails over evidence code section,government code section,and the entire evidence code.
molenda argues that vehicle code section was designed to avoid any best evidence objections to the admission of laboratory reports that are already in a computerized data base and is not any type of exception to the official records exception to the hearsay rule in section of the evidence code she contends that vehicle code section,subdivision g merely pertains to the admission of a certain type of evidence at an administrative hearing and does not state rules pertaining to the sufficiency of that evidence to support an administrative finding.
rules of statutory construction 
as noted above,the interpretation of statutes presents questions of law that are subject to our independent review on appeal.in re clarissa,supra,th at,d.
a fundamental rule of statutory construction is that a court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.phelps stostad cal th,d.first and foremost,we look for that purpose in the actual language of the statute.mercer department of motor vehicles cal d.if the meaning is without ambiguity,doubt,or uncertainty,then the language controls.security pacific national bank wozab cal d.if the meaning of the words is not clear,we may refer to various extrinsic aids,including the history of the statute,to determine the intent of the legislature.kaiser foundation health plan,lifeguard,th,d.finally,if neither the words of the statute nor its legislative history reveal a clear meaning,we apply reason and practicality,and interpret the statute in accord with common sense and justice,and to avoid an absurd result.halbert lumber,lucky stores,th,d.
when interpreting a statute,we consider the statutory language in the context of the entire statute and the statutory scheme of which it is a part.phelps stostad,supra,cal th at,d.we give effect to statutes according to the usual,ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.if possible,we give significance to every word,phrase,sentence and part of an act pursuant to its legislative purpose.ibid.when used in a statute words must be construed in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.citations.moreover,the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole,internal quotation marks omitted.
finally,a more specific statute controls over a more general one touching on the same subject.lake,supra,cal th at,d,department of industrial relations fidelity roof th,d.
vehicle code section is located in article,chapter of division of the vehicle code,which sets forth general provisions related to procedures for handling dui cases.it is part of california implied consent law.people wilson th,d wilson.the immediate purposes of the implied consent law are to obtain the best evidence of blood alcohol content at the time of the arrest of a person who is reasonably believed to be driving while intoxicated before the evidence becomes unavailable due to the passage of time ibid.and to provide incentive for voluntary submission to chemical tests thereby eliminating the potential for violence inherent in forcible testing hernandez department of motor vehicles cal d.the ultimate purpose of the law is to deter motorists from drinking and driving.hughey department of motor vehicles d,d.
based on the plain language of the statute,subdivision g a of vehicle code section has a narrow purpose,which is to permit the electronic transmission or retrieval of information regarding blood alcohol testing done by governmental forensic laboratories directly from the laboratories databases to the dmv.subdivision g of the statute requires government forensic labs to forward the results of blood alcohol testing to the dmv.subdivision g of the statute applies to a narrow group of documents.it refers to two types of documents documents containing data prepared and maintained in the governmental forensic laboratory computerized database system and any other official record that is maintained in the governmental forensic laboratory that relates to a chemical test analysis prepared and maintained in the governmental forensic laboratory computerized database system,subd.g a.subdivision g of section contains another limitation.it applies to documents and records that are electronically transmitted or retrieved through public or private computer networks to or by the dmv,subd.g a.such documents and records are admissible in dmv administrative proceedings if certified by the employee of the dmv who retrieved the document that the information was received or retrieved directly from the lab computerized database system and that it accurately reflects the data received or retrieved from the database,subd.g a.the clear import of these provisions is to permit government forensic laboratories to send documents to the dmv electronically and to permit the dmv to receive or retrieve information regarding blood alcohol testing done by governmental forensic laboratories directly from the laboratories computerized databases.
moreover,the statute provides that a document that contains data that was prepared and maintained in the lab computerized database system and is electronically transmitted or retrieved through computer networks is the best available evidence of the lab chemical test results in an administrative proceeding conducted by the dmv,subd.g a.in our view,the phrase best available evidence refers to the admissibility of the evidence under the secondary evidence rule which provides that the content of a writing may be proved by otherwise admissible secondary evidence unless the court determines either that a genuine dispute exists concerning material terms of the writing and justice requires the exclusion or that admission of the secondary evidence would be unfair,subd.a,italics added.
the secondary evidence rule permits the introduction of otherwise admissible secondary evidence to prove the contents of a writing.pajaro valley water management agency mcgrath th,d.it does not excuse the proponent of the evidence from complying with other rules of evidence,most notably the hearsay rule,citing dart industries,commercial union ins.cal th,fn,d.a writing that passes muster under the secondary evidence rule is not necessarily admissible.the writing still may be inadmissible because of other exclusionary rules of evidence,such as hearsay,opinion,privilege,or irrelevancy.jefferson,supra,citing pajaro valley,supra,th,d.
without any analysis or explanation,the dmv argues that the use of the phrase n otwithstanding any other provision of law in vehicle code section,subdivision g indicates that the legislature intended that the statute prevail over the provisions of evidence code section,government code section,and the entire evidence code.
in people delacruz th,d,the court explained that the language notwithstanding other provisions of law in penal code section is term of art that has been read as an express legislative intent to have the specific statute control despite the existence of other law which might otherwise govern.accord people franklin th,d interpreting,subds.c,d,and f.in california housing finance agency fairway associates i th,d,the court explained the introductory phrase of health and safety code section f,n otwithstanding any other provision of law,qualifies the operative language of the section entitling the prevailing party to recover costs and reasonable attorney fees.thus any other provision of law relating to costs,to the extent contrary to or inconsistent with health and safety code section f,is subordinated to the latter provision.the phrase has been interpreted as referring to both statutory and decisional law.people tillman th,d.
although the introductory phrase n otwithstanding any other provision of law is broad,it is not unlimited.as in california housing,the phrase n otwithstanding any other provision of law in vehicle code section,subdivision g qualifies only the operative language of the statute.vehicle code section,subdivision g permits the dmv to electronically receive and retrieve documents that are maintained in government forensic lab computerized databases and addresses the foundational problem presented by using copies of reports that are stored electronically in such databases.any other provision of law relating to those matters is subordinated to vehicle code section,subdivision g in an administrative per se hearing before the dmv.the statute does not address the public employee records exception or any other exception to the hearsay rule,or the admissibility of evidence generally in administrative proceedings.we therefore reject the dmv contention that vehicle code section,subdivision g prevails over evidence code section,other provisions of the evidence code,and government code section,subdivision d.
the court rejected a similar dmv argument in carlton department of motor vehicles d.carlton.in carlton,the dmv suspended a licensee license,placed him on probation,and stayed the suspension,on the condition the licensee remain free from accident responsibility.id.at.after the licensee was involved in a second accident,the dmv revoked probation and suspended his license.the only evidence supporting its decision was a computerized transcript of a police report that indicated that,in the police officer opinion,the licensee was most responsible for the accident.id.at.the hearing officer admitted the evidence over the licensee hearsay objection.the trial court concluded that the computerized transcript of the police report was insufficient to support the dmv finding and granted the licensee petition for writ of mandate.the appellate court agreed and affirmed the trial court judgment.ibid.
in carlton,the dmv relied on the following language from vehicle code section,which governs the dmv filing and recording of traffic accident reports and permits electronic recording and storage of such reports notwithstanding any other provision of law,the recorded facts from any electronic recording and storage device maintained by the department shall constitute evidence of the facts in any administrative actions instituted by the department.the dmv argued that vehicle code section authorized the use of peace officer reports to create a prima facie showing of responsibility for an accident for purposes of revoking probation.carlton,supra,d at.the court disagreed,explaining that section merely provides accident reports can be maintained and recorded in computerized form and the facts in such form shall constitute evidence in administrative actions.nowhere in the statute is there any suggestion it is intended to supersede the emphatic legislative mandate against sole reliance on hearsay evidence in government code section,subdivision d.ibid.the court explained that t he mere admissibility of evidence at an administrative hearing does not confer the status of sufficiency to support a finding absent other competent evidence and that the most likely purpose of this provision in vehicle code section was to avoid objections to the computerized record of the report under the best evidence rule.id.at.thus,the holding in carlton supports our analysis of vehicle code section,subdivision g in this case.
if computer printouts are offered for the truth of the matter asserted,they must qualify under some hearsay exception.aguimatang california state lottery d.california cases have held computer printouts admissible when they fit within a hearsay exception as business records people lugashi d.or official records people martinez cal th,d.people hawkins th,d.
we conclude that while vehicle code section,subdivision g provides that the dmv may receive or retrieve evidence of a licensee blood alcohol test results directly from a government forensic lab database and that such evidence is the best available evidence of the test results,the statute does not preclude the opponent of the evidence from challenging the document or other record on other exclusionary grounds,including hearsay.
nothing in the language of vehicle code section,subdivision g suggests that it was intended to operate as an exception to the hearsay rule.where the legislature has intended that a statute operate as an exception to the hearsay rule,it has expressly told us so.see.the hearsay rule is a rule of exclusion,but its exceptions are not rules of admission.all of the sections of the evidence code specifying hearsay exceptions provide that the particular statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule.in other words,a statement within a hearsay exception satisfies the hearsay rule,but it may be objectionable under other exclusionary rules,such as the opinion rule,the secondary evidence rule,or a claim of privilege.witkin,cal.evidence ed.hearsay.
since we are able to resolve the issue presented based on the plain language of the statute,we need not address the dmv arguments based on the legislative history of vehicle code section,subdivision g.however,even if it were necessary to look beyond the plain language of the statute and consider the legislative history,we would reach the same conclusion.upon enacting vehicle code section,subdivision g in,the legislature stated this bill would provide that any document containing data prepared and maintained in the governmental forensic laboratory computerized data base system that is electronically transmitted or retrieved through public or private computer networks to or by the department is the best available evidence of the chemical test results in all administrative proceedings conducted by the department.the bill provide s that,in order to be admissible as evidence in an administrative proceeding,a document described in the paragraph shall bear a certification by the employee who retrieved the document stats.this act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace,health,or safety within the meaning of article iv of the constitution and shall go into immediate effect.the facts constituting the necessity are the department of justice is implementing a system that electronically transmits forensic blood alcohol laboratory test results to local law enforcement and state agencies.the department of motor vehicles may be precluded under current law from using electronic reports when conducting administrative hearings for violations.in order to avoid the possibility that the department of motor vehicles may not be able to apply appropriate sanctions to the driving privileges of all persons who exceed the legal limits while operating motor vehicles at the earliest possible time,it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.id.at.nothing in this language suggests that vehicle code section,subdivision g was intended to prevail over evidence code section.
the dmv quotes language from the third reading analysis of the legislation at issue,which states laboratory reports are admitted into evidence in dmv administrative per se hearings pursuant to the evidence code.evidence is generally required to be in writing,made at or near the time of the act,and the sources s of the information and method and time of preparation must be trustworthy.because the use of digital signatures used in the new doj system is not mentioned,there is a potential to create authentication and foundation problems in dmv hearings.this proposal would provide authorization to accept and use electronic or facsimile chemical test results in all administrative proceedings conducted by the department.without this urgency measure,doj would have to continue to support a secondary system for dmv use based on lab results in printed form.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended april,italics added.that the analysis mentioned the requirements of evidence code section in the italicized language does not support the conclusion that the proposed legislation was intended to abrogate the requirements of evidence code section,as the dmv contends.the legislative history the dmv cites supports the conclusion that the legislature was concerned about the foundational problems presented by the electronic retrieval of testing results from the doj new computers.
for these reasons,we reject the dmv contention that by adopting vehicle code section,subdivision g the legislature intended to clear away any obstacles presented by the application of evidence code section foundational requirements to the evidence of blood alcohol test results from government forensic laboratories.
iii.admissibility of evidence of pas test results 
the dmv contends the trial court erred when it excluded and refused to consider the pas test results.
procedural background 
in the administrative per se hearing,molenda counsel objected to the admission of any evidence that referred to the results of the pas testing on the grounds that there was no foundation to support the accuracy of the readings and under the authority of coniglio,supra,th,d the dmv hearing officer sustained both objections and stated that he would not consider the pas test results for numerical proof of molenda blood alcohol level.however,he did consider the pas test results to the extent that they confirmed the presence of alcohol and supported the officer preliminary conclusion that molenda was intoxicated 
in opposition to molenda petition for writ of mandate,the dmv argued that the pas test results were admissible to establish molenda blood alcohol content.it argued that the pas test results met the foundational requirements of title and that the trial court was not bound by the hearing officer mistaken ruling excluding the pas test results.in response,molenda renewed her objections to the pas evidence.
at the hearing on the writ petition,the trial court ruled that vehicle code section and the foundational facts necessary before the pas test could be considered were never established and refused to consider the evidence of the pas test results.
general rules regarding the admissibility of the pas test results 
as noted previously,we review the trial court rulings regarding the admissibility of evidence,including the pas test results,under the deferential abuse of discretion standard.city of ripon sweetin,supra,th at,d williams,supra,cal th at,d,admissibility of pas test results.
the pas breath test results were admissible upon a showing of either compliance with the regulations set forth in title or the foundational elements described in people adams d.adams,which include properly functioning equipment,a properly administered test,and a qualified operator.williams,supra,cal th at,d.title compliance and the foundational requirements from adams are distinct and independent means to support the admission of blood alcohol test results.id.at,d.for example,in williams,the court concluded that although the evidence of the pas testing performed in that case did not meet the title foundational requirements,the test results were reliable and admissible under the adams foundational requirements.id.at,d.
title contains various regulations relating to the analysis of blood,breath,or urine samples to determine the alcohol content of the samples.title,with regard to breath samples,the title regulations address the collection and handling of the samples title,and set forth standards governing the instruments and accessories that may be used to obtain and test the samples.title,subd.a,subd.a.the regulations also set forth procedures for administering breath tests,for determining the accuracy of the testing devices,for training persons who operate the devices,for record keeping related to the accuracy testing,and for expressing analytical results.title.
in this case,there was evidence that officer barry complied with title standards for administering the test on the other hand,there was no evidence regarding the type of device used to conduct the pas testing,other than a serial number for the device.there was no information regarding the manufacturer,make,or model of the device.the record is also silent regarding the extent of officer barry training on the pas device and the extent of any testing done to confirm the accuracy of the device.thus,the evidence here did not meet the foundational requirements of title.
for these same reasons,the evidence does not meet the foundational requirements described in adams,to wit properly functioning equipment,a properly administered test,and a qualified operator.williams,supra,cal th at,d.again,while there was evidence regarding the administration of the test,there was no evidence regarding the type of device used,officer barry qualifications to operate the pas device,or whether the device was functioning properly.
applicability of evidence code section presumption 
dmv contends that since it relied on the foundational requirements of title,it enjoyed the benefit of the official duty presumption in evidence code section,which creates a rebuttable presumption that test results recorded on official forms were obtained by following the guidelines of title.the dmv contends that the evidence in combination with the presumption establishes the necessary foundation for admission of the pas test results.in other words,the dmv contends the presumption of an official duty regularly performed supplied the missing foundational elements.
we begin with a brief overview of the burdens of proof in a dmv administrative hearing.in such hearings,the dmv bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence certain facts,including that the driver was operating a vehicle with a level of percent or higher,subd.b c i,subd.c lake,supra,cal th at,d,petricka department of motor vehicles th,d.the dmv may satisfy its burden using the presumption of section of the evidence code.petricka,supra,at,d.procedurally,it is a fairly simple matter for the dmv to introduce the necessary foundational evidence.evidence code section creates a rebuttable presumption that test results recorded on official forms were obtained by following the regulations and guidelines of title.citations.the recorded test results are presumptively valid and the dmv is not required to present additional foundational evidence.shannon gourley th,d.with this presumption,an officer sworn statement that the device recorded a certain level is sufficient to establish the foundation,even without testimony at the hearing establishing the reliability of the test.davenport department of motor vehicles th,d davenport.
once the dmv establishes its prima facie case by presenting documents contemplated in the statutory scheme,the driver must produce affirmative evidence of the nonexistence of the presumed facts sufficient to shift the burden of proof back to the dmv.citations.the licensee must show,through of the officer or by the introduction of affirmative evidence,that official standards were in any respect not observed citation.once such showing has been made,the burden shifts to the dmv to prove that the test was reliable despite the violation.manriquez gourley th,d.
citing coniglio,supra,th at pages and,d,molenda argues that the dmv was not entitled to rely on the presumption in evidence code section because there was no evidence that the device used in this case was a title instrument.molenda reliance on coniglio is misplaced.in coniglio,this court held that the dmv was not entitled to rely on the evidence code section presumption because the title regulations did not apply to the pas test.we reasoned that since there were no governing statutes or regulations regulating the testing and reliability of the pas test,the court could not presume that the pas test results were reliable and held that the dmv had the burden to show the pas test met the foundation requirements of adams.id.at,d.
after we decided coniglio,the california supreme court held that title regulations apply to pas tests that determine the concentration of alcohol in the blood but not those that determine only its presence.williams,supra,cal th at,fn,d.since the pas test in this case determined both the presence of alcohol and the concentration of alcohol,under williams,title applies to the pas test at issue here.thus,under the authority set forth above,the dmv may be able to rel
