appellant jeffrey swaters,a pilot formerly employed by spirit airlines,had his pilot and medical certificates revoked by the federal aviation administration faa after failing a random drug test.the faa decision was upheld by an administrative law judge alj,whose ruling was in turn affirmed by the national transportation safety board ntsb or the board.swaters petitions for review of the ntsb decision in this court.after thorough review,we affirm the ntsb decision and deny swaters petition.
factual background 
the essential facts in the case are these.swaters had been employed as a pilot by spirit airlines since.on the evening of february,he arrived in san juan,puerto rico during the course of a trip.he spent the evening alone and met the rest of his first officer and three flight following morning,february,at on that day,swaters and his first officer made flights from san juan to orlando,florida from orlando to fort lauderdale,florida from fort lauderdale to kingston,jamaica and from kingston back to fort lauderdale.the last flight landed in fort lauderdale at 
swaters was met at the gate by susan wagner,spirit airlines manager for pilot base operations in fort lauderdale,who told swaters that he had been randomly selected to take a drug test that afternoon.swaters apparently spent some time chatting amiably with wagner and with paul olechowski,spirit airlines chief pilot.it was before swaters was given the necessary paperwork to take to the testing facility.he was told to report to a collection site called global mro.
at around,swaters phoned olechowski to inform him that he had encountered car trouble and had been unable to reach the testing facility.swaters then spoke with toni benson,spirit airlines drug and alcohol program manager.swaters told benson that he was at a gas station and that his car had broken down.because global mro closed at,benson instructed swaters to go to another facility,concentra,which was open until midnight.she asked swaters to get to the facility as soon as possible,and suggested that he take a cab.swaters expressed unease at the idea of leaving his car in an unfamiliar part of town,and instead decided to replace and recharge his car battery.
swaters subsequently arrived at concentra between and his sample was collected at.while at the facility,he signed and dated the following statement on the federal custody and control form ccf or custody form used to keep track of his specimen i certify that i provided my urine specimen to the collector that i have not adulterated it in any manner each specimen bottle used was sealed with a seal in my presence and that the information provided on this form and on the label affixed to each specimen bottle is correct.he also initialed the sealed specimen bottles.
the sample was then sent to quest diagnostics,a laboratory approved by the department of health and human services dhhs to perform drug tests.on march,quest reported to spirit airlines that swaters sample contained metabolites associated with three prohibited controlled substances benzoylecgonine a metabolite of cocaine morphine and or,a metabolite associated specifically with heroin.the concentration of each substance was detected at levels far above the points allowed under federal regulations 
dale plapp,one of spirit medical review officers mros,verified the results and reported them to swaters.swaters denied taking the drugs,and indeed denied having taken drugs at any time during his career as a pilot.however,he offered no explanation as to how the drugs could have shown up in his sample.swaters requested that a split sample of his urine specimen be submitted for testing at another facility.accordingly,the specimen was sent by quest to diagnostic sciences,dsi,another testing facility.dsi reported the same results as those reported by quest.the results were again confirmed by a medical review officer.
based on the finding of prohibited drugs in his system,swaters was found to be in violation of federal aviation regulations a and b on august,the faa issued an emergency order revoking swaters airline transport pilot and first class airman medical certifications 
ii.procedural history 
proceedings before the alj 
swaters appealed the faa emergency order to the ntsb.pursuant to the ntsb rules of practice,the faa filed the order of revocation as the complaint in the case,and a hearing was held before an ntsb administrative law judge on march and.since the evidence presented at the hearing is central to our resolution of this dispute,we pause here to recount important portions of various witnesses testimony.
one key witness was arthur stachurski,the medical technologist at concentra who collected swaters urine sample on february.stachurski said that he had no specific recollection of having taken swaters urine specimen.however,he explained that he follows a standard set of procedures in collecting each sample.he described the procedures in this way 
what i do is,i fill up two vials,one milliliters and one milliliters,and then i put the labels that are on the ccf on the vials,seal the bottles in front of the patient,and i have him initial them off,first and last initial.he does so.and then i put the specimen bottles in the bag in front of the employee,and i ask him to sign the ccf form stating that he has given me the urine,signed off on it,initialed them in his presence,and then i seal the bag in his presence as well.
at.the custody form is placed in the bag with the specimen bottles,and the bag is sent to a laboratory,such as quest or dsi,for analysis.
swaters also testified at the hearing.he claimed that he had not been allowed to witness certain of the steps described by stachurski in the handling of his sample.in particular,he claimed that after his urine sample was poured into the two specimen bottles,stachurski told him to dispose of the excess urine.according to swaters,this allowed stachurski to seal the bottles when swaters was not present.swaters also testified that he left the collection site after stachurski told him he was good to go,and that,as a result,swaters never saw stachurski place the specimen bottles in the plastic bag and seal it.
finally,two expert witnesses testified at the hearing the faa called robert white,dsi director of clinical chemistry,and swaters presented vina spiehler,a pharmacologist certified in forensic toxicology.each expert testified about the properties of the drugs in question the extent to which the effects of the drugs might be observable in the behavior of a person under their influence and about how long after ingestion the metabolites associated with the various drugs could be detected in urine.
white was asked whether it would be unusual for no physical symptoms to appear in a person who had taken these drugs within ten to twelve hours of having ingested them.he responded 
it depends on who doing the observing,whether you got a trained observer or not,first of all.second of all,it depends on how much they took and it the same thing after time and time again,you can go as low as a few molecules up to an overdose where somebody ca even move.it depends on how much they took.
as for how long the metabolites associated with the various drugs remain present in urine,white testified that metabolites stay in the system between two and ten hours.it ought to be around for a couple of hours,may be out,depending on an individual metabolism and their state of hydration,may be out to eight,ten hours.at.he was asked whether,given the level of found in the sample at issue here,swaters ingested the heroin within eight to ten hours of the test.white responded i think so.and yes,this is a pretty substantial level in this case,so i would say well within that area.at.
spiehler testimony was largely consistent with white.when asked about the observable symptoms associated with the different drugs,spiehler said she could really extrapolate behavior or symptoms from urine levels.at.she said that cocaine was a stimulant and that heroin had a sedating effect.at.while she described the behavior of people under the influence of each drug individually,she stated that she had never personally observed a person on both drugs simultaneously.she explained that,taken together,the effects of the drugs 
might be somewhat different.i not actually seen a person go through conversion from the effects of one drug to the other,but i reviewed police reports of people who took both of them together.and initially,they show the cocaine stimulation and then after a few minutes,maybe or minutes they switch over and go on the nod and begin to show the effects of the heroin.
spiehler also explained that the effects of the drugs depend on the person experience with the drug.if they been using it chronically and have built up a tolerance,they show less effect and the effect will go away sooner so it depends not only on how much they take,but what their own personal tolerance is to the drug.at.finally,she said that whether an observer would notice anything would d epend on the level of closeness and observation of that person.at.
spiehler was also asked how long the various drugs in question remain present in urine.she testified that based on the level of metabolites in swaters sample,i think it would have to have been more than two hours before the urine was donated,but less than hours.at.she explained the longest window of detection in urine i seen in the literature is hours,but it does take some time for it to get into the urine,especially to get into the urine in peak levels,and i think that about two hours from my review of the literature.at.furthermore,she opined that if the heroin had been ingested more than hours prior to the urine collection,i t unlikely that would have been detected at all in the urine at a nanograms per mil l evel.at.when asked whether would have shown up in the urine if it had been taken fewer than two hours before,she said it unlikely that it would be that high.it might be greater than,but i do think it would be as high as the,or the higher numbers that were found by the second laboratory if it had been that soon.at.
at the conclusion of the proceedings on march,the alj announced his ruling orally upholding the faa revocation of swaters certificates.in addressing the procedures used in collecting swaters specimen,the alj said that he found stachurski to be credible and found swaters testimony not to be credible.specifically,the law judge said 
i find that arthur stachurski,the urine collector,is a completely credible witness with no reason to testify falsely.he did not remember the respondent specifically,but testified to his usual procedures in collecting urine for dot department of transportation random drug tests.he testified credibly that he always pours the urine from the collection cup into the two specimen bottles in the presence of the donor,has the donor sign the tamper evident seals,and places them on the specimen bottles in the donor presence.
i do not find the respondent to be a credible witness in this regard.i observed his testimony and,while he was polite,i do not consider his demeanor to be convincing or forthcoming.
adm r swaters,ntsb order no,at,wl,at,order 
the alj also addressed swaters claim that he could not have taken the prohibited drugs after the start of his shift at on february.the judge reasoned that,since no one who worked with swaters during the time period in question saw anything unusual about his behavior,and since swaters had hardly ever been alone while on duty,swaters had probably not taken the drugs during working hours.the alj,however,made no finding of fact as to when swaters had taken the drugs.the judge opined only that swaters could have taken the drugs during the previous evening,when swaters admitted to having been alone.as the alj stated 
i agree that it appears indeed unlikely that swaters could have ingested prohibited drugs in the quantities found in urine after he reported for work at on february.however,that does not preclude that he could have ingested the drugs during the evening of february,when he was,by his own account,alone.
although the experts had testified that would not likely be present in a person urine after twelve hours,the alj explained t he amount of time that is detectable in urine is an estimate,and from the testimony of white and spiehler,could be influenced by the tolerance of the drug in the user,and by the quantity ingested.id.accordingly,on march,the administrative law judge upheld the faa revocation of swaters certificates.
proceedings before the full board 
swaters next appealed the alj decision to the full national transportation safety board,advancing essentially the same arguments as those he presented before the alj.on august,the ntsb entered a final order stating that it agree d with the law judge analysis and discern ed no basis to overturn his decision.order at 
first,the board agreed with the alj determination that the faa had made a prima facie showing that swaters urine had tested positive for prohibited drugs.indeed,the board found more than enough evidence to establish the administrator prima facie case.id.at.like the alj,the board concluded that swaters had demonstrate d no legitimate issue with the chain of custody of his urine specimen,or any other grounds for concluding that the quest diagnostics and dsi laboratory findings were not based on tests of the urine specimen respondent provided after his duty day on february.id.at.the board emphasized that the law judge made a clear,adverse credibility finding against respondent claim as to any errors in the collection procedure or chain of custody of the specimen sample.id.at.the board further explained that credibility determinations are generally within the exclusive province of the law judge,and that it saw no reason to overturn the alj assessment.id.
the board also rejected swaters objection to the alj finding that swaters could have ingested the drugs on the evening before the drug test.citing portions of white and spiehler testimony,the board found that there was a basis in the record for the law judge conclusions regarding metabolism.id.this was so,the board concluded,even if swaters point that there is no link between tolerance and metabolism may have been well taken.id.
in light of these determinations,the board was unpersuaded by swaters affirmative defense.specifically,the board explained that r espondent uncredited testimony and the testimony of his witnesses as to their observations regarding the absence of any visible signs of drug intoxication,along with respondent arguments regarding that evidence,are insufficient to carry his burden to rebut the faa prima facie case.id.at emphasis omitted.accordingly,the board affirmed the faa revocation order and denied swaters appeal.
swaters filed the instant petition for review in this court.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to review final orders issued by the national transportation safety board.a the appropriate court of appeals of the united states or the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit may review a final order of the national transportation safety board under this chapter.see also b giving the courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to affirm,amend,modify,or set aside any part of the order and to order the board to conduct further proceedings.our review of board decisions,however,is narrow and deferential we may disturb a decision by the ntsb only if it is arbitrary and capricious.coghlan transp.safety,cir we uphold a decision by the ntsb unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,or the challenged decision is contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity.quotation marks omitted.in other words,when reviewing an agency decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard,we must defer to the wisdom of the agency provided their decision is reasoned and rational.mchenry bond,cir.
findings of fact by the board,if supported by substantial evidence,are conclusive.b see also coghlan,at.substantial evidence,we have explained,is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.mchenry,at citation and quotation marks omitted.it is something more than a scintilla of evidence,but something less than the weight of the evidence the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency findings from being supported by substantial evidence.id.citation and quotation marks omitted.
swaters advances two interrelated contentions on appeal first,he argues that the ntsb erred in concluding that the faa made a prima facie showing that his urine sample tested positive for prohibited substances and second,he claims that the ntsb erred in concluding that he failed to establish his affirmative,that the urine specimen could not have belonged to him.we do not believe that it was arbitrary and capricious for the board to have reached either of these conclusions.
b.the faa prima facie case 
swaters first suggests that the board erred in concluding that the faa succeeded in making a prima facie showing that his urine sample tested positive for prohibited drugs.there is no dispute that the sample in question contained prohibited drugs.rather,swaters claim is that the sample was not his.in particular,he contends that the collection and handling of his sample was somehow flawed.on this record,however,we can find nothing arbitrary and capricious in the board determination that the faa had established a prima facie case.
first,arthur stachurski testimony clearly supports the board determination that proper safeguards and procedures were followed during the collection of swaters sample.as we noted,stachurski recounted the steps he regularly takes in order to ensure the integrity of the samples he collects,and the record convincingly shows that these steps were observed in collecting swaters sample.moreover,swaters himself initialed the sealed bottles and signed a certification expressly stating that the samples were sealed in his presence.swaters testified unequivocally that he understood that in initialing the seals,he was certif ying that it my urine and that it has been sealed.at.brunelli,quest diagnostic laboratory director,also testified that when quest received the specimen bottles from concentra,they showed no sign of any tampering.we are to see how swaters sample could have become corrupted while in concentra or stachurski custody.
likewise,there is substantial evidence to show that the integrity of swaters sample was maintained after it was sent to quest for analysis brunelli gave a detailed explanation of the procedures quest uses to track samples after they are received the sealed bag is opened and the bottles containing the samples are checked for signs of tampering the specimen identification numbers on the seals are checked against the identification numbers on the custody form included with the samples the sample is then assigned an internal tracking number,which is affixed to the custody form and to the specimen bottles that number is then used to track the handling of the sample throughout the rest of the testing process.at the hearing,brunelli reviewed the documents used to track swaters sample and verified that each of these steps was followed.at.he also testified that he observed nothing inappropriate or out of the ordinary in the testing of the sample,and that he had no doubt as to the accuracy of the testing of the sample.at.
in addition to evidence demonstrating the soundness of the chain of custody,the alj determination regarding swaters lack of credibility represents a second,independent source of support for the board conclusion.importantly,the alj did not simply believe stachurski testimony over swaters rather,the judge made an explicit finding that swaters was not a credible witness.that determination itself can be regarded as substantive evidence in favor of the alj ultimate conclusion.united states woodard,cir a defendant disbelieved by the be considered substantive evidence of guilt.united states brown,cir same.
in short,on this record,we can not say that it was arbitrary and capricious for the board to conclude that the faa made a prima facie showing that swaters urine sample had tested positive for prohibited substances.
swaters affirmative defense 
once the faa has made out a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the respondent to advance an affirmative defense.see,adm r gibbs,ntsb order no,wl,at june,see also miranda transp.safety,cir once the faa has established a prima facie case the burden shifts to the pilot to prove the validity of any affirmative defense he may have.quotation marks removed.the defense must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.adm r tsegaye,ntsb order no,wl,at june,we agree with the administrator that respondent must do more than present a prima facie case for an affirmative defense.respondent must prove his affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence.
swaters first purports to identify irregularities in the collection and subsequent handling of his sample.specifically,he notes that when stachurski was interviewed,he could not recall any specific details concerning the collection of swaters sample.as a result,swaters complains,t he only evidence which caused the revocation of his certificates was the chain of custody,which is not based on actual knowledge,but usual and customary practice.gray br.at.but there is nothing remarkable about stachurski inability to recall the particulars associated with each individual donor weeks or months after the fact.indeed,if anything,the fact that stachurski had no special recollection regarding the taking of swaters sample suggests that the sample was collected without incident.in any event,swaters must do more than point to stachurski inability to recall specifically that nothing untoward occurred in the collection of his sample.rather,it is incumbent upon swaters to affirmatively cite evidence suggesting that something went awry.this he has failed to do.
to be sure,swaters claims that he was unable to witness the sealing of the bottles containing his sample and the sealing of the plastic bag in which the bottles were ultimately sent to quest.once again,however,the alj specifically found that swaters testimony lacked credibility on this point,order at,and the ntsb found no reason to question the alj finding.as the board explained 
in this regard,the law judge made a clear,adverse credibility finding against respondent claim as to any errors in the collection procedure or chain of custody of the specimen sample and credited the testimony of the administrator witnesses.board precedent is clear that credibility determinations are generally within the exclusive province of the law judge and will not be disturbed in the absence of arbitrariness,capriciousness,or some other compelling reason.respondent demonstrates no compelling reason,nor do we discern one,to overturn the law judge negative assessment of respondent testimony.
substantial evidence supports the alj adverse assessment of swaters credibility and the board acceptance of that assessment.among other things,the alj determination is supported by the fact that,although swaters claims not to have witnessed the sealing of the specimen bottles,he initialed the sealed bottles and signed the certification on the chain of custody form specifically stating that he had witnessed the sealing.because it is supported by substantial evidence,the alj determination regarding swaters lack of credibility is conclusive.we also reiterate that the alj credibility determination does not simply fail to support swaters case it constitutes positive evidence against swaters and in support of the faa case.woodard,at brown,at.
furthermore,even assuming that the bag was not sealed in swaters presence,the board still could reasonably have concluded that the sample belonged to swaters.as we have noted,under the protocol followed by stachurksi,by the time that samples are enclosed and sealed in the plastic bag,the bottles containing the samples have themselves already been signed and sealed.hence,so long as the seal on the bottles showed no signs of brunelli testified unequivocally that they did integrity of the sample could not have been compromised.faa guidelines address precisely this issue and make clear that failure to seal th
