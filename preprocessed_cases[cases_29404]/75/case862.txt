this case involves the federal aviation administration faa decision to suspend petitioner eligibility for discretionary federal grants,based on claimed violations of federal statutes and existing grant provisions.petitioner arapahoe county public airport authority authority and intervenor city of greenwood village city urge us to set aside the decision for various reasons,not the least of which is the decision is incompatible with an earlier opinion issued by the colorado supreme court.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and d.for the reasons set forth below,we deny the petition for review and affirm the faa order.
the authority owns and operates centennial airport,which is located just south of denver,colorado.operations at the airport historically have consisted of unscheduled commercial passenger and cargo service.in the course of operating the airport,the authority has accepted millions of dollars in discretionary grants from the faa.as part of the grant process,the authority made assurances the airport would be available for public use on reasonable terms and without unjust discrimination,to any person,firm,or corporation to conduct or to engage in any aeronautical activity for furnishing services to the public at the airport.however,within the same grant assurance,the faa also recognized the authority may prohibit or limit any given type,kind or class of aeronautical use if such action is necessary for the safe operation of the airport or necessary to serve the civil aviation needs of the public.
over the course of several years,centennial express airlines centennial express divulged an interest in providing scheduled passenger service at centennial airport,culminating in an official application in may.centennial express submitted its application despite the authority actions one month earlier placing a moratorium on the consideration of applications for scheduled passenger service.the moratorium was designed to provide the authority time to determine whether it could legally prohibit scheduled service.while the authority asked for guidance from the faa on the question,it ultimately decided to completely ban all scheduled air carrier service without waiting to hear from the faa in contravention of the authority ban,centennial express initiated scheduled passenger service between centennial airport and dalhart,texas on december.the authority immediately sought and obtained a temporary injunction in state district court to prevent centennial express from offering scheduled passenger service.
the state district court eventually granted the authority a permanent injunction.centennial express successfully appealed the injunction to the colorado court of appeals,but a plurality of the colorado supreme court reversed the state court of appeals and reinstated the permanent injunction.see arapahoe county pub.airport auth.centennial express airlines,en banc.the colorado supreme court issued its opinion despite concurrent complaints on file with the faa,and in so doing decided federal law did not preempt the authority ban on scheduled passenger service and the ban did not violate the terms of the grant assurances.see id.at.the faa was not a party to this state litigation.
as alluded to in the previous paragraph,the agency process under review here got its start at the same time as the state litigation,and involves the same basic facts.thomas kehmeier,a centennial express stockholder,filed the first complaint with the faa in august,claiming the authority ban violated federal law and the grant assurances.centennial express filed its own complaint in january.as the colorado supreme court noted,the faa had yet to rule on either complaint in when the court issued its opinion.arapahoe county pub.airport,at.these initial complaints were filed pursuant to part.new rules,found at part,and entitled rules of practice for airport enforcement proceedings,went into effect december.centennial express filed a second complaint under the new part rules on february,just two months prior to the colorado supreme court decision.centennial express filed the second complaint even though the company had voluntarily surrendered its faa operating certificate in january.
after consolidating the three complaints,and despite the colorado supreme court decision to the contrary,faa director of the office of airport safety and standards issued an initial determination on august,concluding the ban violated the grant assurances and federal law.the authority requested a hearing which was held over two days in november,and resulted in an affirmance of the director initial decision.the authority and the city subsequently appealed the hearing officer decision to the faa associate administrator for airports,who issued the faa final agency decision and order affirming the previous decisions.the authority then filed the current petition for review,and the city filed a notice of intervention pursuant to circuit rule a 
standard of review 
our review of the faa final decision and order suspending the authority eligibility for discretionary federal grants is governed by the administrative procedure act,within this context,we review matters of law de novo.see wyoming farm bureau fed babbitt,cir.however,the faa findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.see id c.the standard does not allow us to displace the faa choice between two fairly conflicting views,even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.babbitt,at quotation marks and citation omitted see also trimmer united states dep t of labor,cir same.
the authority contends the final faa decision and order should be set aside for the following three errors of law the colorado supreme court opinion reinstating the permanent injunction against centennial express is final,preclusive and dispositive the authority and not the faa determines whether scheduled passenger service will be prohibited as necessary for the safe operation of the airport and to serve the public civil aviation needs and any allowable scheduled passenger service must be limited to aircraft designed for nine or fewer passenger seats we address each alleged error in turn.
the colorado supreme court decision 
the authority argues,pursuant to the full faith and credit act,that arapahoe county public airport authority centennial express airlines,is final,preclusive and dispositive of the issues resolved in the faa final order.the full faith and credit act provides that the judicial proceedings of any court of any such state shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the united states as they have by law or usage in the courts of such state from which they are taken.
the faa asserts is not technically implicated here because it is an agency rather than a court,see american airlines,dep t of,cir,cert.denied,d however,b ecause most agency decisions may be reviewed in federal courts,and those courts must follow section,the faa therefore assume s that a common law rule of preclusion,like that embodied in section,governs federal agency proceedings.we agree with the faa and the fifth circuit that the preclusive effect,if any,of the colorado supreme court decision derives from the common law doctrines of res judicata and issue preclusion collateral estoppel,not.see id.at.we further agree these common law doctrines extending full faith and credit to state court determinations are trumped by the supremacy clause if the effect of the state court judgment or decree is to restrain the exercise of the united states sovereign power by imposing requirements that are contrary to important and established federal policy.see id.at see also midgett united states.balancing,de novo the common law justification for full faith and credit with the competing policy supporting the supremacy clause,we conclude the faa is not required to give preclusive effect to the colorado supreme court decision in arapahoe county public airport authority centennial express airlines.
we begin our analysis on the full faith and credit side of the equation.a close look at the colorado supreme court decision reveals the primary issue before that court was the propriety of a permanent injunction enjoining centennial express from conducting scheduled air carrier service in and out of centennial airport.as such,the colorado supreme court focused from the outset on centennial express conduct in contravention of state regulations.arapahoe county pub.airport,at,stating that to defer to federal agency jurisdiction would be to allow future airport users to unilaterally conduct and continue operations in violation of airport rules so long as they implicate federal jurisdiction in some way.to the extent the colorado supreme court addressed federal preemption issues and the authority obligations under the federal grant assurances,it did so in the narrow context of rejecting centennial express defenses.id.at.further examination reveals that the court conclusion the authority did not violate the terms of the federal grant assurances lacks the depth and breadth of analysis given to those same issues by the director of the faa office of airport safety and standards,the hearing officer,and ultimately,the final agency decision and order issued by the associate administrator for airports.id.at.
the credit to be given to the state court opinion is further influenced by the fact the colorado supreme court was seriously divided in this case,as evidenced by its plurality of seven justices participated in the majority,one justice concurred,two justices dissented,and one justice abstained.id.at.of particular note here,justice scott,while concurring in the result,considered it inappropriate to address preemption in light of the fact the faa had not yet acted under its authority.id.at scott,concurring.he justified the colorado supreme court holding based on its inherent authority to issue an injunction to preserve the status quo pending resolution of the dispute in an appropriate forum.id.at.given justice scott position,and the additional fact the two dissenting justices concluded that in keeping with the doctrine of primary jurisdiction the faa is the appropriate forum to determine issues pertaining to preemption and grant compliance under federal statute,id.at bender,and martinez,dissenting,only half the participating court three of six ostensibly precluded the faa from issuing a contrary ruling.
last,but certainly not least,the faa was not a party to,nor in privity with a party to,the state court proceedings.the faa interest in fulfilling its statutory responsibility to ensure airport compliance with federal aviation laws and grant assurances,and to protect the public interest,is obviously independent of the interests of any particular air carrier,centennial.mere knowledge of the state court proceedings did not oblige the faa to participate in those proceedings.see martin wilks,d.without the faa as a party,the colorado supreme court decision does not satisfy a fundamental requirement of issue preclusion under federal or colorado law.see,baker general motors,d in no event can issue preclusion be invoked against one who did not participate in the prior adjudication.meredith beech aircraft,cir collateral estoppel fails here simply because plaintiff was not a party to the first suit simpson,en banc party against whom estoppel is asserted must have been a party to or in privity with a party in the prior proceeding.this,together with the other circumstances discussed above,weighs heavily against extending full faith and credit to arapahoe county public airport authority centennial express airlines see,acacia villa united states,acknowledging the doctrine of issue preclusion is based on a court exercise of its equitable powers,and is not mandated in the constitution or by statute united states kaytso,cir stating e ven when the elements of collateral estoppel are present,the decision whether to apply the doctrine is within the court discretion western group nurseries,pomeranz,ruling collateral estoppel is an equitable doctrine applied at the court discretion.
turning to supremacy principles,we reiterate that the issue before the faa was whether the authority complied with the conditions imposed on it by federal law and agreement with a federal administrative agency,in return for the authority receipt of federal funds.this federal scheme regulating airport grant compliance is designed in part to insure the maintenance of conditions essential to an efficient national air transport system,including access to airports on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis.city county of san francisco faa,cir,cert.denied,d.on this point,we must agree with the fifth circuit that in the arena of aviation regulation federal concerns are preeminent,and the department of transportation,through the faa,is statutorily mandated to represent those concerns.american airlines,at.indeed,it is difficult to visualize a more comprehensive scheme of combined regulation,subsidization,and operational participation than that which congress has provided in the field of aviation.new england legal found.massachusetts port,cir discussing the faa primary role in administering and ensuring compliance with grant assurances quotation marks and citation omitted.this certainly tilts the balance toward the application of supremacy principles to protect against state courts trumping the federal interests and concerns embodied within the airport grant program.
as to the potential impact of the colorado supreme court ruling in arapahoe county public airport authority centennial express airlines on federal regulation of the airport grant program,we perceive a direct and significant conflict inasmuch as this and similar state court rulings,if deemed preclusive,would frustrate the faa ability to discharge its statutory duty to interpret and implement federal aviation statutes governing the enforcement of grant assurances.see.if given preclusive effect,state court rulings favoring local airport authorities in actions tangentially involving federal grant assurances would further lead to inconsistent enforcement of the federally mandated assurances,potentially jeopardizing the efficiency and equality of access to our nation air transportation system.for these reasons,we hold the strong policy of federal supremacy in the field of aviation prevails over full faith and credit principles in this case.the colorado supreme court decision in arapahoe county public airport authority centennial express airlines therefore has no bearing on the faa decision before us.
determinations based on safety and other civil aviation needs 
the authority argues that as the proprietor of centennial airport responsible for local and regional aviation planning,it,and not the faa,determines whether scheduled passenger service will be prohibited at the airport as necessary for the safe operation of the airport and to serve the civil aviation needs of the public.in support of this argument,the authority relies largely on the colorado supreme court conclusion the ban on scheduled passenger service was,indeed,necessary for the safe operation of centennial airport and to serve the public civil aviation needs.as discussed above,that state court conclusion has no bearing on our decision.
aside from its reliance on the state court decision,the authority attempts to retry its case here by convincing us it has good reasons for imposing the ban including,but not necessarily limited to,the design of and lack of facilities at centennial airport local and regional planning objectives and the recommendations incorporated in the national transportation safety board commuter airline safety study.our job,however,is not that of.we are called on here to review the decision of a federal administrative agency,and we will adhere to the appropriate standards governing such review,as previously articulated in this opinion.see c wyoming farm bureau fed n,at.
we begin by addressing what we consider the threshold legal the authority is preempted by federal statute from imposing such a ban.the airline deregulation act of expressly provides that a political subdivision of a state may not enact or enforce a law,regulation,or other provision having the force and effect of law related t
