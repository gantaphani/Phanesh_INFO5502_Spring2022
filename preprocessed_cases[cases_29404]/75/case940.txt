various airlines asked the department of transportation dot to declare unlawful certain of the methods used by the city of los angeles to calculate the rental rates they pay for terminal space at los angeles international airport lax.both the city and the airlines petition for review of the dot final decision,alaska airlines los angeles world airports,docket no,dot av.lexis,final decision.we grant each petition in part,deny each petition in part,and remand the matter to the dot for further proceedings.
background 
the airline petitioners airlines rent space in terminals and at lax.the city charges the airlines a base rent for their terminal space plus a share of the airport maintenance and operation m o costs.each airline base rent and m o charges are determined in part by multiplying a fee per square foot by the amount of terminal space the airline occupies an airline rent may change,therefore,if the city changes either the fee per square foot or the way in which it calculates the amount of terminal space occupied by the airline.when the leases of the airlines expired and negotiations over new lease terms reached an impasse,the city,seeking increased rental payments to offset increased security costs and to pay for planned airport improvements,adopted a new methodology,increasing both the fee per square foot and the amount of terminal space attributed to each airline.
the new methodology introduced three changes here relevant.first,the city increased m o charges for all airlines operating out of lax,including not only the airlines but also airlines with leases that had not expired.second,the city changed the formula for calculating the airlines rent.under the useable space formula previously employed,the city had multiplied the rental fee by the amount of space used exclusively by each airline.under the new rentable space formula,the city allocated to each of the airlines a share of the terminal common areas,such as corridors and stairwells,thus increasing its square footage and hence its base rent.finally,the city newly based the fee per square foot for the airlines upon the fair market value fmv of the space,whereas under the expired contracts,the rental fee had been based upon the historical cost of the space.
airlines in other terminals continue to pay rent based upon the historical cost of useable space the city is unable to impose its new methodology upon these carriers because they have leases,entered into in the and still in effect.the city nonetheless increased those airlines m o charges,but after the airlines filed suit,ultimately settled for a lesser increase.
the airlines complained to the dot that the new charges imposed by the city were unreasonable and,as compared with the charges paid by airlines using other terminals,unjustly discriminatory.the dot assigned the matter to an administrative law judge,who recommended the dot rule in favor of the airlines in most respects.recommended decision of administrative law judge richard goodwin,docket no.at dep t of transp.may.the dot rejected much of the alj recommendation and held the increase in m o charges was reasonable and the rentable space methodology unjustly discriminated against the airlines and the city may use fair market value rather than historical cost in setting terminal fees but the particular method it used was unreasonable as applied to the airlines because the airlines did not file a separate written complaint with the secretary of transportation within the time required by statute,the dot did not consider whether the fair market value method was unreasonable as applied to them.final decision,dot av.lexis,at.
both the airlines and the city petition for review of the final decision.the airlines argue the increase in m o fees is unjustly discriminatory it was unreasonable for the city to use fair market value but,if the city was permitted to use fair market value,then the dot should have decided whether its use was unreasonable as applied to the as well as the airlines and the dot erred by declining to consider whether lax has monopoly power.for its part,the city argues the dot should not have considered whether the m o fee increase was unreasonable the method it used to determine fair market value was reasonable and the rentable space methodology does not unjustly discriminate against the airlines because they are not entitled to the benefits for which the airlines with leases bargained.
ii.analysis 
this case arises under a,which provides that,upon written request,the dot shall issue a determination as to whether a fee imposed upon one or more air carriers is reasonable.to approve of a fee increase,the dot must have receive d written assurances that air carriers making similar use of the airport will be subject to substantially comparable charges.a.the dot findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence and we will affirm its decision unless it is arbitrary and capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.city of los angeles dep t of airports dot lax i,internal citations omitted.
we begin by considering the challenges to the m o fee increase.next,we turn to the dot assessment of the city use of fmv.we then determine whether the dot erred in holding the city rentable space methodology was discriminatory.finally,having analyzed the dot treatment of particular aspects of the city new methodology for calculating rent,we consider the airlines overarching objection to the dot analysis,namely that the agency should have considered whether lax has monopoly power in a relevant geographic market.
m o charges 
although the dot held the m o fee increase was reasonable,the city petitions for review on the ground that,because the increase was imposed pursuant to a written agreement with air carriers using the facilities of an airport,e,the dot did not have the authority to determine whether it was reasonable.the agreements to which the city refers are the airlines leases,which had expired,and pursuant to which the airlines were occupying terminal space as holdover tenants upon a basis.according to the city,the continuing application of the expired leases and the city reliance upon the clauses in each allowing for adjustment of the m o rent deprives the dot of authority to review the reasonableness of the increase.the dot,however,held the written agreement exception did not apply because a standard or boilerplate holdover agreement,creating a tenancy at will on a month to month basis,subsequent to lease expiration,does not constitute the type of written agreement that forecloses a proceeding.final decision,dot av.lexis,at.
the airlines challenge neither the dot authority nor the reasonableness of the increased m o charge but rather argue the result of the increase was unjustly discriminatory other airlines at lax,in violation of a.the city nonetheless disputes the dot decision that the written agreement exception did not apply because,it says,it fears the future effects of the incorrect ruling.because the airlines do not challenge the decision under,there is no case or controversy as to whether the written agreement exception applies even if we held the dot lacked authority to consider the reasonableness of the increase in m o charges,that holding would not have any effect on the charges.because no justiciable controversy exists when parties ask for an advisory opinion,epa,d citing hayburn case,dall,we can not decide the question presented by the city.
we reject the airlines argument that the increase in m o fees was unjustly discriminatory.as of the date of the final decision,all airlines operating out of lax were paying the increased m o fees.at some time between that date and the filing of the airlines petition for review,the city and the airlines operating out of the other terminals agreed,in settlement of their dispute,to a lesser increase in the m o fee.although the dot could not have foreseen the outcome of that litigation,the airlines argue the department should have considered the possibility that the other airlines would either prevail in or reach a favorable settlement of their dispute with the city.
the dot did not act unreasonably in refusing to consider the range of potential outcomes in the litigation between the city and the other airlines.the dot could not determine whether the airlines were being unjustly discriminated against without knowing whether the other airlines had achieved a favorable result with the city,much less whether the result was so favorable as to constitute unjust discrimination against the airlines.the dot decision to base the final decision upon what it knew,rather than upon what it might have predicted,was not arbitrary and capricious.
rent per square foot 
both the airlines and the city find fault with the dot treatment of fmv.the airlines argue the final decision is arbitrary and capricious because the dot failed to explain why,although an airport may not use fmv,as measured by opportunity cost,when setting airfield rental rates,it is permitted to use opportunity cost in setting fmv rates for space inside a terminal.the city objects to the dot dual requirements that,in using fmv to set terminal rates,the city may look to the opportunity cost of devoting the space only to other aeronautical uses,and must use an independent appraiser to determine fmv.finally,the airlines argue the dot erred in holding the city use of fmv was unreasonable as applied only to the airlines on the ground that the airlines had failed to complain to the dot within the time allotted by statute.
airfield space 
in lax i we held the tax provision of the federal aviation act does not prohibit an airport from considering its opportunity cost in setting airfield fees.at.we directed the dot on remand to decide whether an fmv methodology that considers the most valuable alternative use of the land would more accurately reflect its true cost.id.in air transport association of america dot ata,we reviewed the subsequent policy statement,in which the dot distinguished between airfield fees charged for the use of runways,taxiways,ramps,aprons,and roadway land,and the fees for the use of all other airport space.id.the policy statement required airports to set airfield fees based upon historic cost but allowed them to use any reasonable methodology,including opportunity cost,to set fees.id.in vacating the policy statement we observed t he dot simply has not explained why fair market valuation may be appropriate for other portions of the airport,but is purportedly too difficult to use in valuing airfield assets.id.at.
the airlines argue the dot has again failed to explain its disparate treatment of fees for airfield and for,terminal space.the final decision merely tracks the policy statement,asserting it is within the dot discretion to allow an airport to consider opportunity cost when setting fees,final decision,dot av.lexis,at,and adds that nothing in the controlling decisional guidance precludes the use of fmv,id.at.both statements may be true,but neither is a reasoned basis for allowing an airport to use opportunity cost as a measure of fmv for one type of airport space and not another.we must therefore grant the airlines petition and again remand the matter to the dot either to justify or to abandon its disparate treatment of airfield and space.
other aeronautical uses of terminal space 
although it approved of using fmv in theory,the dot went on to hold the city may not base terminal rents upon a measure of fmv that takes account of what users,such as retail merchants,would be willing to pay for terminal space.the city argues this limitation was arbitrary and capricious because the dot failed to offer a satisfactory explanation for its disparate treatment of aeronautical and uses.the dot supported its position with the observation that airports have grant assurance obligations to operate the facility for aeronautical purposes.id.at.
in lax ii we upheld the dot decision to bar setting airfield rates based upon the opportunity cost of uses,city of los angeles dot,because the city was legally obligated to use the airfield land as an airport.id.at the department concluded that it would be unreasonable for the city to recover compensation through its landing fees for a lost opportunity that does not lawfully exist.the dot offers the same rationale to justify the prohibition against considering uses for space inside the terminal.
although an airport is obligated to use space to support airport services,the dot does not suggest all space must be dedicated solely to aeronautical uses,which would be to deny the obvious these days commercial airports feature many retail vendors of food,clothing,toiletries,periodicals,and more.a commercial airport foregoes lost opportunities aplenty when it leases to an airline space it could lease to a tenant.the difference between the airfield and the terminal is that aeronautical and uses can not coexist in the airfield safety,among other reasons,precludes retail or other operations on the tarmac or runways.in the terminal,by contrast,aeronautical and businesses are compatible,perhaps even complementary.it makes no sense,therefore,to say the city may not rely upon the rental value of retail space in calculating the fmv of terminal space leased to airlines because airports have grant assurance obligations to operate the facility for aeronautical purposes.final decision,dot av.lexis,at.an airport does not cease to operate for aeronautical purposes because it also rents terminal space to a retailer.the dot decision to limit the city use of fmv to the consideration of lost aeronautical opportunities is therefore arbitrary and capricious.we grant the city petition in this respect and direct the dot on remand,either to justify or to abandon its objection to the city considering uses when setting terminal rents based upon fmv.
the city also argues it was arbitrary and capricious for the dot to require that it obtain a neutral third party appraisal,id.at,in order to determine the fmv of rental space.the dot concern was that the city establishment of fair market value was not an objective determination,but rather a determination established by the city itself.id.at.the city objects to the notion that an appraisal may not be objective and reliable.be that as it may,one need not consult precedents to see that requiring an independent appraisal to ensure an objective determination of the fmv for terminal space is neither arbitrary nor capricious but only a prudent acknowledgement of human nature and institutional incentives.
timeliness of airlines objection 
an air carrier may appeal to the dot for review of an airport charge per a b,as follows 
the secretary of transportation shall issue a determination as to whether a fee imposed upon one or more air carriers by the owner or operator of an airport is reasonable if a written complaint requesting such determination is filed with the secretary by an affected air carrier within days after such carrier receives written notice of the establishment or increase of such fee.
when the airlines filed their complaint,only the airlines had received notice that their rent would be based upon fmv.the city did not give notice to the airlines until after the complaint had been filed.the alj advised the airlines that because the complaint had already been filed,it was unnecessary to revise the complaint in order for the airlines to join the airlines arguments against the city use of fmv.upon review,however,the dot held t he reasonableness of the market method as applied to the carriers is outside the scope of this proceeding.final decision,dot av.lexis,at.
in support of their petition for review by this court,the airlines argue the alj invitation equitably tolled the day requirement.the dot responds that the day requirement limits the agency jurisdiction and therefore could not be equitably tolled.
as the supreme court has observed,the law typically treats a limitations defense as an affirmative defense that the defendant must raise at the pleadings stage and that is subject to rules of forfeiture and waiver and permit s courts to toll the limitations period in light of special equitable considerations.john sand gravel united states,d.some statutes of limitations however,
