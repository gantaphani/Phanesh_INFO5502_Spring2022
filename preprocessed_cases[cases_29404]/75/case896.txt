appellants brought this suit against florida governor jeb bush,executive director fred dickinson of the florida department of highway safety and motor vehicles the department,and several florida counties,seeking a temporary restraining order a preliminary injunction restraining appellees from distributing funds pursuant to.stat.the act an injunction preventing appellees from enforcing the act and a declaration that the act is unconstitutional an injunction preventing the counties from distributing funds raised under the act based on the viewpoint of the recipient and an injunction preventing the counties from delegating their duty of administering the funds to religious organizations.the challenged statute,which creates a specialty license plate bearing the message choose life,was enacted under florida specialty license plate program.stat.
the state of florida currently authorizes the distribution of at least specialty license plates.see.stat.the process by which an organization can obtain a specialty license plate is spelled out in.stat.an interested organization must submit to the department a request for the specialty plate,including a general description of the plate,a scientific survey indicating that at least floridians intend to purchase the specialty plate,an application fee,not to exceed,to defray the costs incurred by the department in the review of the application and the development of the plate,and a marketing strategy describing the marketing plans for the plate and outlining the anticipated revenues and planned expenditures of the revenues generated by the plate.id.if the sponsoring organization satisfies these requirements,the department submits the plan to the florida legislature,which has unfettered discretion to enact a law authorizing the specialty plate,or to reject the plan in toto.id.
in,choose life,an organization committed to the promotion of alternatives to abortion,satisfied the requirements for a specialty license plate,and the department submitted the plan to the legislature for approval.a senator offered an amendment to the bill that would have created a second specialty license plate bearing the message pro choice,with proceeds to be distributed to any reproductive services organization,including those involved or associated with abortion activities.the amendment was rejected by a vote of to.the choose life plate legislation passed,and the plan was codified as.stat.
florida motorists may purchase a choose life license plate by paying a annual use fee above the standard license plate fee.by the terms of the act,the annual use fees must first be used to defray the administrative expenses incurred by the department in the development and distribution of the plates,and must then be distributed by the department to florida counties,in proportion to the number of purchasers of the plate in each county.the counties must then distribute the funds to agencies within the counties that satisfy the statutory criteria.id.b.eligible agencies must provide counseling or other services to meet the physical needs of pregnant women who are committed to placing their children for adoption.id.the agencies must spend at least of the funds on clothing,housing,medical care,food,utilities,transportation,or other material needs of pregnant women.the funds may also be used to fund the care of babies waiting to be adopted.id.b.funds generated from the sale of choose life plates may not be distributed to agencies involved or associated with abortion activities,including counseling for or referrals to abortion clinics,providing medical procedures,or advertising.id.b.
once the department distributes funds to the counties,the counties have the sole authority to decide which agencies within the counties are qualified and will receive the choose life funds.id.the act does not limit the ability of the counties to contract with other organizations to make these decisions.indeed,this is what most counties have done,or at least have evidenced an intent to do 
appellants filed this lawsuit in the southern district of florida on january,challenging the constitutionality of florida choose life license plate statute.stat.appellants contend the statute violates their first amendment right to freedom of speech by providing a forum for car owners to express their political views but not providing a similar forum for,and by authorizing the distribution of funds in a manner that discriminates based on the viewpoint of the agency applying for the funds.appellants also claim the statute violates their rights under the establishment clause by creating excessive entanglement with religion by preferring one religion over others and by delegating an important governmental function to religious organizations.appellants further contend the statute violates their right to due process under the fourteenth amendment they assert the statute conditions the receipt of funds on criteria so vague that it encourages discriminatory disbursements of money and fails to give applicants fair notice of what speech renders them ineligible for funds the district court dismissed appellants claims against appellees dickinson and the florida counties in an order dated july,finding appellants lacked standing to bring their claims.women emergency network dickinson,d.the court also granted appellee bush motion for summary judgment,finding he was not a proper party to the suit.women emergency network bush,d.
article iii of the united states constitution authorizes the courts to decide cases only where there is a justiciable case or controversy.const.art.iii,cl.power dep t of energy,cir.perhaps the most fundamental doctrine that has emerged from the requirement is that of standing.allen wright,d.power,at.the supreme court has articulated for us a test to determine whether a party to a lawsuit has standing.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.a plaintiff must show he has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to conduct of the defendant and it is likely,not just merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.power,at.
courts have traditionally recognized at least three distinct forms of standing taxpayer standing,see doremus bd.of educ.of hawthorne,individual standing,see lujan,at.at,and organizational standing,see havens realty coleman,d.we will address appellants claims under each basis for standing.
taxpayer standing 
appellants becker and jackson claim their counties of residence violated their first amendment rights as taxpayers by using county funds to coordinate and oversee the distribution of choose life funds to organizations providing adoption services specifically,appellant becker claims the use of county funds to negotiate a contract with catholic charities,a religious organization,violates his rights under the establishment clause by delegating an important discretionary government function to a religious organization.see larkin grendel den,d.
ordinarily,state taxpayers lack a sufficiently personal interest to challenge laws of general applicability,since their injury is not significantly different from that suffered by taxpayers in general.asarco kadish,d plurality opinion.to have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a state law,a taxpayer must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of its enforcement,and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.doremus,at.at quoting massachusetts mellon.the analysis changes,however,when a taxpayer challenges a statute under the establishment clause.rather than requiring a direct injury,we only require a plaintiff to demonstrate a logical link between his taxpayer status and the challenged legislative enactment,and a nexus between his taxpayer status and the precise nature of the alleged constitutional infringement.flast cohen,d.becker satisfies this relaxed criteria he is a resident of palm beach county,he pays taxes to the county,and palm beach county has expended municipal funds in the contemplation and negotiation of a contract with catholic charities 
there is nothing inherently unconstitutional,however,in the use of county tax dollars to distribute funds from the sale of license plates.in fact,we find it difficult to ascertain what becker must assert to state a viable establishment clause claim.in a case similar to ours,the fifth circuit recently held that a plaintiff challenging louisiana choose life license plate legislation failed to articulate an injury where there was no allegation that the distributors of the funds have yet distributed any money from the choose life fund or that in so doing,or contemplating distributions,they have actually advanced the religious ideologies of their respective organizations or religion in general.henderson stalder,cir.the district court in the present case applied the same standard,dismissing becker claims after finding no evidence to support the notion that any agency appointed to distribute the funds will advance any particular religious ideology.dickinson,d at.
becker contends the fifth circuit and the district court applied the wrong test to determine whether palm beach county violated his rights under the establishment clause.he argues we are bound by the supreme court decision in larkin grendel den,in which the court considered the constitutionality of a delegation of power by the commonwealth of massachusetts to churches and schools in massachusetts to veto applications for liquor licenses at properties located within close proximity to the churches or schools.at.at.the court found the delegation of power to be unconstitutional,noting,the churches power under the statute is standardless,calling for no reasons,findings,or reasoned conclusions.that power may therefore be used for explicitly religious goals id.at.at.the court concluded,the statute substitutes the unilateral and absolute power of a church for the reasoned decisionmaking of a public legislative body acting on evidence and guided by standards,on issues with significant economic and political implications.id.at.at.appellant contends palm beach county violated the establishment clause by negotiating a contract with catholic charities,a religious organization,thereby delegating an important discretionary governmental function to a religious organization,just as massachusetts delegated its licensing power to the churches in larkin.
even if becker is correct that the formation of a contract between palm beach county and catholic charities might violate the establishment clause under larkin,he still fails to satisfy lujan requirement.at.at.it is the formation of a contract that creates a potential establishment clause issue,not the negotiation of a contract.becker contends palm beach county violated his rights as a taxpayer by expending county funds to negotiate a distribution contract with catholic charities.this is nothing more than a speculative injury,insufficient to satisfy lujan requirement palm beach county has not entered any agreement with catholic charities.neither the county nor catholic charities has distributed funds received pursuant to.stat.this is the crux of becker standing problem we can not determine whether palm beach county distribution contract with catholic charities violates the establishment clause because there is no contract.there is nothing unusual or unconstitutional about the use of county funds to negotiate a contract that may or may not come to fruition becker establishment clause claims against palm beach county must fail for lack of standing.
individual standing 
appellants becker and jackson claim the state of florida violated their first amendment rights by providing a public forum for car owners to express their political views but not providing a similar forum for car owners the district court granted the state motion for summary judgment after determining appellants claims were not ripe for review dickinson,d at.specifically,the court found appellants failed to attempt to present their view in the specialty plate forum by applying for a license plate bearing a message concerning their political views,and therefore should not be permitted to levy a first amendment challenge against.stat.id.we agree with the district court.
to establish individual standing,a plaintiff must first demonstrate that he suffered an as a result of the defendant conduct.lujan,at.at.the injury alleged by appellants is not easily defined,a problem that caused the fifth circuit some consternation in henderson.see at jones,concurring and davis,dissenting defining plaintiffs injuries differently.the majority in henderson characterized appellants alleged injury as the state denial of appellants opportunity to express their point of view.id.at.appellants would rather we define their injury as the government promotion of one side of the debate on the abortion rights issue in a speech forum,coupled with the lack of opportunity to present their opposing view.id.at davis,dissenting.the problem with appellants argument is that it presumes the state has done more than it actually has done.has the state of florida authorized the speech of one side of the abortion debate of course.has the state denied the other side of the debate the same opportunity to speak not at all.the first amendment does not require states to authorize the speech of those who have expressed no interest in speaking it only protects the rights of those who wish to speak.the state of florida has not denied appellants access to the specialty license plate forum it has not rejected appellants application for a specialty license plate,and it has not applied.stat.in a discriminatory manner.until it does so,appellants have not suffered an,and they lack standing to bring their claim.
appellants point to a line of supreme court cases that have allowed plaintiffs subject to laws to challenge the laws without applying for and being denied an opportunity to speak.see watchtower bible tract soc.of,village of stratton,d city of lakewood plain dealer publ g,d shuttlesworth birmingham,d.all of these cases involve restrictions or prohibitions on speech by the government.in watchtower,a municipal statute prohibited canvassing without first obtaining a permit.at.in lakewood,an ordinance required mayoral approval for placing newsracks.at.at.in shuttlesworth,an ordinance prohibited public demonstration without a permit.at.at.in all three cases,the constitutional challenge was to the government program that created the speech forum,not to the state authorization of the use of the forum by a third party.if appellants were challenging.stat,the statute that creates the forum,the lakewood line of cases might be relevant.appellants only challenge,though,is to the choose life statute.stat.the choose life statute does not in any way restrict or prohibit appellants speech.nothing in the choose life statute prevents appellants from applying for or gaining entrance to the specialty license plates forum.the first amendment protects the right to speak it does not give appellants the right to stop others with opposing viewpoints from speaking.
redressability 
appellants fare no better in their attempt to establish the third element of standing,that it is likely the alleged injury will be redressed by a favorable ruling from this court.lujan,at.at.as we have explained above,the only cognizable injury appellants could allege is that the state denied the
