apa transport corporation apa transport closed its facilities and terminated all of its employees on february.it had informed its employees of the impending shutdown and layoffs only a week earlier.following the shutdown,a number of and union employees,along with certain employee retirement income security act erisa funds,filed suit against apa transport and affiliated entities claiming that they had violated the notice provisions of the worker adjustment and retraining notification act warn act,et,which requires that an employer provide days notice before a plant shutdown unless the employer qualifies for certain exceptions.on appeal,we address whether the erisa funds have standing to sue under the warn act whether apa transport and an affiliated company,apa truck leasing,could be considered liable pursuant to the warn act as a single employer and whether apa transport qualifies for the faltering company exception to the notice provisions of the warn act.
background 
facts of the case 
apa transport was a trucking business founded in and dissolved on february.apa transport main offices were located in north bergen,new jersey,with other terminals and facilities throughout the northeast.pursuant to collective bargaining agreements,apa transport union employees were represented by teamsters local local and teamsters local local.
the of apa imperatore,and armand owned more than other companies at the time apa transport closed,many of which continue to operate today.one of these companies is apa truck leasing,which is involved in leasing motor vehicles.imperatore and pohan were officers and directors of both apa transport and apa truck leasing with fred astle and burton the affairs of both companies.the parties to this appeal dispute the degree to which apa transport and apa truck leasing were connected to each other appellants argue that the two companies were closely related,highlighting the following facts the companies made loans to one another apa transport provided employees of apa truck leasing with medical,pension,k and workers compensation benefits employees of apa truck leasing received the same benefits as apa transport employees and apa transport provided payroll,office supplies,accounting and other services for apa truck leasing.apa transport,by contrast,contends that the two companies operated separately,and points to the following facts apa transport and apa truck leasing did not share employees the companies handled the discipline of employees separately the companies had separate contracts with different unions and the companies maintained separate financial books and records.
on december,apa transport entered into a loan and security agreement loan agreement with transamerica business capital corporation transamerica.the loan agreement provided apa transport with a revolving credit facility that allowed it to borrow up to million,secured by real property,equipment and accounts receivable.the loan agreement required apa transport to provide transamerica with regular reports as to outstanding accounts receivable and to comply with certain financial covenants.
following the execution of the loan agreement,apa transport suffered consistent losses.as a result,it defaulted on loan covenants on multiple occasions in,and.after each default,transamerica and apa transport negotiated agreements whereby the breaches were waived the applicable covenants were amended.apa transport was also negatively affected by the september,terrorist attacks because it conducted a significant amount of business in the new york city metropolitan area following the attacks,apa transport reported that its revenues fell percent.as a result,apa transport reduced accounts receivable limited the amount of money it could continue to borrow from transamerica under the loan agreement.
on october,transamerica convened a meeting with apa transport at transamerica offices to discuss how apa transport was going to operate going forward,given its losses.joint appendix.the attendees included pohan and imperatore transamerica president,steven fischer and transamerica representatives christopher norrito and michael burns.the transamerica representatives expressed concern about the state of apa transport finances,communicated to pohan and imperatore that transamerica would not continue to fund apa transport operating losses and indicated that pohan and imperatore would need to put additional capital into the company before transamerica would extend any additional financing apa transport stated that it would seek additional financing,and transamerica responded by stating that its options were open for extending the loan agreement.however,apa transport made no formal request at the meeting to secure additional financing or to extend the loan agreement.
in november,transamerica notified apa transport that it was once again in default on the loan agreement.on december,transamerica agreed to a fifth waiver and amendment to the loan agreement to cure those defaults.
the loan agreement was set to expire on february,the termination date,at which point the entire loan amount was due.under the loan agreement,any requests for extensions or renewals of the loan agreement were required to be in writing days prior to the termination date.however,as of the end of,apa transport had made no written or oral request for transamerica to extend or renew the loan agreement the parties had not begun to gather the documentation required for such an extension or renewal and apa transport officials had taken no steps to invest additional capital in the company.
on january,astle sent a letter the astle letter to norrito requesting additional financing for apa transport,to be secured by mortgages on two freight terminals owned by companies related to apa transport.the letter asserted that each of the terminals was worth to million,and requested that transamerica extend an additional loan of to million to be secured by mortgages on these properties.there is no evidence that work was undertaken on the preparation of appraisals,environmental reports or environmental indemnity agreements for these properties,all which would have been necessary to obtain the mortgages.moreover,the astle letter did not specifically seek an extension or renewal of the loan agreement,nor did it mention the impending termination date.
on january,a second meeting was held between transamerica and apa transport to discuss the state of apa transport finances,with pohan,astle,norrito,burns and fischer in attendance.at the meeting,transamerica made no commitment with respect to additional financing it also neither indicated that it would extend its loan beyond the termination date nor increased its lending to apa transport.
on january,pohan sent a letter to fischer the pohan letter.the letter stated that he was renewing the request that transamerica provide apa transport with an additional loan to carry us through this recessionary winter and the losses attendant thereto.it reiterated the offer made in the astle letter for apa transport to arrange to secure additional financing with mortgages on the two terminals.the letter concluded by stating that transamerica prompt response to this request is most urgent,since the ability of the ownership to fund the anticipated losses in the next few weeks has just about been depleted.id.
transamerica did not respond to the pohan letter with a credit memorandum or credit approval.in the first week of february,pohan had a phone conversation with a transamerica representative,during which pohan was informed that it would be difficult to persuade transamerica credit department to approve additional financing unless apa transport owners put additional money into the company.then,on february,transamerica sent apa transport a letter formally notifying it that the loan agreement would terminate pursuant to its terms on february,and that transamerica would not agree to extend the loan agreement to provide additional financing.
unable to continue functioning without such financing,apa transport shut its terminals on february.the first notice to employees of the shutdown was given in a february,letter from apa transport to the president of local,which was received on february.the letter stated that in accordance with the warn act,it was providing notice that apa transport was permanently closing its terminal in philadelphia,pennsylvania effective february.the letter further stated that all employees at the location would be permanently laid off,and that apa transport had given a shortened warn notice because it had been 
actively seeking financial assistance to alleviate its severe economic problems.if apa transport had provided an earlier shutdown notice,it would have precluded our ability to obtain the financing necessary to continue in business.apa transport has now been notified that its request for this critical financing has been rejected and,accordingly,it can no longer afford to operate.
on february,apa transport sent similar letters to representatives of local and to all employees.
as a result of the shutdown,all apa transport represented by local,represented by local and terminated.apa transport paid no wages or benefits to any employee after february.
approximately six weeks after the shutdown,apa truck leasing lent apa transport between and million.the loan was secured by an mortgage and security agreement dated june,on apa transport north bergen terminal facility.
procedural history 
several complaints were filed against apa transport,apa truck leasing and certain other related entities the apa entities beginning in.these complaints alleged violations of erisa the warn act and sought back wages and benefits.one set of plaintiffs was comprised of two erisa funds,the teamsters pension trust fund of philadelphia and vicinity and the teamsters health and welfare fund of philadelphia and vicinity plaintiff funds,which together with teamsters local employee plaintiffs,alleged violations of the warn act and erisa.a second set of plaintiffs was comprised of a class of employees and local also employee plaintiffs who alleged violations of the warn act and erisa 
the cases were consolidated in the united states district court for the district of new jersey in may after which both the plaintiff funds and the employee plaintiffs filed multiple amended complaints that added certain parties.thereafter,apa transport moved for summary judgment as to the claims asserted by the plaintiff funds,alleging that the plaintiff funds lacked standing.the plaintiff funds and the employee plaintiffs simultaneously filed motions for partial summary judgment asserting that the plaintiff funds had standing under the warn act that apa transport,apa truck leasing and the apa entities should be considered a single employer for warn act purposes and that apa transport did not qualify for the faltering company exception to the warn act.apa transport then filed a for summary judgment as to the faltering company defense.at the same time,apa truck leasing and the apa entities filed for summary judgment regarding the single employer issue.
on december,without oral argument,the district court granted apa transport summary judgment motion as to claims asserted by the plaintiff funds,holding that the plaintiff funds lacked standing under the warn act.the district court also granted summary judgment to apa transport on the faltering company defense.finally,it granted apa truck leasing and the apa entities summary judgment on the single employer issue,concluding that none of those companies could be considered a single employer with apa transport.on december,the district court dismissed all remaining issues as moot,and on december,entered final judgment.
a timely appeal followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
ii.discussion 
there are three issues on appeal.we first consider whether the district court was correct to conclude that the plaintiff funds do not have standing under the warn act.next,we determine whether the district court was correct to conclude that apa transport and apa truck leasing did not constitute a single employer for warn act purposes.finally,we address whether the district court was correct to conclude that apa transport qualified for the faltering company exception to the warn act notice requirement.
our review of all three legal issues,which were decided at summary judgment,is de novo.tkr cable cable city,cir.we construe the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
brief overview of the warn act 
the warn act was enacted in in response to extensive worker dislocation that occurred in the and when employees lost their jobs,often without notice,as companies were merged,acquired or closed.the purpose of the warn act is to protect workers by obligating employers to give their employees advanced notice of plant closings.this allows workers who will be laid off time to adjust to the prospective loss of employment,to seek and obtain alternative jobs and to enter skill training or retraining that will allow them to successfully compete in the job market.hotel employees rest.employees int l union local elsinore shore,cir citation omitted.
the warn act provides that covered,those that employ at least workers at a single site of provide days written notice before a closing or mass layoff.see et.the act dictates that notice be given to affected employees or their union representative,the state dislocated worker unit and the chief elected official of a unit of local government.id.a.employers that violate the warn act are liable to their employees for back pay and benefits for each day notice is not provided,up to a maximum of days.id.the warn act contains three exceptions to the notice requirement the faltering company exception,the business circumstances exception and the natural disaster exception.id.b.
standing to sue under the warn act 
the plaintiff funds,joined by the employee plaintiffs,contend that the district court erred when it concluded that the plaintiff funds did not have standing to bring suit under the warn act.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court correctly determined that the plaintiff funds lack standing.
the warn act limits employer liability to each aggrieved employee who suffers an employment loss.a.it further enumerates who may bring a suit 
a person seeking to enforce such liability,including a representative of employees or a unit of local government aggrieved under paragraph or,may sue either for such person or for other persons similarly situated,or both,in any district court of the united states for any district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred,or in which the employer transacts business.
id.a.the warn act defines the term representative with reference to labor organizations,which are the exclusive representative s of employees under federal labor law.id.a.a unit of local government is defined as a political subdivision of a state.id.a.
the district court concluded that the plaintiff funds did not have standing to sue under a because,although employee welfare and benefit plans are included in those benefits to which an aggrieved employee is entitled under the warn act,the plaintiff funds themselves can not be aggrieved employees under the warn act.in re apa transport.consol,wl,at.in support of this position,the district court adopted the analysis of united mine workers of america,district midwest coal,no.th h,wl.there,plaintiffs alleging a violation of the warn act sued to recover,inter alia,contributions that their employers were required to have made to certain benefit funds during the violation period.midwest coal,wl,at.the court ruled that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover the amount of the contributions because the warn act set forth the exclusive remedies for a violation of the act in,and contributions did not qualify as one of the remedies explicitly listed.id.at.in addition,the court concluded that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover contributions because n one of the funds for which the p laintiffs seek contributions by the defendant qualifies as an aggrieved employee under the warn act.id.the district court reasoned that if the benefit plans in midwest coal could not be considered aggrieved employees under the warn act,neither could the plans here and consequently,the plaintiff funds did not have standing.in re apa transport,wl,at.
on appeal,apa transport argues that this reasoning is correct,and further argues that if employees are not entitled to erisa contributions as part of their warn act damages,then the plaintiff funds have no claim upon which to sue.the plaintiff funds respond that the funds in midwest coal were not erisa funds and argue that the analysis there is consequently not transferrable to this case.the plaintiff funds also cite united mine workers of am.int l union martinka coal,d,aff,cir,for the proposition that contributions to erisa plans are benefits that fall under the warn act damages rubric set forth in b the plaintiff funds argue that because they are charged,pursuant to erisa,with aggressively pursuing the funds to which they are entitled on behalf of the employees whom they serve,and because contributions to erisa plans are benefits that can be recovered as damages when there has been a warn act violation,the plaintiff funds should be entitled to sue to recover those contributions.
we believe the parties arguments are premature.the initial issue we must question that both the district court and the parties did not whether the plaintiff funds can be considered person s permitted to seek enforcement of the warn act pursuant to a.this is an issue of first impression in this circuit and it appears that no other circuit has considered whether benefit plans should be considered person s under a.
as noted above,the relevant provision of the warn act provides that a civil suit may be brought by a person seeking to enforce such liability,including a representative of employees or a unit of local government aggrieved under paragraph or.a.the warn act fails to define the word person.the rules of construction for federal statutes broadly define person as includ ing corporations,companies,associations,firms,partnerships,societies,and joint stock companies,as well as individuals unless the context of the statute indicates otherwise.
here,there is nothing in the context of the statute that indicates to us whether congress intended to more narrowly proscribe those person s who can enforce the warn act.nor does the language of the pertinent provision provide a clear answer.rather,it states that the category includ es representative s of employees or unit s of local government aggrieved under paragraph or.a emphasis added.it is a canon of statutory construction that when the word including is followed by a list of examples,those examples are generally considered illustrative rather than exhaustive.see,massachusetts,d scalia,dissenting the word including indicate s that what follows will be an illustrative sampling of the general category that precedes the word.united states grassie,cir w e regard the statutory use of the word including as the preface for a representative or illustrative example,and not as a term of restriction or exclusion for anything not expressly specified.but canons of construction are not mandatory rules.they are guides that need not be conclusive.chickasaw nation united states,d quoting circuit city stores,adams,d.
however,we need not decide whether the statute should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the canon based on the statute alone because authoritative regulations address the very question at issue.we have explained that when a relevant statute is silent or ambiguous,we will defer to any reasonable regulations promulgated by the agency charged with administering the statute.bd.of tr.of trucking employees of welfare fund,fund kero leasing,cir see also smriko ashcroft,cir agency regulations have the force of law quoting marshall lansing,cir martinka coal,at cir warn act regulations have the force of law unless they are irreconcilable with the clear meaning of a statute,as revealed by its language,purpose,and history internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the secretary of labor is charged with prescrib ing such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the warn act.a.here,the regulations promulgated by the department of labor dol pertaining to warn act enforcement state that 
e nforcement of warn will be through the courts,as provided in section of the statute.employees,their representatives and units of local government may initiate civil actions against employers believed to be in violation of of the act.the department of labor has no legal standing in any enforcement action and,therefore,will not be in a position to issue advisory opinions of specific cases.the department will provide assistance in understanding these regulations and may revise them from time to time as may be necessary.
d emphasis added.this provision,unlike the related provision in the statute itself,indicates that only employees,union representatives and units of local government may bring suit.neither party cites this regulation,much less contends that it is in conflict with the plain language of the statute.k mart cartier,d.consequently,we will apply the dol regulation,which compels the conclusion that plaintiff funds are not person s that may enforce the warn act.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the district court correctly concluded that the plaintiff funds do not have standing to bring suit under the warn act.
single employer 
we next address the question of whether apa truck leasing and apa transport constitute a single employer for warn act purposes.if the two entities are a single employer then we need not reach the question of whether apa transport may avail itself of the faltering company defense,as apa transport would not be able to demonstrate that it was faltering because it would have had adequate capital to operate.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court correctly determined that apa transport and apa truck leasing can not be considered a single employer.
the warn act defines the term employer as any business enterprise that employs or more employees.a.the warn act does not define business enterprise however,dol regulations issued under the warn act provide that two or more affiliated companies may be considered a single business enterprise for warn act purposes.a.the regulations state that independent contractors and subsidiaries which are wholly or partially owned by a parent company are treated as a part of the parent or contracting company depending upon the degree of their independence from the parent.id.
in pearson component technology,cir,we adopted the five factors listed in those regulations to create a balancing test that would determine whether related companies are liable under the warn act on single employer grounds.the five factors are as follows common ownership,common directors officers,de facto exercise of control,unity of personnel policies emanating from a common source,and dependency of operations.id.at a.we further indicated that the test was a balancing test in which a number of facts and circumstances may be relevant.pearson,at.however,the factors are not balanced equally the first and second factors,common ownership and common directors officers,are not sufficient to establish that two entities are a single employer.id.at even ownership coupled with common not a sufficient basis for liability.
in the context of summary judgment,we held that the warn act test for intercorporate liability presents a question of fact,but noted that our decision to characterize it as such does not preclude an inquiry as to whether plaintiffs have put forth enough evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact.id.at.in fact,in pearson itself,we applied the test and concluded that the evidence proffered by the plaintiffs simply did not establish the high degree of integration required by the analysis set forth in this opinion to survive summary judgment.id.at.
here,the district court concluded that the evidence was not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact,and held that apa transport and apa truck leasing could not be considered a single employer for warn act purposes.while the employee plaintiffs had demonstrated and apa transport and apa truck leasing did not dispute common ownership and common directors owners the first two factors,as apa transport and apa truck leasing shared all of the same stockholders and maintained the same presidents and,the district court then determined that the third,fourth and fifth factors weighed against the conclusion that apa transport and apa truck leasing should be considered a single employer.for the third factor,de facto exercise of control,the district court found that lower levels of management at the two companies were supervised on a basis,and that as such there was autonomy in supervision.in re apa transport,wl,at.the district court also found that despite intercompany loans,the two companies were autonomous in terms of finances because each company had independent wage rates,pay scales,salaries and payrolls.id.for the unity of personnel policies emanating from a common source factor,the district court found that each company possessed its own employees and its own policies regarding compensation,vacation and sick time that the companies hired and fired employees on an individual basis and that,to a large extent,personnel files were maintained separately.id.at.finally,for the dependency of operations factor,the district court relied on its analysis for the third and fourth factors and determined that it weighed in favor of apa transport and apa truck leasing as well.id as only the first two factors weighed in favor of the employee plaintiffs,and these two factors alone are not sufficient to demonstrate that two entities are a single employer,the district court concluded that apa truck leasing and apa transport could not reasonably be considered a single employer for warn act purposes.id.
on appeal,the employee plaintiffs do not dispute the underlying factual findings of the district court,but contend that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the ultimate question of whether apa transport and apa truck leasing constitute a single employer.we disagree.as we stated earlier,that the balancing test requires a analysis does not preclude an inquiry as to whether plaintiffs have put forth enough evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact.pearson,at.we agree with the district court that no reasonable juror,employing the test,could find that apa transport and apa truck leasing were a single employer.
as an initial matter,we think it important to consider the policy considerations that animate the warn act.the purpose of the act is to penalize those employers that close a plant and fail to comply with the notice requirements of the statute.thus,the question of whether two entities constitute a single employer for warn act purposes is ultimately an inquiry into whether two nominally separate entities operated at arm length or whether,following an assessment of the amount of control exercised by one entity over another,it can be determined that two entities should be considered jointly liable for the closing and the subsequent lack of notice.id.at.accordingly,the goal of the test here is to determine whether apa truck leasing had become so entangled with apa transport affairs so as to engender warn act liability,or whether the two continued to function at arm length as separate entities.id.at.
turning to the decision of the district court,we note it was correct to conclude that the first two factors common ownership and common directors owners are not sufficient to deem two entities a single employer.the employee plaintiffs are thus incorrect to argue that they should survive summary judgment on the single employer issue solely because apa truck leasing and apa transport were owned by the same individuals and shared directors and officers.
consequently,the remaining three factors are determinative.factor three looks to whether there was de facto exercise of control of apa trucking by apa transport or vice versa.the core of this factor is whether one company was the responsible for the employment practice giving rise to the litigation.id.at.here,a review of the facts adduced by the parties indicates that while apa truck leasing may have made certain loans to apa transport and shared certain administrative functions,it was not controlling apa transport and played no role in apa transport decision to close its facilities.thus,factor three does not support a finding that apa transport and apa truck leasing constitute a single employer.
factor four looks to whether there was a unity of personnel policies.the overall question is whether the companies actually functioned as a single entity with regard to their relationship with employees.id.at.to reach an answer,we consider whether the two companies in question engaged in centralized hiring and firing,payment of wages,and personnel and benefits recordkeeping.see vogt greenmarine holding,d.while the two companies did share certain benefit plans and some employee monitoring functions specifically,apa transport did the background security checks for apa truck leasing new hires,and machinists at both companies were given the opportunity to bid for positions at the other company,there is no evidence that the two companies actually functioned as a single entity with regard to their respective employees.pearson,at.employees were hired and fired independently reported separately to supervisors at their respective companies were paid from separate payrolls reported tax obligations to the federal government under separate id numbers keyed to their company and had separate labor contracts.this factor also does not support a finding that apa transport and apa truck leasing were a single employer.
the fifth and final factor is whether there was a dependency of operations between the two companies.to determine whether two companies are dependent on one another,we look to the existence of arrangements such as the sharing of administrative or purchasing services,interchanges of employees or equipment,and commingled finances.id.at citations omitted.although the employee plaintiffs insist that the two companies commingled finances,the record indicates that the loans between apa truck leasing and apa transport were made at arm length.moreover,apa transport and apa truck leasing were clearly not dependent upon one another to continue operation,and there is no stronger evidence for this fact than that apa truck leasing continued to operate without incident after apa transport folded.thus,the fifth factor also can not support a finding that apa transport and apa truck leasing were a single employer.
because the final three factors are clearly in favor of apa transport and apa truck leasing,and because a finding that two companies share the same ownership and certain directors the first two factors is not in and of itself sufficient to find that two entities were a single employer,we conclude that no reasonable juror could find that apa transport and apa truck leasing functioned as a single employer based on the facts presented.we therefore affirm the district court decision on this issue 
d.the faltering company exception 
the employee plaintiffs final argument is that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment to apa transport and apa truck leasing on the question of whether apa transport qualified for the faltering company exception to the warn act notice requirement.as noted above,if we had determined that apa truck leasing and apa transport were a single employer for warn act purposes,then the faltering company defense would not be available because apa transport would have had adequate capital to continue to operate.however,we have concluded that no reasonable juror could find that the two companies constitute a single employer.therefore,we must focus on the question of whether apa transport has established the elements of its affirmative defense sufficient to survive summary judgment.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that apa transport can not avail itself of the faltering company defense.
the faltering company exception is an affirmative defense to liability,which means the employer bears the burden of establishing its elements.as a threshold matter,a company seeking to qualify as a faltering company must demonstrate that it had inadequate capital to continue functioning and,as such,was in a faltering state.id.
the statutory provision states that 
a n employer may order the shutdown of a single site of employment before the conclusion of the period if as of the time that notice would have been required the employer was actively seeking capital or business which,if obtained,would have enabled the employer to avoid or postpone the shutdown and the employer reasonably and in good faith believed that giving the notice required would have precluded the employer from obtaining the needed capital or business.
b.the dol regulation interpreting the faltering company exception of the warn act breaks the provision into its component parts,so that to benefit from the defense an employer must prove it was actively seeking capital at the time the notice would have been required,it had a realistic opportunity to obtain the financing sought,the financing would have been sufficient,if obtained,to enable the employer to avoid or postpone the shutdown,and the employer reasonably and in good faith believed that sending the notice would have precluded it from obtaining the financing.a.
according to the conference report issued when congress passed the warn act,the key elements of the defense,which is intended as a narrow one,are 
that the employer was actively seeking capital or business second that,had the employer obtained this capital or business,it would have enabled the employer to prevent or forestall the shutdown and third,that the employer reasonably and in good faith believed that giving the notice required would have precluded the employer from obtaining the necessary capital or business that it had a realistic opportunity to obtain.thus,to avail itself of this defense an employer must prove the specific steps it had taken,at or shortly before the time notice would have been required,to obtain a loan,to issue bonds or stock,or to secure new business.this duty to seek capital or business falls on the employer 
cong.rec.emphasis added.the central aspects of congress stated purpose have been codified in the dol regulations namely,that the faltering company defense should be construed narrowly and that,to access the defense,the employer must demonstrate that it was taking the specific steps required at the time that notice would have been required.a.
before this court,the employee plaintiffs challenge only the first two of the four elements of the defense,asserting that apa transport was not actively seeking capital at the time the notice would have been required,and that it did not have a realistic opportunity to obtain that financing.the employee plaintiffs have thus conceded the final two elements that the financing,if obtained,would have been sufficient to prevent a shutdown and that apa transport reasonably believed that giving warn act notice would have hindered its ability to get that financing,and we will not discuss them here.we note that for the two elements we will consider,we must conclude that apa transport has established both elements in order to uphold the district court decision.furthermore,we note that the parties do not argue that there are material underlying facts in dispute.appellants br.at appellees br.at.
the district court concluded that apa transport had been actively seeking financing based on apa transport meeting with transamerica on october,and its request at that time for additional financing.it stated that it was not reasonable to insist that apa transport take specific,actual and literal steps on december,when they had taken said steps on october.in re apa transport,wl,at.the district court explained that to require apa transport to take such specific,actual and literal steps would effectively eliminate any practical application of the faltering business exception as it would require said employer to read the minds of the financial institution or institutions from which it seeks its financing.id.
on appeal,the employee plaintiffs assert that the district court misstated the timeline of events in its opinion.the district court found that at the october,meeting,apa transport offered mortgages on two properties to secure additional financing from transamerica.our review of the record indicates that the employee plaintiffs are correct,as apa transport did not offer those mortgages to transamerica until january.apa transport concedes this point.
the employee plaintiffs argue that this discrepancy is significant although transamerica and apa transport discussed in general terms apa transport need for additional financing at the october,meeting,there was no affirmative attempt by apa transport after that meeting to actually secure that financing.the offer of the properties did not occur until january,after the period set forth by the warn act had begun.on these facts,the employee plaintiffs contend that apa transport can not prove that it was actively seeking financing when the period began.
apa transport makes two arguments in response.first,it agrees with the district court that apa transport was not required to take specific steps at or near the beginning of the window because such a requirement ignores the reality that prediction of the date a company will need to shut down is not an exact science and would mean that companies would be ineligible for the exception because they started their financing efforts too late to save the company.appellees br.at.second,apa transport contends that it was in fact actively seeking financing at the beginning of the period.it argues that it indicated that it would seek additional financing from transamerica at the october,meeting,and that once a lender confirms that the borrower was seeking capital,that should be the end of the inquiry as to whether the borrower was actively seeking capital.id.at.apa transport further contends that the court should take into account that business decisions can take some time and that the holidays occurred in the interim so that there should have been no expectation that apa transport would take additional steps in december to secure the financing.id.
we turn first to apa transport argument that the district court was correct to hold that it was not reasonable to insist that apa transport take specific,actual and literal steps on december,when the period began,in re apa transport,wl,at,because prediction of the date a company will need to shut down is not an exact science.appellees br.at.this approach essentially asks this court to read a foreseeability requirement into the faltering business exception in apa transport view,if an employer does not foresee that it is days away from a plant closing,it should not be held liable for failing to take specific steps at the time to secure financing.we believe such an approach runs counter to both the text and the purpose of the warn act.
the plain language of the statute states that a company must be actively seeking additional financing as of the time that notice would have been required.b see also a a n employer must have been actively seeking capital or business at the time that notice would have been required emphasis added.in effect,the warn act establishes strict liability an employer must give notice days prior to a plant closing,unless it can demonstrate that it falls within one of three specific enumerated exceptions the faltering company defense,the unforeseeable business circumstances exception,or the natural disaster defense.b.the unforeseeable business circumstances exception,which provides for a reduction in the notice period for business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the mark,with circumstances not reasonably foreseeable defined as some sudden,dramatic,and unexpected action or condition outside the employer control,indicates that congress was not blind to the issue of foreseeability.b.but apa transport does not contend that it qualifies for the unforeseen business circumstances exception.rather,apa transports appears to
