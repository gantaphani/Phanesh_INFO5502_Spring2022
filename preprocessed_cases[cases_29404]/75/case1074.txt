huntleigh usa corporation huntleigh is a corporation in the business of providing passenger and baggage screening services at airports throughout the united states.during the period between and early,airlines contracted with huntleigh in order to meet their responsibilities for passenger and baggage screening under the air transportation security act of,stat.air transportation security act repealed.
following the terrorist attacks of september,congress enacted,and the president signed into law,the aviation and transportation security act,stat.codified in scattered sections of and atsa.two of atsa provisions are pertinent to this appeal.the first provision,section g,note supp.i,provided that the under secretary of transportation for security was to assume all security and screening functions at united states airports.the second provision,section g,provided that the under secretary of transportation could perform those functions by assuming the contracts of private companies that,at the time,provided security and screening functions at airports.if the government chose to accomplish its security and screening obligations via this route,the statute required that it pay adequate compensation to the private companies whose contracts were assumed.id.atsa transfer of responsibility for passenger and baggage screening from airlines to the federal government had the effect of bringing to an end huntleigh security screening contracts with airlines.
in november of,huntleigh filed suit in the united states court of federal claims under the tucker act,a.in its suit,huntleigh alleged that atsa transfer of responsibility for passenger and baggage screening resulted in a taking of its property without just compensation,in violation of the fifth amendment to the constitution.huntleigh also alleged that it was entitled to compensation under section g of atsa.in november of,the court of federal claims conducted a trial on huntleigh claims.thereafter,on march,the court rendered a decision in which it rejected both of huntleigh claims and ordered the dismissal of huntleigh complaint.huntleigh usa united states.the court ruled that huntleigh takings claim failed because huntleigh had failed to establish that its property had been taken by the government.id.at.the court ruled against huntleigh on its claim for compensation under section g of atsa on the ground that the government had not assumed any of huntleigh contracts.id.at.
huntleigh now appeals the decision of the court of federal claims.because we conclude that governmental action did not effect the taking of huntleigh property under the fifth amendment and that the government did not assume huntleigh security screening contracts so as to entitle huntleigh to compensation under section g of atsa,we affirm the court decision.
background 
the facts pertinent to this case are not in dispute.with the enactment of the air transportation security act in,congress directed the federal aviation administration to require airlines to implement security programs to screen all passengers and luggage traveling in commercial aviation.air transportation security act,a,stat,the administrator shall prescribe reasonable regulations requiring that all passengers and all property intended to be carried in the aircraft cabin in air transportation be screened by procedures or facilities employed or operated by employees or agents of the air carrier.in order to meet their obligations under the statute,most airlines hired private security contractors to perform the required passenger and baggage screening.
huntleigh began offering passenger screening services in,and it assumed baggage screening functions in.as of november,when atsa became law,huntleigh had in place contracts with approximately airlines.the contracts covered passenger and baggage screening at some airports across the united states.
the provisions of huntleigh contracts varied.some contracts contained set periods of performance,whereas others simply continued indefinitely.all contracts,however,were terminable upon one party providing a certain number of days notice to the other party.huntleigh contends,and the government does not dispute,that,as of,huntleigh had acquired an excellent reputation in the industry and that no major airline had terminated a contract with huntleigh since.
in the wake of the terrorist attacks of september,congress reassessed the effectiveness of the screening regime created by the air transportation security act,wherein airlines were responsible for screening functions and generally met that responsibility by hiring private contractors such as huntleigh.specifically,congress determined that the federal government,through a new federal agency,the transportation security administration tsa,could more effectively provide screening services at airports than could private contractors.see,at,cong,the conferees note the terrorist hijacking and crashes of passenger aircraft on september,required a fundamental change in the way the conferees approach the task of ensuring the safety and security of the civil air transportation system.the conferees expect that security functions at united states airports should become a federal government responsibility.consequently,congress enacted atsa,thereby assigning all airport screening responsibilities to the tsa,rather than commercial airlines.
atsa imposed screening responsibilities upon the federal government and set forth a way in which the government could meet those responsibilities.thus,section a of atsa amended d to provide that the under secretary of transportation shall be responsible for security in all modes of transportation,and atsa section g stated that,not later than three months after the enactment of atsa,the under secretary of transportation shall assume civil aviation security functions and responsibilities.atsa section g,in turn,provided that,in order to meet the government responsibilities,the under secretary of transportation may assume the rights and responsibilities of an air carrier or foreign air carrier contract for provision of passenger screening services at airports in the united states.if the under secretary of transportation chose to meet the government obligations under atsa by assuming a contract that existed between an airline and a private screening contractor,section g required the payment of adequate compensation to parties to the contract.
though atsa nowhere expressly forbade huntleigh or other private contractors from continuing to provide airport screening functions,it effectively eliminated the market for such services,given that it concentrated all screening functions in the federal government.thus,although no airline other than american airlines specifically sent a termination notice to huntleigh,huntleigh and the other airlines with which it had contracts treated their contracts as terminated upon the government full assumption of screening functions at airports,resulting in a considerable loss of business to huntleigh.
as noted above,huntleigh filed suit in the court of federal claims under the tucker act,alleging that atsa transfer of responsibility for security screening from airlines to the federal government resulted in a taking of its property without just compensation in violation of the fifth amendment.huntleigh also alleged that it was entitled to compensation under section g of atsa.following a trial,the court of federal claims rendered a decision rejecting both of huntleigh claims and ordering the dismissal of huntleigh complaint.see generally huntleigh.
the court of federal claims began by addressing huntleigh takings claim.huntleigh alleged the taking of several property interests.huntleigh contended first that the government had appropriated its contracts with the airlines.though huntleigh conceded that the government had not actually substituted itself as a party to any of its contracts,it argued that the government had effectively appropriated the contracts insofar as it had taken upon itself the responsibility of performing precisely the functions formerly performed by huntleigh.id.at.huntleigh relied upon cienega gardens united states,to establish entitlement to compensation for the taking of its contractual rights.huntleigh.at.second,huntleigh argued that the government had effected a taking by destroying the going concern value and goodwill associated with its security screening business.id.in advancing this argument,huntleigh relied upon kimball laundry united states,to establish the compensability of going concern value and goodwill see id.at.huntleigh.at.
turning first to the alleged taking of huntleigh security screening contracts,the court of federal claims determined that the contracts were not taken by the government.id.at.the court noted that all the contracts between huntleigh and the airlines contained termination clauses,generally requiring from days advance notice,thus permitting either party to terminate a contract.id.at.the court further noted that,except for american airlines,none of the airlines with which huntleigh had contracts had terminated their contracts.id.rather,following the enactment of atsa,they had allowed the contracts to expire pursuant to their terms.id.under these circumstances,the court reasoned,huntleigh could not properly contend that its contracts were taken by the government.id.the court further reasoned that,despite the fact that atsa was the reason for the expiration of huntleigh contracts,the government could not be deemed to have committed a taking of huntleigh property because atsa did not regulate huntleigh.id.rather,by eliminating any screening obligations the airlines formerly possessed and transferring those obligations to the federal government,the statute embodied regulatory action with respect to the airlines.id.citing omnia commercial united states,and air pegasus of,united states,air pegasus ii,the court determined that governmental action directed at third parties had frustrated huntleigh expectations under its contracts,but that this circumstance did not provide the basis for a cognizable takings claim.huntleigh.at.
the court of federal claims also rejected huntleigh claim for compensation based upon the alleged taking of going concern value and goodwill.the court reasoned that going concern value and goodwill could not be deemed to have been taken when,as in the case before it,there had not been a taking of the underlying business with which the going concern value and goodwill were associated.id.since the government did not appropriate huntleigh business,but rather simply assumed many of the same functions huntleigh had formerly performed,huntleigh was unable to allege that the government actually took its business and therefore could not allege a taking of going concern value and goodwill.id.
having disposed of huntleigh takings claim,the court of federal claims turned to huntleigh second claim that it was entitled to compensation under section g of atsa.in advancing this claim,huntleigh acknowledged that the government had not actually stepped into its shoes under the various security screening contracts with the airlines,so as to be deemed to have assumed the rights and responsibilities of an air carrier or foreign air carrier contract for provision of passenger screening services at airports,as contemplated by section g.id.at.rather,huntleigh argued that the statute did not require a literal assumption of the contracts.id.according to huntleigh,the statute mandated compensation if,as in huntleigh case,the government assumed the responsibilities formerly borne by a private contractor.id.
the court of federal claims rejected huntleigh argument,concluding that section g of atsa did not provide authority for awarding huntleigh compensation for its lost business.id.at.in reaching that conclusion,the court relied primarily upon a textual comparison between sections g and g of the statute.as seen,section g provided that the government shall assume all screening functions at national airports.id.at emphasis added.by contrast,section g provided that the government may effect this obligation by substituting itself as a party into contracts that formerly existed between the airlines and private screening contractors.id.emphasis added.were huntleigh view of atsa correct,the court of federal claims reasoned,the statute,in section g,would have required the government to assume screening functions and then,in section g,would have provided that compensation be paid to former private screeners upon the assumption of such functions.the statute use of the permissive word may in section g,however,conveyed to the court that congress did not intend for section g to set forth the sole means by which the government could assume screening responsibilities under atsa.id.at.thus,the court determined that the requirements of section g only applied when the government actually assumed a contract between private parties,rather than when the government undertook to perform functions formerly performed by one of the parties.id.at.since huntleigh conceded that the government had not actually assumed any of its security screening contracts,the court determined that section g did not require compensation.id.at.based upon its rulings,the court of federal claims entered judgment in favor of the united states and dismissed huntleigh complaint.id.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
on appeal,huntleigh argues that the court of federal claims erred in holding that the enactment of atsa did not result in the taking of its security screening contracts,going concern value,and goodwill.huntleigh also argues that the court erred in holding that it was not entitled to compensation under section g of atsa on account of what it alleges was the government de facto assumption of its security screening contracts.we address these contentions in turn.
the issue of whether a taking has occurred is a question of law based on factual underpinnings.stearns united states,maritrans,united states,washoe county united states.as noted above,in this case,the pertinent facts are not in dispute.consequently,our consideration of huntleigh takings claim reduces to a question of law.we review de novo a ruling by the court of federal claims on a question of law.columbia gas,united states.
the takings clause of the fifth amendment of the united states constitution states that private property shall not be taken for public use,without just compensation.const.amend.v.the purpose of the takings clause is to prevent government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which,in all fairness and justice,should be borne by the public as a whole.penn cent.transp.city of,d.we have developed a test for determining whether fairness and justice require compensation for burdens imposed by a particular governmental action.
first,as a threshold matter,the court must determine whether the claimant has established a property interest for purposes of the fifth amendment.am.pelagic fishing united states,see also maritrans,at.that is because only persons with a valid property interest at the time of the taking are entitled to compensation.wyatt united states.the protections of the takings clause apply to real property,see lucas coastal council,d,personal property,see andrus allard,d,and intangible property,see ruckelshaus monsanto,d.in this case,it is undisputed that the property interests huntleigh alleges were taken are,for purposes of the fifth amendment,cognizable property interests.
second,after having identified a valid property interest,the court must determine whether the government action at issue amounted to a compensable taking of that property interest.am.pelagic,at see also maritrans,at.a compensable taking can occur not only through the government physical invasion or appropriation of private property,see lucas,at.loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,d,but also by government regulations that unduly burden private property interests,see.coal mahon.
huntleigh argues that the court of federal claims erred in holding that atsa did not effect a taking of its security screening contracts and the going concern value and goodwill associated with its security screening business.huntleigh contends that its business relationships were not merely frustrated.it argues that atsa,by establishing the federal government as the only party allowed to perform security screening at national airports,specifically illegalized the subject matter of its contracts with the airlines.huntleigh distinguishes both omnia and air pegasus ii on the ground that the statute at issue in this case was far more direct in terms of its impact on huntleigh than the governmental actions in omnia and air pegasus ii were on the plaintiffs in those cases.omnia and air pegasus ii,huntleigh argues,involved governmental regulation applicable to one party that resulted in a loss to a third party.huntleigh asserts that atsa,by contrast,applied directly to the contracts between the airlines and huntleigh,by illegalizing their subject matter.huntleigh urges that monongahela navigation united states,nl industries,united states,and cienega gardens,compel the conclusion that atsa did effect a taking of its property.finally,huntleigh claims that the court of federal claims erred in its application of kimball laundry to the alleged taking of the going concern value and goodwill associated with its security screening business.
the government responds by asserting that omnia and air pegasus ii control the outcome of this case.the government notes that congress created the airlines obligation to screen passengers and baggage with the enactment of the air transportation security act and then eliminated that obligation with the enactment of atsa,mandating that the government assume the screening obligations formerly borne by the airlines.thus,the government posits,the statutory mandate focused upon airlines,not upon private contractors,such as huntleigh.the government states that,although atsa undoubtedly diminished the demand for huntleigh services and negatively impacted its business,such effects were indirect consequences of atsa regulating the airlines and thereby comprised mere frustration of huntleigh business interests.
the court of federal claims did not err in holding that huntleigh had failed to establish a fifth amendment taking of its property.huntleigh has conceded that the government did not actually assume its contracts.instead,the government engaged in the functions formerly performed by huntleigh under the contracts.thus,any takings claim can not be predicated upon a taking of the contracts.rather,the argument must be that atsa rendered the contracts and the going concern value and goodwill associated with huntleigh security screening business worthless.such a claim can not stand,however,in the face of omnia and air pegasus ii.
in omnia,the plaintiff omnia commercial omnia owned a contract entitling it to purchase a large quantity of steel plate from the allegheny steel company allegheny for an amount below the current market price.at.before any deliveries were made under the contract,however,the government,pursuant to statute and in order to meet needs caused by world war i,requisitioned allegheny entire production of steel plate for and directed it not to comply with its contract with omnia.id.in due course,omnia filed suit in the court of claims,alleging that the government actions with respect to allegheny and allegheny contract with omnia had effected a taking of omnia right to priority to the steel plate allegheny expected to produce.omnia alleged that the government had therefore appropriated for public use omnia property in the contract,causing omnia to suffer a large monetary loss as a consequence of its losing a lucrative contract.id.at.after the court of claims dismissed omnia complaint,omnia appealed to the supreme court.the supreme court affirmed the decision of the court of claims.id.at.the court started from the premise that omnia contract with allegheny was property within the meaning of the fifth amendment and that if the contract was taken for public use the government would be liable.id.at.the court held,however,that omnia contract with allegheny had not been taken 
in exercising the power to requisition,the government dealt only with the steel company,which company thereupon became liable to deliver its product to the government,by virtue of the statute and in response to the requisition order.as a result of this lawful governmental action the performance of the contract was rendered impossible.it was not appropriated,but ended.
in air pegasus ii,the plaintiff,air pegasus of,air pegasus operated a heliport at property it leased in washington,at.following the terrorist attacks of september,the federal aviation administration faa banned all commercial air travel within nautical miles of washington,except at a few select locations,such as ronald reagan washington national airport.id.as a consequence,air pegasus was effectively unable to continue the operation of its business.it thus abandoned its lease and ceased operations at the heliport.id.at.subsequently,air pegasus brought suit in the court of federal claims alleging that the faa flight ban had resulted in the regulatory taking of its heliport business.id.eventually,the court granted summary judgment in favor of the government and dismissed air pegasus complaint.air pegasus of,united states.the court did so after concluding that although the faa regulatory activity may have had an adverse impact on air pegasus heliport business,there was not a taking of any cognizable property interest of air pegasus.id.
on appeal,we affirmed the decision of the court of federal claims.air pegasus ii,at.noting that air pegasus did not own or operate any helicopters itself,we pointed out that air pegasus economic injury was not the result of the government taking air pegasus property,but the more attenuated result of the government purported taking of other people property.this circumstance does not form the basis for a viable takings claim.id.at.after comparing air pegasus takings claim to that of the plaintiff in omnia,we stated 
air pegasus,which did not itself own or operate any helicopters,does not allege that the faa restrictions regulated its operations under the lease.instead,air pegasus basically alleges that the faa,by regulating helicopters owned by third parties,frustrated its business expectations at the south capitol street heliport.therefore,like the appellant in omnia,air pegasus,while no doubt injured by reason of the government actions,has not alleged a taking of private property under the fifth amendment.
id.at emphasis in original.
as did the plaintiffs in omnia and air pegasus ii,huntleigh alleges that it suffered a loss of business as a result of the government regulation of a third party.the federal government imposed screening obligations upon commercial airlines in.with the enactment of atsa in,however,congress drastically reduced the demand for huntleigh services.atsa did not,however,regulate huntleigh directly.rather,it modified governmental regulation of the airlines,which resulted in adverse economic consequences for huntleigh.thus,any losses that huntleigh suffered were indirect,arising only as a consequence of atsa elimination of the airlines security screening obligations.in other words,atsa had the effect of frustrating huntleigh business expectations,which does not form the basis of a cognizable takings claim.see omnia,at.
as noted,huntleigh argues that omnia is distinguishable because,in that case,the government action was directed at a third party,allegheny,resulting in only an indirect impact on omnia.however,urges huntleigh,in this case atsa was directed squarely at providers of airport security screening functions,such as huntleigh,by nationalizing their operations.similarly,huntleigh maintains that air pegasus ii is distinguishable because any effect that the faa flight ban had on air pegasus,which owned neither the heliport nor the helicopters,was indirect,as it arose from governmental regulation of third parties.we are not persuaded by huntleigh efforts to distinguish omnia and air pegasus ii.as far as omnia is concerned,the facts of that case were more favorable to the plaintiff,omnia,than the facts of this case are to huntleigh.as seen,in omnia,the government actions were directed squarely at the contractual relationship tha
