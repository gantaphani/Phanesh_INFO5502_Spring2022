the jackson hole airport,which is managed and operated by the jackson hole airport board pursuant to a use agreement with the united states,is located in the state of wyoming,just inside the southern border of grand teton national park.vortex,which provides nonscheduled commercial aviation services pursuant to faa certification under parts,and of the faa regulations,pts,sought permission from the board to operate charter flights,including scenic tours,out of the airport.the board,however,expressed concerns about the act applicability to sightseeing flights out of the airport and the absence of an air tour management plan for the park as required by the act.vortex,in turn,sought clarification from the faa regarding the applicability of the act to its proposed sightseeing tours out of the airport.the nrdc challenges the faa letter responses to vortex inquiries.
in august and again in may,vortex applied to the board for permission to operate charter services,including scenic air tours,out of the airport.on may,the board approved vortex proposed operations,but on june,concerned that vortex scenic air tour operations would violate the act restrictions on sightseeing tours over national parks,the board rescinded its approval subject to vortex full compliance with the act.although vortex continued discussions with the board,claiming that vortex proposed flights were in compliance with the act and that,in any event,the board lacked the authority to prevent vortex operations,on july,the board issued a moratorium on the approval of all commercial scenic air tour operations out of the airport pending development of an air tour management plan or other conclusive determination that the proposed flights would not violate the act.
on june,vortex wrote to the faa seeking clarification as to the applicability of the act to vortex proposed air tour operations.in the letter,vortex described its proposed flights,stating that its scenic air tour operations will not be conducted over the park and emphasizing that it has never proposed flights over any portion of the p ark.except those portions that are necessary to fly over as a result to approach for a landing or for departure from takeoff.brackets in original.vortex asked the faa to respond to four questions 
does the act apply to the proposed scenic flights that vortex intends on performing at the jackson hole airport for flights conducted outside the park 
does the language in f a i,the minimum altitude provision and its takeoff and landing exception,ensure that those portions of flights that cross sections of the park for normal approach to landing and departure from takeoff are excluded from being considered a scenic air tour over the park when the final tour destination is,in fact,outside the park 
does the use agreement constitute the current conditions of scenic air tour overflights for the park until an air tour management plan is enacted and approved by the faa in the future for grand teton park 
if the above is the affirmative,does the park have the right to unilaterally change overflight rules in the absence of faa approval under the terms and conditions of the act do the current overflight rules of the park stay in place until the whole process as defined in the act take s place to enact a change from the existing rules contained in the use agreement.
on august,vortex wrote the faa again.informing the faa that the board had not lifted the moratorium,vortex asked for clarification of the board authority to enforce the act,and,stating that the board was using the geographic feature provision of the act,f a ii,to preclude vortex flights,vortex also sought the faa views on the meaning of geographic feature as used in the act and the effect under the act of flying within one mile of a geographic feature during takeoff and landing.on august,and october,the board also wrote the faa seeking its views on the meaning of geographic feature and laterally as used in the act,and inquiring as to the board authority under the act to control a flight route.
the faa responded to these questions in three letters.in the first letter,dated august,the faa responded,through donald byrne,the assistant chief counsel for the regulations division,to vortex first two questions,and concluded that the proposed flights would not violate the act.in the second letter,dated september,the faa,through nancy lobue,assistant chief counsel for airports and environmental law in the office of the chief counsel,addressed vortex third and fourth questions concerning the board authority to impose restrictions on sightseeing flights out of the airport,and declined to offer a definitive opinion.however,in the third letter,dated october,the faa,through byrne,offered an advisory opinion on the remaining questions presented by vortex and the board in their letters of august.
