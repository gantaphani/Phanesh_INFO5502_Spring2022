the federal transit administration fta,niagara frontier transit authority nfta,and new york state urban development corporation,doing business as the empire state development corporation esdc,appeal from judge skretny award of attorneys fees to appellee as a prevailing party under the national historic preservation act nhpa.we reverse the award against the nfta and the esdc because the nhpa does not apply to them.we hold that the fta is subject to an award of fees under the nhpa but remand for a recalculation of the award to limit it to work expended in obtaining the supplemental environmental impact statement seis.
background 
the full factual and procedural background to this case is set forth in the district court prior decisions,preservation coalition fta,d,and d.we outline here those facts relevant to a resolution of the issues on the present appeal.
a the project 
appellants fta,nfta and esdc were responsible for a development styled the inner harbor project.the project involved an area on buffalo waterfront that included the terminus of the historic erie canal.as participants in a joint project,some or all of the appellants were required under various federal and state laws to consider the project impact on historic resources and to implement plans to mitigate any harm to those resources.the esdc was the lead agency for environmental and historical review of the project.see preservation coalition,d at.however,the fta,although in many ways a passive participant in the project,was responsible for federal oversight and for the project compliance with all relevant federal regulations.see,the nhpa requires that t he head of any federal agency having direct or indirect jurisdiction over a proposed federal or federally assisted undertaking in any state and the head of any federal department or independent agency having authority to license any undertaking shall,prior to the approval of the expenditure of any federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the issuance of any license,as the case may be,take into account the effect of the undertaking on any district,site,building,structure,or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the national register.
the pertinent statutes are the national environmental policy act nepa,et,the national historic preservation act,et,and section f of the transportation act,c.nepa mandates that federal agencies use all practicable means,consistent with other essential considerations of national policy,to improve and coordinate federal plans,functions,programs,and resources to the end that the nation may preserve important historic,cultural,and natural aspects of our national heritage.b.
the regulations implementing the nhpa require agencies involved in projects such as the present one to consult with state historic preservation officers shpos,make reasonable and good faith efforts to identify historic properties,determine their eligibility for listing in the national register of historic places,and assess the effects of a project on such properties.this consultation process is commonly referred to as the section process after section of the nhpa.see.
under regulations implementing section f of the transportation act of,a transportation project that impacts a historic site can not be undertaken unless the agency shows that there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of the site and that it has done all possible planning to minimize harm to the site.see a.under the archeological exception to section f,these restrictions do not apply if the archeological resource is important chiefly because of what can be learned by data recovery and has minimal value for preservation in place.g.consultation with the shpo is also required as part of the section f process.see e.
because appellants were aware that the inner harbor project might impact historic resources,an archeological exploration of the site was commissioned to determine the likely extent of such resources.preservation coalition,d at.on december,following the completion of stage ii excavations of the inner harbor project site,the field services bureau of the state office of parks and recreation and historic preservation which serves as new york shpo concluded that the inner harbor project would have no adverse effect on any historic structures.the shpo finding of no adverse effect was premised in part on its conclusion that the section f archeology exception applied to historic resources at the project site.d at.significantly,the shpo qualified its conclusions upon the results of upcoming stage iii excavations.id.while the stage iii excavations continued,appellants issued a final environmental impact statement feis for the inner harbor project in february,and a record of decision rod the final document in the administrative issued on june.
the present dispute arose in may,after the issuance of the feis,when excavators discovered a roughly eight foot section of the eastern portion of the commercial slip w all of the erie canal terminus as rebuilt in the.id.at.on may,the shpo informed the esdc that the commercial slip wall met the criteria for listing in the national register of historic places,and on august,the shpo informed the esdc that it would not be feasible to preserve the wall in an exposed condition.as an alternative to exposed preservation,the shpo recommended that the esdc conduct a detailed documentation of the wall,rebury it,and provide appropriate historical interpretation of the wall through marking and signage in the project design.
on october,appellee brought the present complaint,asserting claims under the nhpa,nepa,and section f of the transportation act.the complaint alleged that construction at the inner harbor project site threatened the historic commercial slip wall of the erie canal terminus and that appellants had violated various federal and state laws requiring both consideration of the impact of the inner harbor project on historic resources and planning to mitigate harm to those resources.
one of appellee principal claims was that the feis prepared by the appellants in february,was inadequate because it failed to account for the subsequently discovered historic commercial slip wall in may.see compl,at.appellee sought an injunction against appellants from further construction until they had fully complied with various environmental and historic preservation laws and regulations,including the nepa,nhpa and section f with regard to the commercial slip wall,and a writ of mandamus requiring appellants to prepare an eis or seis satisfying the requirements of these statutes.see compl.e,f,at.although the district court declined to issue an injunction,it found the feis inadequate and,on march,ordered appellants to prepare a seis to address the issues raised by the discovery of the commercial slip wall.see preservation coalition,d at see also id.at this court finds that subsequent developments implicated significant issues in a way that was not adequately addressed in the feis.the district court also threatened appellants with an injunction if the seis was not prepared expeditiously.id.at.
about three months after the district court ruling and after publication of a draft final seis was never agreed to halt all work at the inner harbor project site for sixty days to consider revisions to the project in line with the appellee concerns.six months later,on december,the parties appeared before the district court with a settlement agreement embodied in a proposed stipulation and order.
the stipulation reflected an agreement among the parties that the inner harbor project should include the commercial slip wall and other historic structures.the order,signed by judge skretny,dismissed appellee claims with prejudice and vacated the district court prior orders.however,the stipulation obligated appellants to start the environmental and historical review process from scratch,including compliance with the relevant statutes.appellants therefore had to produce a new feis for the project,while appellee retained the right to bring new claims if it determined that the new feis violated federal law.the new feis would not,however,be subject to the timetable set out by the district court in its prior orders,because the order had vacated them.
the last provision of the stipulation and order addressed the question of costs and attorneys fees 
stipulated and agreed that the plaintiff,appellee shall submit its request for attorney fees and costs pursuant to the national historic preservation act,w to the court by motion within days after the entry of this stipulation and order and defendants shall respond thereto in accordance with a scheduling order to be issued by the court.

discussion 
appellants argue on appeal that appellee can not recover attorneys fees and costs because it is not a prevailing party as defined by the supreme court in buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health and human resources,d.appellants also argue that even if we were to determine that appellee had substantially prevailed,it could not recover under the nhpa because the relief relief available exclusively under the nepa,not nhpa.thus,appellants contend,if appellee is entitled to fees,it must seek them under the equal access to justice act eaja see.nfta and esdc argue in addition that they can not be liable for attorneys fees under the nhpa because they are not federal agencies.
appellee counters that the seis satisfies buckhannon because it worked a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties and that the award of fees under the nhpa was appropriate because the issues to be addressed in the seis were related wholly to the nhpa.see preservation coalition,d at requiring seis to address four issues related to the commercial slip wall as well as the coalition proposals to incorporate the wall into final project see also preservation coalition,slip op.at june,decision and order preservation coalition brought the present action to enforce the provisions of nhpa.it invoked nepa and f as a means of insuring that defendants adequately consider the impact of the inner harbor project on resources that it alleged were protected under nhpa to hold that plaintiff is not entitled to attorney fees under nhpa because it prevailed on a claim under nepa rather than a claim directly under nhpa would elevate form over substance.this case was not about water or air quality,noise pollution,traffic congestion or any of the multifarious components of the environment that nepa is meant to protect.it was about historic resources.appellee also argues that the nfta and esdc can be liable under the nhpa as actors because the provisions of federal statutes reach actors who are found to have violated federal law.

a prevailing party status under buckhannon 
the nhpa authorizes awards of attorneys fees,expert witness fees,and other costs to any person who substantially prevails in an action to enforce the provisions of the nhpa.when preservation coalition brought this action,whether a plaintiff was a prevailing party or had substantially prevailed turned in this circuit upon application of the catalyst theory of recovery.see union of needletrades,indus.textile employees unite ins,cir citing cases.under the catalyst theory,a court could award attorneys fees based solely upon a private agreement among the parties settling their dispute,even though no legal relief such as a consent decree had been obtained.see buckhannon,at.noting that under catalyst theory,a plaintiff was considered a prevailing party if its lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in defendant conduct.under the catalyst theory,therefore,appellee would have been considered a prevailing party and entitled to all fees and costs associated with the litigation that resulted in the settlement agreement.
in buckhannon,however,the supreme court rejected the catalyst theory and held that the term prevailing party required a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties or a court ordered chang e in the legal relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant.at.quoting.state teachers ass garland indep.school,d alterations in buckhannon.as examples of the types of actions that would convey the necessary judicial imprimatur or sanction,the court offered settlement agreements enforced through consent decrees and judgments on the merits.buckhannon,at.as examples of the types of actions that would not convey the necessary imprimatur,the court offered successful results obtained through private settlement agreements,victories such as surviving a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,prevailing over a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,or receiving an interlocutory ruling that reversed a dismissal for failure to state a claim.see id.at.in buckhannon itself,legislative judicial the plaintiff the desired relief and mooted the underlying claims.id.at.
we agree with appellants that,under was decided after the settlement was is not entitled to recover the fees and costs associated with obtaining the stipulation and order that dismissed the case with prejudice.the effect of the stipulation and order was to vacate the district court orders providing for ongoing judicial involvement and to begin the environmental review process anew.this stipulation and order is functionally a private settlement agreement that the supreme court concluded does not provide prevailing party status to a plaintiff because,by its own terms,it eliminated the ongoing judicial oversight in favor of restarting the review process from scratch.see id.at.
however,a very different issue is presented by the question of whether appellee is entitled to recover for the fees and costs associated with obtaining the seis.see preservation coalition,d at.appellee contends that the ordering of the seis constitutes a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties,at.quoting garland,at,sufficient to confer prevailing party status under buckhannon.appellants argue that the seis was little more than interlocutory relief unaccompanied by an enforceable final judgment or a consent decree and therefore lacked the finality necessary for prevailing party status.brief for appellant fta at.
after buckhannon,courts have split on the kinds of judicial actions that confer prevailing party status.the eighth circuit has interpreted buckhannon narrowly and held that a plaintiff is a prevailing party only if it receives either an enforceable judgment on the merits or a consent degree.christina,at.the first circuit,by contrast,has interpreted buckhannon more broadly and focused on the materiality of a judicial outcome and whether the result is purely procedural or whether it actually accomplishes something substantive for the winning party.me.sch.admin.dist.v,cir citations omitted.the first circuit decision also observed that when interlocutory orders confer substantive relief they have often been viewed as sufficient to carry the weight of a fee award.id.at.
