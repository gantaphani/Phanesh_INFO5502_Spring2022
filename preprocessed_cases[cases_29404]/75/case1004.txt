aerolineas argentinas petitions for review of an order of the department of transportation dot conditioning the airline permit to provide air transportation to and from the united states upon its paying into escrow the difference between what it actually pays in user charges at buenos aires ezeiza airport and the higher amounts that united states carriers are required to pay at that airport.aerolineas acknowledges that it is paying user charges for international flights that are roughly one third of what united states carriers are being charged,but it argues that because the disparity stems not from any intentional discrimination on the part of the government of argentina,but rather from conflicting argentine judicial decisions,the dot abused its discretion by treating the discrepancy as an unreasonable discriminatory practice against the united states carriers within the condemnation of the international air transportation fair competitive practices act,c a.in any event,argues aerolineas,because neither the argentine congress nor the executive can control the decisions of the argentine judiciary,the dot countermeasure will not eliminate the difference and was therefore arbitrary and capricious in violation of the administrative procedure act.
for its part,the dot argues first that deprives the court of jurisdiction to review the challenged order because it comes within the exception to reviewability for orders relat ing to a foreign air carrier and subject to disapproval by the president.on the merits,the dot argues the order was within its authority under and easily withstands the deferential review called for under the apa.
because the dot order is no longer subject to the president disapproval,we hold the court has jurisdiction to entertain aerolineas petition,which we deny on its merits.
background 
in early the government of argentina delinked its peso from the dollar,whereupon the value of the peso quickly fell to about cents.in an attempt to mitigate the ensuing panic,the argentine congress passed a law requiring that public service tariffs,including airport user fees,which were formerly denominated in dollars,be paid in pesos as though each peso were still worth,that is,at a rate.the argentine executive,however,issued a decree purporting to supersede that law and requiring that airport user charges for international landing,parking,and air traffic buenos aires international airport aeropuerto internacional ministro pistarini de ezeiza,or ezeiza be paid in dollars at the floating exchange rate of roughly.
several airlines challenged the constitutionality of the decree in the argentine courts,and it is the divergent results of those actions that gave rise to this case.first,aerolineas obtained a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the decree,thereby allowing it to pay the airport charges at the rate.then carriers from the united states and other foreign countries sought,but were denied,the same relief in a different argentine court.as a result,since september aerolineas has been paying user charges at ezeiza that are roughly one third of what the united states carriers must pay for the same services.
four united states carriers filed complaints with the dot pursuant to d.the discrepancy in charges,they argued,put the government of argentina in violation of its bilateral agreement with the united states that a irlines shall not be required to pay charges higher than those paid by the airlines of the other party,air transport services agreement between the governments of the united states of america and the republic of argentina,and therefore constituted an unreasonable discriminatory practice against the united states carriers,c a.the dot agreed,concluding the imposition of higher fees at ezeiza airport on carriers than those paid by aerolineas argentinas constitutes,on its face,the type of activity that was intended to reach.after diplomatic efforts to avoid a confrontation failed,the dot imposed a countermeasure aerolineas permit to operate in the united states was conditioned upon the airline depositing in an escrow account in the united states the difference,for each of its international flights landing at ezeiza,between the user fee it pays and the fee that united states carriers pay there.
shortly thereafter aerolineas moved the dot to stay its order because an appellate court in argentina had modified the preliminary injunction granted in its favor and required the carrier to pay the same difference that is,two pesos on the dollar into an escrow account in argentina pending final resolution on the merits of its constitutional challenge to the decree.the dot refused to stay its order because aerolineas had appealed the modification to the supreme court of argentina and,in the meantime,was not making escrow payments in argentina.aerolineas then petitioned this court for review of the dot order.
ii.analysis 
aerolineas argues first that conflicting decisions by the courts of argentina do not amount to a discriminatory,predatory,or anticompetitive practice by the government of argentina against the united states carriers within the meaning of c a and,in any event,the dot countermeasure should be set aside as arbitrary and capricious,because in argentina,as here,neither the congress nor the executive can dictate the decisions of the judiciary.before turning to those contentions,however,we must address the dot objection that we are without jurisdiction to review the order.
jurisdiction 
under,the secretary of transportation was required to submit his order to the president for review as a decision to amend a permit authorizing a foreign air carrier to provide foreign air transportation.under that section 
the president may disapprove the decision of the secretary only if the reason for disapproval is based on foreign relations or national defense considerations that are under the jurisdiction of the president.the president may not disapprove if the reason is economic a decision of the secretary 
a takes effect as a decision of the secretary if the president does not disapprove the decision not later than days after the decision is submitted to the president and b when effective,may be reviewed judicially under section 
section makes reviewable in this court any order of the department of transportation e xcept for an order related to a foreign air carrier subject to disapproval by the president under section.
the dot argues its order to aerolineas comes within the exception in and is therefore unreviewable.aerolineas responds as follows the dot decision was economic,and because the president may not disapprove economic decisions the order was not subject to disapproval by the president and even if the order was initially subject to disapproval by the president,because he did not disapprove it within the days provided therefor,and the order has since take n effect as a decision of the secretary that is no longer subject to presidential disapproval,it is now subject to judicial review.
aerolineas first argument is really a conclusion,for which it offers no support whatsoever.we reject it in kind.
aerolineas second argument gains traction from south african airways dole,in which we considered the predecessor to,and concluded that if a dot action is not disapproved by the president,then it shall take effect as an action of the dot,not of the president,and as such shall be subject to judicial review as provided in section of this appendix.app.a.
the dot points out that differed from the current in that it excepted from judicial review any order relating to a foreign air carrier subject to the approval not the disapproval of the president the order at issue in that case was by statute made subject only to the disapproval of the president,and we therefore concluded it was not within the exception to judicial review.at.because the order under review in this case was subject to the disapproval of the president,pursuant to the exception in,the dot argues the result in this case should be different.the dot fails to appreciate,however,that in the prior case we went on to explain that even if we were to equate subject to approval wi
