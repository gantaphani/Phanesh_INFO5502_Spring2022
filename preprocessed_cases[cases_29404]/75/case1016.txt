background 
on august,after several months of negotiation and years of disputes with the faa,several thousand air traffic controllers who were members of the patco went on strike from their jobs with the federal government.in response,president reagan demanded that they return to work within hours or risk losing their jobs.over controllers refused to do so,so president reagan fired them and banned them from returning to work at the faa.more than twelve years later,on august,the lifetime ban was lifted.shortly thereafter,the faa issued the recruitment notice.
the notice formally alerted former patco controllers that they were eligible for reinstatement at the faa and provided them a specific avenue to apply.controller positions,the notice stated,would be filled as vacancies occurred and,although the faa expected to add only a few controllers from various sources over the next few years by the notice it was establishing an inventory of applicants who have reinstatement and transfer eligibility.id.according to the notice,applicants would be initially hired at the grade level,with a corresponding salary of between and.internal faa documents explained that hiring would take place at the level because the former patco controllers would need modified training to learn new air traffic control systems they further explained that a controller salary within that range would be based on his penultimate salary at the time he was fired.advancement above the grade level,the notice declared,would be based upon successful completion of training certification requirements for the next higher grade and applicable requirements.id.
the appellants are current and retired former patco controllers who were hired by the faa between and pursuant to the recruitment notice in,they brought suit under the apa to challenge as arbitrary and capricious the faa decision to disregard their prior highest pay grades and performance steps upon their reemployment with the faa from to.appellants br.at.they claim that the faa should have hired them at their prior,and at the appropriate accompanying salary and not at the level and at a salary within its range.
in the district court,the faa moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that the appellants claims were time barred,that they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and that they had failed to state a claim.concluding that the recruitment notice constituted the final agency action under the apa,the court held that the appellants did not meet the statute of limitations because their claims were not filed until.the court also rejected the appellants claim that their claims did not become ripe for review until the faa hired them beginning in,believing that their apa claim was ripe for review in.
on appeal,the appellants argue that the district court erred in two ways.first,they claim that the recruitment notice could not constitute final agency action because the faa hiring process was incomplete and because the notice had no immediate impact on them until they were hired.second,they renew their claim that even if the notice was a final agency action,the apa statute of limitations did not,and could not,begin to run until their claim became ripe for judicial review,which they contend was not until they were hired beginning in.the faa counters that the district court conclusions were correct,but that even if they were not,this court should affirm the dismissal on other grounds,including the appellants failed to show that they were aggrieved they had alternative remedies and thus no cause of action under the apa they failed to exhaust their alternative administrative remedies and they failed to show that the faa decision to hire former patco controllers at the level as opposed to their prior grade levels was arbitrary or capricious.
ii.discussion 
section of the apa provides for judicial review of final agency action.unless another statute prescribes otherwise,a suit challenging final agency action pursuant to section must be commenced within six years after the right of action first accrues.a sendra magaw.the right of action first accrues on the date of the final agency action.see impro,block,in this case,where no formal review procedures existed,the cause of action accrued when the agency action occurred.
the appellants first contend that the district court erred because the recruitment notice did not constitute final agency action.the united states supreme court explained in bennett spear,d,that 
a s a general matter,two conditions must be satisfied for agency action to be final first,the action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process,chicago southern air lines,waterman.it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.and second,the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow,port of boston marine terminal rederiaktiebolaget transatlantic,d.
see domestic,sec.the appellants contend that the recruitment notice fails on both counts.with regard to the first condition,they make two arguments.first,relying on fourth branch assocs.mechanicville ferc,they claim that the notice manifested only the faa future intent to hire former patco controllers.second,they contend that the faa was still formulating its hiring process with regard to former patco controllers after publication of the notice and that the faa subsequently modified its policies in when it allowed former patco controllers who were employed by dod to transfer to the faa and maintain their dod grade levels.
neither argument holds water.in fourth branch,we rejected the petitioner argument that ferc decision to initiate a surrender proceeding in which ferc explicitly stated that it had made no final decision regarding the outcome of the proceeding constituted a final agency action.at.in contrast,while the notice here qualified the date,if ever,on which a former patco controller might be hired stating that the faa expects to fill only a small number of controller positions from a variety of sources over the next few years,that employment opportunities are limited and that it was therefore establishing an inventory of applicants who have reinstatement and transfer eligibility,it stated categorically that,when such hiring occurred pursuant to the notice,it would be at the grade level and at a corresponding salary that declaration constitutes an unequivocal statement of the agency position sufficient to meet the first requisite for final agency action.reliable automatic sprinkler consumer prod.safety comm n.
the appellants also claim that,even if the notice itself was initially definitive wi
