peter mailloux mailloux filed an administrative complaint against r b transportation,llc r b,and its owner,paul beaudry beaudry collectively petitioners,alleging that mailloux was unlawfully discharged from his job as a commercial trucker for his adherence to federal safety standards.mailloux sought relief under the employee protection provisions of section of the surface transportation assistance act of the staa,a final decision and order of the department of labor administrative review board arb determined that mailloux termination violated the staa,and awarded backpay and other expenses.after careful review,we deny the petition.
mailloux employment 
beaudry owns two trucking companies,r b and beaudry enterprises.he also bat express,a third trucking company.these three entities share office space and drivers.neither beaudry enterprises nor bat express is a party to this case.
in,petitioners hired mailloux as a driver of a commercial motor carrier,an truck,to deliver loads on routes between new england and florida during the scope of his employment through december,mailloux reported to heather bagley bagley,who was beaudry administrative assistant,that it was not possible to make various deliveries on time without violating the federal motor carrier safety act,the department of transportation dot hours of service regulation the driving regulation,which restricts the number of hours drivers of commercial motor vehicles may work over a certain period of time.see b bagley informed mailloux that the deliveries had already been scheduled and could not be changed.
on december,mailloux called beaudry home to inform beaudry that he was unable to make a particular delivery from florida on time both because he had a flat tire and because he had already driven the maximum allowable number of hours under the driving regulation.during this conversation,beaudry told mailloux to return the truck to r b facility in new hampshire and beaudry would inquire about arranging for mailloux to be transported back to florida.mailloux responded,i guess that means i fired.beaudry said only get the truck back up here before the conversation ended.when mailloux later spoke with a fellow r b driver,the driver told mailloux yeah,you fired.
osha investigation and testimony before the alj 
on december,mailloux contacted the department of labor occupational safety and health administration osha to report that he would soon be discharged from r b and wanted to speak to someone.the following day,mailloux was,according to the alj,discharged.
later,on december,mailloux met with christine kidder kidder,an osha investigator,and told her that during his employment with r b he was continually required to drive in excess of the driving regulation.during this interview,mailloux informed kidder that he routinely falsified his driving logs for r b in order to provide the appearance that he was in compliance with the driving regulation.
after this initial interview with mailloux,osha conducted an investigation of r b,including an interview with beaudry.when kidder contacted beaudry,he informed her that he had fired mailloux due to his inability to properly plan his trips,which were costing the company time and money.during this interview,kidder inquired whether r b followed the driving regulation.beaudry represented that he had never violated the driving regulation.later,during the alj hearing,beaudry testified that r b submits written notices to drivers whose driving logs are false or violate the driving regulation.beaudry further testified that he submitted such notices to mailloux and ultimately fired him because he was driving in excess of the maximum hours allowable by the driving regulation.
following her interview with beaudry,kidder contacted the dot federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and obtained compliance reviews and enforcement reports relating to r b the dot reports.these reviews and reports are the investigative reports prepared by an agent who visits a company to determine whether they are in compliance with the driving regulation.based on an audit the fmcsa conducted of r b and on kidder own review of the dot reports,kidder learned that beaudry and all three of the companies in which he had an interest had previously been cited for violating the driving regulation the most recent dot report,dated april,showed r b violations of the driving regulation,as well as other dot regulations,for the period august,to february,a time frame that included mailloux employment.additionally,past dot reports showed that r b and the other two trucking companies in which beaudry had an interest had previously been cited for violations on september,january,and june.petitioners paid civil penalties associated with some of these violations.
as part of kidder investigation,she also interviewed bagley,who informed her that r b drivers routinely violated the driving regulation because they often could not otherwise complete their trips on time.bagley stated that drivers would complain to her about driving in excess of the regulation,and the company consequently experienced high turnover.bagley later testified to the alj in a deposition that when she hired drivers and they inquired about compliance with the driving regulation,she would tell them that the company complied with the regulation,even though she knew beaudry would soon have them driving in excess of it.bagley also testified to the alj that trish patrick,beaudry daughter and employee,instructed bagley to separate toll receipts from a truck driver time log when they did not match in order to conceal violations of the driving regulation.
scott hill hill,another r b driver,testified about his experience working for petitioners.like mailloux,hill worked for r b from august until december.hill testified that,during his employment with petitioners,he consistently made deliveries in excess of the driving regulation.hill stated that he falsified his driving logs to make it appear as if he were driving within the legal limitations.hill further testified that beaudry met with him about his violations,and used mapquest to illustrate how a driver could make his deliveries on time and still comply with the driving regulation.hill also testified that beaudry suggested that when hill was driving in florida he could log his driving hours as a local delivery,even though it was an interstate one.hill additionally testified that he brought up the driving regulation issue with beaudry.hill stated he told beaudry at one point that he needed a break,i got to slow down,i want to run legal,and that beaudry responded that he had other drivers that will run.hill testified that he stopped working for r b on december,because he was exhausted.
ii.procedural history 
osha findings and petitioners appeal 
on january,osha issued its findings.osha determined that petitioners violated the staa by discharging mailloux after his complaint to petitioners regarding his work hours.osha ordered petitioners to pay mailloux back wages from december,through february,the date on which he commenced his new employment.
the same day osha issued its findings,petitioners appealed osha order to the alj.petitioners argued that mailloux was terminated for performing poorly,violating the driving regulation,and failing to communicate with the company dispatcher in a timely manner.
alj recommended decision and order 
following a hearing,the alj issued a recommended decision and order on june.the alj observed that the dot reports revealed that r b violations of the driving regulation existed before,during,and after mailloux employment with the company.the alj noted that the dot reports suggested a pattern of violations associated with r b operations.additionally,the alj relied on these records and other evidence to find that mailloux was terminated in violation of the staa.the alj concluded that mailloux was entitled to relief,which included reinstatement and compensatory damages,such as back pay,pursuant to b a because mailloux was not seeking reinstatement,the alj granted him back pay from december,the date of his termination,to february,when he obtained new employment,as well as travel expenses associated with the litigation.the alj order suggested that petitioners compensate mailloux in the amount of plus interest for back pay and for reimbursed travel expenses.pursuant to a,the alj recommendation was automatically forwarded for review to the arb.
arb final decision and order 
on june,the arb issued its final decision and order.the arb affirmed the recommendation by the alj and ruled that mailloux had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that he had engaged in a protected activity when mailloux informed beaudry during the december,telephone conversation that mailloux could not complete the delivery then assigned to him without violating the driving regulation,that r b was aware of the protected activity,and that r b took an adverse employment action the december,termination against mailloux because of it.
the arb held that substantial evidence on the record supported the alj factual findings,and that those findings were conclusive.the arb also held that the alj did not abuse its discretion in admitting the dot reports to which kidder and a dot representative testified,and that these reports were reliable indicators of r b actual violations of the driving regulation.additionally,the arb found that there was substantial evidence to support the alj finding that r b required its drivers to drive in excess of the driving regulation and that its drivers were not disciplined for hours of service violations.furthermore,the arb found substantial evidence in the record,including the fact that beaudry did not have mailloux driver log record indicating a violation of the driving regulation at the time he terminated him,to support the alj finding of a causal connection between mailloux protected activity and his termination.
petitioners had also argued that the alj erred in calculating mailloux daily average wage rate with r b,asserting that mailloux actual start date was august,which,if used instead of august,would reduce his award for the period during which he was unemployed because it would increase the total number of days he worked and thus decrease his daily average wage rate.nevertheless,because the arb found that r b did not properly raise this issue before the alj,the arb declined to consider the issue on appeal and affirmed the recommended award.
petition for judicial review 
in august,r b and beaudry timely petitioned this court to review the arb final decision and order.petitioners petition raises three issues.they argue that evidence that r b and other trucking companies owned by beaudry had violated dot regulations was improperly admitted by the alj into evidence the arb erroneously upheld the alj decision that a causal connection existed between mailloux protected activity and the adverse employment action against him and the arb erred in finding that substantial evidence existed in the record to justify the alj decision regarding back pay.
iii.discussion 
we review the arb final decision in accordance with the dictates of the administrative procedure act,et clean harbors envtl,herman,cir.the arb decision must be affirmed unless its legal conclusions are arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise not in accordance with law,or its factual conclusions are unsupported by substantial evidence.see also the reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law or e unsupported by substantial evidence.substantial evidence is more than a scintilla,and must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.bsp trans,united states dep t of labor,cir quoting nlrb columbian enameling stamping,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
b.the dot reports 
since whether the arb properly affirmed the alj decision to admit the dot reports is an evidentiary ruling,we review it for abuse of discretion.see,united states richardson,cir curtin office of pers,cir see also barker admin.review,fed.appx,cir an alj is granted broad discretion to make evidentiary determinations.an abuse of discretion occurs when a relevant factor deserving significant weight is overlooked,or when an improper factor is accorded significant weight,or when the court considers the appropriate mix of factors,but commits a palpable error of judgment in calibrating the decisional scales.united states decicco,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.
ii.legal framework 
the federal rules of evidence do not apply in apa proceedings.instead,the rules of evidence in administrative hearings before an alj provide,in part,that 
e vidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.it may,however,be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident.
b emphasis added.these rules of evidence also provide the following hearsay exception,concerning p ublic records and reports records,reports,statements,or data compilations,in any form,of public offices or agencies,setting forth f actual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law,unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.a.
iii.analysis 
the arb held that the alj did not abuse its discretion in admitting the dot reports,considering them within the p ublic records and reports hearsay exception and only to the extent that they reflect r b knowledge of its obligations pursuant to the hours of service regulations.petitioners argue that the alj improperly relied on the dot reports as highly prejudicial character evidence that showed,besides r b knowledge of its legal obligations,which petitioners claim was undisputed,that r b was acting in conformity with its past violations of the driving regulation.respondent counters that the dot reports were properly admitted as p ublic records and reports and to show beaudry motive and knowledge in terminating mailloux employment.
first,petitioners do not dispute that the dot reports are f actual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law.petitioners do contend,however,that the dot reports indicate lack of trustworthiness.in making this claim,petitioners cite to a new jersey superior court case from that quotes a opinion from the fifth circuit stating that osha citations are the opinions of investigators and ordinarily do not carry with them the indicia of reliability that is inherent in government adopted safety standards.millison du pont de nemours,alteration in original quoting dixon int l harvester,cir.in any event,as the arb observed,r b paid the penalties imposed by the dot as a result of the admitted reports,the terms of which explicitly stated that such payments constitute admission of the violation s.these admissions bolstered the trustworthiness of the dot reports,supporting the alj consideration of the reports as being within its discretion 
second,beaudry knowledge in discharging mailloux is,as discussed in part,relevant to the instant case.the dot reports suggested that beaudry knew or should have known of the driving regulation and r b failure to comply with it in the past.the dot reports indicated that beaudry knew or should have known he was not telling the truth when he told kidder that he had never violated the driving regulation,which undermined his credibility when testifying.the ninth circuit has observed that,w hen offered to prove knowledge,the prior act need not be similar to the charged act as long as the prior act was one which would tend to make the existence of the defendant knowledge more probable than it would be without the evidence.united states,cir.here,the prior acts of petitioners were their violations of the driving regulation.these acts would certainly be relevant as tending to show that petitioners were aware of their obligations under the driving regulation,that their employees
