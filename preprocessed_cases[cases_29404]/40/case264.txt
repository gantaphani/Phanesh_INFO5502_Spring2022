a judge and a jury,between them,rejected all of the multitude of employment claims john uphoff figueroa,an environmental attorney,brought against his employer,the puerto rico electric power authority prepa and at least seven prepa officials.his basic theory,dressed in many garbs,was that the new popular democratic party pdp regime discriminated against him by denying him a permanent appointment as the administrator of prepa environmental law office and by creating hostile working conditions because he was a member of the new progressive party npp.he alleges the npp regime then retaliated against him after he filed a federal lawsuit in.we find no merit to his claims and affirm.
we hold as a matter of law under branti finkel,d,and its progeny that the position of administrator is not within first amendment protection because it is a policy position.prepa officials could have considered political affiliation when deciding whether to give uphoff the permanent position.once again we remind litigants that political discrimination and retaliation claims under the first amendment can not be restated as claims under the equal protection clause.and we hold that uphoff did not state a claim under the fair labor standards act flsa because he did not allege he was involved in activity.
uphoff suit,as amended in,brought first amendment and equal protection political discrimination claims first amendment retaliation claims flsa retaliation claims,a title vii retaliation claims,a civil rights conspiracy claims,and state constitutional and statutory claims he sued prepa two of his supervisors,hector alejandro navarez and nitza vazquez rodriguez and other prepa officials

uphoff appeals the court dismissal of his claims on the pleadings,its grants of judgment as a matter of law,the jury instructions and verdict form,and the court denial of his motion for a new trial or to amend the verdict.we affirm.
in,uphoff started as principal environmental attorney at prepa,a position just below the position of administrator of the environmental office.he handled the office more complex cases.just before the elections,he was temporarily appointed the administrator of the office.
after the pdp took power in the elections,two pdp members,defendants hector alejandro and nitza vazquez,became uphoff supervisors.the environmental law office was moved to alejandro directorate in september.in june,alejandro appointed vazquez as administrator without allowing uphoff to apply for the permanent position uphoff returned to being the principal attorney.alejandro was promoted in september and no longer supervised uphoff or vazquez.
uphoff apparently claimed that alejandro and vazquez began a campaign to mistreat him because he was an npp member he testified that they excluded him from meetings,blocked him from attending professional seminars,reduced his workload and responsibilities,and maligned him to other employees,destroying his relationships with his colleagues.
before he became uphoff supervisor,alejandro directorate often consulted the environmental law office,and alejandro and uphoff worked together.in early,uphoff and alejandro already began disagreeing over how to handle several cases.alejandro testified that uphoff did not obtain approval before improperly awarding a million contract,failed to timely negotiate a contract,and failed to send documents to federal authorities upon request.
uphoff,in turn,asserted that alejandro and vazquez limited his autonomy at work.they ordered him to arrive promptly at the start of business,uphoff sometimes credited hours he worked late to morning hours on his time sheet without obtaining prior permission to do so,as prepa regulations required.alejandro and vazquez ordered him to accurately report his arrival time.once alejandro refused to sign a time sheet,after uphoff missed a conference call about a federal regulatory matter but reported on his sheet that he had arrived at 
uphoff also testified that alejandro and vazquez denied him vacation leave.vazquez and alejandro testified,however,that in prepa began requiring all executive and managerial personnel to accept payment for vacation time in excess of hours and that uphoff refused to comply.
uphoff claimed that his immediate supervisor,nitza vazquez,tried to isolate him.in late vazquez prevented uphoff secretary from using a computer to edit uphoff work.vazquez also changed the locks to the environmental law office then on the sixth floor for security reasons.uphoff claimed he was the only attorney not given a key vazquez,alejandro,and other employees,however,testified that no attorneys were given keys.when the office later moved to the seventh floor,all attorneys,including uphoff,were given keys.
uphoff testified that his position as principal attorney eroded in and.as principal attorney,uphoff was accustomed to having a larger office than the other lawyers.when the environmental law office moved floors in,uphoff tried to claim the office but was told it would become a conference room.he was left to choose among five identical,small offices designated for attorneys.
in prepa instituted an reclassification plan,based on recommendations by an outside consultant,which made uphoff and all the attorneys senior attorneys.the other attorneys received raises to match uphoff salary uphoff received no raise.several of his colleagues received promotions even before the reclassification plan the defendants offered nondiscriminatory reasons for those promotions.
uphoff attempted to tie all these incidents to political animus.he showed that alejandro,vazquez,and a few of the other individual defendants were pdp members but had little evidence they felt animosity toward npp members.his secretary testified that alejandro had told her the executive director of the agency was pressuring him to oust uphoff.uphoff also testified that alejandro had said he,alejandro,had experienced real discrimination when the npp was in power.
the defendants denied that uphoff was mistreated and that his political affiliation made any difference.vazquez testified that she gave uphoff many complex cases and that she and alejandro let uphoff attend appropriate meetings and seminars.she explained that she only stripped him of cases after he failed to execute assignments.alejandro admitted telling uphoff and others that uphoff was machiavellic,after a particular incident in which he disapproved of what uphoff had done.otherwise,alejandro,vazquez,and other employees denied that uphoff supervisors undermined his work relationships.
alejandro and vazquez testified that tensions arose because uphoff was insubordinate,displayed a bad attitude,and often lost his temper.they also testified that uphoff never respected nitza vazquez authority over him as the administrator,and uphoff did not properly complete assignments that vazquez assigned him.alejandro testified that uphoff did not work well with supervisors,colleagues,or state and federal agencies.
a.the district court properly dismissed several of uphoff claims under rule b 
uphoff appeals the district court dismissal under rule b of his first amendment discrimination claim based on his removal as administrator his flsa,title vii,and civil rights conspiracy claims and his first amendment retaliation claim against all defendants except alejandro and vazquez 
we review a district court decision dismissing claims under rule b de novo,accepting as true all facts in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.sutliffe epping sch,cir.a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.id.quoting ashcroft iqbal,d internal quotation marks omitted.w e may affirm on any basis apparent in the record.id.
uphoff stated no first amendment political discrimination claim as to the position of administrator 
when a position is one for which political affiliation may be considered is a question of law for the courts.flynn city of boston,cir.whether or not alejandro considered political affiliation when he replaced uphoff with vazquez as administrator,political affiliation was a permissible consideration for that position.
the first amendment does not bar public employers from considering political affiliation for positions for which political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for effective performance.galloza foy,cir quoting branti,at.the supreme court crafted this policymaking or exception because political officials must be able to hire staff who will help them execute their policy so effectuate voters wishes.id.
uphoff was not dismissed from,but rather was not appointed to,the permanent administrator position.we have regularly upheld even the dismissal on political grounds of officials or employees who are significantly connected to,either as policymakers or by working closely with policymakers.flynn,at.the official may be a subordinate and need not be the ultimate decisionmaker in the agency it is enough that the official is involved in policy,even if only as an adviser,implementer,or spokesperson.id.at internal citation omitted 
actual functions of the job,not titles,control,and an official description of job functions is a presumptively reliable basis for determining those functions.olmeda,cir internal citation omitted 
the job description says the duty of the administrator of the environmental law office is to develop and formulate prepa legal strategy for all environmental law issues and cases and advise the legal advisor office about that strategy.the administrator implements prepa policies by directing how the agency litigates and resolves cases.candidates must have e xtensive knowledge of the general policy of the authority.
also telling is that the administrator is subject only to general supervision and must exercise a high degree of independent judgment.the administrator meets with other prepa officers and state and federal agencies,serves on relevant committees,and coordinates with other departments.and candidates must have a law degree,a license to practice,and experience practicing environmental law.
in short,prepa relies on the administrator to develop,understand,and execute its goals.those policy goals may change with different administrations,and political affiliation is a relevant consideration 
uphoff stated no flsa retaliation claim against the defendants 
the flsa regulates certain adult employees minimum wages and maximum hours.see.uphoff amended complaint purported to sue under a,which prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to the flsa.plaintiffs must prove that they engaged in statutorily protected activity and that their employers afterward took adverse employment action against them as a reprisal for having engaged in the protected activity.becton dickinson caribe,cir.
uphoff pled no facts supporting an flsa retaliation claim because he did not allege that he engaged in protected activity that suffices to affirm the district court dismissal of uphoff flsa claims against prepa under rule b.ii,wl,at for that reason,the dismissal of uphoff flsa claims against all other defendants under rule a was also appropriate.iii,slip op.at.not only did uphoff not plead such a claim,but he had no claim under the flsa wage and hours provisions.he pled he was lawyer for prepa,and all of the jobs he held were within the learned professional exemption to the flsa see a.
the title vii retaliation claims were properly dismissed 
uphoff appeals the district court dismissal of his title vii retaliation claims against all defendants.because plaintiffs may not bring title vii suits against individual employees,fantini salem state,cir,the dismissal against all individual defendants was proper.
the dismissal of uphoff claim against prepa was also proper.uphoff was required to exhaust his administrative remedies before suing in federal court,including by filing a complaint with the equal opportunity employment commission eeoc.dep t of natural envtl,cir jorge rumsfeld,cir.nothing in uphoff complaint or the record shows uphoff ever filed any complaint with the eeoc,let alone any claim of retaliation.
the civil rights conspiracy claims under were properly dismissed 
a plaintiff suing under must allege a conspiracy existed,the defendants had a conspiratorial purpose to deprive the plaintiff of the equal protection of the laws,the defendants committed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy,and the plaintiff suffered injury to person or property,or a deprivation of a constitutionally protected right.pub,cir.uphoff complaint set forth no facts alleging a conspiracy.and he only alleged political discrimination,which is not actionable under.id.at.
the dismissal of uphoff first amendment retaliation claims against all defendants save alejandro and vazquez was proper 
the dismissal of uphoff claims against all defendants except alejandro and vazquez that he suffered retaliatory adverse employment action for exercising his first amendment right to file suit was proper.and as for alejandro and vazquez,the jury found them not liable.plaintiffs may sue under if they suffered adverse employment action after exercising their first amendment rights.powell alexander,cir see toledo,cir discussing the scope of public employees right to petition.plaintiffs must show they engaged in constitutionally protected conduct and that this conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the alleged adverse employment decision.welch ciampa,cir.
assuming arguendo that uphoff filing his federal court complaint was protected activity,see,at,the amended complaint factual allegations against the other defendants failed to connect them to his filing of the complaint.
b.the district court properly granted judgment as a matter of law for all defendants on uphoff law claims and for all remaining state law claims against the defendants save alejandro and vazquez 
the court granted jmol on uphoff law claims against all the defendants and dismissed the other state law claims against all defendants except alejandro and vazquez.iii,at.
we review de novo a district court decision granting jmol,cir.taking all inferences in favor of uphoff,we review the evidence at trial and ask whether a reasonable jury could have found these defendants liable.see also jennings jones,cir.we may affirm the district court on any independently sufficient ground in the record.invest almaz forest prods,cir quoting hodgens dynamics,cir.
jmol was properly granted on state law claims and dismissal against alejandro and vazquez was othe
