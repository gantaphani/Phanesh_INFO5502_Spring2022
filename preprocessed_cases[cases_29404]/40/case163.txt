in this appeal,brait builders corporation brait challenges the district court dismissal of its claims brought under and massachusetts state law against the commonwealth of massachusetts,division of capital asset management dcam.the district court issued a judgment dismissing the claim with prejudice under federal rule of civil procedure b on the ground that the interests asserted by brait were not property interests protected by the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution.in addition,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction on the state law claims and dismissed them without prejudice.for the reasons stated below,we vacate the district court judgment and remand the case with directions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,pursuant to the eleventh amendment of the united states constitution.
factual background 
given that the district court disposed of this case on a motion to dismiss,see.b,we view the facts as set forth in brait complaint and indulge all reasonable inferences in brait favor.see mccloskey mueller,cir deniz municipality of guaynabo,cir.following,we recount the facts relevant to our decision on jurisdiction.
brait,a massachusetts corporation,is a general contractor that specializes in building construction projects commissioned by the commonwealth of massachusetts or its political subdivisions.as a condition precedent to bidding on public construction projects in the commonwealth of massachusetts,a contractor must hold a certificate of eligibility issued by dcam demonstrating that the contractor has a capacity rating commensurate with the size and scope of the project on which it is bidding.see.laws ch,a fordyce town of hanover.certificates of eligibility,which must be renewed annually,are issued only after dcam review of the contractor prior construction experience,professional references,financial condition,and organizational capacity.fordyce,at citing.laws ch.dcam may decertify a contractor or reduce the classes of work and amount of work on which the contractor is eligible to bid,if dcam learns of a contractor incompetence,poor performance,or misconduct.id.quoting.laws ch.under massachusetts law,a ny materially false statement in the certification application or update statement shall constitute cause for debarring the applicant from future public work as provided in section of chapter of massachusetts general laws.laws ch.a contractor who is debarred or whose certification is suspended,revoked,or not renewed by dcam,loses the ability to contract for construction work from any public authority in the commonwealth of massachusetts.fordyce,at.
brait first received dcam certification to bid on public construction building projects in and continued to annually renew its certification through.in december,brait again applied for renewal of its certificate of eligibility.in response to brait application and based on the information set forth therein,dcam issued a certificate of eligibility valid from december,through december,in the category of general building construction with a single project limit spl of and aggregate work limit awl of.
on or about september,brait was declared the lowest eligible bidder for the beverly high school project in the city of beverly,massachusetts the beverly project.shortly thereafter,dcam received communications from certain groups alleging that brait had intentionally submitted false information in its december certificate of eligibility application in an effort to attain higher certification limits that would allow it to bid on more lucrative public building construction projects.
after certain subsequent communications between dcam and brait the extent of which is not relevant to our decision on jurisdiction dcam debarred brait from bidding on massachusetts public building construction projects for one year through a decertification order issued on november,the final determination.in addition,as a result of the allegations brought against brait and relying on dcam findings,the office of the attorney general of the commonwealth of massachusetts issued a decision on november,rejecting brait bid on the beverly project.brait alleges that both the final determination and the rejection of its bid in the beverly project deprived it of property interests protected by the fourteenth amendment,the right to bid on massachusetts public construction projects and a contract for the construction of a public school without meaningful due process.
ii.procedural posture 
on january,brait filed a complaint in the district court against dcam asserting claims under state law and for violation of its federal due process rights.dcam answered the complaint by asserting,among other things,that it could not be sued under because,as a state agency,it was not considered a person under said statute,see will.dep t of state police,and that it was nonetheless immune from suit under the eleventh amendment.in light thereof,brait moved on april,to amend the complaint by eliminating dcam and adding four dcam officials.brait motion for leave to file an amended complaint included as an attachment a proposed first amended complaint,which named the following persons as proposed defendants,each in their official and individual capacities david perini,commissioner of dcam george matthews,deputy general counsel of dcam natasha bizanos,manager of contractor certification and harry schoenbrun,compliance officer collectively,the proposed individual defendants.
on may,dcam moved to dismiss brait complaint on two alternative grounds.first,dcam alleged that the district court lacked jurisdiction,see.b,pursuant to the eleventh amendment.second,dcam maintained that brait claim should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,see.b,and the court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.in addition,dcam opposed brait motion for leave to file an amended complaint alleging that such filing would be futile because brait failure to state a claim would also justify dismissal against the proposed individual defendants.
on june,the district court ordered that brait motion for leave to file an amended complaint be granted and stated that it was taking dcam motion to dismiss under advisement.more than four months transpired after the district court granted brait motion for leave to file and brait neither filed an amended complaint nor served the proposed individual defendants.
subsequently,on october,the district court issued a brief order dismissing brait claim on the ground that the property interests asserted by brait were not property rights protected by the fourteenth amendment and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims,which the court dismissed without prejudice.this appeal ensued.
iii.standard of review 
because the district court dismissed this case on a motion to dismiss,we review its ruling de novo.mccloskey,at.we,however,are not wedded to the lower court rationale and may affirm an order of dismissal on any basis made apparent by the record.id.
iv.discussion 
dcam is the only defendant in this appeal 
due to its relevance for purposes of our eleventh amendment analysis,we begin by setting forth our understanding with respect to which party is the defendant in this appeal.in this regard,brait avers that because the district court allowed its motion for leave to file an amended complaint the proposed individual defendants should be considered the defendants in this appeal.this is despite the fact that brait did not file an amended complaint after having been granted leave to do so and never served the proposed individual defendants with summonses.for the reasons stated below,we find brait allegations unavailing and conclude that dcam is the only defendant in this appeal.
where amendment as a matter of course is no longer available,federal rule of civil procedure a allows amendment of a complaint with the opposing party written consent or the court leave.an amended complaint,once filed,normally supersedes the antecedent complaint,and causes the latter to no longer perform any function in the case.connectu llc zuckerberg,cir emphasis added citation and internal quotation marks omitted.an amended complaint must generally be served upon every party.a b.furthermore,an amended complaint that adds defendants to an action must be served upon such defendants within days after the amended complaint is filed.m see also bolden city of topeka,cir noting that the day period provided by rule m applies to service upon defendants newly added in an amended complaint.
as we have stated,brait concedes that it has neither filed an amended complaint after having been granted leave to do so nor served the proposed individual defendants.in addition,brait has not requested that the proposed amended complaint attached to its motion for leave to deemed a proper filing of an amended complaint see.d.brait,however,alleges that its inaction was justified in light of the circumstances of this case.specifically,brait contends that it would have been a waste of resources for brait to file the first amended complaint and serve it upon the proposed individual defendants,given that the proposed amended complaint advised the district court of brait allegations for purposes of determining whether the case should nonetheless be dismissed.accordingly,brait maintains that it should not have been required to file an amended complaint or serve the proposed individual defendants with summonses while the district court was still considering dcam motion to dismiss.
brait arguments do not support its contention that the proposed individual defendants are the defendants in this case.its arguments merely attempt to provide reasons for why brait should not have been required to remedy an alleged defect in the district court jurisdiction,despite having been granted leave to do so.it is unnecessary for us to address these arguments at this point,since they do not change the fact that brait failed to file an amended complaint and serve the proposed individual defendants,and,consequently,that dcam is the sole defendant here.
for the reasons stated,we conclude that dcam is the sole defendant in this appeal this conclusion is consistent with the apparent understanding of the district court,which did not change the caption of this case to eliminate dcam and add the proposed individual defendants.such proposed defendants have not appeared in this case on appeal or in the district court.with this understanding in mind,we proceed to analyze dcam eleventh amendment immunity defense.
eleventh amendment immunity 
this appeal presents an eleventh amendment question,whether the eleventh amendment precludes us from exercising judicial power over dcam and questions that relate to the plausibility of brait claims on the merits.as explained below,the nature of the issues presented in this appeal counsels that we begin the dispositional order by analyzing dcam eleventh amendment immunity defense.
generally,courts must adjudicate plausible challenges to their jurisdiction prior to adjudicating the merits of a case.see ruhrgas ag marathon oil.moreover,although the supreme court has declined to state definitively whether the eleventh amendment is a doctrine of subject matter jurisdiction,hudson sav.bank austin.cir citing.dep t of corr.schacht,the court has stated that the amendment is jurisdictional in the sense that it is a limitation on the federal court judicial power.calderon ashmus,emphasis added see also seminole tribe of florida,the eleventh amendment restricts the judicial power under article iii.
on the other hand,the supreme court has also recognized that the eleventh amendment is not with the limitations on judicial power in article iii.calderon,at.consistent with these principles,it is under first circuit precedent that federal courts may resolve a case on the merits in favor of a state without first resolving any eleventh amendment issues the state raises.parella ret.bd.of emps.ret,cir see also mcbee delica,cir in parella,we held that eleventh amendment immunity can be bypassed in certain cases.this first circuit precedent allows federal courts to defer thorny eleventh amendment questions in cases in which it is perfectly clear that the state entity will prevail on the merits.dávila corporación de para la difusión pública,cir citing parella,at.
we do not bypass the eleventh amendment question in this case because the answer to that question is quite straightforward.brait did not amend its complaint to include the individual dcam officers as named defendants under the doctrine of ex parte young.dcam is the only defendant.the supreme court has clearly said that the eleventh amendment bars federal suits by citizens against the state or state agencies baker,cir.therefore,u nless a state has waived its eleventh amendment immunity or congress has overridden it,a state can not be sued directly in its own name regardless of the relief sought.kentucky graham,citing alabama pugh.pursuant to these principles,it is perfectly clear that brait claims in the complaint are barred by the eleventh amendment,since brait sued dcam in the latter own name see virginia office for protection and advocacy stewart,slip op.at april.
in addition,although we do not render an opinion with regards to the merits of the constitutional question reached by the district court,whether brait asserted property interests protected by the fourteenth amendment,we note that the brevity of the district court opinion understates the complexity of this question,particularly in relation to the issue of whether brait had a constitutionally protected property interest in its certification of eligibility to bid on massachusetts public building construction projects therefore,we note that bypassing the eleventh amendment question here might require us to unnecessarily resolve a more complex fourteenth amendment question.
based on the above,we find that the questions at issue in this case do not counsel that we bypass the eleventh amendment immunity question.accordingly,we conclude that brait claims in the complaint are barred by the eleventh amendment.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated,we conclude that eleventh amendment immunity applies and,consequently,that we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal.we therefore vacate the district court judgment and remand the case with directions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
vacated and remanded with directions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.costs in this appeal shall be taxed against brait builders corporation.
dcam is an agency of the commonwealth of massachusetts in charge of,among other things,overseeing administration of massachusetts public bidding statutes.laws ch.see.laws ch,fordyce town of hanover.
such an argument is therefore waived,and we limit our analysis accordingly.see united states zannino,cir.in light thereof,it is unnecessary for us to address the issue of whether brait amended complaint in the event it had been filed should nonetheless be dismissed due to brait subsequent failure to serve summonses upon the proposed individual defendants within days,as required by federal rule of civil procedure m.
we note that brait proposed amended complaint presented four state law claims and one federal law claim,namely,a request for declaratory judgment that the proposed individual defendants deprived brait of its property interests in violation of its right to due process.because we find that brait did not amend its complaint,it is unnecessary for us to address whether a federal court would have jurisdiction to issue such declaratory relief,in light of the fact that no ongoing violation of federal law is alleged by brait,brait concedes that it was only barred for one year from applying for recertification,a period which has elapsed.see mills maine,cir noting that a declaratory judgment is unavailable where the parties agree that there is no ongoing legal violation.
brait has not disputed dcam assertion that it is a state agency subject to eleventh amendment immunity.therefore,we assume for purposes of our analysis that it is.see baker,cir.
brait contention that dcam waived its eleventh amendment immunity is unavailing.specifically,brait avers that during a motion hearing in th
