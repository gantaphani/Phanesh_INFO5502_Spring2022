background 
simon is a subsidiary of the simon property group,a retail shopping mall developer and manager.simon manages the three largest shopping malls in new hampshire,as well as a number of other malls throughout the united states.in,simon contracted with bank of america boa to sell stored value giftcards.
stored value giftcards come in two varieties retail giftcards and giftcards.retail giftcards are similar to traditional gift certificates in that they are issued by a retailer,are serviced by a retailer or its agent,and can only be used at that retailer.giftcards may be sold by a retailer,but they are issued by a bank,typically carry the logo of a payment network such as visa or mastercard,and can be used at any location that accepts debit cards of the same payment network.the giftcards issued by boa and sold by simon were giftcards.these cards carried an expiration date and were subject to administrative fees that reduced the redeemable value of the card after a certain period of time or after certain events,such as the loss and replacement of the card.
under the agreement between simon and boa,boa was responsible for the design of the cards,and boa was identified as the issuer of the giftcard.all proceeds from the sale of giftcards were remitted to simon,who in turn paid boa a transaction fee for each transaction involving a card.simon was responsible for marketing,selling,and servicing the giftcards.
on november,ayotte gave notice to simon that the attorney general intended to file an enforcement action pursuant to the new hampshire cpa to halt the sale of the giftcards.the cpa provides in relevant part 
it shall be unlawful for any person to use any unfair method of competition or any unfair or deceptive act or practice in the conduct of any trade or commerce within this state.such unfair method of competition or unfair or deceptive act or practice shall include,but is not limited to,the following 
xiii.selling gift certificates having a face value of or less to purchasers which contain expiration dates dormancy fees,latency fees,or any other administrative fees or service charges that have the effect of reducing the total amount for which the holder may redeem a gift certificate are prohibited.this paragraph shall not apply to season passes.
on november,simon filed a declaratory judgment action and request for injunctive relief against ayotte in the united states district court for the district of new hampshire,seeking a declaration that enforcement of the cpa against simon for the sale of giftcards would be preempted by the national banking act.new hampshire proceeded to file a civil complaint against simon in the new hampshire superior court on november,alleging that simon violated the cpa by selling giftcards with an expiration date and administrative fees.simon filed a motion to dismiss the civil complaint on the ground that its giftcards were not gift certificates within the definition of the cpa.the superior court found that the giftcards were gift certificates within the definition of the cpa,and denied simon motion to dismiss,but stayed all further proceedings pending the outcome of the federal action.on august,simon moved for summary judgment in the federal declaratory judgment action.
in september,simon terminated its relationship with boa,and entered into contracts with usb to sell giftcards at simon malls,and with metabank to sell giftcards over the internet.usb is a federally chartered bank national bank regulated by the federal office of the comptroller of the currency occ.metabank is a federally chartered thrift national thrift regulated by the federal office of thrift supervision ots.
simon contract with usb states that usb shall be considered the issuer of the giftcards sold under the contract,and that the giftcards are to be national bank products within the meaning of the national bank act for all purposes,including the principles of federal preemption.according to the contract,usb issues the giftcards and then provides a stock of cards to simon.simon then markets the giftcards to consumers.consumers who wish to purchase a gift card provide simon with some form of payment,which simon remits to usb.simon then electronically loads the stored value onto the card and gives the card to the consumer,along with the disclosures provided by usb.simon is paid a commission for each gift card sold.from this point forward,the purchaser of the gift card has a contractual relationship only with usb.usb is responsible for servicing the card and is liable for charges upon it.any fees associated with the card are set and collected by usb,and if the card is reported lost or misused,usb may be liable to the consumer for fraudulent charges.simon has no authority under the contract to alter the terms and conditions of the agreement between usb and the consumer.metabank agreement with simon is substantially similar to simon agreement with usb.
according to metabank and usb,some amount of administrative fees are necessary to make their giftcard business economically viable.in addition,metabank and usb have stated that visa,who provides payment processing services for the giftcards,requires that the cards include an expiration date.according to metabank and usb,the expiration date provides security so that the card identity can be verified by seeing if the card number and expiration date match in a database.
the usb giftcards themselves resemble a credit card in physical appearance.they are about inches long by inches wide.the card has the visa logo along with a hologram in the front bottom right corner.sixteen raised digits appear on the front of the card,below which is an expiration date.the top of the card identifies it as a simon giftcard the usb logo is also prominently displayed.on the reverse of the card,there is a strip emblazoned with the visa logo for the customer signature and a statement that use of the gift card is governed by the terms of the cardholder agreement,that an administrative fee of per month will be deducted beginning thirteen months after the card is purchased,and that the card will expire on the date printed on the front of the card.the card also states this card is issued by and the property of bank national association,pursuant to a license from visa,and must be returned upon request.
the bank simon giftcard cardholder agreement indicates that the agreement is between usb and the consumer.the agreement states the schedule of fees,the expiration date,indicates that the card may be used when making purchases from any merchant that accepts visa debit cards,and states that usb may be liable for failure to complete transactions.the agreement also explicitly limits usb liability for certain transactions and notes that usb may revoke the giftcard at any time without cause or notice.the agreement is printed on a brochure that accompanies the card.the brochure states that the card is issued by usb,and that it may be purchased at a simon mall or at the simon website 
both metabank and usb moved to intervene in the declaratory judgment action.the district court granted both parties motions.
on august,the district court granted simon motion for summary judgment.the district court found that the national bank act and hola authorized nationally chartered banks and thrifts respectively to sell giftcards as a banking product,and that the new hampshire cpa substantially frustrated the ability of metabank and usb to sell giftcards in new hampshire.as such,the district court found that the national bank act and hola preempted the cpa with respect to products issued by nationally chartered banks and thrifts.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court determination that a state statute is preempted de novo.carpenters local union fid.guar,cir.
the doctrine of federal preemption is rooted in the supremacy clause,which provides that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art.vi,cl.federal statutes and the regulations adopted thereunder have equal preemptive effect.fid.fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d.a federal statute or regulation may preempt a state regulatory scheme in three relevant ways first,congress can expressly preempt state law by explicit statutory language.barnett bank of marion county,nelson,d.second,congress can enact a regulatory scheme so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it,id.at.quoting rice santa fe elevator,also known as field preemption.in such cases,state regulation will be invalid even if it does not directly conflict with federal laws or regulations.see,cloverleaf butter patterson.third,federal law may be in irreconcilable conflict with state law,barnett bank,at.quoting rice norman williams,d,also known as conflict preemption.this may occur when compliance with both state and federal statutes and regulations is a physical impossibility,or when compliance with the state statute would frustrate the purposes of the federal scheme.id.simon,usb,and metabank argue that conflict preemption prohibits ayotte from enforcing the new hampshire cpa against simon because the cpa conflicts with federal statutes and regulations authorizing national banks and thrifts to issue gift cards with expiration dates and administrative fees and to sell the cards through third party agents.because usb and metabank activities are regulated under different statutory schemes,we address their preemption claims separately.
a.the national bank act 
the national bank act provides that a nationally chartered bank shall have the power t o exercise by its board of directors or duly authorized officers or agents,subject to law,all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking,seventh.the supreme court has consistently recognized this grant of incidental powers as a grant of authority not normally limited by,but rather ordinarily,contrary state law.barnett bank,at.see also franklin bank new york.deciding that a national bank incidental power to advertise for deposits preempts state law limiting such advertising first bank california.finding that a national bank statutory power preempts state statute limiting its ability to take deposits.thus,a state law may be preempted by the national bank act when it frustrates or limits the ability of a national bank to exercise its statutorily granted powers.see barnett bank,at.accordingly,to determine whether the national bank act preempts the enforcement of the new hampshire cpa,we must first determine whether a national bank enumerated and incidental powers include the issuance of giftcards with expiration dates and administrative fees and the marketing and sale of those giftcards through third party agents.if a national bank has these powers,we must then determine whether the cpa limits the bank ability to exercise that power.
there is little dispute in this case that a national bank has the power to issue stored value cards that carry expiration dates and administrative fees.the occ has determined that the issuance and sale of electronic stored value systems,such as giftcards,is an activity incidental to the business of banking.a occ bulletin,guidance on electronic financial services consumer compliance,july,available at wl at.furthermore,the occ has issued regulations that require the disclosure of expiration dates and administrative fees on giftcards,which indicates that the occ expects that cards might carry expiration dates and fees,and that they are not prohibited from doing so.occ bulletin,gift card disclosures,available at wl at occ bulletin,stored value card systems,available at wl at each stored value system could have specific features such as limits on the amount of electronic cash that can be stored or cards that expire after some established time period.in fact,the occ stated in its amicus brief to this court that it believes that its regulations may require expiration dates on cards as a matter of sound banking practice.see occ bulletin at effective controls,audit coverage,and other preventive measures should be in place to deter or minimize the impact of fraud,counterfeiting,and other improper activities.we must defer to these regulations because they are not unreasonable,unauthorized,or inconsistent.ridgway ridgway,d cited favorably in fid.fed.sav.loan ass n,at.see also chevron,nrdc,d sometimes the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit.in such a case,a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.thus,we conclude that the national bank act gives a national bank the authority to issue and sell stored value giftcards such as the ones at issue in this case.
having determined that it is within a national bank powers to issue and sell the giftcards at issue here,we must determine whether the national bank act gives national banks the power to engage third party agents to market and sell the giftcards.the national bank act explicitly states that a national bank may use duly authorized officers or agents to exercise its incidental powers,seventh.the occ adds that it has explicitly allowed banks to use agents to carry out bank activities.see,preemption determination michigan motor vehicles sales act.may,allowing agents to market automobile loans allowing agents to sell money orders.at least one other circuit has suggested that national banks may use agents to perform activities authorized by the national bank act.see cades h r block,cir finding that requires that a national bank home state usury laws apply,when the bank had used agents to engage in solicitation of consumers.accordingly,we agree with usb and simon that the national bank act authorizes national banks to engage agents to carry out some of their activities.
because the national bank act confers on national banks the power to issue stored value gift cards like those at issue here and to market and sell them through third party agents,we consider whether the new hampshire cpa frustrates the exercise of that power.the new hampshire cpa prohibits the sale of a giftcard with a value of less than that carries an expiration date or administrative fees.ayotte argues that this regulation does not conflict with the national bank act or occ regulations because it regulates only simon,a company that is not a bank.ayotte notes that no enforcement action was brought against usb.but this analysis is too formalistic the question here is not whom the new hampshire statute regulates,but rather,against what activity it regulates.see watters wachovia bank,d we have never held that the preemptive reach of the national bank act extends only to a national bank itself.rather,in analyzing whether state law hampers the federally permitted activities of a national bank,we have focused on the exercise of a national bank powers emphasis in original.for example,in franklin national bank,the supreme court decided that the national bank act preempted local regulations that prohibited banks from advertising that they accepted savings.at.the court stated that because nati
