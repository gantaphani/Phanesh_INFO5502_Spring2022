this appeal arises from a district court order holding that the school board election system of lexington county,south carolina,violates section of the voting rights act of,section.appellant lexington county school district three board of trustees the school board argues that the district court erred in its analysis by considering only the elections that took place between and,and by misapplying the factors set forth by the supreme court in thornburg gingles,d.for the reasons that follow,we vacate the order and remand for further proceedings.
lexington county school district three the district is one of five school districts in lexington county,south carolina.it lies primarily within lexington county,but also includes a small portion of neighboring saluda county.the district is small based on the census,the total population of the district is only persons.constitute percent of the population and approximately percent of registered voters.the district educates roughly students,about percent of whom are minorities.
before,the school board members were appointed by the lexington county board of education.but pursuant to a referendum vote,the district established a school board,elected in nonpartisan elections held in the last week of february of each year.school board members were elected to staggered,terms,with two seats elected in three of every four years,and the remaining seat elected in the fourth.under this electoral system,three individuals were elected to the school board from through.
in,the district method of electing school board members changed again.under this new system,which continues to the present day,school board members are elected in nonpartisan,elections held during the november general election in years.four seats are elected in presidential years and three seats are elected in even years.since this change,voter turnout has quadrupled.voter turnout among whites,however,has outpaced voter turnout among.
on september,levy,betty etheredge,and shirley barr collectively,plaintiffs filed an action against the school board,its individual members,and elton wilson in his official capacity as chair of the lexington county registration and election commission.plaintiffs alleged that the current school board election process dilutes the voting strength of voters in violation of section.they explained that because of the new system,c andidates for the school board preferred by african americans are usually defeated by the white majority voting as a bloc.
this case went to a bench trial on december.after two days of testimony,the trial was recessed until march.at trial,plaintiffs showed that from through,nine candidates ran for the school board but none were elected.although they conceded that one candidate,cora lester,was elected to the school board in,plaintiffs argued that the school board encouraged her candidacy after this action was filed in order to thwart their section challenge.the trial ended on march.
the district court took this matter under advisement for three years.during that time,two school board elections were held in and.in the election,an candidate named leon drafts was elected.given his success,on january,the school board filed a motion for leave to supplement the record with the election results.
on february,and without first deciding the school board motion to supplement,the district court issued its judgment on the merits the order.the district court explained that,based on information up to and including the election,it determined that the school board electoral system adopted in violates section.this appealed followed 
section a of the voting rights act of prohibits a state or its political subdivisions from imposing any electoral procedure or practice in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the united states to vote on account of race or color.a.section b of the act,as amended in,further provides that a violation of section occurs 
if,based on the totality of circumstances,it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the state or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection a of this section in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.
b.this means that,where whites have a majority,minority members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice if the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to defeat the minority preferred candidates.see gingles,at.
in gingles,the supreme court explained that three preconditions must be established for any section violation.first,the minority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district.id.at.second,the minority group must be able to show that it is politically cohesive.id.at.third,the minority must be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the minority preferred candidate.id.internal citation omitted.
if these preconditions are met,the court must then determine under the totality of circumstances whether there has been a violation of section.lewis alamance county,cir citing johnson de grandy,d collins city of norfolk,collins i,cir.in this analysis,courts should consider the factors set forth in the senate judiciary committee majority report the senate report accompanying the amendment to section to determine whether,under the totality of the circumstances,section has been violated collins i,at 
in the case before us,the school board alleges several errors below.it argues that the district court erred by considering only the elections that took place between and.it further argues that the district court application of the second and third gingles factors was based on factual and legal errors we discuss each argument in turn 
we first review the school board contention that the district court wrongly limited its analysis to elections that took place between and.the school board insists that the district court should have allowed into the record the results from the and elections.as noted above,although the school board moved to supplement the record with the election results after the case had been submitted for decision,the district court denied this motion in a paperless order almost two months after issuing the order.in doing so,the court gave only this explanation t he interests of justice are best served by closing the record.the school board then moved for reconsideration,asking the court to consider both the and the elections.the court denied that motion as well.
it is within the district court discretion to reopen a case to admit new evidence see dent beazer materials and,cir.when deciding whether a district court abused this discretion,we consider whether the evidence sought to be introduced is especially important and probative the moving party explanation for failing to introduce the evidence earlier is bona fide and reopening will cause undue prejudice to the nonmoving party.puerto rico,cir see also united states abbas,cir considering similar factors in a criminal matter gibson mayor and council of wilmington,cir considering similar factors,including the burden that will be placed on the parties and their witnesses,the undue prejudice that may result from admitting or not admitting the new evidence,and considerations of judicial economy.i t is generally understood that a trial court abuses its discretion if its refusal to reopen works an injustice in the particular circumstances,at citing gas ridge,suburban agric,cir.
we are persuaded that the district court failure to consider the and election results in the order work ed an injustice in the particular circumstances.id.those electoral results are important and probative given that an candidate was elected to the school board in.in addition,the school board had a bona fide explanation for failing to introduce this evidence earlier such evidence was not available until after the bench trial concluded.finally,although we are sympathetic to plaintiffs wish to have this case resolved sooner rather than later,we find that concern counterbalanced by the district court delay of almost three years in issuing the order.because of that delay,two more relevant elections occurred on such facts,we can not say plaintiffs still retain the same interest in a timely disposition as they would have had before the election.thus,reopening the case here will cause no undue prejudice to plaintiffs,so long as they are afforded an opportunity to test and rebut the evidence presented by the school board.see collins ii,at although trial was originally held in,subsequent elections were considered by both trial court and appellate court westwego citizens for better gov t city of westwego,cir g iven the long term nature and extreme costs necessarily associated with voting rights cases,it is appropriate to take into account elections occurring subsequent to trial.accordingly,we vacate the district court order and remand for further proceedings in which the parties will have the opportunity to present the and election results 
because we are remanding the case,we will address other issues raised on appeal that are likely to recur.see elm grove coal,cir we choose to address this discovery issue because it is likely to arise on remand.specifically,we review the school board arguments that the district court erred in its application of the second and third gingles factors.
we first consider whether the district court erred in its analysis of the third gingles factor under this factor,the court must determine whether the majority votes as a bloc to enable it to usually defeat the minority preferred candidate.gingles,at.to do so,the court must first identify those individuals who constitute candidates of choice,and then analyze whether those candidates are usually defeated by majority white bloc voting.collins ii,at see lewis,at laying out the proper criteria for identifying candidates of choice.the school board argues that the district court made several errors in its identification of the candidates of choice.we address each alleged error in turn.
first,the school board challenges the method that the district court employed to determine whether a candidate who received less support from minority voters than an unsuccessful first choice may nevertheless be deemed a candidate of choice in a election.pursuant to lewis,
if the unsuccessful candidate who was the first choice among minority voters did not receive a significantly higher percentage of the minority community support than did other candidates who also received a majority among minority voters,then the latter should also be viewed by the district court as candidates.
at.lewis,however,left the term significantly higher undefined.
in the order,the district court defined this term based on collins ii,at.the court read collins ii as finding that two successful candidates with percent and percent of the vote were not candidates of choice because they received significantly less minority support than the unsuccessful top minority,who received percent of the vote.noting that the differences between the unsuccessful candidate and the successful candidates were and percentage points respectively,the district court proceeded to classify any candidate in the present case percentage points or more below the unsuccessful top as having received significantly less minority support than the unsuccessful top minority.
we disagree with the district court reasoning.although a differential may be the appropriate standard,it is not necessarily so.interpreting analogous language,lewis explained that t he level of support that may properly be deemed substantial will vary,of course,depending on the number of candidates on the ballot and the number of seats to be filled.at.as such,to determine whether a candidate who received less support from minority voters than an unsuccessful first choice may be deemed a candidate of choice in a election,a district court should first consider the number of candidates on the ballot and the number of seats to be filled only then should the court make a determination of whether the unsuccessful top minority received a significantly higher percentage of the minority community support than did other candidates.the district court,however,did not undertake this type of analysis.thus,we agree with the school board that the district court analysis rests on an improper understanding of the term significantly higher.
next,the school board argues that the district court,in applying the third gingles factor,erred by assuming that no candidates of choice can come from an election in which no candidate received a majority of the minority vote.the district court reached this conclusion after determining that neither lewis nor collins ii establishes a construct for analyzing elections in which no candidate received a majority of the minority vote.accordingly,the district court concluded that the election was devoid of candidates of choice because no candidate received a majority of the black vote during that election.
the district court reasoning assumes that a person without support from over percent of minority voters can not be deemed a candidate.lewis,however,said the opposite w e do not believe that the mere failure to achieve a threshold of in a election necessarily means that a candidate can not be viewed as a candidate.at.in that case,we considered the treatment of second and finishers behind a successful,candidate of choice who had received more than percent of the minority vote.we ultimately found that in a election,
c andidates who receive less than of the minority vote,but who would have been elected had the election been held only among black voters,are presumed also to be candidates,although an individualized assessment should be made in order to confirm that such a candidate may appropriately be so considered.
if such candidates can be considered candidates of choice in an election in which the top received more than percent of the vote,we see no reason why a similarly popular that would have been elected had the election been held only among not also be considered a candidate of choice in an election in which no candidate received percent or more of the minority vote see,ruiz city of santa maria,cir.thus,we find that in elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the minority vote,a candidate may still be labeled a candidate of choice if that candidate would have been elected had the election been held only among minority voters,so long as an individualized assessment of that candidate supports that conclusion 
finally,the school board contends the district court erred in adopting plaintiffs expert report over their own expert report to ascertain the candidates of choice.to determine which candidates were minority preferred,plaintiffs expert,john ruoff,analyzed elections for the school board from to using three statistical methods of analysis homogenous precinct,ecological regression,and ecological inference.the school board expert,david epstein,analyzed the same data using the ecological inference method.ruoff concluded that there were eight candidates of choice for the school board between and.of those eight,one was elected to the school board.by contrast,epstein concluded that there were seventeen candidates of choice during that period.of those seventeen,six were elected to the school board.
the district court favored ruoff results over epstein,but its reasons for this selection are unclear the district court explained its choice,in total,as follows 
the court finds more reliable ruoff use of three statistical methods of precinct hp,ecological regression er,and ecological inference ei as compared to epstein analysis utilizing only the ei method of analysis.the court also finds persuasive ruoff explanations regarding the ridge road precinct the court thus adopts ruoff statistical analysis.
