the press office of maryland governor robert ehrlich,issued the following directive on november,
effective immediately,no one in the executive department or agencies is to speak with baltimore sun reporter david nitkin or baltimore sun columnist michael olesker until further notice.do not return calls or comply with any requests.the governor press office feels that currently both are failing to objectively report on any issue dealing with the administration.please relay this information to your respective department heads.
the directive was authored by deputy director of communications gregory massoni and disseminated to public information offices and executive department by press secretary shareese deleaver.
the baltimore sun company publisher of the sun newspaper,baltimore sun reporter nitkin,and baltimore sun columnist olesker collectively referred to as the sun commenced this action in december against ehrlich,massoni,and deleaver collectively,the governor,seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions against enforcement of the directive.in its claim,brought under,the sun alleges that the governor directive unconstitutionally retaliated against it for exercising its first amendment speech and press rights.
the district court denied the sun motion for a preliminary injunction and granted the governor motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
the sun is maryland largest newspaper with more than one million readers each week.david nitkin,a reporter for the baltimore sun company,was the state house bureau chief,and michael olesker was a columnist for the baltimore sun company,who wrote a weekly opinion column.
these plaintiffs allege in their complaint that the governor issued his november,directive for the express purpose of punishing and retaliating against the sun for the exercise of its first amendment rights.they also allege that the directive was intended to have and has had an impermissible chilling effect on the sun right to free expression.
in support of the sun motion for a preliminary injunction,nitkin testified by affidavit about the effect that the governor directive had on him.he stated that on november,he called the governor press secretary,henry fawell,to seek comment on statements made by legislators calling for a constitutional amendment to give lawmakers a greater say in selling land.fawell response was that the ban is still in effect.nitkin also stated that on the same day he left a message for budget secretary james dipaula and that dipaula secretary informed him that nitkin would have to speak to the governor press office.nitkin stated that on november,he called anne hubbard,a spokeswoman for the department of general services,inquiring about a contract between a private consulting firm and the department of general services,and hubbard replied,david,i ca talk to you.nitkin related that numerous other state government representatives and employees also have not returned my telephone calls.and in a second affidavit,nitkin stated that he was excluded from a press briefing conducted in the governor conference room on december,and that he was not invited to one on january.he acknowledged that other reporters from the sun attended both briefings.
on the same day that the governor directive was issued,nitkin the governor press office to learn if the directive applied to his requests for information made pursuant to maryland public information act.the press office responded to nitkin,advising him that executive officials would continue to answer those requests as legally required.
finally,invitations were extended to nitkin for public press conferences,and he attended three of them during the two months following the issuance of the directive.he also continued to receive public press releases.
in his affidavit in support of the sun motion for preliminary injunction,olesker testified that since the ban was enacted,several state government representatives and employees have not returned my telephone calls.he stated that on november,he made three telephone calls to the governor press office that were not returned.
the baltimore sun company itself has apparently not been denied any access by the directive except insofar as nitkin and olesker have been denied access.other reporters for the sun have had their phone messages and returned,and they attended and reported on both press briefings from which nitkin was excluded or not invited.
in affidavits filed in opposition to the sun motion for a preliminary injunction,massoni and deleaver explained the reach of the governor directive.massoni testified that both before the directive and after it,the governor interacted with members of the media in a variety of ways,including press conferences,press briefings,and exclusive interviews which may be limited in scope,participants,or forum.he observed that these practices were consistent with custom within the broadcast industry,and have not changed during this administration,except to the extent that nitkin and olesker are not granted the special access they once enjoyed.he further testified,
based on my years of experience in the broadcast industry,it is common practice for public officials to determine to whom they will speak,to speak to one or a selected number of reporters and to decide in what forum the information will be disclosed.based on my experience,it is not uncommon for a public official to refuse to provide information,or to limit access to sources of information to a reporter.
deleaver testified by affidavit that the governor determines whether to hold a public press conference or a press briefing of a limited number of reporters.she explained that public press conferences were held in the governor reception room,which has a capacity for persons,and the media could request to be included on the notification list.because nitkin had requested to be on the notification list,he was notified of and invited to public press conferences.olesker never requested to be on the notification list.she stated that press briefings were held in the governor conference room,a private area protected by a guard and a door with keypad access and with the capacity to hold to people.the persons invited to press briefings were called by telephone or invited in person.
the sun has not so confirmed at oral the governor directive actually chilled its reporting on state government matters.the governor pointed out that during the eight weeks before the directive,nitkin wrote articles related to state government and olesker,and during the eight weeks after the directive,nitkin wrote and olesker.
the sun commenced this action on december,against governor ehrlich,massoni,and deleaver in their official capacities,alleging unconstitutional retaliation and seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions barring the governor from enforcing the november,directive.the district court entered an order on february,denying the sun motion for a preliminary injunction and granting the governor motion under federal rule of civil procedure b to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.baltimore sun ehrlich,d.in its decision,the court stated that because the sun seeks the declaration of a constitutional right that neither the supreme court nor the fourth circuit has,in fact,seeks more access than that accorded a private governor motion to dismiss will be granted.id.at.the district court relied on the same reasoning to deny the sun motion for a preliminary injunction.id.
this appeal followed.
because the district court order dismissing the sun complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b and its order denying the sun motion for a preliminary injunction are based on the single legal determination that the sun has failed to state a claim for retaliation upon which relief can be granted,we review that legal determination de novo.see carandola,bason,cir holding that review of legal issues determined in deciding a motion for preliminary injunction is de novo eastern shore,assocs,cir holding that review of order granting motion to dismiss under rule b is de novo.
the sun contends that the district court erred in straying from the issue presented by the motions and that the governor brief continues its effort to mislead this court about the case.the sun asks us to decide did the sun state a cause of action by alleging that a public official retaliated and discriminated against it because he did not like its point of view it argues that the allegation in its complaint clearly satisfied the fourth circuit standards for retaliation claims.thus,we address the single issue whether the issuance of the governor november,directive in response to the sun exercise of its first amendment rights gives rise to an actionable claim for retaliation under the first and fourteenth amendments and.
because government retaliation tends to chill an individual exercise of his first amendment rights,public officials may not,as a general rule,respond to an individual protected activity with conduct or speech even though that conduct or speech would otherwise be a lawful exercise of public authority.bd.of county comm rs umbehr,d suarez.indus.mcgraw,cir see also perry sindermann,d i f the government could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations,his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited.a retaliation claim under must establish that the government responded to the plaintiff constitutionally protected activity with conduct or speech that would chill or adversely affect his protected activity.see constantine rectors and visitors of george mason,cir aclu wicomico county,cir.the determination of whether government conduct or speech has a chilling effect or an adverse impact is an objective determine whether a similarly situated person of ordinary firmness reasonably would be chilled by the government conduct in light of the circumstances presented in the particular case.see constantine,at wicomico county,at see also blatter,cir tailoring adverse impact analysis to specific circumstances presented.because our analysis of the adverse impact is objective,it can be resolved as a matter of law.
not every government restriction,however,is sufficient to chill the exercise of first amendment rights,nor is every restriction actionable,even if retaliatory.dimeglio haines,cir.illustrating the observation that not every government restriction is sufficient to chill the exercise of first amendment rights,we have recognized a distinction between an adverse impact that is actionable,on the one hand,and a de minimis inconvenience,on the other.a plaintiff seeking to recover for retaliation must show that the defendant conduct resulted in something more than a de minimis inconvenience to her exercise of first amendment rights.constantine,at citation omitted.thus,in wicomico county,we held that a prison decision to withdraw from its special arrangement permitting an aclu paralegal to meet with prisoners in private may have inconvenienced appellees,but it did not chill,impair,or deny their exercise of first amendment rights because the paralegal was still free to visit with inmates in secure,meeting rooms,which was all that the prison provide d to any paralegal or other visitor.at.
in a proximate vein,the supreme court has condoned limiting retaliation liability when the challenged government action,whether conduct or speech,is so pervasive,mundane,and universal in government operations that allowing a plaintiff to proceed on his retaliation claim would plant the seed of a constitutional case in virtually every interchange.see connick myers,d see also id.at.holding that,in the government employment context,public employers can reprimand or punish employees for their speech when that speech does not touch on matters of public concern kirby city of elizabeth city,cir umbehr,at.noting that retaliation may be justified,unactionable when legitimate countervailing government interests are sufficiently strong.thus,the connick court recognized that the retaliation cause of action must be administered to balance governmental and private interests so as not to impose liability in everyday,encounters.
illustrating the second dimeglio observation that not every restriction is actionable,even if retaliatory,we have recognized that some government actions,due to their nature,are not actionable even if they satisfy all the generally articulated elements of a retaliation claim.when the challenged government action is government speech,there is no retaliation if the plaintiff can demonstrate a substantial adverse the government speech concerns private information about an individual or unless it was threatening,coercive,or intimidating so as to intimate that punishment,sanction,or adverse regulatory action will imminently follow.suarez,at.other courts,likewise,have held that there is no retaliation when the government alleged retaliatory action was government speech.see,benningfield city of houston,cir harrington harris,cir accord kirby,at leaving open the question whether a oral reprimand might be a sanction or adverse regulatory action sufficient to chill future speech.this limitation on the retaliation cause of action based on government speech is necessary to balance the government speech interests with the plaintiff speech interests.suarez,at.
in this case,the governor does not dispute that nitkin and olesker engaged in constitutionally protected speech and that he issued the november,directive in response to their speech.the directive itself states that the governor and his press office believed that nitkin and olesker had failed to be objective in their reporting.the issues not conceded by the governor center on the remaining elements of a retaliation claim,requiring us to determine in the context of this case whether making issuance of the directive actionable would tend to constitutionalize virtually every interchange between the press and the governor whether the directive effected a substantial adverse impact or chill on the sun exercise of its first amendment rights or simply created a de minimis inconvenience and whether the governor response was protected government speech.
on these issues,the sun contends that the directive was not an everyday interchange but specifically targeted two reporters,denying them rights given to all other reporters.the sun argues that nitkin and olesker are relatively and significantly worse off than other reporters because executive officials no longer can comment to them.although the reporters would not concede at oral argument that their speech has actually been chilled,they argue that as a matter of law the speech of a reasonable reporter of ordinary firmness would be chilled by being subjected to a policy that does not apply to every reporter.in addition,the sun contends that the governor intended his order to coerce nitkin and olesker to conform their speech to his understanding of objective reporting.thus,the sun argues that from the moment the order issued and regardless of its effectiveness in foreclosing their access to official sources of information,a reasonable reporter speech would be chilled by the governor manifest and expressed purpose.
it is common the parties so reporting is highly competitive,and reporters cultivate exclusive sources,including government officials.public officials routinely select among reporters when granting interviews or providing access to nonpublic information.they evaluate reporters and choose to communicate with those who they believe will deliver their desired messages to the public.by giving one reporter or a small group of reporters information or access,the official simultaneously makes other reporters,who do not receive discretionary access,worse off.these other reporters are sometimes denied access because an official believes them to be unobjective.see snyder ringgold,wl,cir unpublished opinion noting the common and widely accepted practice among politicians of granting an exclusive interview to a particular reporter and the equally widespread practice of public officials declining to speak to reporters whom they view as untrustworthy because the reporters have previ
