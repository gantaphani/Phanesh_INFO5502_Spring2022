attorney mark hanson represents a contractor embroiled in a construction dispute concerning a project in egypt.hanson claims that the united states agency for international development usaid unlawfully withheld a document relevant to the dispute in violation of the freedom of information act foia.this document,prepared by a lawyer hired by the private project engineer,laid out the lawyer analysis concerning the dispute that was of common interest to usaid and to the project engineer.the lawyer contract with the project engineer expressly provided that only usaid and its egyptian partner should receive the document.hanson argued that the document was subject to foia disclosure.the district court granted summary judgment to usaid and held that the document fell under the foia exemption for attorney work product prepared in anticipation of litigation.we affirm that judgment.while foia exists to facilitate greater government transparency,the government has as much right to undisclosed legal advice in anticipation of litigation as any private party.
appellee usaid is a federal agency that finances and oversees development projects in foreign countries under the government foreign assistance program.see et.usaid responsibilities include carrying out development activities in egypt.see.one of usaid projects was the construction of a system of water and sewage treatment facilities for the aswan cities in upper egypt.while usaid financed the project,the national organization for potable water and sanitary drainage nopwasd served as the egyptian government agency implementing the project.
in usaid retained the engineering firm camp dresser mckee international,cdm to design the waste and sewage treatment facilities and to provide construction,administration and management services for the project.in following a competitive bidding process,nopwasd awarded the construction contract to build cdm design to a joint venture between contrack international,and morrison knudsen international,the jv.the jv contract conformed with usaid host country contracting mechanism.under this framework,construction firms directly contract with the implementing agency of the host government,while usaid retains certain approval rights,including the right to approve material changes to the contract,such as the level of compensation.
in september,the jv asked nopwasd for an additional million to compensate for time delays.in april,cdm in its capacity as project engineer evaluated the jv request and found that the compensation should be substantially lower.cdm and the jv met several times,yet failed to resolve the dispute.in may at usaid urging,cdm hired richard roy of roy associates as a neutral third party to evaluate the negotiation process,the parties positions,and the impediments to settlement.roy contract provided that he was to provide a final report roy report of his findings to nopwasd and usaid.roy contract neither permitted nor provided for disclosure to any other party.the construction dispute still has not been resolved,and the jv has threatened to sue usaid and cdm to secure the compensation to which it claims entitlement.
appellant mark hanson is a partner in the law firm representing one of the jv members.in february,hanson filed a foia request with usaid requesting the disclosure of a number of documents related to the dispute,including the roy report.usaid produced most of these documents,but refused to produce the roy report on the grounds that it fell under the deliberative process and attorney privileges of b.
hanson filed suit in district court claiming that usaid had unlawfully withheld the roy report.the district court granted usaid motion for summary judgment and ruled that the withheld document was exempt from disclosure under b,because it constituted attorney work product prepared in anticipation of litigation.although roy voluntarily released a draft of his report to the jv during the course of the foia litigation,the district court held that usaid had not authorized roy to do this and thus had not waived its right to claim the foia exemption.hanson appealed the district court decision to this court.
the question of whether a district court properly granted the government summary judgment in a foia action is one of law which we review de novo.ethyl,cir.foia provides that,subject to certain statutory exemptions,federal agencies shall upon any request for records which reasonably describe such records make the records promptly available to any person.a a.the basic purpose of foia is to ensure an informed citizenry,vital to the functioning of a democratic society,needed to check against corruption and to hold the governors accountable to the governed.robbins tire rubber,d.
nonetheless,foia specifies nine exemptions from its general disclosure provisions.b.these exemptions are designed to safeguard various public interests against the harms that would arise from overbroad disclosure.in general,foia exemptions should be narrowly construed to favor disclosure.bowers of justice,cir.the burden of demonstrating that a requested document falls under an exemption rests on the government.city of virginia beach,dep t of commerce,cir a b.the government can meet this burden by describing the withheld material with reasonable specificity and explaining how it falls under one of the enumerated exemptions.miscavige,cir.as a general rule,these and all other foia determinations should be resolved on summary judgment.id.at.
the relevant exemption here is exemption.exemption provides that foia disclosure rules do not apply to interagency or intraagency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.b.courts have interpreted exemption to exclude from disclosure documents produced under the attorney work product doctrine and the deliberative process privilege.sears,roebuck,d.
to determine whether the district court properly found that usaid could withhold the roy report under exemption,we consider three issues.first,we must analyze whether usaid enjoyed an relationship with roy,such that the privilege would even apply to communications between them.see upjohn united states,d.second,we must determine whether the roy report fell under the attorney work product exemption to foia.see b.third,we must consider whether roy unilateral release of the report to the jv amounted to a waiver of this privilege.see in re doe,cir.we shall examine each of these issues in turn.
the privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential information known to the common law.upjohn,at.the supreme court has long recognized that the privilege merits special protection to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.id.at.thus,if a party demonstrates that privilege applies,the privilege affords all communications between attorney and client absolute and complete protection from disclosure.in re allen,cir.this privilege protects not only the giving of professional advice to those who can act on it but also the giving of information to the lawyer to enable him to give sound and informed advice.upjohn,at.
here hanson challenges the existence of an relationship.he asserts that no relationship exists because roy was not retained as a lawyer,but rather as a construction consultant to observe the dispute negotiations.but the incontrovertible fact of this case is that roy is indeed a lawyer.roy was educated as an engineer and had extensive experience in many facets of the construction industry.but roy brochure also held him out to be a lawyer with a degree from tulane law school.the brochure further laid out roy memberships in multiple state bars and other bar organizations.it underscored his extensive experience in dispute resolution and other tasks,noting that as a member of the american arbitration association he has arbitrated and mediated over disputes,resolving hundreds of millions of dollars in claims.it is clear that roy both advertised himself and was hired by cdm as a lawyer who could bri
