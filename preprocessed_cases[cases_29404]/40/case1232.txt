opinion of the court 
daniel sattele appeals the district court denial of his summary judgment motion seeking qualified immunity in a suit brought by allen jones alleging that sattele,among others,had retaliated against him for exercising his first amendment rights.because jones did not allege that sattele deprived him of a constitutional because even if he had,that right was not clearly established at the time sattele engaged in the alleged conclude that sattele is entitled to qualified immunity.we therefore reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural history 
in may,jones was hired as a special investigator for the pennsylvania office of inspector general oig the oig is responsible for investigating allegations of fraud,waste,misconduct,and abuse in executive agencies of the commonwealth.at the time of the events at issue in this case,sattele was an investigations manager at oig and was jones supervisor.
in mid to,jones was given a lead role in the investigation of steve fiorello,the chief pharmacist at harrisburg state hospital.there was only one other person assigned to the investigation.a few weeks after the investigation began,jones told sattele that he was concerned about problems in the pharmaceutical industry that went beyond the fiorello that he believed the industry was routinely bribing state officials.jones informed sattele that he wanted to broaden the fiorello investigation to include the entire pharmaceutical industry.thereafter,jones continued to inform sattele about his concerns regarding the industry.
in response,sattele told jones to stay focused on the fiorello investigation and not to investigate corruption in the pharmaceutical industry as a whole.sattele subsequently removed jones from his lead role in the fiorello investigation in september because jones had,in sattele words,lost focus.sattele based this conclusion on the fact that jones continued to voice concerns about the entire pharmaceutical industry even after sattele had told him to concentrate only on fiorello.
in october,dwight mckee,one of jones colleagues at oig,filed a complaint against other oig employees,alleging that they had retaliated against him for exercising his first amendment rights.in november,an amended complaint was filed,joining jones as a plaintiff and sattele as a defendant.jones brought a cause of action under,alleging that sattele and the other defendants had also retaliated against him for exercising his first amendment rights.jones claimed generally that he was retaliated intimidation and harassment by his complaining to his supervisors that public corruption investigations were being obstructed and delayed for reasons that were not legitimate.
in particular,at his deposition jones identified three comments by sattele that he perceived as harassment in retaliation for his refusal to stop voicing his concerns about the pharmaceutical industry first,he testified that sattele told him that 
mac mckee was torpedoed.some of the things that he got maybe he deserved,but a lot of them he did.he was torpedoed.you keep your mouth shut mac has been torpedoed,keep your mouth shut or the same thing can happen to you.
in a similar vein,jones recalled that sattele told him,in early october,that if jones could not adjust to the way oig operated,he would have to leave his employment there.
second,jones testified that sattele told him to quit being a salmon,by which he meant that jones should quit swimming against the current with the pharmaceutical case.sattele testified at his deposition that he told jones to go with the flow and not swim against the current because he was concerned that jones was not working with the lawyers in the office and was not operating within a team concept.
third,jones related an incident that occurred in october,after he had been removed as of the fiorello investigation.jones stated that thereafter he was not allowed to speak to anyone about the investigation without sattele permission.he nevertheless went to pick up documents from fiorello,the target of the investigation,while sattele and another of his supervisors were out of the office.jones testified that,when he got back,sattele met him first thing,took him into a room with another oig colleague,and demanded to know why he went without sattele permission to pick up papers.jones also stated that sattele and his colleague accused jones of having had an interview with the director of the department of public welfare,something jones denied.
all defendants moved for summary judgment in august,and the district court granted the motion with respect to all defendants except sattele in february.as for jones claims against sattele,the district court determined,based on the three comments identified by jones,that with respect to sattele,jones has presented evidence that could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that his requests to investigate the pharmaceutical industry were a substantial or motivating factor in the retaliatory harassment or intimidation he may have suffered and it could not decide whether sattele had qualified immunity absent a factual determination as to whether sattele conduct constituted retaliatory harassment.in its decision,the district court also determined that jones was not disciplined in connection with voicing his concerns about the pharmaceutical industry and that a t no time during his employment has jones job classification,pay,or benefits been reduced or altered.sattele now appeals from the denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.
ii.jurisdiction standard of review 
the district court had federal question jurisdiction over jones claim pursuant to.we have appellate jurisdiction under and the collateral order doctrine.see doe groody,cir a denial of qualified immunity that turns on an issue of than a factual within the collateral order doctrine that treats certain decisions as final within the meaning of.citing,inter alia,behrens pelletier,d forbes twp.of lower merion,cir when a defendant moves for summary judgment based on qualified immunity,the denial of the motion may be appealed immediately under the doctrine because t he entitlement is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability and is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.quoting mitchell forsyth,d alterations,emphasis,and omission in original 
we exercise plenary review over the district court conclusions of law in its qualified immunity analysis.doe,at.in addition,we may review whether the set of facts identified by the district court is sufficient to establish a violation of a clearly established constitutional right,but we may not consider whether the district court correctly identified the set of facts that the summary judgment record is sufficient to prove.forbes,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we note also that at this stage of the litigation we are looking at the facts as presented by jones,satelle statements were retaliatory,rather than the exercise by satelle of appropriate supervisory limits on jones performance of his assignment.
iii.discussion 
qualified immunity insulates government officials performing discretionary functions from suit insofar as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.id.at quoting anderson creighton,d.to determine whether an official has lost his or her qualified immunity,we must first decide whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged doe,at quoting saucier katz,d omission in original.if the answer to that question is yes,we must then consider whether the right was clearly established.id.at quoting saucier,at.if we also answer yes to the second question,we must conclude that the official does not have qualified immunity.
sattele contends that he is entitled to qualified immunity because his three statements to jones about his work on the fiorello investigation did not deprive jones of his first amendment rights,and even if jones did allege a violation of a constitutional right,that right was not clearly established at the time sat
