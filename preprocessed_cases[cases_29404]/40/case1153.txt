in this appeal we conclude that a district attorney use of the extradition process rather than accepting an accused offer to return for a preliminary hearing when scheduled did not establish a constitutional violation.we also decide that a police officer affidavit of probable cause was not deficient because the statute of limitations had expired before a criminal complaint was filed.moreover,we conclude that portions of a transcript of a preliminary hearing may be considered in connection with the defendants motions to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.we are in agreement with the district court that judgment should be entered in favor of the police officer and district attorney in claims brought under and state tort law.
in december of,a jury awarded substantial damages to carolyn sands following a trial that concerned a contractual dispute over the sale of a business to sherry wagner and others.one of the issues in that case was whether sands had improperly withdrawn funds from a company bank account after the sale.in march of,a new trial was granted.the trial court wrote that sands illegally withdrew at least before the closing from the bank account of the corporation,and after the closing illegally appropriated the entire bank account for her own use.
following the grant of a new trial,wagner contacted defendant sergeant robert mccormick of the berwick police department in columbia county,pennsylvania.she demanded that he file criminal charges against sands for forgery and theft.on april,mccormick filed a criminal complaint against sands before the state district magistrate charging her with counts of forgery and counts of theft by deception.he included in the complaint an affidavit of probable cause that described specific information he received from wagner,including some bank records that he had examined,and also directly quoted the trial court opinion that granted the new trial.
on may,the magistrate issued a warrant for sands arrest listing an address of freeport lane,naples,florida.on june,the warrant was reissued with a notation declared a fugitive.on july,sands was arrested at her home in florida and taken to the county jail where she was detained until released on bail on july.
sands alleges that upon her release she telephoned defendant gary norton,district attorney of columbia county,and told him that once a hearing date was set she would voluntarily return to pennsylvania when requested.it appears that on august,in a letter to the magistrate,attorney kim hill advised that he represented sands and asked that he be notified of the date of the preliminary hearing.
on october,district attorney norton signed a petition for a governor warrant requesting sands extradition that listed an address at ivory cane point,naples,florida.the application stated that sands was a fugitive from pennsylvania and that any delay in her prosecution occurred because the p ersons whereabout sic was unknown.
on november,she was again arrested at her florida home and remained in a county jail there until november when she was transported to pennsylvania in handcuffs and shackles.she was released on bail in pennsylvania on her arrival there.sands alleges that district attorney norton knew that she had retained attorneys in pennsylvania and florida before he applied for the governor warrant and that defendants did not inform her of the date of her hearing before the second arrest.
a preliminary hearing was held before the magistrate on december.after hearing testimony from wagner,the magistrate ordered sands to answer the charges in the court of common pleas of columbia county.sands counsel then asked the court to quash the information because the relevant statutes of limitations had expired.on march,the court of common pleas granted the motion and dismissed the charges.
sands then filed this civil rights action in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania claiming damages under for false arrest and false imprisonment against sergeant mccormick and for false arrest against district attorney norton.she also asserted state law claims of malicious prosecution,abuse of civil process and intentional infliction of emotional distress against both defendants.
sands based the claims against sergeant mccormick primarily on the allegations that he filed the complaint and affidavit of probable cause knowing that the statute of limitations had expired on the charges and that they were based on insufficient facts.she also alleged that sergeant mccormick requested the governor warrant knowing that sands was not a fugitive and refused to take steps to have it rescinded.
the district court dismissed the claims for false arrest and false imprisonment and the state law claim for malicious prosecution against sergeant mccormick because he had probable cause to file the criminal complaint.the district court found that sergeant mccormick properly relied on the information he received from wagner,including the bank records and the comments in the order granting a new trial in the contractual dispute.the district court observed that the running of the limitations period was not relevant to the existence of probable cause and did not become an issue until raised as a defense in sands motion to dismiss the charges in the court of common pleas.
the district court also dismissed the state law claims against sergeant mccormick for malicious prosecution,abuse of process,and intentional infliction of emotional distress on the ground that he was entitled to immunity under the pennsylvania political subdivision tort claims act.tort claims act.et,since he acted in his official capacity and in good faith.
sands assertions against the district attorney were similar to those against sergeant mccormick,but were not identical.sands based her claims against the district attorney primarily on allegations that in his administrative capacity he authorized sands arrest,then signed the criminal information knowing that the statute of limitations had expired and that the charges lacked probable cause.she also alleged that he requested and refused to rescind the governor warrant knowing that sands was not a fugitive.
the district court rejected the claim for false arrest against the district attorney because he was entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity for his actions.the district court declined to accept sands characterization of norton activities as administrative,concluding that they were intimately connected with the judicial phase of the prosecution.
as to the state tort claims,the district court held that because norton acted in his official capacity as a prosecutor and acted in good faith based on probable cause,he was immune under the.tort claims act.moreover,the court held that the malicious prosecution claim lacked merit because the district attorney did not initiate the process,the abuse of process claim failed because sands did not properly allege a perversion of process,and the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim was invalid because the district attorney conduct was not extreme and outrageous.therefore,the state law claims against the district attorney were dismissed.
on appeal,sands raises three principal arguments 
sergeant mccormick did not have probable cause to arrest sands because he was aware that the statute of limitations had expired.
the district attorney failure to timely schedule a hearing and his false statements in the application for the governor warrant despite sands offer to return to pennsylvania once he advised her of the date of the hearing were administrative actions not protected by absolute immunity.
the district court improperly relied on documents outside the complaint and its exhibits in ruling on the federal rule of civil procedure b motion to dismiss.

we first address sands contention that the district court erred in referring to the following two documents attached to the defendants motions to dismiss the march,trial court order granting a new trial in the contract action and the transcript of the preliminary hearing in december of.she asserts that by doing so the district court converted the defendants motions into requests for summary judgment without giving her notice or an opportunity to respond

we have no difficulty concluding that the district court properly considered the challenged documents when it found that there was probable cause to file the charges because sergeant mccormick knew of the trial court order.in reaching this conclusion,it was not necessary to determine the truth of the trial courts comments that sands actions were illegal.it was enough that sergeant mccormick took the opinion into account to some extent in finding probable cause.
likewise,the transcript of the preliminary hearing in december was a public document and had a bearing on the controversy.wagner detailed testimony of sands actions with respect to the bank account explained the facts underlying mccormick affidavit of probable cause.the district judge cited the hearing to show that sands was required to answer to the charges in the court of common pleas.moreover,sands should not have been surprised by the inclusion of the preliminary hearing transcript.in his motion to dismiss in the district court,sergeant mccormick referred to the transcript and argued that the document should be considered according to pension benefit,at.sands merely responded by briefly noting her objection to the additional evidence included by sergeant mccormick and did not elaborate on her position.we do not find merit in sands claims that the district court erred in considering the transcript of the hearing and the opinion in the contractual dispute.
the principal claims against sergeant mccormick are that there was no probable cause to apply for the arrest warrant and that he wrongfully participated in the issuance of the governor warrant.sands does not focus on the district court conclusion that sergeant mccormick had sufficient evidence to believe that she committed the offenses.instead,she argues that sergeant mccormick did not have probable cause in the sense that he knew that the statute of limitations had expired.
sands argument is based on the faulty premise that the statute of limitations is a relevant consideration at the time a police officer files charges.the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that is to be ruled upon by a court of competent jurisdiction.
sands would place far more responsibility on police officers than is required by their calling.to begin with,the application of the limitations period is not a clear cut matter in criminal prosecutions.in some circumstances tolling is applicable.provides that the statute of limitations may be extended in certain circumstances,including when the accused is continuously absent from the commonwealth.const.stat.moreover,late discovery of an offense may allow for longer limitations periods in crimes involving fraud.see.c providing that even if the statute of limitations has expired,a prosecution may nevertheless be commenced for any offense a material element of which is either fraud or a breach of fiduciary obligation within one year after discovery of the offense by an aggrieved party.the mere passage of time since the commission of an offense does not warrant an automatic application of the statute of limitations in a criminal proceeding.
in pickens hollowell,cir,the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit held,
police officers have no responsibility to determine the viability of a statute of limitations defense when executing a valid arrest warrant.the existence of a statute of limitations bar is a legal question that is appropriately evaluated by the district attorney or by a court after a prosecution is begun w hether a valid statute of limitations defense exists is not a cut and dry matter.
id.at.see also williams city of albany,cir.although sands claims are based on the presumed knowledge of sergeant mccormick at the time he presented the affidavit of probable cause,we think the rationale of pickens applies to justify his action.
sands relies on lee mihalich,wl,where the court denied summary judgment in favor of a police officer because there was no evidence to suggest that a reasonably competent police officer would prosecute with the awareness that the charges were barred by the statute of limitations.id.at.we do not agree with that opinion characterization of a police officer responsibility.a police officer has limited training in the law and requiring him to explore the ramifications of the statute of limitations affirmative defense is too heavy a burden.
we note that the dates of the offenses were disclosed in the affidavit of probable cause that was submitted to the magistrate,who may be expected to have more knowledge of the statute of limitations than a police officer.there is no indication that the magistrate had any hesitancy about issuing the arrest warrant.
the court of common pleas decision to quash the information on statute of limitations grounds does not adversely reflect on sergeant mccormick application for the arrest warrant.at that early point,the status of the limitations defense was undetermined and open for further consideration.
in short,we conclude that the district court properly dismissed the claims under against sergeant mccormick because he had probable cause for his actions.we agree that the district court correctly dismissed the state claims against sergeant mccormick for malicious prosecution,abuse of process,and intentional infliction of emotional distress because he was immune from suit under the.tort claims act.see.see also sanford stiles,cir.
we will therefore affirm the judgment in favor of sergeant mccormick.
on appeal,sands contends that the district attorney was not entitled to immunity because he failed to schedule a preliminary hearing and applied for a governor warrant for the second arrest.she contends that his actions were administrative in nature and hence absolute immunity is not applicable.
we need not reach the question of whether the district attorney actions fall within the scope of qualified immunity,however,because sands has not alleged facts that amount to a constitutional violation.in saucier katz,d,the supreme court decided that before ruling on immunity in cases,courts should first determine whether a constitutional violation has been alleged.id.at.we must decide preliminarily,therefore,whether the claims that the district attorney caused illegal arrests and violated sands due process rights are valid.this determination requires a reference to the process and the district attorney role.
in pennsylvania,a preliminary hearing to address the validity of charges filed is not scheduled until the defendant appears for an arraignment before a magistrate in the judicial district where the warrant was issued.f.at tha
