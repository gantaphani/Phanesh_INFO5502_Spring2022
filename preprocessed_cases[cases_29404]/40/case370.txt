before the court is an appeal from the denial of a motion for summary judgment by three police officers in an action alleging excessive force in violation of and maine law.following the recommendation of the magistrate judge,the district court denied summary judgment based on qualified immunity to three officers who fired at the plaintiff while he was on the ground,already shot.the magistrate judge reasoned that the affidavit of a witness who observed the shooting from a nearby apartment created a material issue of fact as to whether the officers used excessive force.specifically,the magistrate judge concluded that the affidavit,which stated that the plaintiff did not have a hammer in his hands,disputed whether the officers could reasonably perceive that the plaintiff continued to present a threat after he was on the ground.
on de novo review of the record we conclude that the key elements of the event are not disputed,even crediting all of the plaintiff competent evidence.a question of law is thus presented as to whether the officers used excessive force in continuing to shoot at the plaintiff.the plaintiff himself does not recall the events at issue.we find that on the undisputed facts,the officers did not use excessive force and are entitled to immunity.we reverse and remand for the entry of judgment for defendants.
factual and procedural background 
we set forth the background facts generally from the record,drawing inferences in favor of the plaintiff.we describe the key facts more specifically later in the analysis.
on the evening of december,vincent berube set out to commit suicide.he parked his truck in a vacant lot in lewiston,maine,and began to slit his wrists and stab himself in the chest.he was interrupted when a car pulled up behind him.assuming it was a police car,berube left the lot and drove to the parking area behind the lewiston police station to,in his words,raise a little hell.
as berube drove his truck into the compound,officer carly conley walked out of the back door of the police station toward her cruiser in the compound.she heard the truck door open,which was followed by yelling and screaming and the sound of windows being smashed.conley approached the truck,and believing the driver to be highly agitated,she radioed for backup.as she rounded the back of the truck and came within ten feet of berube,she saw him raise a shining object,which appeared to her to be a large hammer.officer conley is five feet,three inches tall and weighs pounds,while berube appeared to be about six feet tall and weigh pounds.conley yelled to berube to stop and put his weapon down.believing berube would strike her,conley fired at him until he fell to the ground.
meanwhile,officers eric syphers and matthew vierling arrived at the scene with their weapons drawn.they had heard shots but did not know who had fired.they saw berube lying on his right side with his back toward them,his hands not visible.syphers ordered berube to stay down and show his hands.berube began to roll over toward them,and as berube right hand became visible,syphers saw a object in his hand.vierling and syphers,having heard the shots and seeing a metallic object,believed that berube was armed and was positioning himself to fire.syphers ordered berube to stop moving and show his hands.when berube did not respond,vierling and syphers fired until berube stopped trying to get up.
according to the dispatch recording of conley call for backup,ten seconds elapsed between conley call and the end of the incident,which took place on a dark and rainy night.
berube was arrested and later hospitalized.he was indicted by the androscoggin county grand jury for criminal threatening with the use of a dangerous weapon a hammer by intentionally or knowingly placing officer conley in fear of imminent bodily injury.berube pleaded guilty to the charge on september.
on november,berube filed this action against 
officers conley,syphers and vierling,alleging the use of excessive force in violation of and state law.ann.tit,wanton or oppressive use of force.ann.tit,the maine civil rights act mcra and.ann.tit,et,the maine tort claims act mtca.defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.berube submitted,inter alia,an affidavit and statement by jennifer boren.
the magistrate judge recommended denial of the motion to the extent that the three officers shot berube while he was on the ground,finding that there was a dispute of material fact created by the boren affidavit about whether berube had a hammer and presented a threat to the officers,and thus whether a reasonable officer would have known that shooting berube while he was on the ground and posed no threat to the officers was a constitutional violation.the district court affirmed the recommended decision and granted the motion as to any claims for violation of substantive or procedural due process and for the use of excessive force by conley in circumstances where the plaintiff conviction in state court for criminal threatening necessarily involved the plaintiff placing conley in fear of imminent bodily injury by the plaintiff.in all other respects the motion was denied.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
berube contends that we lack jurisdiction to entertain this appeal from the denial of summary judgment.he cites johnson jones,d,for the proposition that interlocutory review is precluded where the district court has denied summary judgment on the ground that facts material to the decision on qualified immunity are disputed.but johnson does not bar this appeal.even accepting berube version of events,except so far as it would contradict his guilty plea,it is a question of law whether on the facts so assumed there is any violation of law.behrens pelletier,d berthiaume caron,cir.thus we may consider this appeal on the basis of the facts offered or not disputed by berube.whether such a set of assumed facts constitutes a constitutional violation is a question of law we review de novo.santana calderon,cir berthiaume,at.
qualified immunity 
this circuit applies a test for qualified immunity.defendants are entitled to qualified immunity unless the facts alleged show the defendants conduct violated a constitutional right,and the contours of this right are clearly established under law such that a reasonable officer would have known that his conduct was unlawful.santana,at.see also riverdale mills pimpare,cir.
an officer use of deadly force is subject to the reasonableness requirement of the fourth amendment.tennessee garner,d.the test is whether the officer conduct was objectively reasonable,graham conner,d,that is,whether the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others,garner,at.qualified immunity shields a reasonable officer as judged by this objective standard.anderson creighton,d noting that immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law quoting malley briggs,d internal quotation marks omitted.
we have said that the supreme court standard of reasonableness is comparatively generous to the police in cases where potential danger,emergency conditions or other exigent circumstances are present.roy inhabitants of city of lewiston,cir.and we noted that under graham,the calculus of reasonableness must make allowance for the need of police officers to make split second circumstances that are tense,uncertain and rapidly the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.id.quoting graham,at.see also malley,at.stating that qualified immunity leaves ample room for mistaken judgments.
c.the undisputed facts 
we turn now to the record to determine whether,on the facts offered by berube or not disputed by him,the use of force by the officers was reasonable.this appeal concerns the denial of immunity for the claim that the shots that hit berube after he was on the ground constituted excessive force.the key facts concern the shots fired by conley after berube fell to the ground and the conduct of the two officers who came to conley aid.the pertinent fa
