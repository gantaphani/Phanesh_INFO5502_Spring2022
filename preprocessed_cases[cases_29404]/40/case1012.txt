opinion of the court 
new jersey wine enthusiasts,a new jersey couple who seeks access to more kosher wines,and a california brought suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey against jerry fischer,new jersey director of alcoholic beverage control,alleging that several aspects of new jersey alcoholic beverage control law abc law infringe on the dormant commerce clause in violation of.
new jersey law,like the laws of many states,establishes a structure for alcohol distribution and sales.pursuant to that structure,alcoholic beverages are sold by suppliers and manufacturers to wholesalers,who in turn sell to retailers,who then sell alcohol to consumers.in granholm heald,the supreme court reaffirmed the view expressed by five justices in north dakota united states,that such a system is unquestionably legitimate.granholm,at citing north dakota,at plurality op.id.at scalia,concurring in the judgment.the granholm court nevertheless cautioned that straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local producers of alcoholic beverages by,for instance,subjecting producers,but not local ones,to the system,are contrary to the commerce clause and not saved by the states authority to regulate alcoholic beverages under the amendment.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted.
plaintiffs filed this suit in,contending that five aspects of new jersey laws regulating wine contravene this nondiscrimination principle in violation of the dormant commerce clause.the first two statutory provisions at issue involve privileges relating to the sale of wine to consumers and retailers that are afforded to wineries that obtain new jersey plenary or farm winery licenses,but not to wineries lacking such licenses.plenary licenses may be obtained by producers that grow and cultivat e grapes on at least three acres on,or adjacent to,the winery premises,but only if the wine is produced,blended,fortified,or treated by the licensee on its licensed premises situated in the state of new jersey.stat.ann.farm winery licenses,meanwhile,are available to wineries which produce less than gallons of wine per year and which,for the first five years of the operation of the winery,produce wine that is from at least grapes or fruit grown in the state of new jersey.id.holders of either type of license wineries may sell their wines at retail to consumers at the winery and at six salesrooms apart from the winery premises.id.wineries are also permitted to sell their wines to wholesalers and retailers.id.wineries that do not hold either a plenary or a farm winery license wineries,by contrast,must funnel their wines through the system by selling to wholesalers.
plaintiffs also challenge two aspects of new jersey rules regarding the personal importation of wine.stat.a provides in pertinent part as follows 
alcoholic beverages intended in good faith solely for personal use may be transported,by the owner thereof,in a vehicle other than that of the holder of a transportation license,from a point outside this state to the extent of one gallon of wine within any consecutive period of hours provided,however,that except pursuant to and within the terms of a license or permit issued by the director,no person shall transport into this state or receive from without this state into this state,alcoholic beverages where the alcoholic beverages are transported or received from a state which prohibits the transportation into that state of alcoholic beverages purchased or otherwise obtained in the state of new jersey.if any person or persons desire to transport alcoholic beverages intended only for personal use in quantities in excess of those,an application may be made to the director who may,upon being satisfied of the good faith of the applicant,and upon payment of a fee issue a special permit limited by such conditions as the director may impose,authorizing the transportation of alcoholic beverages in quantities in excess of those.
plaintiffs challenge both the cap on importation and the reciprocity provision prohibiting importation of wine from states that bar the entry of new jersey wine.
finally,plaintiffs seek to invalidate new jersey ban on direct shipments of wine from wineries to consumers via common carrier.when plaintiffs filed suit in,the abc law allowed,but not,wineries to make such shipments.however,in anticipation of granholm,which invalidated similar provisions of michigan and new york law,the new jersey legislature rescinded this privilege,resulting in a ban on all direct shipments of wine from producers to new jersey residents.
after three new jersey associates,r r marketing,and allied beverage in the district court on behalf of the defendant,the parties filed for summary judgment,contesting plaintiffs standing to sue,and the validity of the above portions of new jersey abc law.the district court held that plaintiffs met the applicable standing requirements,and that the challenged provisions were largely constitutional.both sides appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to

we first consider whether plaintiffs robert and judy freeman have standing to sue.the freemans describe themselves as wine collectors and home winemakers who travel to the west coast several times each year in order to visit wineries.they allege that the abc law has prevented them from obtaining several wines they would like to drink,but which are unavailable in new jersey stores.the freemans state that they would ideally like to receive direct shipments from wineries,but they also assert that new jersey law allows them to buy,but not,wines directly from producers at wineries and storefronts,and traveling to distant wineries in order to return with small quantities of wine is highly impracticable.
the freemans argue that they are unable to obtain wines that they desire via interstate commerce.in addressing the same argument,the seventh circuit has concluded that when plaintiffs want to drink wines that are not carried by resellers and are prevented from otherwise obtaining those wines by state law,they have establishe d injury in fact.bridenbaugh,cir accord baude.heath,wl,at,rev in part on other grounds,cir cherry hill vineyards,llc hudgins,d,aff sub nom.cherry hill vineyards,llc lilly,cir.we agree.the freemans are directly constrained by the provisions of the abc law preventing the importation of more than a gallon of wine without a special permit,and any wine from states that prohibit the importation of new jersey wines.moreover,although the freemans are not in the business of selling alcoholic beverages and therefore could not violate the other statutory provisions at issue if they tried,bridenbaugh,at,cognizable injury from unconstitutional discrimination against interstate commerce does not stop at members of the class against whom a state ultimately discriminates,motors tracy.rather,customers of that class may also be injured.id.as a result,the allege that new jersey law discriminates against the wineries of which they are suffered an injury in fact.
the question then becomes whether the freemans injury is fairly traceable to the statutes at issue.as an initial matter,we reject defendant contention that the traceability prong is not met because new jersey statutory scheme does not,in fact,offend the dormant commerce clause.standing in no way depends on the merits of the plaintiff contention that the particular conduct is illegal marion tdi,cir quoting warth seldin.the question for purposes of the traceability prong is not whether the abc law is unconstitutionally discriminatory,but rather whether,be it and constitutional or not,it is causally connected to plaintiffs injury in fact.we thus consider whether plaintiffs have presented evidence that each of the challenged provisions impedes their ability to purchase wine in interstate commerce.
the first two of plaintiffs challenges are to provisions of new jersey law that effectively allow wineries to sell directly to consumers and retailers,but forbid wineries from engaging in sales to anyone but wholesalers.the question as to traceability is whether these provisions exclude wine from new jersey that would otherwise appear on the market,thereby limiting the number of wines that the freemans may purchase.cutting against the view that the freemans are traceably injured by their resultant inability to purchase a wide array of wines is the fact that the record does not clearly establish that any wineries would,but for the statute,open retail sales rooms in new jersey.pointing in the other direction is record evidence that many wineries have attempted,without success,to interest new jersey wholesalers in their wines,and that other wineries will not try either to enter the system via a wholesaler,because doing do so would cut deeply into profits or obtain their own wholesaler license,which can be prohibitively expensive.plaintiffs,in other words,have presented evidence that numerous wineries have,without success,sought alternative ways to enter the new jersey marketplace.we conclude that,taken in the aggregate,this evidence suffices to show that part of plaintiffs injury is traceable to new jersey choice to deny wineries the ability to sell directly both to retailers and to consumers.
plaintiffs have also presented evidence that they would return from their winery trips with more wine if new jersey law so allowed.accordingly,part of their inability to buy certain wines may be traced to the transportation restrictions in the abc law and there is little question that the freemans injury partially traces to the direct shipment ban.they have attempted to order wine shipments from at least five wineries,each of which has refused to make the shipments.plaintiffs have also presented evidence,both drawn from their own experience and in the form of a federal trade commission report,that a sizeable number of wineries sell their wine exclusively via direct shipment.taken together,this evidence is more than adequate to demonstrate that there is a fairly traceable connection between the alleged injury in fact and the direct shipment ban.toll,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the same evidence that demonstrates causation suffices,in this case,to demonstrate redressability removing the restrictions placed by the abc law on consumers and wineries would,on this record,lead to greater availability of a greater number of wines that plaintiffs wish to purchase 
the freemans also have prudential standing to challenge the statutory provisions at issue.while defendant argues that the freemans,who knew plaintiffs counsel in this case before it was filed,are thereby without a personal stake in its outcome,there is no evidence that the freemans œnophilia,upon which their standing is grounded,is anything but sincere,or that they are actually attempting to litigate an interest held by their attorneys.similarly,there is no indication that the freemans have come to court with a generalized grievance their injury as wine enthusiasts who wish to purchase certain wines is a highly particularized one.
the remaining question as to the freemans,then,is whether or not they fall within the zone of interests protected by the dormant commerce clause.insofar as the regulations directly affect the freemans as individuals participating in commerce,they have standing to redress their dormant commerce clause right to access interstate markets.oxford,at.the freemans may accordingly proceed with their challenge to the importation restrictions,which directly regulate their participation in interstate commerce.
the other provisions,by contrast,directly regulate producers,not consumers and we have not previously addressed the issue of whether dormant commerce clause plaintiffs have prudential standing when they are not directly regulated by the statute at issue.see id.at reserving this question.we now hold that such plaintiffs can come within the zone of interests if their ability to freely contract with companies was directly infringed by local regulation.id.at barry,dissenting.we adopt this rule because such plaintiffs seek to vindicate interests related to the protection of interstate commerce.in particular,plaintiffs who seek to protect the right as a consumer to purchase services across state boundaries assert interests closely related to the purposes of the dormant commerce clause.huish detergents,warren county,f d,cir.see also,oehrleins,ben oehrleins sons daughter hennepin county,cir suggesting that standing is appropriate where plaintiffs s eek to protect their own rights to purchase goods or do business across state borders.by contrast,plaintiffs are without prudential standing if their interest is unrelated to the asserted barrier to interstate commerce.on the green apartments city of tacoma,cir internal quotation marks omitted.for instance,plaintiffs who allege only that a party with whom they contract is subject to an undue burden on its ability to freely participate in interstate commerce are not within the zone of interests protected by the dormant commerce clause.oxford associates,at barry,dissenting.neither are plaintiffs whose interest is merely one in avoiding a fee or cost.see individuals for responsible gov t,washoe county,cir oehrleins,at see also,city of los angeles county of kern,cir as the name implies,the zone of interest test turns on the interest sought to be protected,not the harm suffered by the plaintiff.
in challenging the prohibitions on direct sales by wineries and the direct shipment ban,the freemans present themselves as consumers wishing to access products.their interest in overturning these features of new jersey law therefore dovetails with the purpose of the dormant commerce clause.the freemans accordingly satisfy the test as to all of the challenged provisions of the abc law.
t he presence of one plaintiff with standing is sufficient to satisfy that requirement.forum for academic institutional rights rumsfeld,cir citing bowsher synar,rev on other grounds.accordingly,having concluded that the freemans possess both constitutional and prudential standing to raise all of the claims at issue,we do not consider the standing of the other plaintiffs.
the dormant commerce clause prohibits the states from imposing restrictions that benefit economic interests at interests expense,thus reinforcing the principle of the unitary national market.am.trucking ass ns whitman,cir quoting cloverlandgreen spring dairies.milk mktg,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the clause therefore prohibits a state from impeding free market forces to shield businesses from competition.id.
any statute that discriminates against interstate commerce on its face or in effect is thus subject to heightened scrutiny.id.at.the party challenging the statute has the burden of proving that the statute is discriminatory.milk mktg,cir cloverland ii,but if the plaintiff meets that burden,the state must demonstrate that the statute serves a legitimate local interest,and that this purpose could not be served as well by available nondiscriminatory means,am.trucking ass ns,at.if the plaintiff does not meet its burden of showing that the statute is discriminatory,we instead use the balancing test set forth in pike bruce church,to determine whether the burdens on interstate commerce substantially outweigh the putative local benefits.cloverland ii,at.
historically,courts have struggled with the question of to what extent the dormant commerce clause applies in the context of alcoholic beverage restrictions,given the broad regulatory authority granted to states by section of the amendment in granholm,however,the supreme court reiterated that dormant commerce clause principles apply in the context of regulations on the shipment of wine.in fact,in the court view,it is essential to the foundations of the union that in all but the narrowest circumstances,state laws violate the commerce clause if they mandate differential treatment of and economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.granholm,at quoting or.waste,dep t of envtl.quality of.thus,the court held that section does not allow states to regulate the direct shipment of wine on terms that discriminate in favor of producers,id.at,and that straightforward attempts to discriminate in favor of local producers are not saved by the amendment,id.at.as a result,unless the state show s that the discrimination is demonstrably justified,statutes regulating alcohol that discriminate against interstate commerce must be invalidated.id.at quoting chem.waste,hunt.the granholm court,however,also held that the system itself is unquestionably legitimate,and that s tate policies are protected under the amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the same as its domestic equivalent.id.at quoting north dakota,at.
we first consider plaintiffs challenges to the statutory provisions allowing only wineries to sell directly to retailers and consumers.
in granholm,the supreme court clarified that t he mere fact of nonresidence should not foreclose a producer in one state from access to markets in other states.at.in particular,when all wine,but not all instate wine,must pass through an wholesaler and retailer before reaching consumers,t he discriminatory character of a system is obvious.id.at.thus,direct and indirect methods of subjecting wineries,but not local ones,to the system contravene the dormant commerce clause.id.at.
the abc law violates this rule by allowing,but not,wineries to sell directly to consumers.instate wineries are thereby allowed to skip the first two and wineries must involve both of these tiers in order for their wine to reach consumers.accordingly,these aspects of the abc law are subject to strict scrutiny as discriminatory on their face.
defendant and intervenors raise three arguments to the contrary,none of which is persuasive.first,defendant argues that,because each location at which an winery sells wine is considered to be a part of the winery premises,all sales are technically meaning that the law is,because,by definition,only new jersey wineries have premises in new jersey.this transparent attempt at obfuscation is,however,squarely at odds with the statutory language allowing wineries to sell wines in six salesrooms apart from the winery premises.stat.emphasis supplied.
second,defendant and intervenors asseverate that the law is because wineries may sell directly to consumers on their own premises in their home states.this argument misconceives the demands of the dormant commerce clause.the dormant commerce clause does not protect the rights of all wineries to engage in the same form of commerce it prohibits states from treating differently from wineries.see,granholm,at.because this regulation mandates differential treatment,it is discriminatory,even if the wineries are,in some sense,competing on an equal footing.
finally,intervenors argue that cherry hill vineyard,llc baldacci,cir,which upheld privileges given by maine to small wineries against a commerce clause challenge,should persuade us to uphold the provisions of the abc law.the statute in baldacci,however,made f arm winery licenses available on equal terms to instate and vineyards alike.id.at.in fact,the baldacci court explained that this aspect of the maine law was what protected it from the charge that it explicitly discriminate s against interstate commerce.id.because new jersey allows only wineries to sell directly to consumers,precisely this is absent from the provisions of the abc law.baldacci supports our view that the provisions of the abc law are facially discriminatory 
new jersey law also authorizes wineries to bypass wholesalers and sell directly to retailers.this privilege again allows,but not,wineries to circumvent portions of the system.as a result,it,too,is facially discriminatory against interstate commerce.
contrary to the district court conclusion,the discriminatory character of these provisions would not be cured by allowing wineries to become licensed wholesalers assuming,arguendo,that an winery may,under new jersey law,eliminate the use of wholesalers by purchasing such a license,any winery purchasing a wholesale license would nevertheless,unlike producers,be forced to proceed through each of the tiers of the system.moreover,a wholesaling license comes at a higher cost than a winery license,and with a different bundle of of which a winery seeking only to sell its own products to retailers would not use.in short,this path is simply an indirect way of subjecting wineries to the system,granholm,at,and the provisions allowing,but not,wineries to sell directly to retailers without using a wholesaler are therefore discriminatory.
neither defendant nor intervenors attempts to save the provisions of the abc law allowing wineries to make direct sales to consumers and retailers by arguing that they are necessary to serve some legitimate local purpose.accordingly,we hold that these portions of the abc law violate the dormant commerce clause.
as discussed above,stat.ann.a caps the importation of wine for personal use at one gallon unless the importing individual secures a special permit.absent such a permit,the statute also bans the importation of any alcoholic beverages from states that refuse to allow individuals to enter with alcohol from new jersey.plaintiffs again argue that these provisions facially discriminate against interstate commerce.
no party contends that the cap on the importation of wine is facially,and that provision does,in fact,treat and wine differently in a way that harms interstate commerce.specifically,the requirements that any individual seeking to enter new jersey with a greater amount of wine apply for a special permit,and pay a fee for the permit,directly burden interstate,but not intrastate,commerce.moreover,since new jersey wineries are currently able to sell unlimited quantities of wine to residents,this provision operates to limit the amount of,but not,wine that may circumvent the system.accordingly,this provision is also subject to strict scrutiny 
defendant nevertheless argues that the permit requirement serves local purposes that would not be as well served by legislation.in particular,fischer adopts the district court conclusion that the special permit serves as a registration mechanism,providing the state the authority to keep track of interstate sales for the purposes of taxation and,to a much lesser extent,to prohibit illegal activity.freeman fischer,d.but the district court,which apparently raised these issues sua sponte,cites to no evidence in the record for this proposition.neither does fischer,and our independent review of the record has not uncovered any evidence to support the notion that the permit serves local interests in tracking sales and squelching illegal activity.this absence of evidence is dispositive,because t he burden is on the state to show that the discrimination is demonstrably justified,and we may uph o ld state regulations that discriminate against interstate commerce only after finding,based on concrete record evidence,that a state nondiscriminatory alternatives will prove unworkable.granholm,at emphases supplied and omitted and internal quotation marks omitted.the district court unsupported assertion does not satisf y this exacting standard,id.at,and we accordingly hold that the permit requirement violates the dormant commerce clause.
the reciprocity provision of a also facially discriminates against interstate commerce.as with the permit fee,the reciprocity requirement prevents certain this case,wine from specified entering the state outside the strictures of the system,while local winemakers are free to sell as much wine as they can directly to new jersey residents.moreover,as the supreme court has noted,reciprocity provisions like new jersey risk generating the trade rivalries and animosities,the alliances and exclusivity,that the constitution and,in particular,the commerce clause were designed to avoid.granholm,at.
the district court nonetheless held that the reciprocity provision is constitutional because defendant interprets it not to apply to wine imported for personal use.when considering a facial challenge to a state law,a federal court must,of course,consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.brown city of pittsburgh,cir quoting vill.of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates.but we will only adopt a proffered limiting construction when the statute is actually susceptible to a construction that avoids constitutional difficulties.brown,at.in this case,defendant narrowing interpretation is contrary to the plain meaning of the statute.the statute provides in part that 
a lcoholic beverages intended in good faith solely for personal use may be transported,by the owner thereof from a point outside this state to the extent of one gallon of wine within any consecutive period of hours provided,however,that except pursuant to and within the terms of a license or permit issued by the director,no person shall transport into this state or receive from without this state into this state,alcoholic beverages where the alcoholic beverages are transported or received from a state which prohibits the transportation into that state of alcoholic beverages purchased or otherwise obtained in the state of new jersey.
stat.a.the reciprocity provision is thus a prohibitory exception from the rule delineating the quantities of alcohol that may otherwise be imported for personal use.as a result,the provision can not be read to contain an exception allowing importation for personal use,because to imply that exception would read the reciprocity clause out of the statute entirely.we therefore reject defendant limiting interpretation and subject the reciprocity provision to strict scrutiny.
as with the provisions regarding sales to consumers and retailers,no party has provided us with any argument that the reciprocity provision is necessary to effectuate some legitimate local interest.we thus hold it unconstitutional as violative of the dormant commerce clause.
finally,plaintiffs seek to invalidate new jersey ban on direct shipments of wine from any winery,whether or,to consumers while plaintiffs concede that this ban is not facially discriminatory,they argue that it is discriminatory in effect.to prevail on this argument,plaintiffs must show that the challenged state statute has extraterritorial effects that adversely affect economic production and hence interstate commerce in other states,thereby forcing producers or consumers in other states to surrender whatever competitive advantages they may possess.cloverland ii,at quoting distillers state liquor.
in their attempt to meet this burden,plaintiffs note that some wineries sell their goods only by direct shipment.but the choice by certain producers to conduct sales only by direct shipment is irrelevant to the constitutionality of the abc law,because the commerce clause does not place new jersey under an obligation to cater to the preferred marketing practices of businesses.see goldmen bureau of,cir holding that questions of the market structure and its method of operation are quite simply beyond the concern of the commerce clause quoting exxon governor of.
plaintiffs also contend that the direct shipment ban disproportionately affects wineries because those producers must funnel all of their wine through the system.but,assuming that this requirement disadvantages producers,it is not an effect of the forces all wine sales out of one channel and into other available by the features of the abc law invalidated above,which allow new jersey wineries to circumvent the system.this argument therefore also fails to demonstrate that the direct shipment ban is discriminatory in effect.
finally,plaintiffs contend that many consumers can not,or will not,undertake to travel to distant locations to purchase wine.even if true,this fact,standing alone,does not demonstrate that the direct shipment ban harms interstate commerce by privileging producers at the expense of wineries.and while several types of evidence could show such an effect,plaintiffs have failed to present any competent evidence that the ban burdens interstate commerce.the federal trade commission report on which they rely though critical of direct shipment bans,is silent as to the effects of new jersey law.plaintiffs also have not produced any other evidence that so much as a single penny of losses incurred by any producer is attributable to the allegedly discriminatory ban.baldacci,at.further,although the ban might be unconstitutional in its effects if it led to more new jersey wines,and fewer wines,being sold in new jersey,the record reflects that less than of wine sold in new jersey is grown in new fact that gives rise to the inference that no displacement of wines has occurred.plaintiffs have also failed to present evidence that consumers substitute wines purchased directly from vineyards for wines that they otherwise would have purchased from producers,or,in fact,that anyone besides the freemans purchases any wines at all directly from vineyards.id.at.nor do plaintiffs adduce any evidence that would in any way undermine the plausible impression that new jersey consumers like imbibers everywhere view trips to a winery as a distinct experience incommensurate therefore,unlikely to be replaced trip to either a mailbox or a retail liquor store.id.at.in short,the record contains no evidence that new jersey direct shipment ban harms interstate commerce in favor of intrastate commerce.
in fact,the gravamen of plaintiffs argument is not that jersey wines are excluded from the market,but rather that a subset of those wines,which are produced by small wineries that do not have much volume or perhaps capital,would only be able to enter the new jersey market via direct shipping,which is prohibited.but,as with wineries that deliver exclusively by mail order,the fact that consumers can not obtain a subset of wines because of the structure of the market and the business plans of the wineries in question does not render new jersey ban constitutionally infirm.see goldmen,at.and because plaintiffs bear the burden on this issue,the mere fact that a statutory regime has a discriminatory potential is not enough to trigger strict scrutiny.baldacci,at see also ass indus.of lohman,noting that the supreme court has never deemed a hypothetical possibility of favoritism to constitute discrimination that transgresses constitutional commands.we accordingly hold that plaintiffs have not met their burden of demonstrating that the direct shipment ban discriminates against interstate commerce in violation of the dormant commerce clause 
because plaintiffs do not argue in the alternative that the direct shipping ban fails the balancing test of pike bruce church,we reject their challenge to the direct shipping ban and affirm the district court opinion insofar as it held that ban to be constitutional.
having determined that the provisions of the abc law allowing wineries to sell directly to consumers and retailers,and limiting the importation of wine intended for personal consumption into new jersey violate the dormant commerce clause,we turn to the issue of the proper remedy.the invalid statutory provisions are constitutionally underinclusive,in that their provision of privileges to wineries alone renders them invalid.this deficiency can be remedied in one of two by declar ing the offending provisions a nullity and order ing that their benefits not extend to the class that the legislature intended to benefit,or by extend ing the coverage of the statute to include those who are aggrieved by the exclusion.heckler matthews.in this case,neither the parties nor the district court has expressly considered the choice between extension and nullification.for this reason,and because the choice between extension and nullification is within the constitutional competence of a federal district court,id.at,we will remand to the district court for a determination of the appropriate remedy.see also,sec graystone nash,cir suggesting remand w hen significant factors were not previously weighed in choosing a remedy.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court determination that the freemans have standing to sue,vacate the district court invalidation of new jersey fee schedule for retail and wholesale licenses,reverse the district court determination that the direct sales and importation provisions of new jersey law comport with the dictates of the dormant commerce clause,affirm the district court conclusion that new jersey ban on direct shipments of wine is constitutional,and remand for a determination of the proper remedy.
the statute also provides that one salesroom per county may be jointly controlled and operated by at least two plenary or farm winery licensees for the sale of the products of any plenary or farm winery licensee for consumption on or off the premises.stat.plaintiffs do not challenge this provision on appeal.
while the language of the statute sets the fee at,see stat.a,defendant certification to the district court indicates that the fee is.

for example,edward,the owner of chateau grand traverste,a michigan winery,stated the following our winery does not currently have a distributor in new jersey.if we were to obtain a distributor,we would be forced to give up approximately of our profits to the distributor.our business model is based on both sales out of the tasting room,use of distributors in specific states,and direct shipment.it is our experience that direct sales to the consumer either at the tasting room or through delivery by common carrier is the most profitable to us.ja affidavit numbering omitted.
defendant and intervenors attempt to resist this conclusion by arguing that the state has never enforced the transportation restrictions when individuals import wine intended for personal use.we reject this argument,because defendant has not presented any official,binding assurance that the statute will not be enforced as written.moreover,we note that the abc law has been repeatedly amended by the legislature without any alteration of the transportation restrictions,a fact which suggests that,whatever defendant current practice regarding the statute,the new jersey legislature intends for it to be enforced.
intervenors argue that the redressability prong is not met as to the direct shipment ban because all wineries are prohibited from making direct shipments,meaning that invalidating the ban would necessarily entail the creation of new rights.but assuming that plaintiffs are correct in their argument that the direct shipment ban disproportionately affects wineries,striking down the ban would do no more than vindicate the rule that state laws may not discriminatorily favor intrastate commerce over interstate commerce.
it is arguable that consumers are also directly regulated by the direct shipment ban,but we will assume,arguendo,that they are not.
section of the amendment provides that t he transportation or importation into any state,territory,or possession of the united states for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors,in violation of the laws thereof,is hereby prohibited.
the district court partially upheld the provisions on the ground that wineries could obtain wholesaler licenses that would allow them to sell wine directly to consumers.both plaintiffs and defendant argue that this interpretation of the abc law is flawed,and we agree.in keeping with the structure,wholesale licenses only allow the licensee to sell to wholesalers and retailers,not to consumers.stat.
while upholding the provisions allowing,but not wineries,to sell directly to retailers,the district court invalidated new jersey fee schedule for retail and wholesale licenses on the ground that wholesale only type available to more expensive.in light of our conclusion that the relevant portions of the statute and are not saved by the ability of wineries to obtain wholesale licenses,we need not reach this issue.
our holding in this regard is not contrary to the fourth circuit analysis in brooks vassar,cir.the fourth circuit did not address the brooks plaintiffs argument that virginia similar importation limit was unconstitutional,instead holding that the issue was rendered moot by the virginia legislature decision to prevent wineries from making direct sales to consumers.see id.at.
in their reply brief,plaintiffs argue that the ban only applies to wineries,because stat.provides that l icensees may transport alcoholic beverages in their own vehicles,solely,however,for their own respective business in connection with and as defined in their respective licenses,without possessing a transportation license.new jersey winery licenses,however,do not allow the licensees to transport wine to consumers.as discussed above,the plenary winery license permits sales to consumers only on the licensed premises of the winery for consumption on or off the premises and in six salesrooms apart from the winery premises for consumption on or off the premises.id.the language of the farm winery provision is slightly different it allows sales at retail to consumers for consumption on or off the licensed premises and in six salesrooms apart from the winery premises for consumption on or off the premises.id.plaintiffs argue that the first of these phrases allows the shipment of wine to reading on or off the premises to apply to the location of the sale,not the location of the consumption.but that reading ignores the parallel use of on or off the premi
