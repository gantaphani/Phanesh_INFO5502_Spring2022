factual and procedural history 
the plaintiffs are former employees of the housing department and active members of the new progressive party npp a political party that campaigns for puerto rican statehood.in,puerto rico held its general elections,and the popular democratic party pdp won control of the government.the pdp is a political adversary of the npp.

marrero held a career position as director of the section program starting in.marrero alleges that her job performance garnered only praise from her supervisors.marrero managed to receive such positive performance feedback despite serving under different party administrations during her career at the housing department.
marrero alleges that after molina retired in june,the housing department was reorganized without following federal guidelines.as part of the reorganization,alonso was brought in to supervise the section program.the reorganization amounted to a constructive demotion of marrero by reducing her responsibilities and subjecting her to an abusive work environment.specifically,her new responsibilities failed to include functions that she was entitled to perform under the housing department prior reclassification program.marrero also alleges that her subordinates often circumvented her,that her supervisors treated her in a discourteous manner by harassing and intimidating her,and that molina openly disparaged the npp in front of marrero and her personnel.finally,marrero suffered several humiliating events arising out of her health status.marrero was surgically treated for cancer in her reproductive system.the defendants allegedly mocked her as a result of this condition,claiming that she was not really sick and simply attempting to avoid returning to work by faking her illness.
on or about may,while still on medical leave,marrero received a letter dated april,stating the intention to remove her from office.this letter,and a subsequent one,accused her of failing to perform job duties and of committing illegal acts.these accusations mirrored ones levied against member of the directly supervised marrero during this time.the housing department also notified velez that it intended to terminate him.velez was initially demoted and later terminated.in both letters,marrero was summoned to an informal hearing,which she alleges was a sham designed to tarnish her reputation.despite her characterization of the hearing,marrero was able to proffer evidence rebutting the accusations against her.marrero was allowed to continue working at the housing department pending the final disposition.the hearing officer submitted a negative report.on march,the housing department notified marrero of her separation from employment and salary,which constituted the last alleged act of discrimination by the defendants.

statute of limitations 
title of the united states code,section creates a private right of action for violations of federally protected rights.because it has no internal statute of limitations,section claims borrow the appropriate state law governing limitations unless contrary to federal law.poy boutselis,cir.
the parties do not dispute that the relevant statute of limitations for civil rights claims in puerto rico takes a limitation period from laws ann.tit.centro medico del turabo,feliciano de melecio,cir puerto rico,cir.
the parties do dispute,however,the date from which the statute of limitation ought accrue.bou argues that the injury occurred in july,when semidey revealed the wrongful reasons for his demotion.the defendants counter that the proper accrual date is march,the date of the actual demotion.
federal law determines the date on which the statute of limitations begins running,cir.the first step in such an inquiry is to determine the actual injury on which the plaintiff rests the cause of action,cir.here,there is no dispute that the actual injury of which bou complains is his demotion.bou argument,and the dispositive point on this issue faced by this court,is thus properly framed as whether the date of that injury ought be tolled until he learned of the discriminatory animus that made his demotion wrongful.
as a general principle,section claims accrue when the plaintiff knows,or has reason to know,of the injury on which the action is based.municipality of caguas,cir rodriguez narvaez nazario,cir.a claimant is deemed to know or learn of a discriminatory act at the time of the act itself and not at the point that the harmful consequences are felt.see chardon fernandez,d.state coll.ricks,d.
in the employment discrimination context,this circuit has rejected the contention that claims do not accrue until the plaintiff knows of both the injury and the discriminatory animus.morris gov t dev.bank of,cir vistamar,at holding that the statute of limitations period for a section claim seeking to redress an unlawful taking of property began to accrue on the date of the wrongful appropriation.in morris government development bank of puerto rico,we dismissed the identical theory proffered by bou when we rejected the appellant contention that his cause of action existed in what amounts to a state of suspended animation until he became aware of the racial and political motives behind the adverse employment decision.at.
following this clear precedent,the statute of limitations period for bou claim began to accrue at the first discrete act of discrimination.see ledbetter goodyear tire rubber,d holding that the limitations period for a title vii claim for pay discrimination begins with the first discrete act.there is simply no support for bou argument that this date ought be suspended until he learned the discriminatory motives behind the discrete act.as a result,the
