this tort action was brought by the parents of a young child who was seriously injured when she was struck in the head by an object thrown from a lawnmower as she rode a tricycle at her childcare center.separate entities were providing the lawn maintenance and the childcare on the day of the accident under contracts with the federal government.appellants brought a suit for damages against the united states under the federal tort claims act ftca,b,and alleged supplemental claims under puerto rico law against other defendants,including the childcare provider and the maintenance company.the district court concluded that the ftca independent contractor defense barred liability under the statute,and it thus dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we agree that the case must be dismissed,although we conclude that the ftca discretionary function exception provides the rationale.
on the morning of october,was riding a tricycle in the parking lot of the rainforest kids child development center rainforest kids in san juan at the same time that an employee of genett group,genett was mowing the grass adjacent to the lot.a projectile dislodged by the lawnmower struck in the forehead,above her right eye.mother,appellant courtney carroll,was summoned to the scene and accompanied her daughter in an ambulance to a nearby hospital,where the girl had emergency surgery.was discharged from the hospital two days later.she will require ongoing observation to determine whether the injury caused permanent impairment.
rainforest kids operates the childcare facility on land adjacent to the federico degetau federal building under a license from the general services administration gsa.genett has a contract with gsa to provide maintenance and landscaping services for the federico degetau property,including at rainforest kids.carroll and her husband,ricardo acosta rodriguez,brought suit alleging,inter alia,that the united states was liable for injuries under the ftca because it failed to coordinate the activities of the two contractors to ensure the safety of children enrolled at rainforest kids they claimed that their family had suffered million in physical,emotional,and economic damages as a result of injury.
the united states disputed its liability for the accident based on two limitations on the jurisdiction granted by the ftca for tort claims against the government the independent contractor defense and the discretionary function exception.under the former,the government may not be held responsible for negligent acts or omissions committed by employees of government contractors whose daily operations are not closely supervised by united states officials in essence,eliminating vicarious liability as a theory of recovery against the federal government.see united states orleans,d wood united states,cir under the latter,discretionary acts of government employees are immunized from liability when based on policy considerations.see a abreu united states,cir.the district court found that the independent contractor defense required dismissal of the case and,consequently,did not consider the applicability of the discretionary function exception.having rejected federal jurisdiction under the ftca,the court also dismissed the supplemental causes of action under puerto rico law.
this timely appeal followed.
the ftca provides a carefully limited waiver of the federal government sovereign immunity for certain claims alleging harm caused by united states employees or agents.bolduc united states,cir.it allows civil actions against the government for injury or loss of property caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.b.the ftca expressly does not waive the government immunity for claims arising from the acts or omissions of independent contractors.see supra quoting,inter alia.the waiver also has exceptions and,where they apply,the federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over torts against the united states.wood,at see also montijo reyes united states,cir.
plaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court erred in dismissing the case based on the ftca independent contractor defense because they do not seek to impose liability on the united states for the actions of rainforest kids or genett employees.rather,their target is the government own failure to coordinate the contractors activities to ensure the safety of rainforest kids young charges.nor does the discretionary function exception apply,they assert,because injury did not arise from discretionary conduct entitled to protection from tort liability.plaintiffs argue that the government had no discretion to fail to implement and enforce schedules for lawn mowing and outdoor play that would have protected rainforest kids children from the risk of flying objects.appellants also contend that the district court erred in relying on the contract documents submitted by the united states as proof of the terms of the government agreement with genett because they were unsigned,incomplete,and unauthenticated.
as we shall explain,the independent contractor defense and the discretionary function exception are linked in the factual circumstances of this case.although we agree with the district court that rainforest kids and genett are independent contractors,the discretionary function exception provides the ground for dismissal because appellants argue that the united states is directly,rather than vicariously,liable for the injury to see wood,at limiting discussion to the discretionary function exception where the plaintiff fashion ed her argument as one of direct rather than vicarious negligence 
in evaluating a motion to dismiss under rule b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,we construe plaintiffs complaint liberally and ordinarily may consider whatever evidence has been submitted,such as depositions and exhibits.aversa united states,cir see also merlonghi united states,cir.our inquiry,however,is tilted toward the government claim of immunity t he ftca must be construed strictly in favor of the federal government,and must not be enlarged beyond such boundaries as its language plainly requires.bolduc,at quoting united states horn,cir.
we begin with plaintiffs assertion that we should not take into account the genett contract documents on which the district court relied 
a.the contract exhibits 
the agreement between the united states and genett is critical evidence in evaluating the government relationship with the contractor and,as will be seen,the nature of that relationship is an essential component of our analysis of the discretionary function exception.see williams united states,cir examining the contract between the government and contractor in evaluating contractor status brooks,cir contracts typically define the parameters of the contracting parties responsibilities.the status of the documents evidencing the contract is thus important to our inquiry.
without question,the contract materials in the record are less than ideal.the primary item is a comprehensive document that describes the maintenance and landscaping tasks at the federico degetau complex for which gsa sought to hire a contractor this document,which spans more than sixty pages,is what the district court treated as the contract,although the document itself merely presents the government expectations and does not refer to genett by name.nor is it signed by either party included in the same packet of materials,however,are multiple forms labeled amendment of of contract,several of which indicate that amendments were made to an agreement between the government and genett.one such form bears the signatures of both genett president and gsa contract specialist.see docket 
although acknowledging that it may have been technically permissible under rule b for the court to consider the submitted materials,appellants maintain that the court erred in accepting them as accurate depictions of the government relationship with genett.they argue that the government failure to produce complete and authenticated copies of the contracts should have led the district court to reject any defense based on the contract provisions.like the district court,however,we are satisfied that the documents adequately memorialize the agreement between the united states and genett.the contract contains a detailed description of the contractor role and responsibilities,see infra section.b,and the government has represented in filings to the court that the document reflects the parties agreement.see.b stating that,by submitting a pleading or other paper to the court,an attorney certifies to the best of her knowledge and belief,formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,that the factual contentions have evidentiary support.appellants do not dispute that the document depicts genett obligations,but suggest that it may not be complete.given the substantial document in the record,the theoretical existence of additional provisions materially modifying its terms is too speculative a possibility to give us pause.we thus accept as not clearly erroneous the district court implicit finding that the challenged documents provide sufficiently reliable evidence of the parties agreement for purposes of the jurisdictional ruling.
b.the independent contractor defense 
the status of rainforest kids and genett 
the key factor governing whether an entity providing services to the united states is an independent contractor is whether the contractor,rather than the government,exercises supervision and control of its own activities.see united states orleans,d a critical element in distinguishing an agency from a contractor is the power of the federal government to control the detailed physical performance of the contractor.quoting logue united states,d id.at.holding that independent contractor status under the ftca turns on whether the contractor operations are supervised by the federal government see also williams,at finding independent contractor status based on a comprehensive instrument providing that the contractor was responsible for the maintenance of the premises and the daily operations of the premises larsen empresas el yunque,cir holding that the independent contractor defense applied where responsible party ran the operation of a restaurant that was located on premises owned and controlled by the united states.
appellants appear to acknowledge that genett and rainforest kids were independent contractors and,indeed,there can be no serious dispute as to that status.attachment i of the childcare center licensing agreement specified that t he provider,rainforest kids board of directors,is not an employee or agent of the government,and that,with certain exceptions,decisions and responsibilities with respect to program,levels of enrollment,fees,tuition,hiring,policy making,and any and all other aspects of the operation and conduct of the center business shall be the exclusive right,prerogative,and responsibility of the provider.docket,at,emphasis added.
similarly,the genett contract stated that it was governed by specifications,and the document explained that,under a contract,the contractor,rather than the government,determines its own optimal work schedules,frequencies,resource allocations,and performance methods for meeting the government quality requirements.docket,at.emphasis omitted.the genett contract also stated that i t is the policy of gsa that government direction or supervision of the contractor employees,either directly or indirectly,will not be exercised.docket,at,see also id.at,stating that n either gsa employees nor other government employees are authorized to exercise either direct or indirect supervision over the contractor employees.
thus,under the terms of the agreements,the two service providers were independent contractors with control of and responsibility for the management and supervision of their respective operations.the government argues that such responsibility logically extends to the scheduling of lawn mowing and outdoor playtime so as to avoid obvious hazards to the rainforest kids children.appellants,however,argue that notwithstanding rainforest kids and genett independent status,the united states could not properly delegate such coordination to the contractors.they argue,in effect,that the united states lacked the discretion to leave the responsibility for ensuring safety in the hands of the contractors.in addition,they appear to argue that the government did not,in fact,delegate such authority to the contractors.
on the one hand,appellants arguments appear inconsistent with the basic premise of the independent contractor defense,that the government may not be held liable for injury caused by the acts or omissions of independent contractors employees in the discharge of the duties the contractors were hired to perform.on the other hand,we think it possible for the government to hire independent contractors while retaining responsibility for a discrete aspect of their operations,including,for example,safety measures.see,whisnant united states,cir holding that the government had retained responsibility for safety even though an independent contractor was responsible for maintenance at a naval commissary.the government argues that it made no such safety in this case,and that the discretionary function exception protected its judgment to delegate the responsibility to genett and rainforest kids.before considering the nature of that exception and its application here,we look at whether responsibility for safety was included in the delegation of authority to the contractors.
responsibility for safety measures 
both agreements expressly assign responsibility for safety to the contractors.the rainforest kids license obliges the childcare center to comply with all federal,state or local safety policies,docket,at,i,and,in apparent recognition of the burden of liability,the license requires rainforest kids to procure liability insurance and to maintain accident insurance on all students,id.genett agreement similarly states that the contractor shall comply with all applicable federal,state,local,and industry safety and health standards and regulations,docket,at,and it requires the contractor to employ a sufficient number of capable and qualified contract and subcontract employees to enable it to properly,adequately,safely,and economically manage,operate,maintain,and account for the facility,id.at.b emphasis added.the contract also states that t he contractor shall take all necessary precautions to prevent injury to the public,building occupants,or damage to property of others.id.at,part ii.
two other provisions in the genett contract require particular attention to the safety of children.a provision addressing cleaning requirements states due to the inquisitive nature of children,report to the cor any observations that could conceivably cause injury to a child.extra effort should be made to ensure that maintenance equipment and supplies are well secured from the children.id.at.a special note states 
in addition to the standard scope of work described above,the expected outcome is to ensure a safe and healthy environment for the children utilizing the child centers.this includes the daily removal and disposal of soiled diapers,plus a special emphasis on quality control.all efforts should be made to protect the children.due to the inquisitive nature of children,report to the co gsa contracting officer designated representative,any potential hazards that could conceivably cause injury to a child.extra effort should be made to ensure that maintenance equipment and supplies are well secured from the children.employees cleaning child care centers are subject to federal,state,and local laws governing health screening requirements prior to commencing employment.
specifically with respect to,the deposition testimony confirms that it was genett responsibility to set a schedule that would meet the contract quality and safety requirements.anabel mulero,the gsa contracting officer representative cor at the time of the accident,testified that it was not part of her job to ensure that genett followed a schedule for mowing because the contract is performance based,though she reported that she encouraged adherence to a schedule so the contractor could avoid falling behind in the work.docket,at.another cor,maxwell rivera,stated that the only guidance given by gsa about mowing when people were in the area was to work safely t he contract says they have to be working to emphasize safety.so if there are kids,common sense,to me,would tell me i would not cut the grass if i have kids present.docket,at.rivera further testified that genett and rainforest kids would need to work out scheduling to avoid conflicts because we do give them the schedule as to when to cut the grass.we just want it cut and cleaned.docket,at.
wanda lara,genett project manager,reported the same allocation of responsibility.she testified that the contractor employees were required to walk the grassy area of the complex looking for rocks and other debris.docket,at.although she did not specify who formulated that policy,she stated that a mowing schedule had been prepared by the genett project manager who preceded her.id.at.
mulero also testified that a schedule was developed by genett and rainforest kids after complaints were made by the childcare workers about genett employees interfering with their activities and making noise during the children nap times.docket,at.mulero did not participate in the meeting to work out the arrangements,she explained,because i did feel like i had to be there.i think that was something on which two civilized persons could reach an agreement.id.at.
in sum,both the terms of the agreements and their actual execution show that the united states did not carve out responsibility for safety measures from its otherwise comprehensive delegation of authority to rainforest kids and genett.although the genett contract anticipates schedules or procedures for some matters,possibly including safety items,such detail does not negate the agreement overall status as a contract.the varying levels of specificity signify only that the government determined that certain tasks needed more explicitly stated performance expectations.see,orleans,at.noting that the independent contractor in that case must comply with extensive regulations and guidelines,although the contracting agency does not have the power to supervise the daily operation of the contractor logue,at.finding independent contractor status where the contractor must follow detailed federal rules and standards,but the agreement gives the united states no authority to physically supervise the conduct of the contractor employees 
we thus turn to consider whether the government decision to assign to others the responsibility for ensuring safety at the federico degetau complex was a discretionary judgment protected from ftca liability.
c.the discretionary function exception 
the supreme court has observed that the discretionary function exception marks the boundary between congress willingness to impose tort liability upon the united states and its desire to protect certain governmental activities from exposure to suit by private individuals.united states empresa de viacao aerea rio grandense varig airlines,d,quoted in abreu,at.the exception,codified at a,immunizes conduct of government employees that arises from legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social,economic,and political policy,protecting against liability that would seriously handicap efficient government operations.wood,at quoting varig airlines,at,and united states muniz,d internal quotation marks omitted.the protection is available even when an employee has abused his or her discretion 
a framework is used to determine the applicability of the discretionary function exception 
a court first must identify the conduct that is alleged to have caused the harm,then determine whether that conduct can fairly be described as discretionary,and if so,decide whether the exercise or of the granted discretion is actually or potentially influenced by policy considerations.
fothergill united states,cir see also united states gaubert,d berkovitz united states,d.if the challenged conduct is both discretionary and,there is no jurisdiction for the claim.montijo reyes,at we consider each prong of the inquiry in turn.
the allegedly harmful conduct 
appellants focus on the manner in which the united states managed the contractors it hired to run the childcare center and to perform maintenance work at the federico degetau complex they complain that the government breached its duty of care to and her family by a permitting genett personnel to use dangerous equipment in the vicinity of children,b permitting to play in an area that was unreasonably dangerous,and c failing to coordinate schedules to avoid the risk of harm.simply stated,appellants claim that gsa employees were negligent in failing to create and enforce a schedule that would have prevented mowing at times when the rainforest kids children were playing outside.
the nature of the conduct 
the second step of the inquiry is to determine whether the identified conduct involves a matter that the political branches have left to the actor choice.fothergill,at.if a federal statute,regulation,or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow the employee has no rightful option but to adhere to the directive.berkovitz,at.in such circumstances,where the employee conduct can not appropriately be the product of judgment or choice,there is no discretion in the conduct for the discretionary function exception to protect.see also montijo reyes,at.where,however,the government actors in question have latitude to make decisions and choose among alternative courses of action,the conduct is discretionary.bolduc,at.
appellants argue that the gsa employees overseeing the federico degetau complex had no discretion to forego safety measures that would have prevented the unsafe,overlapping activities by genett and the childcare center on federal property.although they point to no federal law,regulation or policy requiring gsa to control the interaction between the contractors on safety issues they maintain that the government had an obligation under commonwealth law applicable to landowners,as well as under the contract,to ensure the children safety by establishing and enforcing a schedule barring lawn mowing during the children outdoor playtime.appellants further suggest that the government was required to take action because gsa officials knew that maintenance personnel had previously mowed the lawn near the childcare center while children were playing outside.we consider in turn the significance of commonwealth law,the contract,and the allegation of knowledge.
commonwealth law 
appellants may not invoke puerto rico law as a basis for determining whether the government failure to adopt and enforce safety procedures was protected discretionary conduct.state law can not override the ftca grant of immunity for discretionary conduct 
a lthough the threshold inquiry into governmental liability as defined by the ftca requires an examination of state law to define tortious conduct,the question of whether a state law tort can be applied against the united states is exclusively one of federal law.claimants obtain their right to sue the federal government from congress and they necessarily must take it subject to such restrictions as have been imposed.
berkman united states,cir alterations in original quoting dalehite united states.quoting fed.hous.admin.burr.see also,sydnes united states,cir considering state tort law as a limit on the federal government discretion at the jurisdictional stage impermissibly conflates the merits of plaintiffs claims with the question whether the united states has conferred jurisdiction on the courts to hear those claims in the first place.abreu,at even where the government conduct would create state tort liability in a suit against a private party,the ftca provides that sovereign immunity is not waived if the challenged governmental action involved the exercise of discretion.but see dickerson,united states,cir holding that the independent contractor exception in the ftca would not insulate the government from the contractor negligence if the duty was under florida law.
thus,whether the government may be held liable under the ftca for the failure to implement and enforce safety measures turns on whether federal law left it to the discretion of the applicable gsa officials to adopt or not such measures.logue,at.congress could have left the determination as to whose negligence the government should be liable for under the federal tort claims act to the law of the state involved,as it did with other aspects of liability under the act.but it chose not to do this.as noted,appellants have identified no pertinent federal law obliging gsa to assume the responsibility for safety.
contractual requirements 
we already have rejected appellants argument that the government retained responsibility for safety in its agreements with rainforest kids and genett.see supra section.we see no basis on which the government chosen allocation of authority could be deemed improper.where no federal law or policy limited the government discretion to delegate the coordination of schedules,or other safety precautions,to the independent contractors,the united states had the flexibility to craft the balance of authority in the contracts as it saw fit.see,muniz rivera united states,cir noting that,in a case involving flooding of federally supported housing,no applicable statute,regulation,or policy directed the manner in which the supervision is to be carried out nor specif ied the taking of the actions that the plaintiffs claim would have prevented their plight bolduc,at where the government actors in question have latitude to make decisions and choose among alternative courses of action,the conduct is discretionary.
indeed,the decision to assign independent contractors the responsibility for safety,in particular,has been found to be within the government discretion.see,wood,at noting that delegation of safety issues to a contractor reflected a judgment that in obtaining the best value for the american taxpayer,worker safety should be a primary concern of the contractor shuman united states,cir endorsing dismissal of ftca claim based on discretionary decision to delegate safety responsibility to independent contractor shansky united states,cir t here is no principled basis for superimposing a generalized safety exception upon the discretionary function defense.mcmichael,at finding that government inspectors failure to enforce safety requirements not protected by discretionary function exception where inspectors were given a number of precise inspections to perform which involved no judgment concerning agency policy 
as a matter of course,gsa permissible judgment to delegate to the contractors the responsibility for safety in the performance of their activities meant that the government had the discretion not to prescribe and outdoor play schedules.the contractors,not the united states,bore responsibility for implementing procedures to ensure the safety of the rainforest kids children 
c.the united states knowledge 
appellants suggest that,even if the united states otherwise had the discretion to delegate the coordination of activities to the contractors,the government was obliged to act here because it had knowledge that the dangerous conduct at issue had occurred previously.assuming for the sake of argument that government knowledge could be part of the discretionary function analysis,appellants attempt to invoke that factor here is unavailing.the only evidence of government knowledge in the record is a limited,disputed request for admission.when the united states failed to respond to appellants requests for admission within the thirty days specified by federal rule of civil procedure a,appellants moved to deem admitted,inter alia,a statement that gsa,through its employees,had knowledge that maintenance personnel had previously mowed the lawn surrounding the rainforest kids child development center at the same time that children were playing outside the facility.in its opposition to the deeming motion,the government attributed its delayed response to its normal reliance on the relevant agency to coordinate and provide the information necessary to respond to discovery requests and stated that it had by that time responded to the appellants requests for admissions and production of documents.
the district court did not rule on appellants motion to deem before dismissing the case.even if the statement is deemed admitted,however,it is an insufficient basis on which to deny the government the protection of the discretionary function exception.the statement says only that the overlap had occurred before,at an unspecified time,and not that it had been occurring routinely.whatever the significance generally of government knowledge of its independent contractors safety performance,we reject the notion that a single problem would shift responsibility to the government.under the contracts,genett and rainforest kids had the obligation to make sure the overlap did not recur.
we are thus satisfied that the record shows that the allegedly harmful conduct the failure to establish and enforce a schedule for safe mowing can fairly be described as discretionary,fothergill,at,satisfying the second prong of the discretionary function inquiry.
policy related 
the third prong of the discretionary function exception requires us to consider whether the judgment at issue is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield,berkovitz,at,or,as we have framed the question whether the exercise of discretion involve s or is susceptible to judgments,abreu,at alterations in original quoting montijo reyes,at.we start with the presumption that the exercise of discretion by a government official implicates a policy judgment.see supra note.
as with our discussion of the discretionary nature of the conduct,the policy inquiry is influenced by the independent contractor status of genett and rainforest kids.appellants would like us to ask whether there is a policy rationale for the government failure to coordinate the scheduling of lawn mowing and outdoor play.that is not the relevant question.the relevant question is whether there is a policy justification for assigning responsibility for such coordination to the independent contractors hired to perform maintenance and run the childcare center.to ask that question is to answer it.
the judgment to hire independent contractors presumably was based on an assessment of cost and efficiency concerns relating to the use of time.see,williams,at noting that,in choosing whether to hire an independent contractor,the united states must weigh concerns of expense,administration,payment,access to the premises,and a veritable plethora of factors.as we have noted,the product of such a weighing of factors is unquestionably a policy judgment.see supra note.the decision to staff a job with independent contractors necessarily also embraces judgments about which delegated tasks require detailed instructions to ensure proper performance and which are more efficiently presented to the contractor as general obligations.indeed,the benefits of engaging independent contractors would be lost if the government needed to take the time to make judgments about,and provide guidance on,every aspect of every task to be performed.
in this instance,the government concluded,in effect,that the tasks of developing and enforcing a safe,compatible schedule for playtime and lawn mowing were appropriately left to the two entities directly responsible for managing the potentially conflicting activities.as the government judgment implicates the same policy concerns that underlie the choice to hire independent contractors in the first place,it also is protected by the discretionary function exception 
the presence and scope of the independent contractor agreements here distinguish this case from others,cited by appellants,in which plaintiffs have successfully argued that the government inaction on safety matters was not protected by either the discretionary function exce
