opinion of the court 
this case concerns ephedrine alkaloids eds,substances that were marketed beginning in the early as dietary supplements to reduce weight and boost energy.in,the food and drug administration fda banned all supplements containing eds after concluding that they present an unreasonable risk of illness or injury at all dose levels.pharmaceuticals,a maker of products containing eds,challenges that determination as discussed below,we conclude that challenge is precluded.
rulemaking background 
the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food,drug,device,or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded.a.in,congress amended the fdca through the dietary supplement health and education act.dshea,which sets guidelines for how fda may regulate dietary supplements.fda may declare that a dietary supplement is adulterated if it presents a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury under conditions of use recommended or suggested in labeling,or if no conditions of use are suggested or recommended in the labeling,under ordinary conditions of use.f a.the dshea also makes clear that the fda bears the burden of proof in seeking to have a dietary supplement declared adulterated,as the section provides in any proceeding under this subparagraph,the united states shall bear the burden of proof on each element to show that a dietary supplement is adulterated.the court shall decide any issue under this paragraph on a de novo basis.f 
in,fda began examining eds and in began to consider regulating dietary supplements containing eds.june.fda sought comment on a proposed finding that a dietary supplement is adulterated if it contains mg or more of eds per serving,or if its labeling suggests usage resulting in a total daily intake of mg or more of eds.fda received negative feedback on this proposal and in withdrew part of the proposed rule.between and,fda released information on eds and solicited other comments through notices to the public.in,fda published another notice,informing the public that fda intended to consider whether eds present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury under conditions of use recommended or suggested in labeling,or if no conditions of use are suggested or recommended in the labeling,under ordinary conditions of use.
fda issued a final rule in,declaring all eds to be adulterated and therefore banned.fda explained that it was acting based on the pharmacology of ephedrine alkaloids,the scientific literature on the effects of ephedrine alkaloids,and the adverse events reported to have occurred in individuals following consumption of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids.final rule declaring dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids adulterated because they present an unreasonable risk,hereinafter final rule the final rule represented the first time fda banned an entire class of dietary supplements under the dshea.
fda determined in the final rule that its burden to show unreasonable risk is met when a product risks outweigh its benefits in light of the claims and directions for use in the product labeling,or if the labeling is silent,under ordinary conditions of use.fda defined unreasonable risk to represent a relative weighing of the product known and reasonably likely risks against its known and reasonably likely benefits.in conducting this weighing,fda evaluated the claimed benefits of eds,including weight loss,enhanced athletic performance,and increased energy,against the known risks,including increased blood pressure and heart rate,and their consequences,such as increased risk of stroke and heart attack.fda found that the best clinical evidence for a benefit is for weight loss,but even there the evidence supports only a modest weight loss,insufficient to positively affect cardiovascular risk factors associated with being overweight or obese.fda concluded that the potential benefits of eds did not outweigh the risks and therefore determined that eds products were adulterated and must be banned.
b.the two litigation proceedings 
filed a complaint challenging the final rule in the northern district of georgia on august,claimed that the final rule was issued in violation of the administrative procedures act and that fda failed to meet its burden to prove that supplements containing eds present an unreasonable risk.main claim was that fda could not meet its burden of proving adulteration with a generally applicable rule for an entire class of substances,but was,instead,required to proceed on a basis.on february,fda sought forfeiture of eds products,made by,in the northern district of georgia,asserting an interest in the seized products,initiated its own action in the same court,and the two cases were consolidated.
in the meantime,fda on january,initiated forfeiture proceedings in the district court for the western district of pennsylvania against certain eds products manufactured by and located in that district.filed a complaint against fda and challenged the final rule based on the same grounds it had asserted in its complaint in the northern district of georgia.
in both the georgia and the pennsylvania cases,and the fda filed for summary judgment.the georgia district court granted summary judgment to the government on august,crawford,d.filed a notice of appeal to the eleventh circuit on september.on october,the pennsylvania district court subsequently and in part in relying on the georgia decision granted summary judgment to the government,upholding the final rule.that decision was appealed in the case at bar,in which asks this court to invalidate the final rule.
however,before this court heard the appeal from the western district of pennsylvania,the eleventh circuit,on october,affirmed the decision of the georgia district court and upheld the final rule,crawford.argument was held in this case on october.subsequent to argument in this case,sought rehearing in the eleventh circuit,a request which was denied on january.has not sought further review of the eleventh circuit decision.
about a week after the eleventh circuit decision and about a week before oral argument in this case,the government raised the possibility that review in this court was precluded by the eleventh circuit decision.the parties presented argument on preclusion and,at the request of the panel,submitted supplemental briefing on the issue.
fda argues that,in view of the eleventh circuit decision,res judicata or collateral estoppel should operate to bar arguments on this appeal.
res judicata requires a showing that there has been a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit involving the same claim and the same parties or their privies.eeoc united states steel,cir.collateral estoppel,on the other hand,requires of a previous determination that the identical issue was previously adjudicated the issue was actually litigated the previous determination was necessary to the decision and the party being precluded from relitigating the issue was fully represented in the prior action.jean alexander cosmetics,usa,cir citing henglein colt indus.operating,cir.
the parties use the terms res judicata and collateral estoppel nearly interchangeably,and neither side argues that using one or the other would meaningfully affect the analysis.collateral estoppel customarily refers to issue preclusion,while res judicata,when used narrowly,refers to claim preclusion.this court has previously noted that the preferred usage of the term res judicata encompasses both claim and issue preclusion.venuto witco,cir.
a comparison of the parties and the issues makes the appropriateness of res judicata immediately apparent.the parties in the eleventh circuit are identical to the parties before this court.the claims are also identical.contends that the claims are not the same because different eds products were seized in georgia than in pennsylvania therefore,argues that because fda must prove that each individual product is adulterated,the products seized in the georgia action can not be classified as the same as those seized in the pennsylvania action.however,this argument is,in effect,sim
