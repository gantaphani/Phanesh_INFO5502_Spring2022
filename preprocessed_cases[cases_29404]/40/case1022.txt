introduction 
since the late century,the united states has restricted immigration into this country but despite the existence of these legal restrictions,a substantial number of persons have succeeded in unlawfully entering the united states,and now live within the various states.plyler doe.the dispute we are now called upon to address is one of an increasing number of cases that have arisen from actions that state and local governments have taken because of illegal immigration.
the city of hazleton,pennsylvania hazleton or the city is appealing a permanent injunction that the district court entered prohibiting hazleton enforcement of two local ordinances that attempt to regulate employment of,and provision of rental housing to,certain aliens.several individuals and organizations sued to enjoin enforcement of the ordinances arguing that they violate the united states constitution,as well as federal and state statutes.the district court agreed and enjoined hazleton from enforcing the ordinances in their entirety.
we now hold that the district court erred in reaching the merits of the challenge to the private cause of action provision because no plaintiff has standing to challenge that provision.accordingly,that portion of the district court order will be vacated.however,although our reasoning differs somewhat from the analysis used by the district court,we conclude that it correctly enjoined the rest of the challenged ordinances.we will therefore affirm the district court order in all other respects.
ii.factual and procedural background 
hazleton and its ordinances 
the city of hazleton is located in luzerne county in northeastern pennsylvania.lozano city of hazleton,d.under pennsylvania law,hazleton is classified as a city of the third class and operates under an optional plan b form of government.id.its executive is a mayor,and its legislature is a city council.id.
hazleton population was only in.id.between and the time of trial,however,its population increased to between and.id.much of this growth was due to an influx of latino families who migrated from new york and new jersey to pennsylvania in the early.id.these newcomers included united states citizens and lawful permanent residents,as well as persons lacking lawful immigration status,who are often referred to as undocumented immigrants or illegal aliens.id.
hazleton mayor,as well as other local officials,subsequently concluded that aliens lacking lawful status were to blame for certain social problems in the city,see,and that the federal government could not be relied upon to prevent such aliens from moving into the city,or to remove them,see lozano,d at.accordingly,city officials decided to take independent action to regulate the local effects of unlawful immigration.see.beginning on july,hazleton city council began enacting a series of ordinances designed to address these concerns.lozano,d at.
this litigation concerns two of those ordinances the illegal immigration relief act ordinance iirao,which consists of ordinance,as amended by ordinance and ordinance and the rental registration ordinance ro,which consists of ordinance these ordinances attempt to regulate the employment of unauthorized aliens,and the provision of rental housing to aliens lacking lawful immigration status,within hazleton.
the illegal immigration relief act ordinance 
the iirao begins with a statement of findings and a declaration of purpose,which asserts 
t hat unlawful employment,the harboring of illegal aliens in dwelling units in the city of hazleton,and crime committed by illegal aliens harm the health,safety and welfare of authorized workers and legal residents in the city of hazleton.illegal immigration leads to higher crime rates,subjects our hospitals to fiscal hardship and legal residents to substandard quality of care,contributed to other burdens on public services,increasing their cost and diminishing their availability to legal residents,and diminishes our overall quality of life.
iirao in response to these concerns,the iirao 
seeks to secure to those lawfully present in the united states and this city,whether or not they are citizens of the united states,the right to live in peace free from the threat of crime,to enjoy the public services provided by this city without being burdened by the cost of providing goods,support and services to aliens unlawfully present in the united states,and to be free of the debilitating effects on their economic and social well being imposed by the influx of illegal aliens to the fullest extent that these goals can be achieved consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states and the commonwealth of pennsylvania.
section of the iirao asserts that it is unlawful for any business entity to recruit,hire for employment,or continue to employ or permit,dispatch,or instruct any person who is an unlawful worker to perform work within hazleton iirao.under the iirao,an unlawful worker is defined as a person who does not have the legal right or authorization to work due to an impediment in any provision of federal,state or local law,including but not limited to a minor disqualified by nonage,or an unauthorized alien as defined by h.iirao.section requires e very business entity that applies for a business permit to sign an affidavit affirming that they do not knowingly utilize the services or hire any person who is an unlawful worker.iirao.
section also provides for public monitoring,prosecution,and sanctions.any city resident may submit a complaint to hazleton code enforcement office alleging that a local business entity is violating the section prohibition on utilizing the services of an unlawful worker.iirao.upon receipt of such complaint,the code enforcement office requests identity information about the alleged unlawful worker from the employing business,and that business must provide the information within three business days,or hazleton will suspend its business license.iirao.if the worker is alleged to be an unauthorized alien,the code enforcement office submits any identity information received from the business to the federal government,pursuant to,for verification of the immigration status of such person s.id.
if the code enforcement office confirms that the worker lacks authorization to work in the united states,the business must terminate that person within three business days or the city will suspend its business license iirao.safe harbor from this sanction is provided to businesses that verify the work authorization of its workers through use of the basic pilot program which has since been named.iirao.is a federal program for verifying work authorization which congress has authorized for use on a trial basis.
a business whose license is suspended under the iirao regains its license one business day after it submits an affidavit affirming that it has terminated the unlawful worker.iirao.if a business is found to have employed two or more unauthorized aliens at one time,it must also confirm its enrollment in in order to recover its license iirao b.if a business entity violates the iirao a second time,hazleton suspends its license for a minimum of twenty days and reports the violation,whether or not eventually corrected,to the federal government.iirao.
the iirao further creates a private cause of action against businesses that employ unlawful workers.section of the iirao makes it an unfair business practice for a business entity to discharge an employee who is not an unlawful worker,if,on the date of the discharge,the business entity was not participating in and the business entity was employing an unlawful worker.iirao.an employee discharged under these conditions may sue the business entity under the iirao for treble actual damages,as well as reasonable attorney fees and costs iirao.
the iirao also addresses the harboring of persons lacking lawful immigration status.section makes it unlawful for any person or business entity that owns a dwelling unit in the city to harbor an illegal alien in the dwelling unit,knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to,entered,or remains in the united states in violation of law.iirao.harboring is broadly defined.the ordinance states to let,lease,or rent a dwelling unit to an illegal alien shall be deemed to constitute harboring.iirao.additionally,section of the iirao makes legal immigration status a condition precedent to entering into a valid lease.iirao.all leases entered into by persons lacking lawful status are deemed breached.id.
the mechanisms for enforcing the housing provisions of the iirao are similar to those set forth above for enforcing the employment provisions.thus,any city resident may file a complaint with hazleton code enforcement office alleging that a property owner is illegally harboring a tenant who is an illegal alien.iirao.once such a complaint is received,the code enforcement office may request identifying information about the named tenant from the property owner,and the property owner must provide that information within three days.iirao.the city then verifies the legality of the tenant immigration status with the federal government,pursuant to c.iirao.
if the federal government confirms that the tenant lacks lawful immigration status,the iirao gives the property owner five business days to evict that tenant.iirao.if the owner fails to do so,the city suspends the owner rental license and bars the owner from collecting any rent for the applicable dwelling unit iirao.these sanctions end one business day after the owner submits an affidavit affirming that has corrected the violation.iirao.any subsequent violation subjects the owner to a fine of per day per adult illegal alien harbored in a dwelling unit,as well as suspension of rental license.iirao.
the rental registration ordinance 
the ro operates in conjunction with the provisions of the iirao.section of the ro requires that any prospective occupant of rental housing over the age of eighteen apply for and receive an occupancy permit.ro.to receive that permit,the prospective occupant must pay a fee and must submit certain documents,including p roper identification showing proof of legal citizenship residency to hazleton code enforcement office.ro.hazleton landlords are required to inform all prospective occupants of this requirement,and they are prohibited from allowing anyone over the age of eighteen to rent or occupy a rental unit,unless that person has a permit.id.
section of the ro provides that a landlord found guilty of renting to someone without a permit must pay an initial fine of per unauthorized occupant,and an additional fine of per day per unauthorized occupant until the violation is corrected.ro.an authorized occupant of rental housing who is found guilty of permitting someone without a rental permit to live in apartment must pay the same fine.id.
b.the plaintiffs 
the following six plaintiffs claim that they have standing to bring this suit pedro lozano,john doe,john doe,john doe,jane doe,and the hazleton hispanic business association plaintiffs business entities,landlords,and tenants,as well as an organization whose members include hazleton business entities and landlords.we briefly describe these plaintiffs,and the basic facts underlying each plaintiff claim to standing.
pedro lozano is a lawful permanent resident who immigrated to the united states from colombia in january.lozano,d at.he owns a duplex in hazleton and rents out half of it to help pay his mortgage.id.at.he hires contractors to perform repairs on his property as needed.id.at.
john doe was born in mexico,and had lived in hazleton for six years at the time of trial.id.at.he is unsure of his immigration status,but believes that he could be removed from the united states.id.he is similarly unsure of his work authorization.id.john doe landlord evicted him because of the risk of being fined pursuant to the aforementioned provisions of the iirao and the ro.id.at.
john doe had lived in hazleton for four years at the time of trial.id.at.he understands his immigration status to be illegal,and he rents an apartment within hazleton.id.at.
john doe and jane doe were born in columbia and had lived in hazleton for more than five years at the time of trial.id.at.they rent a house in hazleton,but fear eviction and being forced to leave hazleton if the ordinances are enforced.id.at.
the hazleton hispanic business association hhba is an organization of business owners from the hazleton area that exists to promote the interest of its business members and to project the image of the hispanic business community.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.hhba president,rudolfo espinal,owns three rental properties in hazleton and hires contractors to perform repairs on those properties as needed.id.at.
procedural history 
as noted above,numerous plaintiffs filed this action for injunctive relief based upon challenges to the validity of the iirao and the ro.lozano,d at.the district court granted these plaintiffs motion for a temporary restraining order,and the parties agreed to extend that order until the case could be resolved on its merits.id.these ordinances have never been enforced,and the challenges asserted are facial.
the amended complaint alleges that the ordinances violate the supremacy clause,the due process clause,and the equal protection clause of the united states constitution the federal fair housing act,plaintiffs privacy rights pennsylvania home rule charter law.pennsylvania landlord and tenant act.and the limits of hazleton police powers.id.
at the conclusion of a bench trial,the district court issued a thorough opinion and order permanently enjoining the city from enforcing the ordinances.the court concluded that eight of the eleven plaintiffs had standing to challenge the iirao and the ro,and that it was appropriate for the john and jane doe plaintiffs to proceed anonymously.the court held that the iirao and the ro violate the supremacy and due process clauses of the united states constitution,as well as.the court also held that hazleton,as a city of the third class,lacked authority under pennsylvania home rule charter law to create the iirao private cause of action,and that it exceeded its police powers in enacting these ordinances 
this appeal followed.hazleton argues that plaintiffs lack standing,and that the district court abused its discretion both in permitting the john and jane doe plaintiffs to proceed anonymously and in issuing a confidentiality order prohibiting hazleton from disclosing the doe plaintiffs identity information to the federal government.hazleton further contends that plaintiffs claims are meritless,and that the ordinances are valid under federal and state law.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review a district court conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see,mccutcheon am.servicing,cir.we review a district court grant of a motion to proceed anonymously and grant of a confidentiality order for abuse of discretion.doe prot.plus,cir.
iv.severability and standing 
we first address the threshold question of plaintiffs standing.here,however,standing implicates the issue of issue which has yet to be explicitly discussed in this suit.as we explained in contractors ass city of philadelphia,c ourts considering constitutional challenges to statutes often analyze standing problems in terms of the severability doctrine the severability doctrine governs whether plaintiffs have standing to challenge an entire o rdinance,or just certain provisions,cir.
severability,however,like any issue,can be waived,and it is clear that hazleton has,with one exception,waived issues of severability here.the district court considered whether plaintiffs have standing to challenge the employment provisions and the housing provisions of these ordinances as collective wholes,and conducted its merits inquiries accordingly.see,lozano,d at t he ordinances at issue have two distinct provisions,one directed to employment issues and one aimed at issues,and we will discuss each topic separately with regard to.on appeal,hazleton does not contest the district court failure to further sever the ordinances.rather,hazleton brief characterizes the ordinances the same way the district court did.thus,hazleton argues that plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the employment provisions and the housing provisions,and that the employment provisions and the housing provisions are not,without further differentiating among those provisions 
the sole severability issue hazleton has not waived concerns the iirao private cause of action.hazleton has argued that the private cause of action is severable from the rest of the iirao employment provisions both in its brief and at oral argument.severability of a local ordinance is a question of state law,and pennsylvania law favors severability.contractors ass n,at.additionally,there is a presumption in favor of severability where,as here,the ordinances contain a severability provision.id.for an ordinance to be severable,t he legislating body must have intended that the act or ordinance be separable and the statute or ordinance must be capable of separation in fact.the valid portion of the enactment must be independent and complete within itself.saulsbury bethlehem steel,emphasis omitted.
here the iirao severability provision indicates that hazleton city council did intend the private cause of action provision to be severable from the balance of its regulatory scheme.furthermore,the private cause of action is not intertwined with the other employment provisions,most of which concern business licensing requirements.it can operate independently and is capable of separation in fact.id.we therefore conclude that it is severable.accordingly,we will evaluate plaintiffs standing to challenge the iirao private cause of action independently of their standing to challenge the other employment provisions and the housing provisions.
in essence,the question of standing asks whether the litigant s are entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute.warth seldin.as we will explain,we conclude that there is at least one plaintiff with standing to challenge the employment and housing provisions of these ordinances.accordingly,we must consider the merits of the challenges to those provisions.see rumsfeld forum for academic and institutional rights,t he presence of one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy article iii requirement.however,as we will also explain,we find that no plaintiff has standing to challenge the iirao private cause of action.accordingly,review of the legality of that provision must await a challenge by a plaintiff who can establish an article iii injury.
general principles of standing 
the irreducible minimum of any standing inquiry derives directly from article iii of the united states constitution.see lujan defenders of wildlife.article iii limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to cases and controversies.const.art.iii,see also lujan,at.the judicial power established by article iii is therefore not an unconditioned authority to determine the constitutionality of legislative or executive acts.hein freedom from religion,internal quotation marks omitted.rather,federal courts are permitted to address these questions only if actually adjudicating the rights of individuals.id.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the inquiry into standing must focus on whether a claim is being brought by a party whose interests entitle him to raise it.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a plaintiff interests satisfy article iii when the following three elements are present 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
lujan,at internal citations,quotation marks,and alterations omitted.
in addition to these constitutionally required elements of standing,federal courts have developed a body of limitations on the exercise of their judicial power.see elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,see also oxford assocs.waste,cir.accordingly,e ven in cases concededly within our jurisdiction under article iii,we will decline to decide the merits of a case when these prudential standing requirements are not satisfied.elk grove unified sch,at.prudential standing encompasses the general prohibition on a litigant raising another person legal rights,the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches,and the requirement that a plaintiff complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.allen wright.
an organization wishing to bring suit on behalf of its members must satisfy a specific combination of constitutional and prudential standing requirements.see united food and commercial workers union local brown,explaining that the first two prongs of the associational standing test are constitutional,while the third prong is prudential.to establish that it has associational standing and can represent its members interests in federal court,an organization must show that 
a its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right b the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose and c neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.
hunt.state apple adver.comm n.
here,plaintiffs claim that lozano and the hhba have standing to challenge the employment provisions of the iirao,and that lozano,the hhba,and the doe plaintiffs have standing to challenge the housing provisions of the iirao and the ro.
constitutional standing 
the employment provisions 
as discussed above,the iirao employment provisions require businesses to submit affidavits affirming that they do not utilize the services of unlawful workers incentivize,and in certain circumstances mandate,the use of create procedures for adjudicating independently of federal law whether a business has employed an unauthorized alien and penalize a business for doing so by suspending its business license.
the district court held that lozano had standing to challenge these provisions for himself,and that the hhba had standing to challenge them on behalf of its member,rudolfo espinal lozano is a landlord,and espinal is a landlord and owner of a real estate agency.both are business entities under the iirao and both sometimes hire contractors to perform work on their rental properties.accordingly,the district court found that they faced imminent concrete injury,because if the iirao were enforced,they would be compelled to comply with its employer requirements adding a burden of time and expense to their operations.see lozano,d at.hazleton challenges the district court conclusion on several grounds.
hazleton primary argument on appeal is that the injury these plaintiffs face is nothing more than the cost of compliance with the iirao,and that this is a generalized burden insufficiently particularized to satisfy the requirement of article iii.it is that an injury must be particularized to support standing.a particularized injury is one that affect s the plaintiff in a personal and individual way,alston countrywide fin,cir quoting lujan,at internal quotation marks omitted,and is established when a plaintiff shows that has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury and not merely that s he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally,ams.united for separation of church state reagan,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,the supreme court has rejected attempts by taxpayers to bring suits challenging the government use of tax dollars.for instance,in frothingham mellon,the supreme court held that a taxpayer lacked standing to challenge a federal appropriations act that she alleged violated the tenth amendment.the court explained that the harm a taxpayer suffers when the government unlawfully uses taxpayer funds is shared with millions of others and comparatively minute and indeterminable.id.at.because such an injury is a matter of public and not of individual concern,it is not particularized,and therefore insufficient to give rise to article iii standing.id.the court has reaffirmed this conclusion many times since,explaining that 
a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about only harm to his and every citizen interest in proper application of the constitution and laws,and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at not state an article iii case or controversy.
hazleton attempts to transpose these principles into a quite different context.hazleton suggests that because all business entities in hazleton are required to comply with the iirao,the burden of complying with the ordinance is generalized and not particularized.accordingly,it argues that lozano and presumably all business entities in standing to challenge the iirao provisions affecting them.the argument could not be more misguided.
plaintiffs here are not members of the general public complaining of some indefinite and indeterminable harm,such as the unconstitutional expenditure of their.rather,lozano and espinal are direct targets of an ordinance they allege to be unconstitutional,complaining of what that ordinance would compel them to do.thus,the appropriate comparison is not to taxpayers seeking invalidation of government expenditures,but to taxpayers seeking invalidation of taxes imposed on them.as the supreme court explained in hein,at,it is incontrovertible that taxpayers in this second category have standing o f course,a taxpayer has standing to challenge the collection of a specific tax assessment as unconstitutional being forced to pay such a tax causes a real and immediate economic injury to the individual taxpayer.
furthermore,hazleton insistence that these plaintiffs lack standing because their injuries are at least among business entities in hazleton is misplaced.the fact that an injury is is not the primary focus of the particularized inquiry.see fed.election comm akins.as the supreme court explained in united states students challenging regulatory agency procedures scrap,t o deny standing to persons who are in fact injured simply because many others are also injured,would mean that the most injurious and widespread government actions could be questioned by nobody.we can not accept this conclusion.the question of particularity turns on the nature of the harm,not on the total number of persons affected.
lozano and espinal will not suffer in some indefinite way in common with people generally if the iirao is enforced.frothingham,at.rather,they will be affected in a personal and individual way by what the iirao requires of them.lujan,at.enforcement of the iirao would create coercive pressures compelling them to investigate the work authorization status of the prospective contractors they seek to hire.additionally,they would be required to submit affidavits to hazleton code enforcement office affirming that they do not knowingly utilize the services of unlawful workers.failure to comply with either directive could result in significant sanctions.these costly requirements,imposed directly and purposefully on these plaintiffs,are a particularized.
hazleton also argues that even if the cost of compliance is a theoretically sufficient injury under article iii,these plaintiffs fail to show that the cost of compliance with the iirao is greater than the cost of compliance with federal law.thus,argues hazleton,these plaintiffs fail to show that there would be any actual cost of compliance with the iirao itself.hazleton is mistaken.federal law certainly does not require anyone to submit an affidavit to hazleton code enforcement office.though relatively small,that cost is sufficient for standing purposes.a n identifiable trifle is enough for standing.see scrap,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the iirao is also much broader than federal law,and coerces as well as incentivizes different behaviors.lozano and espinal testified that they only hire workers to perform discrete repair projects on their rental properties as needed.see,lozano has problems with his roof and intends to hire a contractor to make repairs,espinal intends to hire someone to do plumbing and electrical repairs as part of the ongoing renovations of his rental properties.he also anticipates hiring someone for tasks such as shoveling snow.such workers would almost certainly be considered independent contractors under federal law.as we discuss in greater detail below,the federal requirement that employers verify the work authorization status of their employees does not apply to independent contractors.thus,federal law would not require either lozano or espinal to determine such persons work authorization status.in contrast,the iirao prohibits plaintiff business owners from permit ting,dispatch ing,or instruct ing any person who is an unlawful worker to perform work regardless of whether the person is an employee or an independent contractor,and thus compels them to verify the work authorization of any worker whose services they utilize.iirao see also.therefore,we reject hazleton attempt to refute the standing of lozano and espinal by arguing that the iirao imposes no burdens beyond those imposed by federal law.it clearly does.
lozano and espinal have established that if the iirao is enforced,it will cause them particularized injury redressable by this court.since the employment provisions of the iirao apply to independent contractors,lozano and espinal and therefore the hhba have standing to challenge those provisions.however,it is much less clear whether the private cause of action applies to independent contractors,and we must separately evaluate whether lozano or espinal have standing to challenge that provision 
private cause of action 
unlike the other employment provisions of the iirao,which impose restrictions on a business entity not only when it hire s for employment,or continue s to employ an employee,but also whenever it permit s,dispatch es,or instruct s any person to perform work,iirao,the private cause of action on its face affords rights only to an aggrieved employee.iirao emphasis added.under section of the iirao,it is an unfair business practice for a business entity to terminate any employee who is not an unlawful worker while it continues to employ an unlawful worker.id.if it does so,the business entity is liable to the aggrieved employee for treble damages.id.whereas the rest of the iirao speaks of workers,the section creating the private cause of action appears to inure solely to the benefit of employees.
lozano and espinal have not testified that they currently employ anyone who would be considered an employee,nor has either testified about any intent to do so.moreover,even if they even if we were to construe this section as also inuring to the benefit of discharged independent and espinal have not testified that they have plans to hire more than one person,employee or contractor,at any one time,and the record is insufficient to support such a finding.yet,the iirao private cause of action arises only if at least two persons work for the same business entity at the same time.additionally,unlike other provisions they testified about,lozano and espinal did not testify that they fear prosecution under the private cause of action provision or that they have any reason to fear such prosecution.
we realize,of course,that the threat of future prosecution can certainly be a sufficiently imminent injury to support article iii standing.see,one does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.however,that threat must be more than a possibility dependent on multiple contingencies that may never occur.see,caribbean marine servs.baldrige,cir explaining that fears of liability reliant on multiple contingencies do not give a plaintiff standing.lozano and espinal would be injured by section of the iirao only if they proceeded to hire multiple employees,terminated one while retaining another,and were sued by or had reason to fear suit by the terminated employee.this attenuated sequence of events is not even suggested by this record,and it is therefore too tenuous to support a conclusion that either has the requisite personal interest to establish a case or controversy.accordingly,we conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of these plaintiffs challenges to the iirao private cause of action.
housing provisions 
the housing provisions of the iirao prohibit the knowing or reckless harboring of illegal aliens defined to include the knowing or reckless provision of rental housing subject landlords who violate this prohibition to significant monetary sanctions and invalidate any lease entered into by persons lacking lawful immigration status.the ro requires all persons over the age of eighteen who seek to live in rented property to obtain an occupancy permit makes possession of documentation of lawful immigration status a requirement for receiving that permit prohibits landlords from renting to persons who lack a permit and subjects landlords who do so to suspension of their rental license and a concomitant prohibition on collecting rent from the dwelling units involved.
the district court held that lozano,the hhba again on behalf of its member espinal,and the doe plaintiffs have standing as landlords and tenants to challenge the housing provisions of the iirao and the ro.
landlord plaintiffs 
the district court concluded that landlords lozano and espinal had suffered a constitutionally sufficient because the housing provisions made it more difficult for them to rent apartments.the court also concluded they had standing because hazleton enforcement of the housing provisions would directly impose certain requirements on them,costing them both time and money.see lozano,d at.hazleton contests the court conclusions on several grounds.
hazleton first argues that the record fails to support the district court finding that the housing provisions made it more difficult for lozano and espinal to rent their properties.according to hazleton,the record reveals that the landlords had the same mixed success in renting apartments both before and after passage of the ordinances.hazleton br.hazleton therefore claims that lozano and espinal have suffered no injury at all.we can not agree.
the district court finding that both lozano and espinal had more difficulty finding tenants for their properties following passage of the iirao and the ro is supported by the record,and certainly not clearly erroneous.lozano testified that tenants who had been renting from him since he acquired his rental property in ran away upon learning about the ordinances in.j.lozano further testified that he has been able to find tenants only sporadically since then,and that at least one prospective tenant,who had been quite interested in an apartment,reacted with concern and quickly departed after lozano informed him about the requirements of the iirao and the ro.espinal similarly testified that he has had more difficulty in renting apartments since passage of the ordinances,and that on at least one occasion,he showed an apartment to potential tenants,who were going to take it,but after telling these applicants about the ordinances,they never called him back.the record therefore supports the district court conclusion that lozano and espinal suffered sufficient injury to establish article iii standing.
hazleton next argues that even if lozano and espinal did lose tenants and rental income because of these ordinances,such an injury is not legally cognizable because landlords have no right to rent to illegal aliens.hazleton makes the rather hyperbolic metaphor of comparing these plaintiffs to drug dealers asserting a claim to the proceeds of their unlawful activity.the city states j ust as a drug dealer has no interest in income derived from violations of federal drug laws,a landlord has no interest in income derived from continuing violations of federal immigration law.hazleton br.hazleton comparison is as regrettable as it is unsound.
it is unfortunate that we must point out that there is no evidence in the record that the prospective tenants who chose not to rent from plaintiffs were here unlawfully,as hazleton argument presumes.there are certainly other reasons why such invasive ordinances might dissuade a prospective tenant from renting in hazleton.however,even if we were to assume that all deterred tenants were here unlawfully,we would still conclude that plaintiffs assert an injury cognizable under the law.
by comparing landlords to persons who sell drugs in direct contravention of federal law,hazleton distorts both the applicable law and the interests these plaintiffs assert.federal law simply does not prohibit landlords from renting in the ordinary course of business to persons who lack lawful immigration status.nor does federal law directly prohibit persons lacking lawful status from renting apartments.as we discuss in further detail below,there is a federal prohibition against harboring of aliens lacking lawful presence.however,this prohibition is not nearly so broad as hazleton,and has never been held to apply to a landlord who does nothing more than rent to a tenant who happens to be here unlawfully.in light of these realities,we think the interest that these plaintiffs assert is more appropriately characterized as an interest in continuing to operate their rental businesses consistent with the less costly mandates of federal law,and that is an interest which supports article iii standing.
hazleton also argues that these plaintiffs fail to establish that the iirao and the ro caused whatever injury they have suffered because actions of independent the potential tenants are responsible for that injury,not the ordinances themselves.hazleton draws its argument from the discussion of causation in lujan.there,the supreme court explained that when the plaintiff is himself an object of a challenged government action,there is ordinarily little question that the action has caused him injury,and that a judgment will redress it.lujan,at.however,when 
a plaintiff asserted injury arises from the government allegedly unlawful regulation or lack of regulation of someone else,much more is needed.in that circumstance,causation and redressability ordinarily hinge on the response of the regulated or regulable third party to the government action or perhaps on the response of others as well thus,when the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action or inaction he challenges,standing is not precluded,but it is ordinarily substantially more difficult to establish.
lujan,at internal quotation marks omitted.hazleton contends that the landlord plaintiffs can not satisfy this higher burden.
in pitt news fisher,cir,we discussed when the regulation of a causes a plaintiff injury for the purposes of article iii.there,pennsylvania had amended its liquor code to impose criminal sanctions on businesses that advertised alcoholic beverages in publications directed at educational institutions.the pitt news,a newspaper at the university of pittsburgh,sued to enjoin enforcement of this amendment,and asserted standing based on the fact that its advertising revenues had suffered because of advertisers compliance with the law.the district court held that indirect economic effects resulting from a regulation aimed at third parties were insufficient to give the pitt news standing.id.at.
in reversing that ruling,we explained that the advertisers would not have cancelled their contracts with the pitt news were it not for the regulation.the fact that advertisers would cancel their contracts,thereby reducing advertising revenues,was not only reasonably foreseeable when the commonwealth decided to enact and enforce the act,it was the very goal of the statute.id.at internal citation omitted.accordingly,we concluded that the injury the newspaper suffered was fairly traceable to enforcement of the statute against its advertisers.
the situation in pitt news is analogous to the situation here.the housing provisions of the iirao and the ro have already deterred certain renters from contracting for housing with lozano and espinal,and these ordinances will continue to deter other renters if they are enforced.this deterrence was not only reasonably foreseeable when hazleton enacted these ordinances,it was hazleton very goal.id.the injuries lozano and espinal assert are a direct,predictable,and anticipated consequence of the regulation.accordingly,their injuries are fairly traceable to the ordinances.
moreover,hazleton argument ignores that lozano and espinal are not just directly impacted by the ordinances,but directly regulated as well.the housing provisions of the iirao and the ro regulate both tenants and landlords.although the injury on which hazleton focuses,the injury of lost rental income,is caused by the requirements imposed on tenants,the district court found,and we certainly agree,that these landlords would be equally injured by the requirements the iirao and the ro impose on them.thus,even if we agreed with all of hazleton arguments thus far,we would still conclude that lozano and espinal have standing.the housing provisions of the iirao and the ro regulate the ability of landlords to contract with certain persons.they require landlords to explain the ordinances to all prospective renters and to examine those renters occupancy permits.more generally,they compel landlords to act as local enforcers of immigration law in ways that far exceed their obligations under federal law.compliance with these requirements elevates the cost of doing business as a landlord,and that alone gives them article iii standing 
tenant plaintiffs 
because t he loss or imminent loss of one apartment and the inability to rent a new one is certainly an actual and concrete injury,caused by the ordinances and redressable by the court,the district court concluded that the doe plaintiffs,who lack lawful immigration status,also have standing to challenge the housing provisions of the iirao and the ro.lozano,d at.
hazleton first argues that the district court erred in finding that john does and and jane doe face imminent injury.according to hazleton,their fears of eviction are merely conjectural because none of them have been evicted or have received any threat or warning that they might be evicted in the future.hazleton br.we are entirely unconvinced.
these plaintiffs all testified that they feared losing their apartments and having to move elsewhere.see.hazleton cites john doe testimony that he did not expect to be evicted because his landlord does care much about the ordinances,as evidence that he faces no imminent injury.however,hazleton misconstrues this testimony.john doe later explained that he had been told by his landlord agent that his landlord did not expect the ordinances to ever go into effect,and for that reason,john doe had been unconcerned.see.he also testified that he has no reason to believe that his landlord would not comply with the ordinances if they are enforced.given the harsh sanctions the iirao and the ro would impose on any landlord who rented to him or the other doe plaintiffs,such fears are plainly.the possibility of eviction is therefore much more than conjecture.a plaintiff need only show a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute operation or enforcement,and the doe plaintiffs clearly do so.babbitt united farm workers union.
hazleton also raises here the converse of its argument above it contends that the doe plaintiffs lack standing because their claimed injuries would be caused by landlords,and not the ordinances.this verges on the ridiculous.just as hazleton ordinances compel tenants not to rent from plaintiff landlords,they compel landlords not to rent to plaintiff tenants.the doe plaintiffs fears that their landlords will not rent to the iirao and the ro require those landlords not rent to certainly fairly traceable to the ordinances.additionally,as hazleton well knows,these ordinances directly regulate tenants as well,and therefore would injure the doe plaintiffs regardless of their landlords reactions to them.the iirao and the ro would invalidate their leases,and would require them to pay a fee and provide documentation which they lack in order to continue renting apartments in hazleton.these injuries easily satisfy article iii.
finally,hazleton argues that the doe plaintiffs fail to establish redressability because,even if this court struck down the ordinances,the doe plaintiffs would still be subject to removal.according to hazleton,this court can not grant a remedy that takes the doe p laintiffs out of legal jeopardy.they will still be in violation of federal law and subject to removal.hazleton br.hazleton greatly overstates the demands of this element of constitutional standing.
as the supreme court explained in larson valente,a plaintiff satisfies the redressability requirement when he shows that a favorable decision will relieve a discrete injury to himself.he need not show that a favorable decision will relieve his every injury.redressability therefore does not require that a court be able to solve all of a plaintiff woes.rather,we need only be able to redress,to some extent,the specific injury underlying the suit.see epa,holding that redressability prong was satisfied because risk of global climate change would be reduced to some extent by relief requested.by permanently enjoining enforcement of the housing provisions of the iirao and the ro,this court can provide meaningful redress for the injury the doe plaintiffs assert.such relief would substantially decrease the likelihood that they will be evicted unable to procure rental housing while they remain in the united states.that is more than sufficient to establish standing.
because lozano,hhba member espinal,and the doe plaintiffs will suffer injury caused by the ordinances and redressable by the court,we conclude that they have article iii standing to challenge the housing provisions of the iirao and the ro.
prudential standing 
even when a plaintiff satisfies article iii standing requirements,federal courts may nonetheless decline to consider that plaintiff claims for prudential reasons.hazleton contends that there are two prudential considerations which counsel restraint here.
hazleton first argues that plaintiffs lack prudential standing because they do not fall within the zone of interests protected by federal immigration law.hazleton misstates the applicable zone of interests inquiry in the context.
the supreme court has explained that a plaintiff may bring suit only when the interests asserts are arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.ass of data processing serv,camp.this limitation on standing arose in suits challenging agency action under the administrative procedure act apa,but has since been employed more broadly.see bennett spear,the test was first applied to suits under the apa,but later cases have applied it also in suits not involving review of federal administrative action and have specifically listed it among other prudential standing requirements of general application.internal citations omitted.however,outside of the administrative law context,the test may have different permutations,see conte,quaker,cir,and the breadth of the zone of interests will vary according to the provisions of law at issue,bennett,at.
thus,in the context,we have explained that the relevant prudential inquiry is not whether a plaintiff interests fall within the zone protected by the allegedly federal provision,in this case,federal immigration law.in.john hotel tourism ass virgin islands,cir,several employer organizations brought suit to enjoin a virgin islands law establishing that employees could only be terminated for cause.the plaintiffs alleged that this law was by the national labor relations act nlra.on appeal,defendants argued that plaintiffs lacked prudential standing to invoke the effect of the nlra,because the nlra zone of interests did not encompass employers interests in terminating their employees.we agreed with the defendants characterization of the nlra zone of interests,but found this no bar to employers prudential standing.we explained 
we know of no governing authority to the effect that the federal statutory provision which allegedly enforcement of local legislation by conflict must confer a right on the party that argues in favor of.on the contrary,a state or territorial law can be unenforceable as by federal law even when the federal law secures no individual substantive rights for the party arguing.
suits arise under the supremacy clause and vindicate the interests of that clause,not the interests of the federal provision.therefore,the appropriate prudential inquiry in cases if any such inquiry is necessary at all must be whether the plaintiff interests fall within the zone protected by the supremacy clause itself.see,wilderness soc y kane,cir declining to decide if zone of interests test applies in cases,but emphasizing that if it does,the relevant zone of interest is that of the supremacy clause and not of the allegedly federal statute pharm.research mfrs.concannon,cir in a case,it is the interests protected by the supremacy clause,not by the statute,that are at issue.these interests,which are no less than our society interest in a working federalism,are societal,not individual.accordingly,all plaintiffs fall within their breadth,and have prudential standing here.
hazleton also argues that we should,as a matter of prudential standing,refuse to adjudicate the doe plaintiffs claims because they concede that they lack lawful immigration status.hazleton relies on national coalition of latino clergy,henry,wl,the unpublished decision of a lone federal district court as support for its contention 
in henry,the district court for the northern district of oklahoma considered challenges to the oklahoma taxpayer and citizen protection act of,a law which mirrors the iirao in several respects and which,in litigation,chamber of commerce edmondson,cir,was preliminarily enjoined in part.the court concluded that those plaintiffs lacking lawful immigration status had article iii standing,but nonetheless held that it would not consider their claims for prudential reasons.explaining that courts have traditionally refused to entertain cases brought by plaintiffs with unclean hands,it reasoned that the illegal alien plaintiffs seek nothing more than to use this court as a vehicle for their continued unlawful presence in this country,at.to allow them to do so,the court concluded,would make it an abetter of iniquity,a result it found unpalatable.id.the court thus adopted a new,and narrow,prudential limitation on standing 
a n illegal alien,in willful violation of federal immigration law,is without standing to challenge the constitutionality of a state law,when compliance with federal law would absolve the illegal alien constitutional when the challenged state law was enacted to discourage violation of the federal immigration law.
hazleton argues that,for the reasons articulated in henry,we too must prudentially decline to take jurisdiction with respect to the doe appellees.hazleton br.henry invented bar to judicial access is entirely improper,and we will not accept hazleton invitation to duplicate that error here.
the henry decision,both in substance and tone,fails to appreciate that whatever a person immigration status,an alien is surely a person entitled to due process clause protections.plyler,at see also wolff mcdonnell,the right of access to the courts is founded in the due process clause and assures that no person will be denied the opportunity to present to the judiciary allegations concerning violations of fundamental constitutional rights.the supreme court therefore has certainly considered judicial challenges brought by persons lacking lawful immigration status,see,plyler,even when compliance with federal law would have absolved the illegal alien constitutional dilemma,henry,wl,at.
henry defends its rule by claiming that it would not deny persons without lawful status all access to the courts,as they would retain prudential standing to sue for harms unrelated to their status.but this caveat assures little.as this case demonstrates,all it takes for a harm to become related to a person immigration status is for some legislative body to decree it so.the scope of these aliens rights would therefore,under henry reasoning,be entirely dependent on the will of state and local legislatures,which could tie any consequence of their choosing to unlawful status and never face judicial review.
the doe plaintiffs satisfy article iii standing requirements,and the prudential standing requirements of general applicability set forth by the supreme court.accordingly,we will address their claims.however,two more preliminary issues must be resolved before we do so.
anonymity and confidentiality 
hazleton argues that the district court erred in permitting those plaintiffs lacking lawful immigration status to proceed using a john doe or jane doe pseudonym.we disagree.
in protection plus,we explained that although the use of pseudonyms to conceal a plaintiff identity has no explicit sanction in the federal rules,the supreme court has given the practice implicit recognition.at.we thus concluded that the decision whether to allow a plaintiff to proceed anonymously rests within the sound discretion of the court.id.
in deciding whether to permit those plaintiffs with concerns about the legality of their immigration status to proceed anonymously,the district court surveyed case law within this circuit and identified nine separate factors courts have used to decide whether anonymity is appropriate.see lozano,d at.the court then engaged in a thorough analysis of each of these factors,and concluded that the factors favoring anonymity outweighed those favoring disclosure.specifically,the court found that ethnic tensions had escalated in hazleton since enactment of the ordinances,and that the named plaintiffs had been harassed and intimidated for their involvement in this litigation see id.at.the court concluded that the doe plaintiffs,because of their unlawful status,would face an exponentially greater risk of harassment,and even physical danger,if their identities were revealed.id.at.the court also noted that the litigation was in the public interest,and reasoned that the doe plaintiffs,as well as prospective litigants lacking lawful status,would be deterred from bringing cases clarifying constitutional rights,if doing so required alerting federal immigration authorities to their presence.see id.at.finally,the court explained that because the doe plaintiffs identity information was not central to their claims,restricting hazleton access to that information would not be prejudicial.see id.at.we agree with each of these conclusions,and think it clear that given the environment in hazleton following enactment of these ordinances,the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the doe plaintiffs to proceed using pseudonyms.
relatedly,hazleton also argues that the district court violated a by entering an order prohibiting the parties from disclosing information obtained during discovery regarding the john and jane doe plaintiffs.section a provides 
notwithstanding any other provision of federal,state,or local law,a federal,state,or local government entity or official may not prohibit,or in any way restrict,any government entity or official from sending to,or receiving from,the immigration and naturalization service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status,lawful or unlawful,of any individual.
a.hazleton argues that because the district court is an entity of the federal government,it was prohibited by this section from preventing hazleton from communicating with federal immigration authorities about the citizenship or immigration status of the doe plaintiffs.
although we are not convinced that a does,or could,limit the inherent powers of federal courts in the way hazleton suggests,we need not reach this question because hazleton argument fails for a more fundamental reason.under the confidentiality agreement the parties eventually entered into,the doe plaintiffs agreed to reveal their identities only to hazleton attorneys,and not to hazleton officials.see.consequently,hazleton never learned these plaintiffs identities or their immigration status.the district court simply could not have prohibited hazleton from communicating with the federal government about information that hazleton never knew.
vi.discussion 
having resolved these preliminary issues,we can turn to the merits of the claims before us.although our reasoning differs from that of the district court,we agree that the provisions of the ordinances which we have jurisdiction to review are by federal immigration law and unconstitutional under the supremacy clause.because that conclusion turns on the relationship between the ordinances and federal immigration law,we begin our inquiry into the merits of this appeal by briefly laying out the parameters of that law.
federal immigration law 
the immigration and nationality act 
the primary body of federal immigration law is contained in the immigration and nationality act ina,enacted in,and amended many times thereafter.the ina sets forth the criteria by which aliens,defined as any person not a citizen or a national of the united states,a,may enter,visit,and reside in this country.
under the ina,there are three primary categories of aliens who may lawfully enter spend time within the united states nonimmigrants,who are persons admitted for a limited purpose and for a limited amount of time,such as visitors for pleasure,students,diplomats,and temporary workers,see a immigrants,who are persons admitted as or after admission,become lawful permanent residents of the united states based on,inter alia,family,employment,or diversity characteristics,see and refugees and asylees,who are persons admitted to and permitted to stay for some time in the united states because of humanitarian concerns,see aliens wishing to be legally admitted into the united states must satisfy specific eligibility criteria in one of these categories,and also not be barred by other provisions of federal law that determine inadmissibility.congress has determined that who,inter alia,have certain health conditions,have been convicted of certain crimes,present security concerns,or have been recently removed from the united states,are inadmissible,see,and if detained when attempting to enter or reenter the country,may be subject to expedited removal,see.
despite the carefully designed system for lawful entry described above,persons lacking lawful immigration status are obviously still present in the united states.as the supreme court explained almost thirty years ago s heer incapability or lax enforcement of the laws barring entry into this country has resulted in the creation of a substantial shadow population within our borders.plyler,at.such persons may lack lawful status because they entered the united states illegally,either by failing to register with immigration authorities or by failing to disclose information that would have rendered them inadmissible when they entered.see.in addition,aliens who entered legally may thereafter lose lawful status,either by failing to adhere to a condition of admission,or by committing prohibited acts such as certain criminal offenses after being admitted.see id.
persons here unlawfully are subject to removal from the country.removal proceedings are initiated at the discretion of the department of homeland security dhs see juarez holder,cir t he decision when to initiate removal proceedings is committed to the discretion of immigration authorities.citing reno.although certain aliens are subject to more expedited removal proceedings for all others,section of the ina sets forth the sole and exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be admitted to the united states or,if the alien has been so admitted,removed from the united states.a.
under section,an alien facing removal is entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge and is provided numerous procedural protections during that hearing,including notice,the opportunity to present and examine evidence,and the opportunity to be represented by counsel at the alien expense.see.at the conclusion of a removal hearing,the presiding immigration judge must decide,based on the evidence produced during the hearing,whether the alien is removable,see c a,and if so,whether should be ordered removed,or should be afforded relief from removal.such relief can include postponement of removal,cancellation of removal,or even adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident.see c.
in sum,while any alien who is in the united states unlawfully faces the prospect of removal proceedings being initiated against,whether will actually be ordered removed is never a certainty until all legal proceedings have concluded.moreover,even after an order of removal issues,the possibility remains that no country will accept the alien.under such circumstances,the constitution limits the government authority to detain someone in anticipation of removal if there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.see zadvydas davis,
the ina,as amended,also prohibits the harboring of aliens lacking lawful immigration status.it provides that any person who knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to,entered,or remains in the united states in violation of law,conceals,harbors,or shields from detection such alien in any place,including any building or any means or transportation shall be subject to criminal penalties.a a iii.
for decades,the ina contained no specific prohibition against the employment of aliens lacking legal status.rather,regulation of the employment of aliens not lawfully present was at most a peripheral concern.decanas bica.this changed in,when congress amended the ina through enactment of the immigration reform and control act irca,stat.codified at.irca forcefully made combating the employment of illegal aliens central to the policy of immigration law.hoffman plastic compounds,national labor relations board,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
the immigration reform and control act 
irca regulates the employment of unauthorized aliens,a term of art defined by the statute as those aliens neither lawfully admitted for permanent residence nor authorized to be employed by this chapter or by the attorney general.h.irca makes it unlawful to knowingly hire or continue to employ an unauthorized alien,or to hire anyone for employment without complying with the work authorization verification system created by the statute.a.this verification system,often referred to as the process,requires that an employer examine certain documents that establish both identity and employment authorization for new employees.see b.the employer must then fill out an form attesting that reviewed these documents,that they reasonably appear to be genuine,and that to the best of the employer knowledge,the employee is authorized to work in the united states.see id.although employers are required to verify the work authorization of all employees,congress did not extend this requirement to independent contractors.see a making unlawful the knowing employment of an unauthorized alien,and the hiring of an employee for employment without verifying the employee work authorization.f specifically excluding independent contractors from the definition of employee.g specifically excluding a person or entity using contract labor from the definition of employer.
the verification system is critical to the irca regime.hoffman plastic compounds,at.not only is failure to use the system illegal,but use of the system provides an affirmative defense to a charge of knowingly employing an unauthorized alien.see a.thus,employers who use the process in good faith to verify the work authorization of employees are presumed not to have knowingly employed someone unauthorized to work in this country.in enacting irca,congress required the president to monitor the security and efficacy of this verification system.see d.congress also imposed limits on the president ability to change it.id.
in addition to relying on the verification system,irca uses public monitoring,prosecution,and sanctions to deter employment of unauthorized aliens.irca provides for the creation of procedures through which members of the public may file complaints about potential violations it authorizes immigration officers to investigate these complaints and it creates a comprehensive hearing and appeals process through which complaints are evaluated and adjudicated by administrative law judges.see e.
under irca,an employer who knowingly hires an unauthorized alien shall be ordered to cease and desist the violation,and to pay between and per unauthorized alien for a first offense,between and per unauthorized alien for a second offense,and between and per unauthorized alien for a third or greater offense.e.an employer who fails to verify the work authorization of its employees can be ordered to pay between and for each person whose authorization it failed to authenticate.e.employers who engage in a pattern or practice of hiring unauthorized aliens shall be fined up to per unauthorized alien,imprisoned for not more than six months,or both.f.
irca expressly states and localities from imposing additional civil or criminal sanctions other than through licensing and similar laws upon those who employ,or recruit or refer for a fee for employment,unauthorized aliens.h.
because of its concern that prohibiting the employment of unauthorized aliens might result in employment discrimination against authorized workers who appear to be foreign,congress included significant protections in irca.see the statute provides that,with certain limited exceptions,it is an unfair employment practice to discriminate in hiring on the basis of national origin or citizenship status.a.congress put teeth into this provision by creating the office of a special counsel to investigate and prosecute such offenses,and it required that the president fill that position with the advice and consent of the senate.c congress also authorized immigration judges to punish those who violate irca mandate by imposing civil fines equivalent in amount to those imposed for knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens.compare e a i iii with g b iv i iii 
the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act 
in,congress again amended the ina by enacting the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,stat.codified as amended in various sections of.in iirira,congress directed the attorney general,and later the secretary of homeland security,to conduct three pilot programs of employment eligibility confirmation in an attempt to improve upon the process.iirira a,stat.congress mandated that these programs be conducted on a trial basis,for a limited time period,and in a limited number of states.see iirira b c,stat.two of these trial systems were discontinued in.however,the known as the basic pilot program but since renamed was reauthorized and expanded to all fifty states in.see basic pilot program extension and expansion act of,stat.it has been reauthorized several times since,and its current authorization will expire,absent congressional action,on september.see department of homeland security appropriations act,stat.consolidated security,disaster assistance,and continuing appropriations act,div.a,stat.
allows an employer to actually authenticate applicable documents rather than merely visually scan them for genuineness.when using,an employer enters information from an employee documents into an internetbased computer program,and that information is then transmitted to the social security administration dhs for authentication.see iirira,as amended,a.these agencies confirm or tentatively nonconfirm whether the employee documents are authentic,and whether the employee is authorized to work in the united states.see iirira,as amended,a.if a tentative nonconfirmation is issued,the employer must notify the employee,who may contest the result.see id.if an employee does not contest the tentative result within the statutorily prescribed period,the tentative nonconfirmation becomes a final nonconfirmation.see id.if the employee does contest it,the appropriate agencies undertake additional review and ultimately issue a final decision.see id.an employer may not take any adverse action against an employee until it receives a final nonconfirmation.see id.however,once a final nonconfirmation is received,an employer is expected to terminate the employee,or face sanctions.
with only a few exceptions,federal law makes the decision of whether to use rather than the default process entirely voluntary.see iirira,as amended,a.federal government employers and certain employers previously found guilty of violating irca are currently required to use all other employers remain free to use the system of their choice see iirira,as amended,e.significantly,in enacting iirira,congress specifically prohibited the secretary of homeland security from requiring any person or other entity to participate in.see iirira,as amended,a.congress also directed the secretary to publicize the voluntary nature of the program and to ensure that government representatives are available to inform persons and other entities that seek information about of its voluntary nature.iirira,as amended,d.
those employers who elect to use and actually do use the system to confirm an employee authorization to work are entitled to a rebuttable presumption that they did not hire that employee knowing that lacks authorization to work in this country.see iirira,as amended,b.employers who elect to use,but in practice continue to use the process,are not entitled to the rebuttable presumption,but can still claim the affirmative defense.see iirira,as amended,b.
state and local immigration laws 
as we noted at the outset,state and local attempts to regulate issues related to immigration have skyrocketed in recent years.according to the national conference of state legislatures nc sl,bills pertaining to immigration were introduced in state legislatures in,and of them were enacted into law.national conference on state legislatures,state laws related to immigrants and immigration january,http last visited.less than five years later,these numbers had increased more than in,over bills pertaining to immigration were introduced.from these,laws were enacted,and resolutions adopted.id.
a number of these laws contain provisions that are either identical,or similar,to provisions in hazleton ordinances in their brief filed on behalf of plaintiffs,amici curiae chambers of commerce note that arizona,mississippi,oklahoma,utah,tennessee,louisiana,west virginia,colorado,minnesota,georgia,and rhode island,as well as the municipalities of valley park,missouri mission viejo,california beaufort county,south carolina and apple valley,california,have all enacted laws that in some way regulate either the procedures employers must undertake in order to avoid hiring unauthorized aliens,or the penalties that can be imposed for doing so.in addition,plaintiffs call our attention to several localities,including escondido,california and the city of farmers branch,texas,which have passed ordinances regulating the provision of rental housing to aliens not lawfully present in the united states.
various challenges have been leveled at these commonly,attacks rooted in the supremacy the resulting body of case law informs our analysis.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit,affirming a decision by the district court for the district of arizona,upheld an arizona statute requiring all employers within the state to use,and subjecting businesses that employ unauthorized aliens to a graduated series of sanctions up to and including the permanent revocation of their business licenses.that court rejected the plaintiffs and due process claims.see chicanos por la causa,napolitano,cir,cert.granted.the district court for the eastern district of missouri also upheld an employment ordinance virtually identical to the iirao against,due process,and equal protection challenges,as well as challenges based on state law.see gray city of valley park,wl,aff on other grounds,cir.
in contrast,the court of appeals for the tenth circuit partially affirmed a preliminary injunction issued by the district court for the western district of oklahoma,barring enforcement of certain provisions of an oklahoma law on grounds.much like the iirao,that law required employers in oklahoma to verify the work authorization of independent contractors,and also created a private cause of action against business entities that employ unauthorized aliens.see chamber of commerce edmondson,cir.
the district courts for the southern district of california and the northern district of texas have held that ordinances similar to the housing provisions of the iirao and the ro are.see villas at parkside partners city of farmers branch farmers branch iii,d,wl,villas at parkside partners city of farmers branch farmers branch ii,d garrett city of escondido,d.
as we have explained,the district court entered the challenged injunction because it concluded that the iirao and the ro,among other failings,are by federal law.although our reasoning departs from that of the district court,we agree with its conclusion see johnson orr,cir an appellate court may affirm a result reached by the district court on reasons that differ so long as the record supports the judgment.
the supremacy clause of the united states constitution provides that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art.vi,cl.the doctrine is a necessary outgrowth of the supremacy clause.it ensures that when congress either expresses or implies an intent to preclude certain state or local legislation,offending enactments can not stand.

the supreme court has long made clear that federal interests are paramount in the field of immigration.the court explained seventy years ago t hat the supremacy of the national power in the general field of foreign affairs,including power over immigration,naturalization and deportation,is made clear by the constitution was pointed out by authors of the federalist in,and has since been given continuous recognition by this court.hines,u.at see also toll moreno.
however,the supreme court has also explained that not every state or local enactment that affects the rights of aliens necessarily interferes with the federal interest in immigration.in decanas bica,the supreme court articulated a framework for analyzing challenges to state and local laws that impact the rights of aliens but do not regulate immigration.although decanas was decided a decade before congress enacted irca and two decades before it enacted iirira,many aspects of the court analysis are still relevant to our inquiry.
in decanas,the supreme court considered whether a state law prohibiting the employment of persons unlawfully present was by the ina.california had enacted legislation prohibiting employers within the state from knowingly employ ing an alien who is not entitled to lawful residence in the united states if such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.a group of migrant farmworkers sued,arguing that the law was both by the constitution exclusive delegation of the power to regulate immigration to the federal government,and by the ina.the court disagreed.
in upholding the statute,the court explained that the p ower to regulate immigration is unquestionably exclusively a federal power under the united states constitution,precluding all state involvement even if congress has neither expressed nor implied its intent to preclude that state regulation.id.at.t he constitution of its own force requires of any state efforts to actually regulate immigration.id.at.however,the court also explained that not every state enactment which in any way deals with aliens is a regulation of immigration and thus per se by this constitutional power.id.rather,a state law only regulates immigration if it is essentially a determination of who should or should not be admitted into the country,and the conditions under which a legal entrant may remain.id.as california law did not intrude into these proscribed areas,the court held that it was not,absent congressional action.
the court also held that california law was not field by the ina regulatory scheme.first,the court explained that the regulation of employment of illegal aliens was not a subject matter of such clear and manifest federal importance as to require the conclusion that it was occupied by federal regulation.id.at.the court reasoned that states have broad authority under their police powers to regulate the employment relationship to protect workers within the state,and that california law fell within the mainstream of such police power regulation.id.because the law focuse d directly upon the essentially local problems of employing illegal aliens and was tailored to combat effectively the perceived evils,it did not touch upon a field that by its very nature would support no conclusion but that congress had occupied it id.at.
secondly,the court concluded that the ina as it then existed did not reflect clear and manifest congressional intent to preclude state regulation in the field of employment of aliens here unlawfully.then,the ina was primarily concerned with the terms and conditions of admission to the country and the subsequent treatment of aliens lawfully in the country.id.at.only one provision of one section of the ina even mentioned the employment of persons not lawfully in the country this evidenced at best a peripheral concern with employment of illegal entrants,which was insufficient to establish a congressional intent to occupy the field.id.at.to the contrary,the court believed that congress had indicated its intent,through laws addressing farm labor contractors,for the states to consistent with federal law,regulate the employment of illegal aliens.id.at.
the court did not,however,actually rule on the issue of conflict.rather,it remanded the matter so that the lower courts could determine if california law was consistent with federal law.id.in all other respects,though,the court found the challenged law an appropriate use of state power,given both its limited impact upon immigration and congress then limited foray into regulating the employment of persons lacking lawful immigration status.
in sum,decanas holds that the federal authority to regulate immigration is exclusive,but states are not necessarily precluded from regulating consistent with federal law certain local issues affecting the rights of aliens,unless congress has indicated an intent to preclude such regulation.
employment provisions 
presumption against 
the district court concluded that the employment provisions of the iirao were expressly,field,and conflict.hazleton challenges each of the district court conclusions on multiple grounds.hazleton first claims that the district court erred in failing to apply the presumption against.we agree.
as we have noted,congress does not casually sweep away the historic police powers of states.this reality underlies the rebuttable presumption that federal legislation does not those police powers absent clear and manifest congressional intent to the contrary.medtronic,at.only state and local laws aimed at areas beyond the state historic police powers,that venture into matters long regulated by the federal government,are not afforded the benefit of this presumption.see locke,at a n assumption of is not triggered when the state regulates in an area where there has been a history of significant federal presence.internal quotation marks omitted.
in analyzing the applicability of the presumption in this case,the district court reasoned that i mmigration is an area of the law where there is a history of significant federal presence and where the states have not traditionally occupied the field.in fact immigration is a federal concern not a state or local matter.lozano,d at.based on this reasoning,the district court refused to presume.however,the district court analysis is inconsistent with the framework set forth in decanas.
as we noted above,in decanas the supreme court explained that not every state enactment which in any way deals with aliens is a regulation of immigration.at emphasis added.rather,laws regulate immigration only if they attempt to regulate who should or should not be admitted into the country,and the conditions under which a legal entrant may remain.id.hazleton employment provisions therefore plainly do not regulate immigration under decanas.rather,they regulate the employment of persons unauthorized to work in this country,and like the law at issue in decanas,fall within the state historic police powers.accordingly,they must benefit from the presumption against.
we are aware,of course,that the landscape of federal immigration law has changed dramatically since the court decided decanas.in enacting irca,congress clearly made the regulation of the employment of unauthorized aliens a central concern of federal immigration policy.however,while this sea change in the federal regulatory scheme is incredibly important for purposes of our substantive analysis,it does not negate the operation of the presumption against.the applicability of the presumption turns on a state historic police powers.by definition,that means that the presumption depends on the past balance of state and federal regulation,not on the present.
as we have just explained,until the passage of irca,the federal government played at most a very small role in regulating the employment of persons without lawful immigration status.see decanas,at.moreover,the supreme court concluded that congress then intended for the states to,consistent with federal law,regulate the employment of illegal aliens.id.at.thus,when congress enacted irca,it began legislating in an area in which states had regulated,and in which the federal government,for the most part,had not.accordingly,we presume that congress did not intend to sweep away the states historic police powers by enacting irca,absent clear evidence to the contrary.
as noted above,irca includes an express clause,which states that t he provisions of this section preempt any state or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions other than through licensing and similar laws upon those who employ,or recruit or refer for a fee for employment,unauthorized aliens.h.thus,irca expressly state and local laws that sanction those who employ unauthorized aliens,unless the sanction is imposed through a licensing,or similar,law.
the district court read this clause as expressly hazleton employment provisions in the iirao because they impose a suspension of a business business entities that employ unauthorized aliens.hazleton had argued that the iirao is a licensing law,and thus saved from the express reach of irca,but the district court disagreed.the court reasoned that since the iirao imposes the ultimate sanction of entirely taking away a business ability to operate,it is at odds with the plain language of the express provision,which is concerned with state and local municipalities creating civil and criminal sanctions against employers.lozano,d at.
the district court also concluded,based on a review of irca legislative history,that the iirao scheme for revoking licenses is inconsistent with the congressional intent underlying irca saving clause.according to the court,congress had no intention,in exempting licensing laws from express,of permitting states and localities to independently adjudicate whether a business entity has employed an unauthorized alien.in reaching this conclusion,the district court reviewed.i,reprinted in,the sole piece of irca legislative history directly discussing the provision.based on several sentences in that report,the court concluded that congress intended the saving clause to only exempt from express local laws that revoke the licenses of persons who the federal government has found guilty of violating irca,and not the licenses of persons who localities independently adjudicate guilty of violating their own prohibitions against employing unauthorized aliens because the iirao creates its own procedures for adjudicating whether an employer is guilty of employing unauthorized aliens,and revokes licenses based on that determination,rather than based on a federal determination that an employer has violated irca,the court concluded that the iirao employment provisions do not fall within the scope of irca saving clause.see lozano,d at.on appeal,hazleton renews its argument that the iirao employment provisions are a licensing law within the meaning of irca saving clause,and we agree.
as noted earlier,the text of irca express clause explicitly excludes from its scope licensing and similar laws.congress did not define these terms.terms that are not statutorily defined are usually ascribed their ordinary or natural meaning.fed.deposit ins.meyer.
dictionary defines a license as a permission granted by competent authority to engage in a business or occupation or in an activity otherwise unlawful.similarly,black law dictionary defines a license as a permission,usually revocable,to commit some act that would otherwise be unlawful.black law dictionary ed.here,the iirao conditions the grant of a business license on a business agreement not to employ unauthorized aliens,and on the business continued adherence to that agreement.a business license certainly falls within the plain meaning of a license and therefore,it seems clear that the iirao provisions for suspending such licenses constitute a licensing law.
plaintiffs nonetheless argue,consistent with the district court decision,that irca express provision would be toothless if a state or municipality could effectively circumvent the general prohibition on imposing sanctions by imposing sanctions of this severity.according to plaintiffs,the loss of a business license is the death penalty for a business,and the express clause would be swallowed by its exception if a law regulating business licenses is held to be a licensing law.
in support of their argument,plaintiffs cite several recent supreme court cases which stand for the proposition that courts should read saving clauses narrowly,and in light of the statutory scheme as a whole.see aetna health davila,geier,at locke,at.looking at irca and its purposes more broadly,plaintiffs argue that it is clear that congress could not have intended the saving clause to permit states and localities to revoke the business licenses of employers who employ unauthorized aliens.
the problem with plaintiffs argument,however,is that even if we look more broadly at irca as a whole,there is simply no basis for wedging the limitation plaintiffs urge into the text.congress unequivocally states in the saving clause that licensing laws are not expressly by irca.nowhere in irca text or legislative history is there an indication that congress intended that clause to apply only to licensing laws that impose minor penalties,and not to licensing laws that impose more significant sanctions.similarly,there is no indication that congress intended to exclude laws regulating the provision,suspension,and revocation of business licenses from the term licensing law,and plaintiffs do not offer an alternative definition of license that would sensibly exclude business licenses.see chicanos por la causa,at finding no support for plaintiffs interpretation of the term license as excluding business licenses.
when statutory language is plain and unambiguous,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.lamie united states,internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore conclude that the iirao is a licensing law under irca saving clause and saved from express 
plaintiffs also argue consistent with the district court decision that the iirao does not fall within irca saving clause because it creates and relies upon its own adjudicative system for determining whether an employer has employed an unauthorized alien,rather than relying,as congress intended,on the adjudicative system created by irca.because this argument is better addressed in the context of the purposes and objectives underlying irca,we attend to it in our discussion of obstacle conflict 
that the iirao employment provisions are saved from express does not end our inquiry.as the supreme court has emphasized,a law that is saved from express is still invalid if it is conflict.see geier,at.the fact that congress intends to save a general class of laws,such as licensing and similar laws,from express does not mean that congress intends to permit any law within that category even if it impedes federal interests.a federal law that forecloses conflict analysis is one that defeat s its own objectives.id.at.congress may intend such a complex type of relationship,but we will not assume it absent proof.id.therefore,even though the iirao is a licensing law,it can not be allowed to operate if compliance with both its employment provisions and irca is impossible,or if those provisions stand as an obstacle to the objectives underlying irca.in either case,the supremacy clause requires that the iirao give way.
the district court concluded that the iirao employment provisions are by irca because of the numerous ways in which they differ from and conflict with irca.lozano,d at.hazleton argues that the district court erred by conflating mere difference with conflicts sufficient to result in.hazleton br.
the city correctly argues that conflict occurs only if a difference either makes it impossible to comply with both federal and local law or stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.hines,at see also.lime avocado growers,paul.we too have concerns about the district court approach,both because it did at times equate difference with conflict,and because it failed to anchor its articulation of the congressional purposes underlying irca to that statute language and legislative history.
nonetheless,upon a thorough consideration of those purposes,we agree that the iirao employment provisions stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of federal law,and thus are.
as we will explain,it is indisputable that congress went to considerable lengths in enacting irca to achieve a careful balance among its competing policy objectives of effectively deterring employment of unauthorized aliens,minimizing the resulting burden on employers,and protecting authorized aliens and citizens perceived as foreign from discrimination.see edmondson,at irca balances the goals of preventing the hiring of unauthorized aliens,lessening the disruption of american business,and minimizing the possibility of employment discrimination.the iirao substantially undermines this careful balance.it furthers the first of these federal objectives at the expense of the others.this significant conflict is sufficient to rebut the presumption against,see geier,at,and invalidate these provisions under the supremacy clause.
irca was one of the longest and most difficult legislative undertakings of recent memory.presidential statement on signing the immigration reform and control act,weekly comp.doc.over the course of numerous sessions,congress debated taking the theretofore unprecedented step of directly prohibiting the employment of unauthorized aliens.congress ultimately committed to enacting employer sanctions,but in so doing,committed equally to enacting measures that would protect groups likely to be unfairly burdened by those and authorized workers.irca is thus a carefully crafted political compromise which at every level balances specifically chosen measures discouraging illegal employment with measures to protect those who might be adversely affected.ctr.for immigrants rights,ins,cir,rev on other grounds.
congress paid considerable attention to the costs irca would impose on employers,see.i,at considerable discussion was generated during the processing of this bill to the effect the employer sanctions provisions were placing an undue burden on employers in requiring them to do the paperwork and keep records on employees,and drafted the legislation in a manner that would minimize those burdens,see,cong.rec.daily ed,statement of bryant irca has been carefully designed for the minimum burden necessary to be effective.
congress heeded these concerns in crafting irca prosecution and adjudication scheme.for example,it limited investigation of complaints to those with a substantial probability of validity in order to minimize the possibility of harassment of innocent employers.e b,at.similarly,congress intended to minimize the burden and the risk placed on the employer in the verification process.collins foods int l,ins,cir.accordingly,the process only requires employers to ascertain whether employees documents appear on their face to be genuine.b a ii.i,at.congress could have required employers to ascertain the actual legitimacy of such documents it did not.
just as importantly,congress strove to ensure that the prohibition against hiring unauthorized aliens would not result in discrimination against authorized workers whether alien or citizen who appear foreign,as congress feared that overcautious employers might incorrectly assume such persons were unauthorized to work in the united states.irca legislative history could not be more plain or emphatic about the congressional commitment to preventing this sort of discrimination.the house report explains 
numerous witnesses over the past three congresses have expressed their deep concern that the imposition of employer sanctions will cause extensive employment discrimination against and other minority group members t he committee does believe that every effort must be taken to minimize the potentiality of discrimination and that a mechanism to remedy any discrimination that does occur must be a part of this legislation a protections are essential to this bill.
i,at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.irca is thus delicately balanced to serve the goal of preventing unauthorized alien employment while avoiding discrimination against citizens and authorized aliens.collins foods int l,at.as we explained earlier,congress created the office of a special counsel to handle discrimination charges,see c,and specifically required that the president fill that position,see c.as also detailed above,congress authorized administrative law judges to impose on employers found guilty of discrimination civil penalties equivalent to the penalties imposed on employers found guilty of employing unauthorized aliens.see g b iv i iii.
the supreme court has consistently found state and local laws which alter the careful balancing of objectives accomplished by a federal law to be,and so have we.see,bonito boats,thunder craft boats,finding florida law because it struck the balance between the encouragement of invention and free competition in unpatented ideas differently from federal patent law rogers larson,cir finding virgin islands law because it struck the balance between assur ing an adequate labor force on the one hand and protect ing the jobs of citizens on the other differently from federal immigration law.hazleton iirao undermines irca careful balancing of objectives in at least four ways.
first,the iirao significantly increases employer burden by creating a separate and independent adjudicative system for determining whether an employer is guilty of employing unauthorized aliens.hazleton system fails to reflect the same concern with reducing employer burden as irca.in contrast to the federal requirement that a complaint have a substantial probability of validity,the iirao permits investigation of any complaint lodged against an employer regardless of its likely merit.under section of the iirao,a complaint is valid so long as it includes an allegation which describes the alleged violator s as well as the actions constituting the violation,and the date and location where such actions occurred.iirao.upon receipt of any such complaint so long as it does allege a violation on the basis of national origin,ethnicity,or race,hazleton code enforcement office must,within three business days,request identity information from the business entity regarding any persons alleged to be unlawful workers.iirao.
similarly,the iirao provides employers with substantially fewer procedural protections than irca.under irca,an employer must be provided with notice and an opportunity for a hearing,and an administrative law judge must find the employer guilty of violating irca by a preponderance of the evidence before any sanctions can be imposed.see e.that employer also has a right to an administrative appeal and judicial review.see id.in marked contrast,the iirao requires hazleton code enforcement office to immediately suspend the business license of a business entity which fails to provide requested information about alleged unlawful workers within three business days.see iirao.additionally,if a business entity fails to terminate anyone that hazleton has decided is an unlawful worker within three business days,the code enforcement office immediately suspends its license.see iirao.a business entity that has been subject to a complaint and subsequent enforcement can then seek relief in court,but both the procedure and remedies available to that employer are entirely unclear on the face of the ordinance.see iirao.
the crux of this conflict,however,transcends the differences between the iirao prosecution and adjudication system and irca.rather,it is rooted in the fact that hazleton has established an alternate system at all.as we have explained,congress created a comprehensive and carefully balanced prosecution and adjudication system,and foremost among its goals in doing so was to minimize the burden this system would impose on employers.see edmondson,at irca exhaustively details a specialized administrative scheme for determining whether an employer has knowingly employed an unauthorized alien.we therefore can not fathom that congress intended to tolerate the supplementing of its carefully crafted system with independent state and local systems,which by their mere existence drastically increase burdens on employers.
under the iirao,a business in hazleton must worry about two separate systems of complaints,investigations,prosecutions,and adjudications.furthermore,hazleton ordinance is not the only consideration here,given the emerging landscape of local and state regulation in the area.see,buckman pls.legal,explaining that if one state tort system is permitted then federal law will have to operate in the shadow of states tort regimes thereby dramatically increas ing the burdens facing potential not contemplated by congress.if hazleton ordinance is permissible,then each and every state and locality would be free to implement similar schemes for investigating,prosecuting,and adjudicating whether an employer has employed unauthorized aliens.see rowe motor transp.ass n,reasoning that allowing one state to implement its own monitoring system would allow other states to do the same easily lead ing to a patchwork of state laws,rules,and regulations.as noted above,many states and localities have already tried.a patchwork of state and local systems each independently monitoring,investigating,and ultimately concurrently with the federal employers have hired unauthorized aliens could not possibly be in greater conflict with congress intent for its carefully crafted prosecution and adjudication system to minimize the burden imposed on employers 
second,the iirao contravenes congressional objectives by altering the employment verification scheme created by irca,and supplemented by iirira and subsequent legislation.while irca affords an affirmative defense to any employer who uses the process to verify the work authorization of its employees,the iirao does not.the iirao provides its safe harbor only to employers who use.in this way,the iirao significantly alters the risk calculus for employers,and coerces use of the iirao also directly compels city agencies,city contractors,and all employers twice found guilty of violating the iirao to use.these provisions contradict congressional intent for to remain fully voluntary for the vast majority of decision that,once again,balances seeking efficacy in employment authorization verification with the goals of minimizing employer burden and preventing employment discrimination.see geier,at finding state law imposing a specific requirement conflict where congress deliberately sought variety and to provide several different options.similarly,they contravene congressional intent for the process to serve as a universal protection against sanctions.
as plaintiffs pointed out at oral argument,if congress were solely concerned with ensuring that no unauthorized alien ever secured employment in the united states,it would have and could have found a better mechanism for verifying employment authorization than the process.the process is not foolproof,and yet it remains the default employment verification system years after irca enactment.this reflects congress determination that,which advances certain federal objectives to the detriment of others,is not yet appropriate for mandated use.
at least for certain categories of employees,studies have shown that is more effective than the process for determining whether an employee is authorized to work in the united states.see citizenship and immigration services,report to congress on the basic pilot program,june,at the program reduced unauthorized employment among participating employers by permitting employers to determine whether the information provided by employees on forms is consistent with information on ssa and dhs databases.however,because of problems with the relevant databases,has been alarmingly ineffective in verifying the employment authorization of aliens and naturalized citizens,and thus has effectively resulted in discrimination against these groups.see id.t he tentative nonconfirmation rate was unacceptably high for employees and was higher than desirable for employees.this created burdens for employees and employers and led to unintentional discrimination against persons.
as of the last evaluation of in,employees were still thirty times more likely to receive tentative nonconfirmations than employees born in the united states,see westat,findings of the web basic pilot evaluation findings september,at xxv,and united states citizens were seven times more likely to receive erroneous tentative nonconfirmations than aliens,see id.this study thus made clear that further improvements are needed before could be made mandatory.see,at xxi.accordingly,through various expansions of the program,congress has continually required that be strictly voluntary for the vast majority of employers.see,department of homeland security appropriations act,stat.consolidated security,disaster assistance,and continuing appropriations act,div.a,stat,basic pilot program extension and expansion act of,stat basic pilot extension act of,stat.
the voluntariness of the system protects employers as well as employees.has costs,including and training expenses.see findings,at xxvi edmondson,at has significant costs in the form of implementation and training expenses.given the problems with the system,these costs are not yet a reliable investment.moreover,continues to operate on a trial basis,and absent action by congress,its statutory authorization will terminate in.see department of homeland security appropriations act,stat.mandating now therefore requires employers to incur costs that may be entirely worthless in the.in all these ways,congress refusal to make mandatory is consistent with its objective of ensuring that irca imposes the minimum burden necessary to be effective.see cong.rec.daily ed,statement of bryant.
additionally,hazleton scheme increases the burden on interstate employers by failing to provide safe harbor for those who use the process.as the court explained in edmondson,b y making the system a uniform national requirement,congress limited the compliance burden on interstate corporations while facilitating uniform enforcement.at.a uniform system reduces costs for employers with multiple locations throughout the country by ensuring that the same human resources procedures can be used in all locations.hazleton scheme denies interstate employers who use the process the benefits of uniformity.interstate employers with locations in hazleton who wish to ensure safe harbor in all locations would either have to adhere to different regulations in different locations,or use in all locations.
in its defense,hazleton argues that the other courts that have considered the question of states and localities power to mandate have concluded that there is insufficient evidence that congress refusal to allow the federal government to make mandatory reflects an intent to deprive states and localities of the power to do so.in chicanos por la causa,for instance,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit concluded that an arizona law that made use of mandatory was not conflict.it explained that the fact that congress made participation in voluntary at the national level did not in and of itself indicate that congress intended to prevent states from making participation mandatory.see chicanos por la causa,at.similarly,in gray,the district court for the eastern district of missouri declined to interpret congress decision not to make mandatory as restricting a state or local government authority under the police powers.gray,wl,at.that court reasoned that a locality mandating of is consistent with the federal goal of greater enforcement.id.
these decisions,however,fail to afford proper weight to the purposes underlying congress decision to retain as a voluntary program.despite its advantages,also has significant problems,and accordingly mandating its use interferes with the balancing of interests embodied in irca.the conclusion that mandating is consistent with the goal of greater enforcement thus simply ignores that enforcement is not congress only concern.again,hazleton has placed a priority on deterring employment of unauthorized aliens,but failed to concern itself with the costs its ordinance imposes on employers and on aliens.
there is yet another way in which the iirao obstructs the congressional purposes underlying irca.the iirao coerces employers to verify the work authorization of independent contractors,even though congress purposely excluded independent contractors from irca verification requirements.although employers do face liability under irca for knowingly utilizing the services of independent contractors who are unauthorized aliens,they are not required to actually verify contractors work eligibility,as they must with employees.see a.thus,employers can utilize contractors services without incurring the expense of verification,or the anxiety of potential sanctions.the iirao,on the other hand,does not distinguish between employees and independent contractors,and thus effectively coerces businesses to verify their contractors authorization.see iirao.in so doing,the iirao fundamentally alters a business relationship with its contractors and undermines the careful balancing of objectives congress intended.
in drafting irca,congress explicitly declined to sanction employers based on the work authorization status of casual hires,those that do not involve the existence of an relationship.i,at.this was not an unreasoned choice,but part of the crafting of the statute to minimize the burden placed on employers.as the court explained in edmondson,e mployers are not required under federal law to verify the work eligibility of independent contractors because it would increase the burdens on business.at.businesses utilize independent contractors,in part,to reduce the costs and liabilities associated with procuring labor when an enduring and structured relationship is not needed.compelling businesses to concern themselves with the work authorization status of contractors alters this relationship,and also raises costs.
ironically,the iirao is equally problematic for purposes because it only coerces but does not directly require verification of independent contractors work authorization,while imposing sanctions on employers if their contractors are unauthorized.although earlier versions of the bills that became irca did not require employers to use an employment verification system,congress ultimately decided that a mandatory and uniformly used employment verification system must be a counterpart of employer sanctions.absent that requirement,congress concluded,employers would too often guess about their prospective hires work authorization.see.i,at t he bill does provide substantial protections against discrimination in the form of a uniform verification process for all new hires,at to be nondiscriminatory any employee eligibility system must apply equally to each member of the workforce.guesswork unavoidably yields discrimination in hiring,and that result could not be more at odds with congressional intent 
hazleton failure to balance its sanctions with protections is a final area in which the employment provisions of the iirao significantly conflict with irca.congress was clear that a mechanism to remedy any discrimination that occurs because of employer sanctions must be a part of employer sanctions legislation.i,at.hazleton contends that irca provision fully accomplishes the congressional goal of deterring unlawful discrimination,and that it is not compelled to duplicate federal efforts.hazleton misses the point.
while drafting irca,congress heard testimony that imposing employer sanctions would create economic incentives for employers to discriminate against workers who appeared to be of foreign origin.if hiring unauthorized aliens were penalized,but discriminating against authorized foreign workers were not,employers might rationally choose not to hire anyone who appeared foreign in an effort to avoid entirely the threat of sanctions.see,cong.rec.daily ed,statement of hart the employer sanctions in the legislation will undoubtedly act as an incentive for businesses to play it safe and refuse to hire individuals whose status may be in question.this would mean that b lacks,hispanics,and asians would encounter new difficulties in getting hired.consequently,congress decided that irca must allow judges to impose on employers who discriminate in hiring penalties of the exact same magnitude as imposed on employers who hire unauthorized aliens.compare e a i iii with g b iv i iii.
the iirao employment provisions upset this careful balance.by imposing additional sanctions on employers who hire unauthorized aliens,while not penalizing those who discriminate,hazleton has elected to place all of its weight on one side of the regulatory scale.this creates the exact situation that congress feared a system under which employers might quite rationally choose to err on the side of discriminating against job applicants they perceive to be foreign.this is inconsistent with irca and therefore can not be tolerated under the supremacy clause.
hazleton attempts to parry the thrust of this argument by again relying on the decisions in chicanos por la causa and gray.those courts rejected the argument that licensing laws that revoked the licenses of businesses who employed unauthorized aliens were likely to increase discrimination,and would contravene irca absent an component.
we believe those decisions undervalue the emphasis congress placed on preventing discrimination,and the care congress took to achieve that objective.for example,the courts in both chicanos por la causa and gray demanded proof that employer sanctions result in discrimination.that is puzzling because congress has already addressed that question.although congress could not have been certain that sanctions would lead to future discrimination when it enacted irca,it was sufficiently troubled by the likelihood to commit to preventative action.see.ii,at,reprinted in u.the house of representatives recognized the potential for this unfortunate cause and effect relationship between sanctions enforcement and resulting employment discrimination.notably,congress also required the comptroller general to report,three years after irca enactment,on whether employer sanctions had resulted in discrimination.the comptroller general concluded that employer sanctions had caused widespread discrimination.gov t accountability office,testimony on immigration reform employer sanctions and the question of discrimination.
congress stated repeatedly that countervailing protections must be a part of any employer sanctions legislation,see.ii,at i f there is to be sanctions enforcement and liability,there must be an equally strong and readily available remedy if resulting employment discrimination occurs.emphasis added,and we think this just as true when states and localities regulate in this area.to be consistent with federal law,states and localities that use regulatory enactments to sanction employers who have been found guilty of employing unauthorized aliens under irca must impose sanctions of equal severity on employers found guilty of discriminating.
hazleton attempts to shield its legislative efforts from based on the doctrine of concurrent enforcement,but this could not be less persuasive.as hazleton itself acknowledges,concurrent enforcement activity is authorized only where state enforcement activities do not impair federal regulatory interests.hazleton br.quoting gonzales city of peoria,cir,overruled on other grounds by,de la vina,cir emphasis added.hazleton claims that the iirao satisfies this standard because the employment provisions were drafted with meticulous care to match the terminology and scope of federal law.hazleton br.given our discussion thus far,we need not belabor here explaining why this assertion is wrong.simply put,hazleton has enacted a regulatory scheme that is designed to further the single objective of federal law that it deems unauthorized aliens do not work in the united states.it has chosen to disregard congress other lawful immigrants and others from employment discrimination,and minimizing the burden imposed on employers.regulatory cherry picking is not concurrent enforcement,and it is not constitutionally permitted.
notably,this is not the first time that we have confronted a local law that skews the federal government careful balancing of objectives in the regulation of alien employment.we addressed a similar situation over thirty years ago in rogers larson.there,the government of the virgin islands had enacted a law which called for the replacement of certain nonimmigrant alien workers with qualified citizens or lawful permanent resident workers,if and when such workers became available.nonimmigrant aliens brought suit arguing that the territorial law was by the ina,and in particular by federal regulations guaranteeing nonimmigrant aliens employment for definite periods of time.we agreed.
in striking down the virgin islands legislative effort as an obstacle to the congressional purposes underlying the ina,we made clear that the fact that the two statutory schemes shared purposes in common did not save the territorial law from.rather,the laws were directly at odds with each other because they str uck the balance between the goals differently.id.at.the virgin islands statute struck the balance more in the direction of protection of,and federal law struck it more in the direction of protection of employers and alien workers.id.because of the different emphasis the two statutory schemes place d on the purposes of job protection and an adequate labor force,the virgin islands provision was invalid under the supremacy clause.id.the same is just as true here.
it is,of course,not our job to sit in judgment of whether state and local frustration about federal immigration policy is warranted.we are,however,required to intervene when states and localities directly undermine the federal objectives embodied in statutes enacted by congress.the employment provisions of the iirao stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of irca objectives,hines,at,and thus are.
housing provisions 
our final inquiry addresses plaintiffs claim that the housing provisions of the iirao and the ro are.the district court agreed with plaintiffs,and so do we.
before delving into the substance of this analysis,however,we must first consider whether the presumption against applies to the housing provisions.the district court did not distinguish between the employment and housing provisions in addressing the presumption it summarily concluded that both operate in the field of immigration,and that because of the history of significant federal presence in that area,the presumption did not apply.lozano,d at.we have explained why that conclusion was erroneous as applied to the employment provisions,which under decanas,fall within the states historic police powers.the housing provisions,however,raise a very different issue.as the district court for the northern district of texas explained in farmers branch iii,l ocal regulation that conditions the ability to enter private contract for shelter on federal immigration status is of a fundamentally different nature than restrictions on employment.d,wl,at.
the parties characterize the housing provisions of the ro and the iirao in starkly different terms.hazleton maintains that the housing provisions regulate rental accommodations,and thus,like the employment provisions,fall within the state historic police powers.plaintiffs,on the other hand,argue that these provisions regulate who may live in hazleton based on immigration status,and that regulating which aliens are permitted to reside in the united states is a historically federal function far beyond the police powers of any state.
although we realize that a state certainly can,and presumably should,regulate rental accommodations to ensure the health and safety of its residents,and that such regulation may permissibly affect the rights of persons in the country unlawfully,see decanas,at,we can not bury our heads in the sand ignoring the reality of what these ordinances accomplish.through its housing provisions,hazleton attempts to regulate residence based solely on immigration status.deciding which aliens may live in the united states has always been the prerogative of the federal government.hazleton purposefully chose to enter this area of significant federal presence.locke,at.accordingly,we will not presume.
the rest of our analysis flows directly from our conclusion that hazleton housing provisions regulate which aliens may live there.under decanas,a state or locality may not regulate immigration,which the supreme court has defined as any attempt to determine who should or should not be admitted into the country,and the conditions under which a legal entrant may remain.decanas,at.such power is delegated by the constitution exclusively to the federal government,and even if congress had never acted in the field,states and localities would be precluded from doing so.see id.thus,over a century ago,the supreme court explained that t he doctrine is firmly established that the power to exclude or expel aliens is vested in the political departments of the federal government,to be regulated by treaty or by act of congress.yo united states.whether hazleton inadvertently stumbled into this exclusively federal domain,or decided to defiantly barge in,it is clear that it has attempted to usurp authority that the constitution has placed beyond the vicissitudes of local governments.
the housing provisions of the iirao and the ro are also field by the ina.as the supreme court explained in decanas,the central concern of the ina is with the terms and conditions of admission to the country and the subsequent treatment of aliens lawfully in the country.at.the comprehensiveness of the ina scheme for regulation of immigration and naturalization,plainly precludes state efforts,whether harmonious or conflicting,to regulate residence in this country based on immigration status.
we recognize,of course,that hazleton housing provisions neither control actual physical entry into the city,nor physically expel persons from it.nonetheless,i n essence,that is precisely what they attempt to do.bonito boats,at.it is difficult to conceive of a more effective method of ensuring that persons do not enter or remain in a locality than by precluding their ability to live in it.id.
at oral argument,hazleton posited that aliens lacking lawful status could still reside in the city through purchasing a home,or through staying with friends the response is as disingenuous as it is unrealistic.there is nothing on this record that suggests that the people whom the residential provisions are aimed at could avail themselves of such options.even if they were viable alternatives for some,however,many others still would be excluded,and that is sufficient for these provisions to be.
we also recognize that hazleton housing provisions regulate presence only within its city limits,not the entire country.this does not change the analysis.to be meaningful,the federal government exclusive control over residence in this country must extend to any political subdivision.again,it is not only hazleton ordinance that we must consider.if hazleton can regulate as it has here,then so could every other state or locality.see rowe,at.as the district court for the northern district of texas reasoned we can imagine the slippery slope if every local and state government enacted laws purporting to determine that certain persons could not stay in their bounds.if every city and state enacted and enforced such laws the federal government control over decisions relating to immigration would be effectively eviscerated.villas at parkside partners city of farmers branch farmers branch i,hrg.tr.at.indeed,the record strongly suggests that hazleton mayor intended these provisions to be at the forefront of exactly such an evisceration.see supra note.
the housing provisions of the iirao and the ro are also conflict by the ina.as the district court explained,these provisions attempt to effectively remove persons from hazleton based on a snapshot of their current immigration status,rather than based on a federal order of removal.this is fundamentally inconsistent with the ina.
hazleton goes to great lengths to defend its housing provisions as providing for an accurate assessment of tenants immigration status,and only denying housing to those whom the federal government confirms are here unlawfully.even assuming hazleton is correct,this argument does not advance hazleton cause rather,it highlights the fundamental misconception at the heart of these ordinances.through its housing provisions,hazleton attempts to remove persons from the community based on current immigration status.however,as justice blackmun explained in plyler the structure of the immigration statutes makes it impossible for the state to determine which aliens are entitled to residence,and which eventually will be deported.at blackmun,concurring.
under federal law,an unlawful immigration status does not lead instantly,or inevitably,to removal.under most circumstances,a federal removal hearing under section of the ina is required.absent certain limited exceptions,this proceeding is the sole and exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be admitted to the united states or,if the alien has been so admitted,removed from the united states.a.as we explained in detail above,knowing whether the government will decide to initiate proceedings against a particular alien is as impossible as trying to predict the outcome of such a proceeding once initiated.
the federal government has discretion in deciding whether and when to initiate removal proceedings.see juarez,at.as the district court found,the government purposefully exercises its discretion not to prosecute in certain instances,and thereby tacitly allows the presence of those whose technical status remains illegal.see lozano,d at.furthermore,once the government initiates these proceedings,whether they will result in removal is far from certain.a judge may award discretionary relief saving a removable alien from removal,or even adjusting that alien status to that of lawful permanent resident.see.thus,for these reasons,it is simply 
impossible for a state to determine which aliens the federal government will eventually deport,which the federal government will permit to stay,and which the federal government will ultimately naturalize.until an undocumented alien is ordered deported by the federal government,no state can be assured that the alien will not be found to have a federal permission to reside in the country,perhaps even as a citizen.indeed,even the immigration and naturalization service can not predict with certainty whether any individual alien has a right to reside in the country until deportation proceedings have run their course.
plyler,at powell,concurring.
stitched into the fabric of hazleton housing provisions,then,is either a lack of understanding or a refusal to recognize the complexities of federal immigration law.hazleton would effectively remove from its city an alien college student the federal government has purposefully declined to initiate removal proceedings against so too would hazleton remove an alien battered spouse,currently unlawfully present,but eligible for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident under the special protections congress has afforded to battered spouses and children.see u.b.in each of these instances,as in every single instance in which hazleton would deny residence to an alien based on immigration status rather than on a federal order of removal,hazleton would act directly in opposition to federal law.
hazleton attempts to avoid this result by again relying on the concept of concurrent enforcement to defend its housing provisions.according to hazleton,its housing provisions mirror the ina prohibition against harboring,which imposes criminal penalties on 
any person who knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to,entered,or remains in the united states in violation of law,conceals,harbors,or shields from detection,or attempts to conceal,harbor,or shield from detection,such alien in any place,including any building or any means of transportation.
a a iii.hazleton contends that since federal courts have consistently found that providing housing to aliens lacking lawful immigration status constitutes unlawful harboring,its housing provisions do no more than concurrently enforce federal law.hazleton is wrong.
as we have explained,hazleton housing provisions operate in a field which the federal government exclusively occupies.therefore,even if hazleton housing provisions did concurrently enforce federal law,this would not save them even harmonious regulation is here.however,hazleton is also plainly incorrect in claiming that its housing provisions mirror federal law.the federal prohibition against harboring has never been interpreted to apply so broadly as to encompass the typical relationship.
a a iii criminalizes harboring an alien,knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that the alien came to,or remains in,the united states in violation of law.the statute,however,does not define the term harboring,and the supreme court has yet to do so.as a result,the breadth of the term is currently in dispute among the circuit courts of appeals.some courts,our own included,have found that culpability requires some conduct that helps to conceal an alien from authorities.we,along with the court of appeals for the second circuit,define harboring as conduct tending to substantially facilitate an alien remaining in the united states illegally and to prevent government authorities from detecting the alien unlawful presence.united states ozcelik,cir internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added see also united states kim,cir harboring encompasses conduct tending substantially to facilitate an alien remaining in the united states illegally and to prevent government authorities from detecting his unlawful presence.emphasis added.thus,we have held that harboring requires some act of obstruction that reduces the likelihood the government will discover the alien presence.it is highly unlikely that a landlord renting of an apartment to an alien lacking lawful immigration status could ever,without more,satisfy this definition of harboring.renting an apartment in the normal course of business is not in and of itself conduct that prevents the government from detecting an alien presence.
it is true that other courts of appeals have held that a showing of concealment is unnecessary,and that conduct which merely substantially facilitates an alien remaining in the country illegally is sufficient to constitute harboring.see,united states tipton,cir internal alteration omitted.however,even under the more lenient tests of these jurisdictions,we are not aware of any case in which someone has been convicted of harboring merely because rented an apartment to someone knew or had reason to know was not legally in the united states.
notably,all the cases cited by hazleton for that proposition involve defendants who played a much more active role in helping an alien remain in the united states.see,tipton,at defendant employer who employed and housed six unauthorized alien employees,provided them with transportation and money to purchase necessities,and maintained counterfeit immigration papers for them guilty of harboring united states zheng,cir defendant employer who permitted ten to twenty unauthorized alien employees,who were overworked and underpaid,to live at his house in accommodations without paying rent guilty of harboring kim,at defendant employer who advised unauthorized alien employees to change names and acquire false documentation guilty of harboring united states sanchez,cir defendant employer who paid to rent an apartment for unauthorized alien employees,provided them with transportation to and from work,and offered to obtain immigration papers for them guilty of harboring.none of these cases involve anything verging on a simple relationship.rather,the fact that so many of these cases involve employers emphasizes that something much more is needed to turn renting a residential unit into harboring.
furthermore,regardless of the breadth of the term harboring in and of itself,there is no question that harboring is illegal under federal law only if a defendant knew or was in reckless disregard of the harbored alien immigration status.see a.hazleton argues that the housing provisions of the iirao similarly only prohibit renting to persons known to lack lawful immigration status.this isolated reading of the iirao is misleading.taken together,the iirao and the ro not only prohibit the knowing harboring of defined to include the rental of housing to certain aliens,but also make legal immigration status a qualification for occupancy of rental housing.although the typical landlord might never know of tenant immigration status,hazleton provisions collectively require that any provider of rental housing be put on notice about the immigration status of potential renters.see lozano,d at espinal testified that he understood the ordinances to require that he obtain information on immigration status from tenants that he normally would not seek.
although the federal government does not intend for aliens here unlawfully to be harbored,it has never evidenced an intent for them to go homeless.a f i explaining that an alien noticed to appear for a removal proceeding must immediately provide the attorney general with a written record of an address at which the alien may be contacted respecting the proceeding.common sense,of course,suggests that hazleton has absolutely no interest in reducing aliens without legal status to homelessness either.no municipality would benefit from forcing any group of residents legal or illegal onto its streets.rather,it appears plain that the purpose of these housing provisions is to ensure that aliens lacking legal immigration status reside somewhere other than hazleton.it is this power to effectively prohibit residency based on immigration status that is so clearly within the exclusive domain of the federal government.
in sum,we find the housing provisions of hazleton ordinances regulations of immigration,and both field and conflict by the ina.
vii.conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court order permanently enjoining hazleton enforcement of the iirao and the ro.

this ordinance is enacted by the council of the city of hazleton under the authority of the act of legislature,april,act,known as the home rule charter and optional plans law,and all other laws enforceable the state of pennsylvania.
hazleton refers to persons who are not lawfully present within the united states as illegal aliens.plaintiffs refer to them as undocumented immigrants.we recognize that there are significant criticisms of each term.see,beth lyon,when more security equals less workplace safety reconsidering laws that disadvantage unauthorized workers.lab.empl,scholarly and popular concerns about the phrase illegal alien abound,pointing out that the phrase is racially loaded,ambiguous,imprecise,and pejorative.martinez regents of the of,d,t he term illegal alien is less ambiguous than the term undocumented immigrant,granted,cal.federal immigration law defines an alien as any person not a citizen or national of the united states.a.immigrant is defined as every alien except an alien who is within certain specified classes of nonimmigrant aliens,and generally refers only to lawful permanent residents.a.congress has preferred the term alien to describe those persons who lack lawful immigration status,see,u.we will use the word alien rather than immigrant because alien is more precise,and precision is important to discussions in this area.when discussing issues of employment,we will use the official term unauthorized alien.however,when discussing issues of immigration status,we will use either aliens not lawfully present or aliens lacking lawful immigration status,rather than illegal aliens.
on july,hazleton enacted ordinance,the first version of the iirao.on august,the city enacted ordinance,the ro.on september,hazleton enacted ordinance,a revised version of the iirao,which replaced ordinance in its entirety.on december,hazleton enacted ordinance,which amended the iirao by adding an implementation and process section.finally,during trial,the city enacted ordinance,which again amended the iirao to provide that complaints based,in full or in part,on national origin,ethnicity,or race,would be considered invalid.the of these ordinances is attached as an appendix.
it is important to note that the parties hotly contest whether aliens in hazleton actually caused any of these purported problems and whether hazleton officials had any valid reason to think they did.the district court did not make any factual findings about the cause of any social or fiscal problems hazleton may be facing,and our discussion should not be interpreted as supporting either side of that debate.
the iirao defines business entity broadly to mean any person or group of persons performing or engaging in any activity,enterprise,profession,or occupation for gain,benefit,advantage,or livelihood,whether for profit or not for profit.iirao.the term encompasses but is not limited to individuals,partnerships,corporations,contractors,and subcontractors.iirao.it includes any business entity that possesses a business permit,any business entity that is exempt by law from obtaining such a business permit,and any business entity that is operating unlawfully without such a business permit.iirao.
c states the immigration and naturalization service shall respond to an inquiry by a federal,state,or local government agency,seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of any individual within the jurisdiction of the agency for any purpose authorized by law,by providing the requested verification or status information.
this three business day period is tolled if the business entity acquires further information about the worker and requests a secondary verification from the federal government of the worker authorization,or if the business entity tries to terminate the worker and that worker challenges the termination in pennsylvania state court.iirao.
city agencies and business that contract with the city for amounts greater than are also required to enroll in.iirao.
even an employee who is properly terminated for cause or without cause in the case of an employee at will has a cause of action under this provision.the ordinance uses lost wages as a measure of damages.iirao.
the iirao defines an illegal alien as an alien who is not lawfully present in the united states,according to the terms of united states code title,section et iirao.
this five business day period is tolled if the property owner acquires further information about the tenant and requests a secondary verification from the federal government of the tenant immigration status,or if the property owner tries to evict the tenant and that tenant challenges the eviction in pennsylvania state court.iirao.
eleven plaintiffs filed the operative complaint.the district court dismissed three of them for lack of standing,and that portion of the district court decision is not being appealed.of the eight plaintiffs the district court found to have standing,only six press their cases on appeal.
the district court dismissed the equal protection,fair housing act,privacy,and pennsylvania landlord and tenant act claims,and those portions of its order have also not been appealed.
we note that hazleton waiver of this issue likely speaks to the merits of a severability analysis as well,as severability often turns significantly on intent.if hazleton had truly intended each provision of the iirao and the ro to operate independently,and to stand or fall independently of the other provisions of this regulatory scheme,it surely would have pressed that point sometime during this litigation.it has not done so.
assuming the other requirements of associational standing are met,one member with standing is sufficient for an organization to have standing.see hunt,at a n association may have standing solely as the representative of its members the association must allege that its members,or any one of them,are suffering immediate or threatened injury as a result of the challenged action of the sort that would make out a justiciable case had the members themselves brought suit.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.
the employment provisions of the iirao regulate the behavior of all business entities,a term which as we noted above,is defined expansively and includes even those entities that do not have or need business licenses.at the same time,compliance with these provisions is primarily,although not entirely,coerced through regulating the provision of business licenses.lozano and espinal are plainly business entities under the iirao however,neither has testified as to whether he has a business agree with the court of appeals for the eighth circuit when faced with the same issue in gray city of valley park,cir,that this does not deprive them of standing.regardless of whether these plaintiffs have business licenses,the iirao applies to them as business entities,and they must,as citizens,comply and conform their conduct according to the ordinance directives.id.at see also id.at at the very least,as a business entity covered by the ordinance,plaintiffs may not knowingly recruit,hire for employment,or continue to employ,an unlawful worker to perform work within the city.and,when a valid complaint is lodged,plaintiffs would be required to provide identity information to the code enforcement office.internal citation omitted.
we note,however,that the ro explicitly exempts from its registration and license requirements those p roperties which consist of a double home,half of which is let for occupancy and half of which is as the owner residence.ro.at trial,lozano testified that he owns a home.he lives in one unit with his family,and rents out the other unit,which is subdivided into two separate apartments,to help him pay the mortgage.see.to our knowledge,the parties have not raised whether the double home exception applies to lozano,and the district court did not address the issue.if that exception does apply,lozano could not establish a sufficient injury to challenge the ro.see addiction specialists,twp.of hampton,cir explaining that because standing is a jurisdictional issue,it can not be waived,and the court must,when necessary,consider it sua sponte.however,even assuming that lozano is exempt from the ro,other plaintiffs would still have standing to challenge that ordinance,and we therefore would still have jurisdiction to review it.
hazleton does not extend this argument to john doe,which is wise since john doe was evicted by his landlord because of these ordinances.see.hazleton does challenge john doe standing,however,based on its contention that john doe is lawfully present in this country.we recognize that the record contains conflicting testimony as to john doe immigration status.on the one hand,john doe testified that his father,a united states citizen,submitted a petition to make john doe a legal resident,and that the united states government approved that petition.on the other hand,john doe testified that he is unsure of his immigration status and his work authorization,that he believes he is removable,and that he is not here legally.see.we therefore can not conclude that the district court findings as to the legitimacy of his fears were clearly erroneous.regardless of john doe precise legal status,we think that he has established standing.he has been evicted because of the ordinances,and his own understanding his ability to status is sufficiently uncertain that he is quite likely to suffer further injury if the ordinances are enforced.
as a general rule,we do not consider arguments arising out of unpublished decisions,and do so here solely for the purposes of putting to bed hazleton argument,which we find particularly troubling.
lozano,for example,testified that hate mail was sent to his home three separate times.one letter contained a clipping from a newspaper describing the alleged effects of illegal immigration as well as a picture of a warrior wearing a huge mexican hat.scrawled near this picture were the phrases,s ubhuman spic scum and i f it is brown,flush it down.lozano,d at alterations in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.this letter also contained a link to a website proclaiming itself the official home page of the national socialist movement,an organization dedicated to the preservation of our proud aryan heritage,and the creation of a national socialist society in america and around the world.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court noted that this sort of harassment extended even to people who were merely perceived as being connected to the lawsuit,even if this perception was not rooted in fact.amilcar arroyo,a united states citizen who publishes a newspaper,was publically harassed when he tried to cover a rally in support of the ordinances.based on a rumor that he was a plaintiff in this suit,rally participants gathered around him shouting,get out of the country and traitor.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.police escorted arroyo from the rally for his own protection.id.
congress has also ratified treaties pursuant to which persons may be admitted on humanitarian grounds even if they do not satisfy the statutory definition of refugee set forth in the ina.see united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
prior to,the immigration and naturalization service ins,which operated under the department of justice,administrated both immigration services and immigration enforcement.on march,congress abolished the ins.pursuant to the homeland security act of,stat,that agency functions were transferred to three separate agencies within the newly created department of homeland security citizenship and immigration services uscis,which performs immigration and naturalization services,immigration and customs enforcement ice,which enforces federal immigration and customs laws,and customs and border protection cbp,which monitors and secures the country borders.older documents may continue to refer to the administrative structure,and citations to them should be understood in that context.
as noted above,inadmissible aliens detained at the borders of the united states,or others deemed not to have been admitted to the country,may be subject to expedited removal.see.in addition,expedited removal procedures apply to certain aliens already within the country who have been convicted of crimes.see.
in zadvydas,the court addressed the cases of two aliens who had been ordered removed from the united states,but who,for various reasons,no other country would accept.the government sought to continue detaining them nonetheless.the court held that the due process clause imposed reasonableness limits on detention,and thus that the government could not continue the aliens detention indefinitely if there was no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.at.
provides in relevant part that with certain limited exceptions,it is an unfair employment practice for a person or other entity to discriminate against any individual other than an unauthorized alien,as defined in section h of this title with respect to the hiring,or recruitment or referral for a fee,of the individual for employment or the discharging of the individual from employment a because of such individual national origin,or b in the case of a protected individual because of such individual citizenship status a.any person by an unfair employment practice may file a charge respecting such practice or violation.b.
c provides in relevant part that t he president shall appoint,by and with the advice and consent of the senate,a special counsel for unfair employment practices.c.the special counsel shall be responsible for investigation of charges and issuance of complaints under this section and in respect of the prosecution of all such complaints before administrative law judges.c.
there are some differences between the two sections.the imposition of monetary sanctions under is mandatory,but discretionary under.compare e a with g b iv.also,criminal penalties are available for certain violations under,but not available under.see f.in contrast,provides for compensatory relief,such as backpay and other remedies,which is not available under.see g b iii and vii viii.
pursuant to an executive order by president george bush,certain federal government contractors are now also required to use.see exec.order.
in fact,hazleton mayor got the idea of enacting the iirao and the ro from simi
