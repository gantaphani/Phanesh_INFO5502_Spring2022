officer craig matthews brought suit alleging that the city of new york retaliated against him for speaking to his commanding officers about an arrest quota policy at his precinct of the new york city police department nypd.the united states district court for the southern district of new york paul engelmayer,judge granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,holding that matthews spoke as a public employee,not as a citizen,and that his speech was thus not protected by the first amendment.we conclude that because matthews comments on precinct policy did not fall within his official duties and because he elected a channel with a civilian analogue to pursue his complaint,he spoke as a citizen.accordingly,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
matthews speech about the quota system 
since,craig matthews,an nypd police officer,has been assigned to the precinct the precinct in the bronx.he alleges that starting in,unnamed supervisors in the precinct implemented a quota system mandating the number of arrests,summons,and that police officers must conduct.matthews also alleges that lieutenant mark sedran refined the quota system by creating a point system that awarded points to police officers for issuing what sedran considered good summonses and subtracted points for less desirable summonses.compl,joint app x.matthews alleges that officers were under pressure to comply with the quota system.

in january,matthews met with jon bloch,the precinct new commanding officer,and two other officers in captain bloch office.matthews told them about the quota system and stated that it was causing unjustified stops,arrests,and summonses because police officers felt forced to abandon their discretion in order to meet their numbers,and that it was having an adverse effect on the precinct relationship with the community.compl,joint app x.
ii.matthews complaint and the defendants motion to dismiss 
on february,matthews filed a complaint under alleging that the nypd retaliated against him in violation of the first amendment to the constitution and article i,of the new york state constitution because he spoke to the precinct leadership about the arrest quota policy.although not relevant to this appeal,which is limited to the narrow question of whether matthews spoke as a citizen or as a public employee,the alleged acts of retaliation consist of punitive assignments,denial of overtime and leave,separation from his partner,humiliating treatment by supervisors,and negative performance evaluations.
on march,the defendants moved to dismiss,arguing that matthews speech was made pursuant to his official employment duties and was thus unprotected.the district court barbara jones,judge granted the defendants motion to dismiss.see matthews city of new york,civ,wl s.on november,a panel of this court vacated the dismissal and remanded,holding that t he record in this case is not yet sufficiently developed to determine as a matter of law whether officer matthews spoke pursuant to his official duties when he voiced the complaints.matthews city of new york,fed.app x,cir.the panel stated that discovery was necessary as to the nature of the plaintiff job responsibilities,the nature of the speech,and the relationship between the two.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
on remand,after the case was reassigned to district judge paul engelmayer,the following evidence relevant to this appeal was developed in discovery.
iii.matthews employment duties 
matthews stated in an affidavit that the vast majority of his time as a police officer is spent 
going on radio runs,which are responses to calls in the precinct,in addition to requests,and requests that come through the station house telephone switchboard,patrolling the streets and vertical patrolling of local housing,filling out complaint reports and additional forms relating to criminal activity,lost property,and missing persons,including interviewing witnesses,responding to traffic accidents,transporting prisoners to and from the precinct house,courts,and hospitals,and doing community visits with local businesses and organizations.
joint app x.matthews duties are formally defined by the nypd patrol guide,which was created to serve as a guide for all members of the service,although it does not contain distinct instructions for every situation that may be encountered in the field.foreword,patrol guide,joint app x.section of the patrol guide,titled allegations of corruption and other misconduct against members of the service,states that 
all members of the service must be incorruptible.an honest member of the service will not tolerate members of the service who engage in corruption or other misconduct.all members of the service have an absolute duty to report any corruption or other misconduct,or allegation of corruption or other misconduct,of which they become aware.
joint app x.the patrol guide defines corruption and other misconduct as,c riminal activity or other misconduct of any kind including the use of excessive force or perjury that is committed by a member of the service whether on or off duty.id.it also outlines a procedure for officers to report misconduct to the internal affairs bureau and provides that the f ailure to report corruption,other misconduct,or allegations of such act is,in itself,an offense of serious misconduct and will be charged as such.id.at.
commissioner john beirne,deputy commissioner for labor relations for the nypd,testified at deposition that a quota system alone is not misconduct but that a quota system that results in an unjustified stop,an unjustified arrest,an unjustified summons,or an adverse employment action is misconduct that must be reported.matthews testified that the patrol guide does not obligate him to report the existence of a quota system and that he would only have a duty to report misconduct that violated the penal law.it is undisputed that matthews did not regularly meet with or report to captains bugge or bloch.commissioner beirne,captain bloch,and captain bugge testified that an officer has no duty to monitor the conduct of his or her supervisors.
iv.avenues for civilian complaints to the nypd 
patrol guide section states that one duty of a commanding officer in the nypd is to m aintain as much personal contact as possible with business,civic organizations and other groups or media with community influence and interests to keep abreast of community tensions and trends.joint app x.in this spirit,the precinct held monthly community council meetings in which the public was invited to raise concerns about policing practices.captain bloch testified that he routinely attended these meetings,missing fewer than four or five of the previous thirty.
in addition to the community council meetings,captain bugge testified that,one to three times per month,he met with members of the public,such as local politicians,church leaders,or members of civic associations,to discuss policing issues in the precinct.the minutes of one community council meeting reflect that captain bugge announced that he welcomes the community to call him and discuss problems.joint app x.captain bloch testified that in his experience,however,meetings with community members outside of the community council meetings happened rarely.joint app x.
v.the defendants motion for summary judgment 
on may,the defendants moved for summary judgment.on july,the district court granted the defendants motion.the district court held that matthews speech was made as an employee of the nypd,not as a citizen,and thus was not protected by the first amendment.
matthews now appeals.
