background 
facts underlying smith claims 
at the time of smith termination on october,he was years old and a registered member of the republican party.he worked as the superintendent of the city of allentown recreation bureau,a post to which he was appointed in by former mayor william heydt,who also is a republican.as superintendent,smith was responsible for overall management of the recreation bureau,including seven staff members and between and,seasonal employees.he prepared budgets,developed new recreation programs,ran the city organized sports programs,and assisted with the planning of sportsfest,an annual community festival of athletic events.as superintendent,he set green fees at the municipal golf course and administered the course annual marketing budget.he was also responsible,along with the heads of two other city departments,for managing the city swimming pools.
in november,democrat roy afflerbach succeeded heydt as mayor.smith continued to serve as superintendent of the recreation bureau throughout the afflerbach administration,weathering a funding crisis and preserving many of the city recreation programs.in early,afflerbach appointed appellee ed pawlowski as director of community and economic development.pawlowski thus became smith immediate supervisor in the city government.according to pawlowski,there were a number of problems with smith performance as superintendent.pawlowski said that smith neglected to create new recreational programs or to promote existing recreation offerings.smith acknowledges that pawlowski chastised him,and the other department heads who operated the swimming pools,for failing to perform necessary pool upkeep.
in late,pawlowski resigned in protest over certain policies implemented by the afflerbach administration.his successor,and hence smith new supervisor,was lauren giguere.she developed a performance plan that established a series of goals for the recreation bureau.the plan required smith to establish financial procedures,create a master plan for cooperation between the recreation bureau and the parks bureau,explore options for constructing new recreation centers,and implement new software programs to increase bureau efficiency.
in early,pawlowski announced his candidacy for mayor of allentown on the democratic ticket.the november general election pitted pawlowski as the democratic candidate against former mayor heydt on the republican ticket.smith supported heydt renewed bid for office and placed a campaign sign in his yard approximately three weeks before the election.pawlowski ultimately emerged victorious in the election.
sometime during the first half of,smith allegedly had a conversation with his friend james spang,a democrat who had worked on pawlowski campaign according to smith,spang stated that pawlowski viewed smith as a political enemy of sorts and believed that smith had improperly attempted to influence two members of the city recreation commission to support heydt bid for mayor.app.at.in contrast,spang testified that he approached smith to express concern that heydt had received preferential invitations to events at sportsfest,while pawlowski had not.spang recalled the conversation lasting approximately two minutes,during which he encouraged smith to refrain from politicizing events and recommended that future invitations be extended in a more neutral fashion.spang,who does not recall uttering the phrase political enemy,explained that he approached smith because he believed that smith had a future as a candidate for local office and that smith political prospects would be placed in jeopardy if he were perceived as using city events for partisan purposes.spang testified that he never informed pawlowski of his conversation with smith,and smith possesses no knowledge regarding why spang would have represented that pawlowski considered smith a political foe.
in may,pawlowski appointed francis dougherty,who until that time had worked in philadelphia,to replace giguere as director of community and economic development for allentown.dougherty conducted a review of smith file and determined that smith had failed to achieve any of the goals set forth in guigere performance plan.smith view is that he had made progress on the goals,but he concedes that he did not fulfill them within the time allotted under guigere plan dougherty discovered that during smith tenure,the number of rounds played at the municipal golf course had declined and control of the city halloween parade had been ceded to a private citizen who was running it with minimal oversight from the recreation bureau after reviewing smith performance dougherty concluded that smith did not have the skill sets to implement the city vision for its recreation programming.app.at.
dougherty recommended to pawlowski that smith be discharged.pawlowski reviewed dougherty recommendation and soon agreed with dougherty assessment.in addition to the problems identified by dougherty,pawlowski knew his office had received complaints that the golf course was poorly managed and that smith had not developed new golf programming to promote the course.dougherty testified that he met with pawlowski in late june to discuss smith employment status and that,at the close of that meeting,pawlowski instructed him to terminate smith employment.prior to formally terminating smith,pawlowski and dougherty consulted the city solicitor and assistant solicitor as well as sonya stephens,a representative from the city human resources department hr.all three individuals advised against the termination.pawlowski and dougherty nevertheless decided to proceed with the firing.
during a meeting with smith on july,dougherty informed him that he lacked the skills necessary to perform his employment duties effectively and that he was being given the option to resign or retire.according to smith,dougherty observed that smith birthday and his employment anniversary,which occurred respectively on august and october,were approaching and that pawlowski wanted to receive smith resignation by that birthday but no later than the anniversary date.
following that conversation,smith prepared a letter describing his accomplishments as superintendent of the recreation bureau,stating that he was not a political enemy of pawlowski,and requesting that pawlowski reconsider his termination.pawlowski reviewed the letter but declined to reconsider.smith tendered his resignation,effective october.the city subsequently hired carl bruno,who at the time was years of age,to replace smith.bruno served as superintendent of the recreation bureau for six months,after which he was replaced by kevin easterling,then years of age.
hr representative stephens testified that she was never formally apprised of smith termination and that she discovered it through happenstance,though she could not recall precisely how she learned of it.she further explained that,in her opinion,the firing was unwarranted and that conducting a termination meeting without the involvement of an hr representative was unusual.
procedural history 
on october,smith commenced the present lawsuit.smith complained that,when terminating his employment,pawlowski and the city of allentown discriminated against him on the basis of his age,in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea,and on the basis of his political affiliation,in violation of his first amendment rights.smith claimed that dougherty reference to his birthday during the termination meeting revealed animus,and he contended that stephens characterization of his discharge as unusual and unwarranted supported his claim.he further asserted that his having a campaign sign in his yard during the november election together with spang political enemy comment provided evidence that he was fired due to his affiliation with the republican party.mayor pawlowski and the city responded that smith was terminated not because of his age or political affiliation but because he lacked the skills to lead the recreation bureau effectively.
with respect to the age discrimination claim,the district court found that smith failed to proffer evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that defendants proffered rationale for terminating him was a pretext for age discrimination.addressing the political affiliation claim,the court found that smith testimony regarding spang political enemy comment constituted inadmissible hearsay that could not be considered on summary judgment.because smith could not identify an alternate source of pawlowski alleged political enmity toward him,the court concluded that smith lacked admissible evidence that pawlowski considered smith a political adversary.it therefore entered summary judgment for pawlowski and the city on all claims.this timely appeal followed.

age discrimination 
the district court disposed of smith age discrimination claim under the framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d,which we have applied to adea claims.see keller orix credit alliance,cir describing the prima facie showing that a plaintiff must make under mcdonnell douglas,as applied to an adea claim.under mcdonnell douglas,the plaintiff bears the burden of proof and the initial burden of production,having to demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination by showing first,that the plaintiff is forty years of age or older second,that the defendant took an adverse employment action against the plaintiff third,that the plaintiff was qualified for the position in question and fourth,that the plaintiff was ultimately replaced by another employee who was sufficiently younger to support an inference of discriminatory animus.potence hazleton area sch,cir.once the plaintiff satisfies these elements,the burden of production shifts to the employer to identify a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action.keller,at.if the employer does so,the burden of production returns to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the employer proffered rationale was a pretext for age discrimination.starceski westinghouse,cir.at all times,however,the burden of persuasion rests with the plaintiff.id.
before the district court in this matter,the parties stipulated that smith possessed sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case and that smith allegedly substandard job performance provided appellees with a legitimate,nondiscriminatory rationale for his termination.thus,the district court addressed only whether smith had adduced evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that appellees relied upon his job performance as a pretext for age discrimination.smith predicated his allegations of age discrimination upon several things first,dougherty reference to smith birthday and anniversary date during the meeting at which they discussed smith termination second,the recommendations of stephens,the city solicitor,and the assistant solicitor that smith not be discharged and,third,the city progressive discipline policy,which appellees allegedly failed to utilize prior to discharging him.he also argued that dougherty,as a recent political appointee from outside the allentown area,lacked sufficient knowledge about smith job performance to reach an informed decision about whether to recommend termination.the court concluded that such evidence did not cast doubt upon the reasons that appellees proffered for smith discharge.the court therefore granted summary judgment to appellees on smith adea claim.
after the district court rendered its ruling,the supreme court decided gross fbl financial services,d,which considered whether the framework established by price waterhouse hopkins,d,is available to plaintiffs in age discrimination cases.gross.at.price waterhouse,decided under title vii of the civil rights act of,determined that,if the defendant initiated an allegedly adverse employment action as the result of both permissible and impermissible motives,the burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that it would have taken the adverse action notwithstanding the improper motive.at.watson se.trans,cir.this framework has become known as the doctrine.gross refused to apply price waterhouse to adea claims for two reasons.first,the court found that shifting the burden of persuasion to an age discrimination defendant is improper because the plain language of the adea requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendant took the adverse employment action because of the plaintiff age.gross.at quoting a.the court construed this language as requiring that the plaintiff prove causation from the outset of an adea case.id.at.more court expressed ambivalence about the utility of in age discrimination claims.the court noted that it had never definitively applied mcdonnell douglas to adea claims,gross.at,and suggested that,at least of the price waterhouse variety,has been difficult to apply in practice and that its cumbersome nature has eliminated any perceivable benefit to extending its framework to adea claims.id.at.
appellees argue that gross renders mcdonnell douglas inapplicable to adea cases and that we should dispose of the instant appeal solely by inquiring whether smith would have retained his job but for the alleged age discrimination.however,we may not depart from our prior decisions applying mcdonnell douglas to age discrimination cases unless those decisions are irreconcilable with gross.see mennen atl.mut.ins,cir noting that a panel of the court may not overrule the decisions of a prior panel unless the earlier disposition is in conflict with supreme court precedent.while we recognize that gross expressed significant doubt about any under the adea,we conclude that the causation standard required by gross does not conflict with our continued application of the mcdonnell douglas paradigm in age discrimination cases.
gross stands for the proposition that it is improper to shift the burden of persuasion to the defendant in an age discrimination case.mcdonnell douglas,however,imposes no shift in that particular burden.mcdonnell douglas provides that,once the employee establishes a prima facie case,the burden of production,of going forward shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employer adverse employment decision.mcdonnell douglas,at.if the employer makes that showing,the burden of production shifts once again to the employee to establish that the employer proffered justification for the adverse action is pretextual.dep t of comm.affairs burdine,d.throughout this exercise,the burden of persuasion,including the burden of proving but for causation or causation in fact,remains on the employee.starceski,at cir citing burdine,at.hence,gross,which prohibits shifting the burden of persuasion to an adea defendant,does not forbid our adherence to precedent applying mcdonnell douglas to age discrimination claims.decisions of our sister circuits are in accord.see,leibowitz cornell,wl,at cir,applying mcdonnell douglas while recognizing that gross requires the plaintiff to prove that age was the cause of the defendant adverse employment action geiger tower,cir holding that,following gross,the mcdonnell douglas framework can still be used to analyze adea claims based on circumstantial evidence.we have therefore evaluated smith age discrimination claim pursuant to mcdonnell douglas to see whether he produced sufficient evidence to establish that appellees proffered rationale for terminating him was a pretext for discrimination.
we conclude that smith has failed to carry that burden.he
