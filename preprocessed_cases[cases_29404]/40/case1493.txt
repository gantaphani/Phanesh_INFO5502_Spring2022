a corporate taxpayer paid million to a controlled subsidiary in exchange for shares of the subsidiary stock and the subsidiary assumption of a million contingent liability of the taxpayer.the taxpayer then sold the shares for million,claimed a million capital loss on its federal income tax return,and sought a refund based on that loss.the internal revenue service declined to pay because it concluded that the capital loss stemmed from an illegal tax shelter.after the taxpayer sued,the district court denied the irs summary judgment motion and granted the taxpayer summary judgment motion.the irs appeals.we conclude that neither the irs nor the taxpayer is entitled to summary judgment under the controlling tax statutes.under the sham transaction doctrine,however,the validity of the claimed loss turns on unresolved issues of material fact.accordingly,we affirm the denial of the irs motion,reverse the grant of the taxpayer motion,and remand for further proceedings.
the black decker corporation bdc,its subsidiary black decker bdi,and their direct and indirect subsidiaries constitute a major manufacturer of power tools and home improvement products.the subsidiaries involved are emhart industries,price pfister,and kwikset,all of which are domestic corporations controlled by bdc.bdc is also owner of black decker canada,the canadian subsidiary,which does not file a tax return in the united states.we will refer to bdc and its domestic direct and indirect subsidiaries as,collectively,taxpayer.taxpayer provides medical and dental insurance benefits to its current and retired employees,who number in the thousands.the aggregated future health benefits claims constitute a contingent liability because their precise cost is not known in the present.thus,taxpayer can estimate but can not predict with certainty how many of its employees or retirees will be diagnosed with particular illnesses in future years.
in taxpayer realized nearly million in capital gains income from the sale of three businesses.taxpayer sought to offset that income against a large loss to prevent the imposition of a substantial federal income tax obligation.to this end taxpayer executed a transaction that gave rise to what it intended to be a significant capital loss.the deloitte touche accounting firm had designed the transaction and advised some corporate clients,including taxpayer,on its implementation as a tax strategy.the transaction involved a subsidiary called black decker healthcare management bdhmi.taxpayer owned all of bdhmi common stock.bdhmi preferred shareholders included an affiliate of william mercer,taxpayer benefits consultant and a subsidiary of marsh mclennan companies,and taxpayer canadian subsidiary.the participation of outside investors permitted bdhmi to file a federal income tax return separate from taxpayer.
the transaction consisted of two phases.phase one was an exchange on november,between taxpayer and its canadian subsidiary on the one hand and bdhmi on the other.taxpayer and the canadian subsidiary paid bdhmi approximately million in cash with funds taxpayer had borrowed from its banks for days.in return bdhmi gave taxpayer and the canadian subsidiary shares of bdhmi series c preferred stock and assumed liability for the future health benefits claims against taxpayer and the canadian subsidiary from to,which had an estimated net present value of million.according to the exchange agreement the companies executed,bdhmi assumption of liability did not constitute either a legal defeasance of the benefits liabilities by taxpayer or a novation and consequently,taxpayer continue d to be primarily liable for the payment and performance of the benefits liabilities.thus,taxpayer remained liable on the underlying obligations transferred to bdhmi.
the companies executed phase two on december.taxpayer and the canadian subsidiary sold the bdhmi shares at a price of million to an unrelated trust benefitting a former bdc executive.also that day,bdhmi promised to lend bdi approximately million,most of which was to be repaid in monthly installments according to the terms of three lending agreements.bdi installment payments on the loans were designed to provide bdhmi with sufficient funds to pay the benefits liabilities as they came due.although bdhmi continued to hold the benefits liabilities,taxpayer reported all of the income from the businesses and employees that gave rise to those liabilities.
as one of bdhmi outside investors put it,the rationale behind the establishment of the subsidiary bdhmi is that a loss equal to the reserve for the liabilities can be recognized upfront for tax purposes and the special purpose vehicle,bdhmi may be able to deduct the amount of the claims a second time as they are actually incurred.formally,the investors in bdhmi stood to earn a positive return on their investment in the event that taxpayer actual health care liabilities fell short of the expected cost of those liabilities,so that taxpayer repayment on the loan would exceed bdhmi payments on the medical claims,creating net income for bdhmi.but as a practical matter taxpayer expected bdhmi to generate net operating losses because the health expenses were likely to consistently exceed bdhmi interest income from the loan to taxpayer.or,in the words of taxpayer accountants,bdhmi will generate net operating losses since the interest income on the note receivable is not likely to exceed annual claims paid which are recognized for tax purposes when paid.
in its tax return taxpayer characterized phase one as the purchase of the bdhmi shares for million and phase two as the sale of those shares for million,generating a million capital loss.taxpayer claimed that its basis in the bdhmi stock was equal to the cash payment without reduction by the benefits liabilities bdhmi assumed in phase one.the large capital loss offset the capital gains from taxpayer divestitures earlier in the year.further,the large loss had both retrospective and prospective effects under the internal revenue code of,as amended,irc,allowing taxpayer to file for refunds on its returns for the through tax years.the refunds sought totaled approximately million.
because the irs did not pay the refunds for more than six months,taxpayer commenced a civil action in the district court for the district of maryland.a.the irs filed a counterclaim for tax,interest,and penalties of approximately million.the irs construed the tax laws as requiring taxpayer to state its basis in the shares sold as million,not million.taxpayer took the opposite view.moving for summary judgment,the irs argued that under irc c a taxpayer,the transferor,had to reduce its stock basis by the amount of the contingent liability assumed by bdhmi,the transferee.the district court denied the motion.taxpayer then moved for summary judgment,arguing that the transfer of the benefits liabilities was not a sham transaction that could be disregarded for tax purposes.the district court granted the motion,black decker united states,d.the district court stated that because bdhmi was constituted for a valid business purpose,bdhmi and all of its transactions were objectively reasonable and thus could not be disregarded for tax purposes.id.at.this appeal by the irs followed.
the irs first contends that it was entitled to summary judgment because,on the undisputed facts,the statutes governing the transaction required the basis reduction.preliminarily,we note that if taxpayer were to engage in the contingent liability transfer today,it would be required to reduce its basis by the amount of the transferred liabilities under irc h,which congress enacted as part of the community renewal tax relief act of,a,stat.that statute does not control here because it does not apply retroactively.in addition,in the irs issued notice on contingent liability tax shelters,which put corporations on notice that the irs would challenge transactions of the type at issue here.these legal and enforcement policy developments took place after taxpayer engaged in the contingent liability transaction.consequently,the question before us is whether the law at the time taxpayer executed this transaction required taxpayer to reduce its basis in the stock by the amount of the benefits liabilities transferred.in answering this question,we first briefly survey the pertinent statutes.then we turn to the parties specific statutory arguments on whether summary judgment should have been granted in the irs favor.
on appeal the parties agree that the transaction is to be analyzed under irc.section a provides that no gain or loss shall be is,the transaction is property here,the cash from taxpayer is transferred to a corporation bdhmi by one or more persons here,members of a consolidated group,taxpayer solely in exchange for voting stock in bdhmi,and immediately after the exchange the transferor is in control of the transferee.see a.taxpayer did not,however,transfer property to bdhmi solely in exchange for bdhmi stock because bdhmi also assumed the contingent liability.so the transfer does not fit within the exact terms of a.
taxpayer would nevertheless continue to enjoy the benefit of a if taxpayer could successfully invoke a.under a transactions are treated as a transactions if they would satisfy a were it not for the fact that the transferee,in consideration for the transferor property,not only gave its stock but also assumed the transferor liability.in such cases,a prevents the transferee assumption of liability from being treated as taxable money or property received by the transferor.this benefit is not available,however,when the exceptions of b and c apply.see a.only the b exception is in dispute here.infra part.
separate from the concept of gain or loss recognition is the concept of basis computation.the income tax consequences of selling property hinge on the taxpayer basis in that property.except as otherwise provided,the basis of property shall be the cost of such property.usually,basis is the original cost of property used in computing capital gains or losses for income tax purposes.lessinger comm r,cir quoting webster third new international dictionary.in general,when a taxpayer sells an asset for more than its basis,he records a capital gain when he sells the asset for less than its basis,he records a capital loss.in the transaction at issue here,taxpayer basis in the bdhmi stock is determined under.see h.under a a transferor basis in the stock received from the transferee is the same as the basis of the property the transferor surrendered,reduced by the amount of any money received.a.section d further provides that,in analysis,an assumption of liability by the transferee shall be treated as money received by the transferor.a transferor reduces its basis in the stock received from the transferee by the amount of any liability the transferee assumed in exchange.but the statute also provides that d does not apply if the liability assumed is one that would be excluded under c.d.section c,in turn,excludes liability the payment of which would give rise to a deduction.c a.
to prevail on summary judgment the irs must demonstrate that as a matter of law taxpayer was not entitled to the c exception.this demonstration turns on statutory meaning.it is well established that when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.lamie united states trustee,d punctuation omitted see coleman cmty.trust bank in re coleman,cir.when the language of the statute is unclear,we may consult its legislative history as a guide to congressional intent.yi fed.bureau of prisons,cir.the fact that a tax statute is at issue here does not render inapplicable these general principles of statutory interpretation.
the benefits liabilities taxpayer transferred to bdhmi fall within the plain terms of the c exception if,in the event that the claims are paid,a person would be able to deduct the amounts paid from that person taxable income.the statute does not specify,however,whether the person taking the deduction would be the liability transferee bdhmi or the transferor taxpayer.because the statute does not clearly identify the person who would take the hypothetical deduction the statute envisions,it is appropriate to examine the legislative history so far as is necessary to identify that person.
section c was first enacted in and rewritten into its present form two years later by the next congress.the senate report that presaged the revision explained 
in general,liabilities the payment of which would give rise to a deduction include trade accounts payable and other liabilities,interest and taxes which relate to the transferred trade or business.however,such liabilities may be excluded under this provision only to the extent payment thereof by the transferor would have given rise to a deduction.
at,reprinted in.the second sentence quoted resolves the uncertainty in c would give rise to a deduction phrase by clarifying that congress had in mind the deductibility by the transferor.a liability falls within the c exception so long as,if the transfer had not taken place and the transferor had paid the liability,the transferor could have taken a deduction.to see why this condition is satisfied here,let us suppose that the health care claims had remained with taxpayer.in that case,when taxpayer incurred medical expenses as its employees and retirees received health care,taxpayer could have deducted those expenses from income.
the irs presses two arguments for why taxpayer can not claim the c exception.the first argument relies on legislative history.the irs focuses on sentences such as the first of the two from the senate report quoted.it contends that congress crafted the exception to protect a parent corporation from a tax double whammy when transferring both assets and associated liabilities to a subsidiary in exchange for stock.from this perspective,congress wanted to prevent such parent corporations from being twice penalized by deprivation of the right to deduct the transferred liabilities as they accrued and mandatory reduction of the stock basis by the amount of the liabilities transferred.since taxpayer only transferred the health claims but not the assets generating those claims,the irs argues that congress did not intend for taxpayer to benefit from c.further,the irs reads the quoted phrase would have given rise to a deduction,at,to mean a deduction unavailable to the transferor once the liability has been transferred.
the legislative history argument does not persuade us.the prototypical transaction congress had in mind in drafting c may well have been one in which a corporation exchanged liabilities as part of a transfer of an entire trade or business to a controlled subsidiary,but nothing in the section plain language embraces such a limitation.as a result we find no ambiguity in the statute that requires us to parse the congressional record and discern what type of business transactions congress originally envisioned in enacting the section.the senate report use of the phrase would have given rise also does not go as far as the irs would have us take it.on the contrary,we agree with one commentator observation that this language does not imply that congress silently contemplated a case in which liabilities are transferred but the deduction is retained by the transferor and then concluded that c should not apply.ethan yale,reexamining black decker contingent liability tax shelter,tax notes,july.
the irs second argument is based on sound administration of the tax laws,because the taxpayer should not be allowed to take the functional equivalent of a double deduction.appellant br.at.although taxpayer has not claimed the employee health expenses as a deduction bdhmi,not a party to this suit,claims them instead,the irs argues that taxpayer has the legal right to seek these deductions as health care costs accrue.in the irs view,the million loss that taxpayer reported effectively accelerates deductions for uncertain future health care costs through the year.such acceleration would contravene the prohibition against claiming a deduction in a given tax year for an estimate of liabilities that have not become fixed by the end of that year.here,receipt of medical care and filing of proper claims forms would fix the annual health care liability.united states dynamics,d.
again,we are not convinced that the language of c is so unclear as to permit us to rely on this policy argument and adopt the irs reading.in addition,because bdhmi files a tax return separate from taxpayer and has been taking the deductions for the health care expenses as the expenses are incurred,the double deduction argument would only work if we were to treat bdhmi and taxpayer as a single entity.we see no justification on the present record for disregarding the distinct corporate taxpayer identities of bdhmi and taxpayer.rather,we agree with taxpayer bdhmi pays the claims bdhmi takes the taxpayer.appellee br.at.
we conclude that the contingent liability taxpayer transferred to bdhmi falls within the c exception for liability the payment of which would give rise to a deduction.therefore,under d exception to the general rule of d,the liability need not be treated as money received by taxpayer for basis reduction purposes.for this reason the district court denial of the irs summary judgment motion was correct.
the irs next advances two arguments for why the district court erred in granting summary judgment in taxpayer favor.the first argument is based on the irc and the second on the sham transaction doctrine.
section b of the irc is an rule.it provides that if a taxpayer principal purpose in transferring liability was to avoid federal income tax on the exchange,or was otherwise not a bona fide business purpose,then the assumption of liability shall,for analysis,be considered money received by the taxpayer on the exchange.b.in this refund suit the burden is on the taxpayer to prove that the assumption of liability is not to be treated as money received by the taxpayer.b.thus,if b applied,taxpayer would be required to prove by the clear preponderance of the evidence that it had a bona fide business purpose for transferring the benefits liabilities to bdhmi.id.
the irs argues that taxpayer business purpose was a disputed fact requiring trial.next the irs contends that this issue is material because if taxpayer could not meet this burden at trial,then taxpayer would be obligated to treat the benefits liabilities assumed by bdhmi as money taxpayer received for purposes.the purposes of,in the irs view,include the basis computation rules of.in particular,the irs endeavors to connect the rule of b to the rule of.the irs would have us travel along one of two routes between these sections.
the first route is linguistic.the irs concentrates on the phrase money received,which appears in both b and in a.from the irs perspective,if taxpayer lacked a bona fide business purpose in the exchange,then bdhmi assumption of liability would be money received by taxpayer under b and also under a a ii,so that taxpayer basis in the bdhmi shares would be decreased by the amount of the liability bdhmi assumed.see a the basis of the property permitted to be received without the recognition of gain or loss shall be the same as that of the property exchanged decreased by the amount of any money received by the taxpayer.this argument is plausible but ultimately unavailing.it can not overcome the absence of any reference to on the face of b.rather,b refers as pertinent here only to the purposes of,which are the purposes of gain or loss recognition,as indicated by the opening words of a no gain or loss shall be recognized.those purposes are distinct from the purposes of,which concerns the computation of basis.section h certainly refers to,but this reference has no substantive content rather,it simply guides the reader of to the basis computation rule for exchanges that qualify for treatment.
the treasury regulation interpreting also undercuts the irs argument.the regulation explains that when a taxpayer lacks a bona fide business purpose in transferring liabilities through a exchange,the total amount of liabilities assumed shall,for the purpose of determining the amount of gain to be recognized upon the exchange in which the liabilities are assumed or acquired,be treated as money received by the taxpayer upon the exchange.reg.c emphasis added.the emphasized language clarifies that the focus of b analysis is gain recognition only.the regulation complete silence on basis assessment indicates that b is not concerned with such assessment.
by declining to endorse the irs view that money received means the same thing in the two different sections,we adhere to the teaching that a word is not a crystal,transparent and unchanged,it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.towne eisner.holmes.only by masking the conceptual difference between gain or loss recognition and basis computation could we treat the phrase money received as having a single meaning,irrespective of the circumstances in which it is used.the irs has not provided compelling reasons to do that.
the second route the irs identifies between b and is structural.here,the irs argues that if taxpayer could not meet b business purpose test,taxpayer could not use d to invoke c exclusion of liabilities.see supra part.that is because in the irs view,to be deductible under c a liability must fall within c,but c does not apply to any liability that falls within b.see c c shall not apply to any exchange to which subsection b of this section applies.
the irs argument falters in taking this last step.we read the statute to mean that as a general matter liability need not exceed falling within c in order to qualify for the d exception.again,d provides that the ordinary basis reduction rule of d,under which assumed liabilities are treated as money received by the transferor,does not apply to the amount of any liability excluded under section c.d.section c exclusion,as relevant here,covers a liability the payment of which would give rise to a deduction.
supra part.in referring to c,d does not by implication refer to c or.if congress intended such a broader reference,it could have built one into d by,for example,providing that d does not apply to the amount of any liability excluded under c.but that is not what the statute says.
the central difficulty with the irs reasoning is that it would limit liabilities eligible for the d exclusion to those that exceed basis under c,even in transactions that have a perfectly legitimate business purpose and thus do not transgress the b provision.under c if the amount of the liability transferred in a exchange is greater than the basis of the property transferred,then,in general,the recognizes a capital gain on the amount by which the liability exceeds the basis of the transferred property.estate of kanter comm r,cir,rev on other grounds sub nom ballard comm r,d.while c is concerned with assumed liabilities that exceed the basis in the property transferred,d has no such concern its only concern is the liabilities that would give rise to a deduction as described in c.we agree with the irs that under c,when a transaction lacks a bona fide business purpose under b,c is not applied.but accepting this much of the argument does not compel the conclusion that,when b applies,it also knocks out the c exception for basis computation purposes under d.or,as the irs put it in a concededly advisory memorandum to its field agents,even if a taxpayer has abused the rules in violation of b,which does not inquire into taxpayer intent,is not the means of correcting that.field service advice,at.
taxpayer points to a published revenue ruling that supports this analysis.the ruling views d as providing that section d does not apply to the amount of any liabilities defined in section c.rul,emphasis added.there is no language in the ruling that ties d either to c command regarding liabilities that exceed basis or to c displacement of c altogether when b applies.of course,the revenue ruling does not control our analysis for at least two reasons.first,while such rulings constitute precedents to be used in the disposition of other cases,comm r,cir quoting proc,the precise degree of deference owed to these in the face of the irs decision
