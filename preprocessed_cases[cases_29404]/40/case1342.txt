in november,sadisco purchased a acre parcel of land located in the county,with the intention of operating a salvage automobile wholesaling business on such parcel,which use is a permitted use within the industrial zones in which the parcel is located the property is bisected by foxley road,a dedicated public.the majority of foxley road is not paved.
of relevance to the issues on appeal,the property directly abuts a portion of the southeastern fence line of andrews air force base.also of relevance to the issues on appeal is the fact that andrews air force base is a designated superfund site.a superfund site is a site which the united states environmental protection agency has added to its superfund list,also known as the national priorities list,pursuant to its authority under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla,to.united states general electric,cir.superfund sites are those which require priority remedial attention because of the presence,or suspected presence,of a dangerous accumulation of hazardous wastes.united states cannons eng g,cir.
the real estate purchase contract pursuant to which sadisco purchased the property reflects sadisco knowledge of the property environmental condition in relation to andrews air force base.specifically,under the bolded and underlined heading environmental,such contract provided,in relevant part 
purchaser acknowledges that the property is located adjacent to andrews air force base,an active department of defense facility which was listed on the national priorities list in,that contaminants from andrews air force base have migrated beneath the which provides access to the property,and that contaminants from andrews air force base may affect the property now or in the future.purchaser accepts the property and shall have no recourse against seller with respect to the environmental condition of the property under any theory of liability.
on december,sadisco applied to the county for a use and occupancy permit in order to operate a salvage automobile wholesaling business on the property.approximately three months later,sadisco applied for a permit in order to temporarily house a construction trailer on the property 
the record is undisputed that on june,the county issued sadisco a permit to house a construction trailer on the property.however,the parties hotly contest whether the county actually issued sadisco a use and occupancy permit in response to its december application for one.nonetheless,the record is undisputed that by the end of october,the county had legitimately revoked any and all outstanding permits that it had issued to sadisco with respect to the property based upon sadisco violation of numerous county code provisions.for example,on october,the county cited sadisco for performing grading work on approximately twenty acres of the property without obtaining the required grading permit.for a second example,on october,the county cited sadisco for impermissibly operating its salvage automobile wholesaling business out of the construction trailer.
undaunted,sadisco continued to operate its salvage automobile wholesaling business on the property and continued to perform grading work without applying for any of the required permits.consequently,in may,the county filed two petitions in maryland state court for injunctive relief,one based upon sadisco grading permit violations and the other based upon sadisco zoning code violations.
on september,sadisco and the county entered into two consent orders,one for each petition for injunctive relief.the consent order pertaining to sadisco illegal grading activities the grading consent order provided that within sixty days sadisco would,inter alia,o btain the required grading permit and approved erosion and sediment control plan.the consent order pertaining to sadisco zoning violations the zoning consent order provided that within ninety days sadisco would vacate the premises until a valid use and occupancy permit is obtained cease use of the premises until a valid use and occupancy permit is obtained and obtain a building permit for the existing trailers or remove them from the premises.the zoning consent order further provided that if sadisco did not take these corrective actions within ninety days,the county 
shall have the authority to take all action necessary to enter onto the property to execute this order,and to remove the occupants and close down the operation of the on the premises by posting and securing the p roperty,and permit no one to enter onto the p roperty for the purpose of conducting business until a valid use and occupancy permit is obtained and the costs of the suit are paid 
on appeal,sadisco makes much of the fact that the day before it signed the consent orders,its attorney lawrence taub sent a letter to associate county attorney anne magner,stating 
on behalf of my client,i have discussed the timing issue with both you and county department of environmental resource staff inspectors fred holtzberger and jeffrey dehan,and i have been told by all that even though the consent order s are limited to these specific timeframes,if the required permits and other actions have not been fully accomplished by the end of those time periods,but the county staff sees that my client has been diligently pursuing these applications and that the failure to obtain these permits is not as a result of any inaction by my client,the county staff will continue to work with my client,will not take actions to cause it to cease operations upon the p roperty,and will allow my client to continue to operate upon its property while continuing to diligently pursue issuance of the required permits.my client execution of these consent orders is thus premised upon its understanding and acceptance of this representation by you and the county department of environmental resources staff.
letter dated september.the record is undisputed that the letter described the standard practice of the county to work with property owners to resolve county code violations and to forbear from enforcement as long as the property owner was making good faith efforts to cure its violations.associate county attorney anne magner never responded to the letter.according to sadisco,this letter memorialized an oral contract between sadisco and the county that predates the consent orders.
the county then granted sadisco a series of requested extensions of the deadline for compliance with the terms of the grading consent order based upon sadisco representations that it was diligently working to meet such requirements.ultimately,the county extended the deadline for sadisco compliance with the terms of the grading consent order to july.
moreover,based upon requests by sadisco to allow it more time to comply with the requirements of the zoning consent order,the county permitted sadisco to operate its salvage automobile wholesaling business on the property until the middle of march.however,on march,the county notified sadisco in writing that it intended to carry out enforcement of the zoning consent order on or after march.
at an april,meeting of various county officials,the decision was made to enforce the zoning consent order.the sheet in the record reflects that such officials included,among others cynthia barry,zoning inspector supervisor for the county department of environmental resources county zoning inspector supervisor barry jeffrey dehan,code enforcement officer in the community standards division of the site development inspection section of the county department of environmental resources county code enforcement officer dehan and anne williams,environmental crimes specialist for the division of environmental health of the county health department county environmental crimes specialist williams.of relevance to the issues on appeal,prior to this meeting,the county knew that groundwater at andrews air force base had long been contaminated with chlorobenzene and other volatile organic chemicals.the county also knew that preliminary studies had found low concentrations of chlorobenzene within ground water seeps along the fence line between andrews air force base and the property and at higher concentration levels on property not owned by sadisco but nonetheless adjacent to the property and next to the fence line at andrews air force base.furthermore,the county knew that it would not be able to learn the exact extent of the groundwater contamination in regard to the property until issuance of an environmental report,based upon sampling data,that was expected to be issued later in the year.
a written document,entitled sadisco property foxley road action items,detailed how the county intended to proceed,as determined at the april,meeting.the county department of environmental resources would actually padlock the gate sadisco had installed across the foxley road on the property.until sadisco obtained the necessary county permits,for grading and use and occupancy,sadisco would only be allowed to access the property to remove cars and perform other tasks on the property that would bring sadisco into compliance.the county padlocked the property the next day on april.
nearly three years later,on march,sadisco filed the present civil action in the united states district court for the district of maryland against the county and the officials,individually and in their respective official capacities.the officials consist of county zoning inspector supervisor barry erv beckert,district engineer in the county department of public works and transportation county district engineer beckert county code enforcement officer dehan thomas matzen,associate director of the community standards division of the county department of environmental resources county associate director of the community standards division and county environmental crimes specialist williams.
the complaint alleged five counts as follows.pursuant to,count alleged the county and the officials collectively the defendants violated sadisco substantive due process rights under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.count alleged the defendants violated sadisco substantive due process rights under the maryland declaration of rights.count alleged breach of contract under maryland common law against the county alone.count alleged tortious interference with economic relations under maryland common law against the defendants.count alleged negligent misrepresentation under maryland common law against the defendants.
in february,the district court dismissed counts,and on the basis that sadisco had failed to comply with,and was not entitled to waiver of,the notice requirements of the local government tort claims act the lgtca,cts.jud.proc.b.the district court dismissed count as time barred to the extent sadisco alleged breach of a written contract.the district court allowed discovery to proceed on count to the extent such count alleged breach of two oral contracts.the district court also allowed discovery to proceed against the officials with respect to count,but stayed discovery against the county for any potential liability under monell department of social services,d.see id.at limiting liability of local governmental units not part of the state for eleventh amendment purposes for constitutionally offensive actions of its employees to actions taken by such employees in furtherance of some municipal policy or custom vathekan prince george county,cir observing that monell established that municipalities and counties could be liable for constitutional deprivations under.
on february,the defendants moved for summary judgment on the remaining counts,with the officials in their individual capacities each seeking to be dismissed on the basis of qualified immunity.on july,the district court ruled as follows.the district court dismissed the officials in their individual capacities from the action on the basis of qualified immunity.because sadisco naming of the officials as defendants in their official capacities served as suits against the county,the county remained as the sole defendant with respect to count see kentucky graham,d as long as the government entity receives notice and an opportunity to respond,an suit is,in all respects other than name,to be treated as a suit against the entity.the district court denied the county motion for summary judgment on count.however,the district court granted the county motion for summary judgment with respect to the remaining portion of count,for allegedly breaching two alleged oral contracts.
on may,the county again moved for summary judgment with respect to count,which motion the district court granted on november.huggins prince george county,d.this timely appeal followed.
on appeal,sadisco challenges the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the county with respect to count the district court dismissal,based upon qualified immunity,of the officials in their individual capacities with respect to count the district court grant of summary judgment with respect to count allegation of breach of two alleged oral contracts between sadisco and the county and the district court rule b dismissal of counts,and.
we first address sadisco challenge to the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the county with respect to the portions of count alleging breach of two oral contracts that sadisco alleges existed between it and the county.sadisco contends that such oral contracts arose from two identical promises made by the county,approximately nine months apart,to forbear shutting down sadisco salvage automobile wholesaling business on the property,as long as sadisco diligently pursued issuance of the necessary permits.according to sadisco,the first promise occurred on november,during a meeting between sadisco representatives on the one hand and county zoning inspector supervisor barry and county code enforcement officer dehan on the other.sadisco contends the second promise occurred on september,one day before the county and sadisco entered into the consent orders,when the county,through associate county attorney anne magner,made the same promise.
when the district court asked sadisco at the summary judgment hearing regarding the remaining portion of count what the county was to get out of that agreement,referring to the alleged second promise,sadisco responded 
two things mainly.first of all,sadisco entry into the consent orders.sadisco could have litigated this matter instead of entering into consent orders at that point in september of,but sadisco relinquished that opportunity and entered into the consent orders.that the consideration.
sadisco also represented at the same summary judgment hearing that the alleged oral contracts had no fixed terms.sadisco alleges the county breached the alleged oral contracts when it padlocked sadisco business on april.on appeal,as it did below,sadisco points to various portions of deposition testimony,including deposition testimony by associate county attorney anne magner,as its primary evidence in support of the alleged oral contracts.
below,after considering the parties written arguments in the summary judgment motion papers and the parties oral arguments at the summary judgment hearing,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the county on the ground that no consideration in favor of the county existed to support a valid oral contract which predated the consent orders.
we agree with the district court.first,because the of the two alleged oral contracts november predates the county filing of its two enforcement actions against sadisco may,sadisco agreement to enter into the consent orders to settle the enforcement actions can not serve as consideration for such alleged oral contract.
although the of the two alleged oral contracts september post dates the county filing of its two enforcement actions against sadisco may,such alleged oral contract suffers from a different,but nonetheless fatal problem.the county adamantly denies the existence of such an oral contract and the evidence upon which sadisco attempts to rely in order to prove that it gave the county valid consideration for the alleged oral contract is barred from admission by the parol evidence rule because such evidence directly contradicts the two subsequent written consent orders.between the consent orders,which are matters of contract under maryland law,allstate ins.stinebaugh,sadisco collectively agreed,inter alia to relinquish its rights and opportunities to defend itself in the two then pending enforcement actions to obtain a grading permit and an approved erosion and sediment control plan and to perform various work at the property within sixty days to vacate the premises within ninety days unless sadisco obtained a valid use and occupancy permit and unless sadisco took the corrective actions specified in the zoning consent order within ninety days,the county possessed the authority to shut down sadisco salvage automobile wholesaling business on the property until a valid use and occupancy permit is obtained and the costs of the suit are paid.by relying on parol evidence,sadisco attempts to contradict the deadlines for its compliance with its obligations under the consent orders with an period of time for compliance.
maryland substantive law,which the parties agree applies to analyze sadisco breach of oral contracts claim,is clear that the parol evidence rule bars admission of sadisco evidence of a prior agreement to vary or contradict the terms of the written consent orders in an effort to establish that it gave consideration for the alleged oral contract.calomiris woods,maryland law generally requires giving legal effect to the clear terms of a contract and bars the admission of prior or contemporaneous agreements or negotiations to vary or contradict a written contractual term.higgins barnes,in absence of fraud,duress,or mutual mistake,parol evidence is not admissible to show the intention of the parties or to vary,alter,or contradict the terms of a contract that is complete and unambiguous.
despite the fact that sadisco claims of deadlines directly contradict the unambiguous and deadlines in the consent orders,sadisco argues that the parol evidence rule does not apply because neither consent order contained an integration clause.sadisco argument is without merit.under maryland law,although an integration clause is indicative of the intention of the parties to finalize their complete understanding in a written contract,the existence of such a clause in a contract is not a prerequisite to application of the parol evidence rule.see,kasten constr.rod enterprises,maryland follows objective test for interpreting written contracts where contract is plain and unambiguous and in absence of fraud,duress,or mutual mistake,court can not look beyond four corners of the written contract to evidence of prior statements or agreements,especially when contract contains integration clause.
here,the bottom line is that,pursuant to the written zoning consent order,which consent order post dates the second alleged oral contract,sadisco plainly and unambiguously agreed that if it d id not take the corrective actions ordered,in the zoning consent order within ninety days of september,the county shall have the authority to take all action necessary to enter onto the p roperty to execute this order,and to remove the occupants and close down the operation of the on the premises.the effect of sadisco claim alleging breach of the second oral contract and its offer of deposition testimony and other various evidence in support,is to directly contradict this plain and unambiguous language of the zoning consent order.because sadisco has not shown or even alleged that it entered into the zoning consent order because of fraud,duress,or by mutual mistake,the parol evidence rule steps in to bar such effort.kasten constr,at.see also strickler eng g seminar,where parties have expressed their intention in clear and definite terms the paper must be construed according to the true meaning of the words used therein.in sum,we hold the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the county with respect to the portion of count alleging breach of two alleged oral contracts and affirm the judgment below in that respect.
we next address sadisco challenge to the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants with respect to count,its substantive due process claim under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.sadisco challenge is without merit.
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment states,in relevant part,no state shall deprive any person of property,without due process of law const.amend.xiv.in county of sacramento lewis,d,the supreme court explained that the core of the concept of due process is protection against arbitrary action,id.at,and that only the most egregious official conduct can be said to be arbitrary in the constitutional sense,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court further explained,the substantive component of the due process clause is violated by executive action only when it can properly be characterized as arbitrary,or conscience shocking,in a constitutional sense.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.c onduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest is the sort of official action most likely to rise to the level.id.at.
sadisco premises its substantive due process claim on the following two property interests its right to use the p roperty under permits issued by the county and the county express agreement to allow it to continue operating.sadisco opening brief at.notably,sadisco does not contend that the decision to shut down its salvage automobile wholesaling business on the property was motivated by any intent on the part of the defendants to injure sadisco.rather,according to sadisco,the defendants violated its right to substantive due process in regard to these asserted property interests by shutting down its salvage automobile wholesaling business on the property based upon the officials respective individual fears as well as their collective fear that the county would incur liability for expensive environmental costs in connection with the foxley road.
the district court disposed of this count with respect to the county on the basis that sadisco had not forecast sufficient evidence that it had a property interest protected by the fourteenth amendment.we agree with the district court on this point.first,assuming arguendo that a party can make out a substantive due process claim based upon a property interest in an existing contract,sadisco can not maintain a substantive due process claim upon this basis because,as we just held in part ii of this opinion,supra at,sadisco failed to establish an enforceable contract between it and the county in which the county agreed to allow it to continue operating its salvage automobile wholesaling business on the property as long as sadisco diligently pursued obtaining the necessary permits.
sadisco asserted property right to operate its business on the property pursuant to permits issued by the county does not work either.critically,the record is undisputed that by the end of october,the county had legitimately revoked any and all outstanding permits that it had issued to sadisco with respect to the property because of sadisco violation of numerous county code provisions,so that by the time the county shut down sadisco salvage automobile wholesaling business on april,sadisco no longer held any valid permits.
sadisco addresses the revocation issue by citing a helping hand,llc baltimore county,cir,for the proposition that once a permit is issued,ev
