mike ahumada,as relator,filed this qui tam action on behalf of the united states under the false claims act fca,et.in his first amended complaint,ahumada alleges that his former employer,the national center for employment of the disabled nced,along with other defendants,defrauded the government through various schemes in connection with contracts pursuant to the javits wagner act,et.specifically,ahumada alleges that nced conspired with its suppliers and an overseeing nonprofit to skirt applicable regulations and overcharge the government.
after nced and its former ceo settled,the district court dismissed ahumada claims against the remaining defendants.it held that the fca bar precluded jurisdiction and that ahumada had not stated any viable claims.ahumada now appeals that dismissal,as well as the district court denial of his motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
from february to july of,nced employed ahumada as a vice president and general manager.nced,a nonprofit corporation,produces a number of products including military apparel and corrugated boxes that it sells to agencies of the government.these sales occur pursuant to contracts under the javits wagner act.
the javits wagner act establishes a government contracting program the jwod program to promote employment and training opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities.a.to that effect,the act created the committee for purchase from people who are blind or severely disabled the committee,which makes and maintains a procurement list of products and services eligible for purchase from qualified nonprofit agencies.if a n entity of the federal government intend s to procure a product or service on the procurement list,it must do so from such a nonprofit at a market price established by the committee.id.to qualify for participation in the program,a nonprofit must certify,on an annual basis,that it employs blind or other severely disabled individuals for at least percent of the hours of direct labor required for the production or provision of the products and services.id.c.
to coordinate the participation of nonprofits,the committee appointed the national industries for the severely handicapped nish to serve as the jwod program central nonprofit agency.see id.c.in this role,nish was responsible for e valuat ing the qualifications of other nonprofits that sought to participate in the program,and for assigning them contracts in a fair and equitable manner.b.nish was also charged with monitor ing the participating nonprofits to ensure their compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements of the program.id.j.
beginning in october about eight months before ahumada filed his initial complaint in this case the oregonian,a newspaper,published a series of articles describing questionable practices within the jwod program.among other issues,the articles alleged that nced was receiving payment on jwod contracts despite failing to employ the requisite percentage of disabled workers.the articles attributed at least some of the problems in the program to lax oversight by nish.
the el paso times published the first in a similar series of articles that november.its articles reported that the committee had begun investigating nced for its perceived lack of compliance with jwod labor requirements.the articles further alleged that certain nced suppliers,including international paper ipc,green bay packaging,and smurfit stone container,helped nced skirt jwod regulations by providing nced with finished products rather than component parts.see d prohibiting nonprofits from subcontract ing the entire production process for all or a portion of an order without the committee prior approval.the articles reported that nced then resold these products to the government under the pretense that they were produced entirely by disabled nced employees.the allegations reported in the two newspapers were also the subject of a television documentary.
in the wake of this publicity,the fbi launched a criminal investigation that resulted in the indictments of three nced executives.bob jones and patrick woods nced former ceo and former board president ultimately pleaded guilty to various fraud and embezzlement charges.in,a jury convicted nced former coo,ernie lopez,of making false statements and conspiracy to defraud the government.
on june,ahumada filed this qui tam suit under the fca against nced,jones,and john doe defendants in the district court for the eastern district of virginia.the complaint alleged that,between and,jones and nced engaged in a series of schemes to defraud the government,primarily by receiving payments on jwod contracts despite failing to comply with jwod regulations.ahumada later filed a first amended complaint alleging that nced falsely represented its compliance with jwod requirements falsely represented that it produced certain products it sold to the government and overcharged the government.
the first amended complaint also named several additional defendants,including nish and four nced suppliers ipc,green bay,smurfit,and weyerhaeuser collectively,the supplier defendants.ahumada alleged that nish knew that nced was not complying with jwod requirements but continued to assign it contracts to improve nish own bottom line.he also alleged that the supplier defendants conspired with nced and facilitated its fraud by issuing artificially inflated invoices,and,later,providing rebates falsely billing nced for raw materials despite actually providing finished or nearly finished products and falsely stamping finished products with nced box manufacturing certificate.according to ahumada,the supplier defendants engaged in this conduct while attempting to nced was not complying with jwod regulations.
per its statutory mandate,the united states intervened in ahumada suit with respect to defendants nced and jones.see b.both eventually settled with the government and ahumada.the united states chose not to intervene with respect to the claims against nish and the supplier defendants,and those parties moved to dismiss ahumada suit.
in support of their motions to dismiss,nish and the supplier defendants advanced two primary arguments.first,they argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction pursuant to the fca bar.see e a.this provision precludes jurisdiction over claims based upon publicly disclosed allegations unless the relator is an original source.id.second,they argued that the first amended complaint suffered from various pleading defects.in response,ahumada moved for leave to file a proposed second amended complaint.
the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss.see united states ex rel.ahumada ctr.for emp t of the disabled,cv,wl.may.the court held that the first amended complaint was devoid of any particularized facts and therefore failed to plead fraud with the particularity required by federal rule of civil procedure b.id.at.specifically,it did not identify the who,what,when,where and how of the alleged false claims.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court also held that the first amended complaint general and conclusory allegations were insufficient because they adequately alleged neither scienter an essential element of any fca claim nor the specific elements of a conspiracy.id.at.
as an alternative basis for dismissal,the court held that the bar deprived it of jurisdiction.in the court view,t he allegations in the first amended complaint clearly track the news media stories which appear to be the basis of ahumada s claim.id.at.furthermore,the court held that ahumada had not established that he was an original source so as to avoid the bar because he failed to demonstrate that he possessed direct and independent knowledge of the information underlying the allegations.id.
finally,the district court denied ahumada leave to amend.it explained that the proposed amendments fail ed to cure the deficiencies in the first amended complaint and were therefore futile.id.at.because t he specific details added to the second amended complaint were all information that c ould be found in the public domain,the court determined that the new pleading was likewise based upon a public disclosure.id.
ahumada appealed,and we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.
although ahumada nominally challenges the district court order dismissing the first amended complaint,his arguments on appeal center on the sufficiency of the allegations in the second.in essence,rather than directly challenge the district court dismissal of the first amended complaint,ahumada argues that the district court should have granted him leave to amend,which he contends would have cured any pleading or jurisdictional defects.we thus consider the issues presented by this appeal solely through the prism of ahumada proposed second amended complaint,ultimately seeking to determine whether the district court erred in concluding that it was futile.
generally,we review a district court denial of a motion for leave to amend for abuse of discretion.see airline pilots ass awappa,llc,cir.but where,as here,the district court denied such a motion on grounds of futility,we employ the same standard that would apply to our review of a motion to dismiss.see pollard pollard,app x,cir see also platten hg bermuda exempted,cir.thus,we review de novo the district court legal conclusion that ahumada proposed amendments fail ed to cure the deficiencies in the first amended complaint namely,that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted and failed to overcome the fca bar see ahumada,wl,at.
we first consider whether the fca bar rendered the second amended complaint futile by precluding jurisdiction.we hold that the bar deprived the district court of jurisdiction over the claims against all of the appellees except weyerhaeuser.
at the time ahumada filed this action,the fca bar provided that n o court shall have jurisdiction over an action under the fca based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions unless the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.e a.qualifying public disclosures include those from the news media or a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,among others.id.once a defendant files a motion to dismiss based on the bar,the relator bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the bar does not apply.see united states ex rel.vuyyuru jadhav,cir.
under this court precedent,a qui tam action is based upon publicly disclosed allegations only if the qui tam plaintiff allegations were actually derived from the public disclosure itself.united states ex rel.rostholder omnicare,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this stands in contrast to the broader tests applied by our sister circuits,which generally consider allegations to be based upon a public disclosure if they were supported by or substantially similar to fraud that had been publicly disclosed.united states ex rel.may purdue pharma,cir see also united states ex rel.ondis city of woonsocket,cir t he fourth circuit is alone among the courts of appeals in favoring a narrow reading of the based upon language.notably,the bar encompasses actions even partly based upon,partly derived from public disclosures.see vuyyuru,at emphasis added.
we easily conclude that ahumada allegations are at least partly based upon public disclosures.ahumada barely argues otherwise in his opening brief,stating in just a single sentence that his action is not based upon any public disclosure because the only evidence in the record is that ahumada has relied only upon his own personal knowledge.appellant br.at.to the contrary,however,the second amended complaint itself plainly relies on public disclosures.it explicitly references reporting from the oregonian and el paso times,and many of ahumada allegations appear to have been lifted almost verbatim from the various articles see ahumada,wl,at.moreover,several of the essential allegations constitute little more than direct citations to testimony from the lopez trial.because that information,at a minimum,appears to actually derive from public disclosures,see rostholder,at,we have no reason to disturb the district court factual finding that public disclosures at least partly form the basis of ahumada claim,see ahumada,wl,at.
even though his action is partly based upon public disclosures,ahumada may nevertheless avoid the bar if he is an original source of the allegations.see e a see also rockwell int l united states,describing status as an exception to the bar.to qualify as an original source,a relator must establish that he has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing the action.e b.
considering the second requirement first,we conclude that ahumada has adequately established that he reported his allegations to the government prior to filing suit.in an affidavit he submitted in response to the defendants motions to dismiss,ahumada averred that,around january,he met with fbi agent steve chambers and told him everything he knew about all of the defendants.similarly,the second amended complaint itself alleges that,in an april meeting with chambers and agent tom murray,ahumada described in detail the various schemes taking place at nced that were being used to defraud the government.id.at.
rather than question the truth of these statements,nish and the supplier defendants object that they do not establish that ahumada discussed any allegations against nish or any specific supplier defendant with the fbi.appellees br.at emphasis added.similarly,they argue that ahumada has not shown,with the requisite particularity,that he informed the government about his specific allegations against the remaining defendants.id.at emphasis added.
we think this asks too much.we agree that a relator may not satisfy the exception reporting requirement through an ambiguous assertion that leaves open to question whether the plaintiff actually reported information relating to any particular claim or concerning any particular defendant.but that is not the case here.ahumada affidavit specifically states that he told the fbi everything he knew about all of the defendants.emphasis added.read in conjunction with the second amended complaint allegations which of course name the defendants and outline in detail what ahumada knew,we find nothing ambiguous about this statement.requiring more would prove needlessly duplicative.
whether ahumada has satisfied the exception direct and independent knowledge requirement is a more complicated question.
under our case law,a relator knowledge is direct if he acquired it through his own efforts,without an intervening agency,and it is independent if the knowledge is not dependent on public disclosure.grayson mgmt,cir.to establish that his knowledge meets this standard,a relator must allege specific facts as opposed to mere conclusions showing exactly how and when he obtained it.see united states ex rel.hafter spectrum emergency care,cir.a mere assertion of direct and independent knowledge,without adequate basis in fact and unsupported by competent proof,will not establish jurisdiction.id.at.
in applying these standards,we note that the exception does not permit claim smuggling.rockwell int l,at.in other words,the fact that a relator is an original source with respect to some claim does not confer jurisdiction in gross over all of his claims.id.emphasis added.for this reason,we separately address the source of ahumada knowledge with respect to his claims against each defendant.
in his second amended complaint,ahumada alleges that nish facilitated nced fraud by ignoring nced lack of compliance with jwod regulations.according to the complaint,nish representatives toured nced facilities on three occasions in,and,and these visits would have disclosed and did disclose that nced did not employ significant numbers of severely disabled individuals.nevertheless,the complaint alleges,nish did not bar nced from participating in the jwod program.instead,nish continued to certify nced compliance with jwod labor requirements each and every year.id.meanwhile,nish own revenues increased by at least percent.accordingly,the second amended complaint concludes,nish aided nced in wrongfully profit ing from the united states.id.at.
even assuming these allegations are true,ahumada has not established that they are based on his direct and independent knowledge.ahumada worked at nced for only six months in,so it is far from clear how he gained direct knowledge of the nish visits in,and.ahumada has offered no explanation for how he learned of these events.but nearly all of the information appears in public disclosures.indeed,the second amended complaint itself explicitly cites testimony from the lopez trial for at least one of its allegations against nish.
accordingly,without any other explanation from ahumada,we conclude that his knowledge necessarily derives from public disclosures or some other intervening agency.grayson,at.the allegations against nish therefore do not avoid the bar.
so too with the claims against green bay.the substance of ahumada allegation against green bay is that it produced complete and nearly complete products for nced in violation of nced obligation to produce such products itself.see.according to the second amended complaint,green bay was aware that nced governments contracts required direct labor by disabled employees,yet it sold nced the finished products anyway.see id.at.
as ahumada forthrightly acknowledges,however,nced did not place orders with green bay until after ahumada was terminated from employment by nced.id.emphasis added.to support his allegation that green bay provided nced with finished products,ahumada cites publicly disclosed testimony from the lopez trial.see id.at jose rosales,sales representative for green bay,testified at the criminal trial of ernie lopez that commencing in february,nced ordered a million postal sleeves from green bay.accordingly,we conclude that ahumada is not an original source with respect to the claims against green bay.
in contrast to green bay,ipc was already making containers for nced at the time ahumada began working there.id.at.according to the second amended complaint,these containers came from ipc san antonio plant,rather than its el paso plant,because the general manager of the el paso plant refused to go along with the illegal scheme of manufacturing boxes that were supposed to be made by disabled individuals.id.thus,ahumada asserts,ipc unquestionably knew that nced was participating in the jwod program and that nced was not meeting the jwod requirement.id.
to be sure,this allegation comes closer than the previous ones to establishing ahumada direct and independent knowledge.but it nevertheless falls short of the mark.to support his assertion that ipc unquestionably knew of nced wrongdoing the scienter element of the fca claim ahumada states that he was told that ipc general manager refused to go along with the illegal scheme.id.emphasis added.but he does not state who told him this information whether some third party or an employee of ipc itself.see united states med,cir per curiam noting that a relator is not an original source if a third party is the source of the core information on which the qui tam complaint is based internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.he thus has not established that his knowledge was direct,rather than derived from an intervening agency.see grayson,at.
ahumada also alleges that ipc submitted to nced eleven invoices for complete gsa boxes in september and october of,after ahumada informed an ipc representative of nced fraudulent conduct.these boxes,ahumada alleges,were stamped with nced box manufacturing certificate,falsely making it appear that the boxe s were manufactured by nced in compliance with the jwod labor requirements.id.but ahumada offers no basis on which he could have known such detailed information directly.in fact,because the invoices ahumada cites were issued after he left nced in july,this information almost certainly derives from public disclosures or some other intervening agency.rockwell int l,at concluding that the relator did not possess direct and independent knowledge b ecause he was no longer employed by the defendant at the time the alleged fraud occurred.likely confirming as much,the same page of the second amended complaint explicitly cites testimony from the lopez trial.
in sum,because ahumada has not established that his allegations against ipc are based on his direct and independent knowledge,he does not qualify as an original source.
ahumada allegations against smurfit are much like those against green bay ahumada alleges that smurfit began filling large orders for complete or nearly complete containers only a fter ahumada was terminated by nced.emphasis added.paragraph of the second amended complaint does further allege that,after ahumada was terminated,he informed smurfit representatives of nced illegal conduct.but it again provides no explanation for how ahumada directly knew that smurfit continued to make complete containers for nced.see id.moreover,the next paragraph of the complaint again cites testimony from the lopez trial,strongly suggesting that this public disclosure was in fact the source of ahumada knowledge.ahumada is therefore not an original source with respect to the smurfit allegations either.
weyerhaeuser 
ahumada primary allegation against weyerhaeuser is that,during the time that ahumada worked at nced,it provided nced with raw sheets as well as complete or nearly complete boxes.id.at.according to the second amended complaint,ahumada met with steve cartmill,a weyerhaeuser sales manager,on many occasions during this period and took him on tours of the nced facility.id.on these tours,cartmill allegedly saw that nced failed to employ a sufficient number of disabled workers.the complaint further alleges that cartmill told ahumada that weyerhaeuser was issuing artificially inflated invoices to nced and later providing rebates,and that nced had requested weyerhaeuser to bill for raw sheets rather than complete boxes it actually provided.based on these allegations,ahumada asserts that weyerhaeuser facilitate d nced defrauding of the government.id.at.
thus,in contrast to many of the allegations against the other defendants,ahumada learned the facts underlying the weyerhaeuser allegations directly through the course of his employment with nced.see united states ex rel.barajas northrop,cir finding that the relator knowledge was direct and independent because he acquired it during the course of his employment.to be sure,the information ahumada alleges he learned from cartmill might in some sense be characterized as secondhand.but cartmill was an employee of weyerhaeuser itself,not an intervening agency or third party.see grayson,at emphasis added see also med,at.and,as further support for his status,ahumada alleges that he independently confirmed what cartmill told him about weyerhaeuser billing practices through his own inquiry with nced controller.
because ahumada knowledge derived from an admission the defendant made to him during the course of ahumada employment an admission ahumada then confirmed through his own efforts we believe it is sufficiently direct to satisfy the exception see grayson,at see also united states ex rel.devlin california,cir explaining that a relator knowledge is direct and independent if he discovered the information underlying his allegations through his own labor.accordingly,the district court did not lack jurisdiction over ahumada claims against weyerhaeuser.
to summarize,we hold that the bar deprives the district court of jurisdiction over ahumada claims against nish,green bay,ipc,and smurfit.with respect to those defendants,the district court correctly determined that ahumada proposed amendments to his first amended complaint were futile.because the bar does not preclude jurisdiction over the claims against weyerhaeuser,however,we must also consider the separate question of whether those claims were adequately pleaded.
as relevant here ahumada asserts claims against weyerhaeuser pursuant to three separate provisions of the fca specifically,those imposing liability against a person who 
knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to the government a false or fraudulent claim
