in february,appellant john coleman filed a freedom of information act foia request with appellee drug enforcement administration dea for documents concerning the federal government regulation of the drug carisoprodol.despite a statutory mandate requiring agencies to respond to foia requests and appeals within twenty working days,the dea took more than sixteen months to respond to coleman request,eventually denying it for failure to prepay the assessed processing fee.the department of justice office of information policy oip then took over seven months to act on coleman appeal of the dea fee determination,ultimately remanding the request back to the dea for reconsideration.coleman waited almost five more months for subsequent dea action.finally,after nearly two and a half years of pursuing his request through the administrative process to no avail,coleman filed this action against the dea seeking production of the documents he originally requested.
having exhausted the litigant,the dea proceeded to argue that it was coleman who had failed to pay its fee request for a preliminary search of documents and to exhaust his administrative remedies.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment to the dea.we reverse.because the dea violated its statutory deadline for responding to coleman,we hold that he has exhausted his administrative remedies in this matter and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
congress passed the freedom of information act,in to establish a general philosophy of full agency disclosure,at,and to assure the availability of government information necessary to an informed electorate,at.the statute provides that,subject to certain enumerated exemptions for classified documents,agency personnel and medical files,confidential financial information,and the like,b,federal agencies generally must make their internal records available to the public upon request,id.a a.as the supreme court has recognized,foia disclosure regime shines a light on government operations to check against corruption and to hold the governors accountable to the governed.nlrb robbins tire rubber,d.
upon receipt of a request for records,an agency has twenty working days to determine whether to comply with such request and shall immediately notify the person making such request of such determination and the reasons therefor.a a i.the period may be extended in unusual circumstances,to wit,if the agency must search for and collect the requested records from field facilities search for,collect,and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request or consult with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request.id.a b.if an agency seeks to invoke the unusual circumstances extension,it must send written notice to the person making such request setting forth the unusual circumstances for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched.id.a b i.no extension for unusual circumstances is permissible without written notice to the requester.if an agency seeks to extend the deadline by more than ten working days,it must provide the person an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed more quickly.id.a b ii.at the time coleman filed his request,there was no other relevant mechanism for an agency to toll the time limit.
to offset the cost of fulfilling document requests,foia authorizes agencies to collect processing fees.id.a.there are three basic types of fees search fees to cover the cost of agency personnel time spent locating the requested documents,review fees to cover the cost of personnel time spent determining whether any requested documents are exempt from disclosure,and duplication fees to cover the cost of actual duplication as well as any personnel time spent in the duplication process.b,c.when records are requested for commercial use,an agency may,in accord with its own regulations,assess search,review,and duplication fees.a a ii i.when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by an educational or noncommercial scientific institution or a representative of the news media,the agency may collect only duplication fees,not search or review fees.id.a a ii ii.any other requests for noncommercial use are subject to both search and duplication fees,but not review fees.id.a a ii iii.
notwithstanding the foregoing fee assessment criteria,foia requests must be processed without any charge or at a charge reduced below the agency established fee schedule if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.id.a a iii.if no fee waiver applies,an agency may require prepayment before beginning to process a request if the agency has determined that the fee will exceed.id.a a v.if the requester refuses to prepay these fees,the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be done on it until the required payment is received.i.
if a requester is not satisfied with an agency response to a request,either because the requester disagrees with the fee assessment or the agency has refused to provide all requested documents that the requester believes are subject to disclosure under foia,the requester may file an administrative appeal.id.a a i.pursuant to federal regulations,the oip handles all appeals from doj component organizations,including the dea.a.foia requesters have days from the date of the dea adverse decision to appeal to the oip.id.by congressional mandate,the oip has twenty working days after receipt of the appeal to make a determination on it.a a ii.
if a requester is not satisfied with the outcome of an administrative appeal,the requester may seek judicial review of any adverse decision.on complaint by the requester,the district court has jurisdiction to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant.id.a b.before commencing litigation,a requester must ordinarily exhaust administrative remedies by appealing an issue through the foia administrative process following an initial adverse determination by the agency,wilbur cia,per curiam see also c.however,a requester shall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies and may commence litigation immediately if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions of the foia statute,a c i,so long as the agency has not cured its violation by responding before the requester files suit,pollack dep t of justice,cir.this constructive exhaustion provision allows a requester to break out of the administrative process and proceed directly to federal court in the face of an unresponsive agency.if,during litigation,the government can show exceptional circumstances exist and that the agency is exercising due diligence in responding to the request,the court may retain jurisdiction and allow the agency additional time to complete its review of the records.a c i 
the trek through the above administrative process began on february,when coleman,a researcher and author,sent a foia request to the dea seeking documents regarding the scheduling of carisoprodol trade name soma r pursuant to the controlled substances act.coleman offered to reimburse the federal government all appropriate costs in connection with the search and reproduction of the requested records up to the sum of.id.
the dea received the request several days later on march.pursuant to foia,the agency had twenty working days to determine whether to comply with the request and notify coleman of that determination.see a a i.the period expired on april,and no response or notice of unusual circumstances was sent to coleman by that date,placing the dea in violation of foia provisions.
on july,one year,four months,and ten days after receiving coleman request the dea denied the request on the grounds that the promise to pay fees of is insufficient to cover the cost of the search,review and duplication.the dea stated that,as a commercial requester,coleman was responsible for search,review,and duplication fees and,based on the initial request,the cost of only the preliminary phase of the search was estimated at.the agency advised that it could not begin processing the request until coleman submitted an advance payment of,which would cover most of the agency estimate for the cost of the search.
approximately two weeks later,on july,coleman appealed the fee assessment to the oip.in his appeal,he asserted that he was not a commercial requester but rather a researcher and an author who,in the past,has published medical and scientific articles in professional journals and books for which he neither sought nor received remuneration.he indicated that he was seeking this information as a requester and stated his intent to use the requested information as part of his research for a book,journal article,or news report.id.coleman further stated that he was,in fact,eligible to request a fee waiver because he was a freelance journalist and disclosure of the information he sought is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations of the government with respect to how it enforces provisions of the controlled substances act.notwithstanding his initial promise to pay,coleman formally requested a fee waiver in light of the dea excessive delay in unlawfully denying him access to the requested information.
the oip received the appeal on august.pursuant to foia,the oip had twenty working days to act on it.see a a ii.the period lapsed on september.no decision on the appeal was communicated to coleman by that date,placing the oip,like the dea,in violation of the statutory time limit.
on march,seven months and eleven days after receiving coleman appeal the oip notified coleman that the dea action on his initial request was not consistent with the dea own regulations concerning fee assessment.citing b defining commercial use request id.e.without mandating a particular final disposition,the oip remanded the request to the dea for reprocessing,including further consideration of coleman fee category.while foia itself does not explicitly contemplate remands following administrative appeals,doj regulations provide that a remanded request will be reprocessed in accordance with the oip appeal decision.b.the oip decision letter did not indicate that coleman had to take any additional action to have his request reprocessed.
on april,coleman resubmitted his foia request directly to the dea.he reiterated that he was not a commercial requester and proposed a settlement that all fees for search and duplication review cost is no longer applicable be waived,arguing in support of the proposal that he was a published author of academic and technical materials.he also reasserted that disclosure of the information sought in the request is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations of the government with respect to how it enforces provisions of the controlled substances act.
after waiting approximately four more months for a response from the dea,coleman commenced the instant lawsuit pro se in the eastern district of virginia.he recounted the history of his foia request going back nearly years from the date he filed the complaint and sought judicial relief in the form of an order directing the dea to provide immediate and full access to the requested documents with all fees waived in view of excessive and unlawful delay.
on september,just before filing an answer in this litigation,the dea took action on coleman request,which was still pending after the oip remand six months earlier.the dea maintained its position that coleman was a commercial requester because he was affiliated with a firm that offered consulting services to pharmaceutical companies seeking government approval of their new drugs.the agency also pointed to one of coleman publications in which he disclosed a financial relationship with several drug manufacturers.finding that coleman had a commercial interest in the documents he sought,the dea declined to grant him either noncommercial fee status or a fee waiver.it then rejected the foia request on the grounds that the search fee alone would exhaust coleman commitment many times over.the day after the dea sent this letter,it filed an answer and pointed to the reasoning in the letter as justification for denying coleman request.
even as this litigation was pending,the parties continued their discussions in the administrative process.on november,three months after coleman filed his complaint,the dea sent additional correspondence in further response to his request.j.the agency reiterated its position that coleman was a commercial requester based on his involvement in pharmaceutical consulting and his past foia requests,at least some of which were deemed commercial without dispute.and once again,the agency denied the request at issue here,arguing that the processing fees would far exceed regardless of whether coleman were deemed a commercial or noncommercial requester.the parties reached an impasse following coleman final administrative correspondence,dated december,in which he again explained his belief that he was entitled to both noncommercial fee status as well as a public interest fee waiver.the dea moved for summary judgment shortly thereafter.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the dea in march,concluding that coleman both failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and failed to pay the fee necessary to begin processing his request.with respect to the exhaustion issue,the court found that coleman only recently demanded a waiver of all fees associated with his foia request in his december,letter and had not yet appealed the denial of the waiver to the oip.the district court also found that coleman refused to pay the dea assessed processing fee before filing suit,providing a second,independent grounds for summary judgment in favor of the agency.coleman unsuccessfully moved the district court to alter or amend its judgment,and this appeal followed.
we shall first address whether coleman exhausted his administrative remedies prior to filing the instant suit.as a general matter,the concept of administrative exhaustion makes good sense.it is far better for the requester and the agency to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution on their own without the need for federal judicial intervention.the requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted saves both agency and judicial resources and affords the requester hope that a timely response to the request will be forthcoming.congress recognized,however,that agencies may be prone to resist the release of records,either because they believe in good faith that production of the requested documents is not required or because they wish to spare themselves inconvenience or embarrassment.without the prospect of judicial intervention,therefore,the right of citizens to examine the basic workings of their government would be severely compromised.this is an especially troubling prospect at a time when the reach of government makes accountability important and the sheer size of government can render its operations all but impenetrable.
unfortunately this particular suit illustrates the frustration of congressional hopes and the confirmation of congressional fears.given the extended and inexcusable agency delay coleman faced while pursuing his foia request,we conclude that he constructively exhausted his administrative remedies before commencing this litigation.
a requester must ordinarily appeal the denial of a foia request within the administrative process before proceeding to federal court,wilbur,at see also c.however,to prevent agencies from keeping requesters out of court by simply delaying the administrative process ad infinitum,congress provided that a requester will be deemed to have exhausted his or her administrative remedies if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions laid out in foia.a c i.put simply,if an agency does not respond to a request within twenty working days after receiving it,the requester may typically commence litigation.citizens for responsibility ethics in fec,wl,at.this court has flatly stated that even if a request may have been burdensome to the agency or would have to be delayed because of other requests filed earlier,the constructive exhaustion provision still applies.pollack,at.here,the dea inaction on remand triggered constructive exhaustion of coleman administrative remedies and allowed him to proceed directly to court.
it is beyond question that both the dea and the oip failed to comply with the applicable time limits that governed coleman initial request and appeal.see a a.coleman first submitted his request on february,and the dea did not act on it for one year,four months,and ten days following receipt exceeding foia time limit many times over.coleman appealed the decision on july,and the oip did not act on it for seven months and eleven days following receipt also exceeding foia time limit many times over.after each agency exceeded its statutory deadline,coleman was free to seek judicial relief.see,id.a c i citizens for responsibility,wl,at.however,before this litigation began,the dea eventually did respond to coleman initial request,and the oip eventually did act on his appeal,thereby precluding him from relying on constructive exhaustion with respect to those submissions.see pollack,at see also oglesby dep t of army.
notwithstanding these prior responses,when coleman commenced the instant litigation,he had been waiting for a decision from the dea on remand for nearly five months.although foia does not explicitly contemplate remands following administrative appeals,it is inconceivable that congress intended to allow agencies to escape foia time limits by sitting on remanded requests indefinitely.in setting a time limit for agencies to respond to initial requests and establishing constructive exhaustion as a means to enforce that limit,congress expressed a clear intent to ensure that foia requests receive prompt attention from the applicable agencies.a request upon remand is still a request,and we therefore conclude that it,too,must be acted upon within twenty working days,pursuant to a a i.
whether the clock began ticking on the date the dea received the remand from the oip or a few weeks later when the agency received coleman resubmitted request,the dea triggered a third foia violation by once again failing to provide coleman with a timely response.the dea did not cure this violation because it did not respond before coleman filed the operative complaint here.it is true that the dea responded to coleman request on remand before the agency filed its answer but after coleman filed his complaint.however,constructive exhaustion applies if an agency has exceeded its statutory deadline,unless the agency responds to the request before suit is filed.pollack,at emphasis added.that the agency responded after the suit began is thus of no moment.we therefore conclude that coleman has constructively exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to the claims made in his request upon remand.
the dea argues,however,that coleman can not rely on constructive exhaustion here because,first,the agency responded to coleman initial request before he filed this lawsuit,dea br.at,and second,even if coleman constructively exhausted the claim that he was a noncommercial requester,he did not exhaust the fee waiver claim because he did not request a waiver until after this litigation had already begun,id.at.we find both of these objections to be without merit.
the dea asserts that once an agency responds to a request,constructive exhaustion is inapplicable and actual exhaustion of administrative remedies is required,regardless of the agency subsequent actions or lack thereof.id.at.but that position does not square with the text of the statute.
foia constructive exhaustion provision applies if an agency fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions of the statute.a c i emphasis added.foia imposes two distinct time limits relevant here one for responding to requests,id.a a i,and one for responding to appeals,id.a a ii.if an agency timely responds to an initial request but fails to make a timely determination with respect to the appeal of that request,it has violated one of the two applicable time limit provisions,and constructive exhaustion can apply.contrary to the dea position,the mere fact that an agency has responded to the initial request does not make constructive exhaustion inapplicable given that subsequent agency inaction following the initial response may mean that the agency has fail ed to comply with the applicable time limit provisions.
accordingly,an agency is not immune from the limit simply because it has already rejected a request once and has been forced to reconsider it on remand.the dea failure to reprocess coleman renewed request on remand in anything like a timely fashion violated the statutory time limit and thus triggered constructive exhaustion,notwithstanding the fact that the agency had already responded to the initial request more than a year earlier.the irony of the dea position is especially apparent here,where it contends that its belated and dilatory initial response gives it a free pass for all time.
the dea next contends that,even if coleman exhausted his claim that he was a noncommercial requester,he did not exhaust his claim because he did not request a waiver until after this litigation had commenced.while the dea may be correct that a plaintiff can exhaust administrative remedies with respect to one issue in a foia dispute but not another,see dettmann dep t of justice,to conclude,as the district court did,that coleman exhausted his remedies only with respect to the distinction and not with respect to the fee waiver question both chops this case too finely and overlooks the substance of coleman administrative correspondence.
despite the dea quibbles about exactly what coleman requested from the agency and when he did so,the administrative claims he raised regarding his eligibility for noncommercial fee status and his eligibility for a fee waiver all address the same core question,namely how coleman request should be treated under foia fee assessment scheme.the dea would create a rule under which a foia requester must make distinct arguments addressing every individual component of an adverse fee determination before obtaining judicial review of that determination.however,holding an ordinary citizen seeking to learn about the basic workings of a federal agency to such an exacting standard would impose a burden not authorized by foia and would frustrate the statute purpose of assur ing the availability of government information necessary to an informed electorate,at.while a foia requester can not exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to an issue if not a word was said about it,dettmann,at,a requester need not provide the agency with every nuance and detail of a particular claim before exhaustion can be found.
even were we to require a foia requester to explicitly challenge each and every component of an allegedly erroneous fee assessment,coleman would still prevail because he did,in fact,address both his noncommercial fee status and his fee waiver eligibility.on july,coleman sought oip review of what he described as his misidentification by dea as a commercial requester and dea erroneous fee estimate used,in effect,to deny his foia request.he asked that fees that otherwise might be required to fulfill his request be waived in full because of the stated errors and excessive delay in unlawfully denying him access to the requested information.id.moreover,coleman indicated that he was eligible to request a fee waiver,either by asserting that disclosure was in the public interest or that he was entitled to a waiver in his capacity as a freelance journalist.these statements were before the dea on remand because the agency received coleman oip appeal with the oip remand decision.
out of an abundance of caution,coleman resubmitted his request to the dea following the reman
