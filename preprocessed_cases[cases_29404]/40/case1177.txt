the supreme court held in deshaney winnebago county department of social services,d,that,i n the substantive due process analysis,it is the state affirmative act of restraining the individual freedom to act on his own incarceration,institutionalization,or other similar restraint of personal is the deprivation of liberty triggering the protections of the due process clause.id.at.the crux of the case before us is whether a mere assurance can be an affirmative restraint of personal liberty similar to incarceration or institutionalization.id.we hold that it can not.therefore,the plaintiff can not proceed under the danger theory of liability derived from the supreme court decision in deshaney,and we will reverse the district court denial of summary judgment.to do otherwise would take the danger doctrine beyond its precedential and constitutional origins.
background 
the facts of this case present a tragic story.zi ye visited ikjin kim six times,from february,to march,at philadelphia district health care center.kim diagnosed ye with hypertension,coronary artery disease,and angina.he prescribed a combination of sublingual nitroglycerine,procardia,and lipitor.ye and his son,ken ye,visited kim office on march.ye,through his son,complained of shortness of breath,coughing,and discomfort in his upper body area.ken ye later testified that kim told ye that there is nothing to worry about and that he is fine.kim gave ye a prescription for cough medication and told him to return in three months.ye had visited his prior physician,tuan on february.
ken ye visited his father at home later that day and found him unconscious.ye was taken to frankfort hospital in an ambulance.doctors at the hospital determined that ye was suffering from congestive heart failure and had experienced a myocardial infarction.ye received emergency bypass surgery.he nevertheless suffered respiratory failure and polyneuropathy,a degenerative nerve condition.ye was hospitalized for a month and then transferred to a skilled nursing care center.he has since been hospitalized for acute care several times and remains on a ventilator.
ken ye testified that his family did not seek emergency medical assistance for ye after leaving kim office because they rel ied upon kim assurances to us that there was nothing to worry about and that my father was fine.ken ye also stated that,i f on march,kim had not assured us that my father was fine and that there was nothing wrong,i would have immediately taken my father to the emergency room.
both experts presented by ye described kim conduct as a professional outrage,and unconscionable.they agreed that kim should have obtained complete cardiac workups in light of ye risk factors and prior history of coronary artery disease.they also testified that kim should have immediately hospitalized ye for emergency medical care upon observing bilateral pitting edema,or swelling.they further concurred that ye later complications would have been avoided by immediate emergency medical care.
ye filed a variety of claims against kim and his employers including the united states of america,including a claim under,in the eastern district of pennsylvania on march.ye and the united states of america subsequently stipulated to the dismissal of the united states and the department of justice as parties.kim and the remaining defendants filed for summary judgment on october.during summary judgment proceedings,ye abandoned all claims except his danger claim under.kim argued that he had committed no constitutional tort and raised the affirmative defense of qualified immunity,as he was acting in his capacity as a doctor at district health care center.the district court granted summary judgment for kim remaining employers due to a lack of causation.however,the district court denied kim motion,holding that a reasonable jury could conclude that the elements of a danger were met and that qualified immunity was not available.
we have jurisdiction over this appeal of an interlocutory order as a denial of qualified immunity that turns on an issue of than a factual appealable as a collateral order under.doe groody,cir.the district court had jurisdiction over the claim made pursuant to under.we review the grant or denial of summary judgment de novo.see union pacific greentree trans.trucking,cir.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the court must draw all reasonable inferences in the manner most favorable to the party.see celotex catrett,d.
ii.discussion 
there is no affirmative right to governmental aid or protection under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.deshaney,at.the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment provides that n o state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.nothing in the language of the due process clause itself requires the state to protect its citizens life,liberty,or property from private harms.see deshaney,at,d.the due process clause prevents the government from abusing its power or using it as an instrument of oppression.davidson cannon,d.the supreme court has long recognized that the constitution generally confers no affirmative right to governmental aid,even where such aid may be necessary to secure life,liberty,or property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual.deshaney,at,d see,harris mcrae,d holding that the state has no obligation to fund abortions or other medical services lindsey normet,d holding that the state has no obligation to provide adequate housing.the constitution protects people from the government,not from each other or from themselves.
there are,however,two exceptions to this rule the special relationship exception and the danger exception.ye argues that kim is liable for his mistaken assurances under the danger theory of liability.
the danger exception originates from the deshaney court statement that while the state may have been aware of the dangers that joshua faced in the free world,it played no part in their creation,nor did it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them.deshaney,at.many courts have explained the danger exception by echoing judge posner comments in bowers devito,cir.judge posner described the constitution as a charter of negative liberties,which tells the state to let people alone,and does not prescribe affirmative duties to provide services,even so elementary a service as maintaining law and order.id.at.however,even with this view,he conceded that a different result obtains where the state crosses the line from inaction to action 
we do not want to pretend that the line between action and inaction,between inflicting and failing to prevent the infliction of harm,is clearer than it is.if the state puts a man in a position of danger from private persons and then fails to protect him,it will not be heard to say that its role was merely passive it is as much an active tortfeasor as if it had thrown him into a snake pit.
the third circuit first allowed a claim under the danger theory of liability in kneipp tedder,cir.quoting deshaney,the kneipp court concluded that when the harm incurred is a direct result of state action,liability can attach under.we have refined the kneipp test in subsequent cases.see rivas city of passaic,cir ambro,concurring noting the changes and stating that i n light of these substantial modifications to the kneipp test,kneipp as shorthand is a misnomer.notably,the test no longer requires that a crime be committed by a.as judge ambro noted in his concurrence in rivas the fourth element reference to a third party crime arises from the doctrine origin as an exception to the general rule that the state does not have a general affirmative obligation to protect its citizens from the violent acts of private individuals.the courts,however,have not limited the doctrine to cases where third parties caused the harm.id.at internal quotation omitted see also estate of smith marasco smith i,cir.
this court considered the necessary elements of a danger in bright westmoreland county,cir.the bright panel considered kneipp and its progeny and clarified the four part danger test.it instructed that the four elements are 
the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable and fairly direct 
a state actor acted with a degree of culpability that shocks the conscience 
a relationship between the state and the plaintiff existed such that the plaintiff was a foreseeable victim of the defendant acts,or a member of a discrete class of persons subjected to the potential harm brought about by the state actions,as opposed to a member of the public in general and 
a state actor affirmatively used his or her authority in a way that created a danger to the citizen or that rendered the citizen more vulnerable to danger than had the state not acted at all.
id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the majority noted that the addition of the word affirmatively to the fourth element was not an merely a recognition that both deshaney and this court precedents explicitly required an affirmative act,rather than inaction.id.at citing middle bucks area vocational tech,cir en banc liability under the danger theory is predicated upon the state affirmative acts which work to the plaintiff detriment in terms of exposure to danger.brown grabowski,cir noting that deshaney holds that a state failure to take affirmative action to protect a victim from the actions of a third party will not,in the absence of a custodial relationship support a civil rights claim.
the first question in determining whether kim should receive the protection of qualified immunity is whether he violated ye constitutional this case,whether his actions constituted a violation of the substantive component of the due process clause via the danger exception.see saucier katz,d.kim concedes that the first three elements of a danger claim are satisfied the bright panel noted that the fourth element can be broken down into its parts and analyzed accordingly.bright,at see also laura oren,safari into the snake pit the state created danger doctrine,mary bill rts.the three necessary conditions to satisfy the fourth element of a danger claim are that a state actor exercised his or her authority,the state actor took an affirmative action,and this act created a danger to the citizen or rendered the citizen more vulnerable to danger than if the state had not acted at all.bright,at.
did a state actor exercise his or her authority 
we have never squarely considered the meaning of the term authority within the context of the danger doctrine.nevertheless,kim urges us to give definition to this section of the fourth bright element in an effort to bar ye claim.
kim argues that dicta from this court decision in mark borough of hatboro,cir,dictates that a plaintiff can make out a danger claim only where a state actor has exercised power that is uniquely within the province of the state.the mark court observed that t he cases where the danger theory was applied were based on discrete,grossly reckless acts committed by the state or state actors using their peculiar positions as state actors.id.emphasis added.however,this language was mere dicta and was applied to a volunteer firefighter who had committed arson,thus acting well outside the scope of his authority.nevertheless,kim argues that because the power he exercised,the ability to give medical advice or to serve as a doctor,was not unique to state actors,this component of the danger claim can not be satisfied.
this court has never imposed such a requirement on danger claims.although we cited mark extensively in bright for its discussion of the fourth element of a danger claim,we made no reference to a requirement that the affirmative action be one that is solely within the province of the state.see bright,at.this court decision in rivas city of passaic,cir,counsels even more strongly against imposing such a requirement.in rivas,emergency medical technicians emts were summoned to assist a man apparently experiencing an epileptic seizure.id.at.the emts summoned police to the scene,indicated that rivas had attacked them,but did not inform them that they believed him to be epileptic.id.they also did not communicate their knowledge that placing rivas in restraints could be fatal.id.at.rivas died of asphyxiation.id.at.his representatives brought a action under the danger theory of liability.id.at.the rivas court dealt with the fourth element of a state created danger claim in a single paragraph,focusing entirely on whether a reasonable could conclude that the emts had increased rivas exposure to harm.id.at.
indeed,it is difficult to ascertain how ye theory of the authority requirement comports with our decision in rivas.at.the coercive and custodial functions at issue in most danger cases are powers only the state may legitimately exercise.however,the emts critical affirmative act was to call the action that any private citizen can legitimately take.kim attempts to distinguish rivas by arguing that emergency medical care is uniquely within the province of the state.however,much of the country emergency medical services are now provided by private companies even if we were to conclude that emergency medical care were traditionally the province of the state,that argument would apply with equal force to medical care for the indigent.
however,there is no indication in our jurisprudence or in its supreme court antecedents that there exists an independent requirement that the authority exercised must be peculiarly within the province of the state.the authority language is simply a reflection of the state actor requirement for all claims.
did the state actor take an affirmative action 
kim argues that an assurance or misrepresentation,without more,can not constitute an affirmative act for purposes of the danger inquiry.this court has never expressly addressed this issue.we hold that a mere assurance can not form the basis of a danger claim.
this court rejected a similar claim in bright.at.a police officer assured bright approximately three weeks before annette death that koschalk would be arrested and in reliance upon these assurances,bright failed to take defensive actions,such as leaving the area with his family,hence creating the opportunity for the damages ultimately sustained.id.internal quotes omitted.the bright court stated that,even assuming this account of causation was accurate,s danger liability can not be predicated on these facts.id.we concluded that,bright does not,and can not,claim that the state in any way restricted his freedom to act on his family own behalf,and invoked the deshaney court holding that,under these circumstances,no affirmative duty to protect arises from the state expressions of intent to help.id.citing deshaney,at.internal quotes omitted.the police officer assurance that someone would be arrested,an action then not taken,could not constitute an affirmative action.
the bright decision reflects the concerns that animated the supreme court decision in deshaney.the court observed that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment was intended to prevent government from abusing its power,or employing it as an instrument of oppression.at.citing davidson cannon,d internal quotes omitted see also parratt taylor,d powell,concurring in result it would make no sense to open the federal courts to lawsuits where there has been no affirmative abuse of power.speaking of the special relationship exception,the deshaney court stated that the affirmative duty to protect arises not from the state knowledge of the individual predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him,but from the limitation which it has imposed on his freedom to act.at.the court further observed that,i n the substantive due process analysis,it is the state affirmative act of restraining the individual freedom to act on his own incarceration,institutionalization,or other similar restraint of personal is the deprivation of liberty triggering the protections of the due process clause.id.
we applied this injunction by the deshaney court that the substantive component of the due process clause must be predicated on an affirmative act that works a deprivation of liberty when we observed in bright that danger liability could not lie because the state did not restrict hi
