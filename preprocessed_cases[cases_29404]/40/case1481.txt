this case concerns the ownership of papers from the administrations of two governors of south carolina during the civil war.thomas law willcox sued in united states bankruptcy court for a declaratory judgment that the papers were part of his estate.defendant south carolina contends that the papers are public property.the bankruptcy court held for the state.the district court reversed,holding that the state failed to establish that the papers constituted public property under south carolina law of the civil war era.because the long possession of the papers by the willcox family creates a presumption of ownership in their favor and the state has adduced insufficient evidence to defeat this presumption,we affirm.
the is thomas law willcox willcox,a south carolina resident whose family has lived in the state for many years.the defendants are rodger stroup,director of the south carolina department of archives and history,and the state of south carolina collectively state.willcox ownership claims against two other defendants,his sister kathryn willcox patterson and cousin john willcox,await the outcome of this proceeding.
at issue in this case are approximately documents from the administrations of south carolina governors francis pickens and milledge bonham.as the district court described them,the documents,which date from between december and august,concern confederate military reports,correspondence,and telegrams between various confederate generals,officers,servicemen,and government officials,and related materials.the documents also address a wide variety of official duties of the governor during that time period t he court adopts the bankruptcy court finding of fact that the documents are properly described as governor records relating to matters of military significance,police powers,as well as to other duties of the governors during the relevant time period.the collection has been appraised at million.
willcox found the papers in or in a shopping bag in a closet at his late stepmother home.after finding the papers,willcox sold a few of them to various individuals and gave two to his wife.in may,willcox scheduled an auction for august,to sell the remaining documents.the auctioneer publicized the upcoming sale and was contacted by defendant stroup,who sought permission to microfilm the papers for the state archives prior to auction.willcox authorized the copying,and the papers were microfilmed.on the day before the auction,august,stroup and the attorney general office for the state of south carolina obtained a temporary restraining order in state court enjoining the sale of the papers.
on august,willcox filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court of the district of south carolina.willcox then filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court seeking a declaratory judgment that the papers were property of the bankruptcy estate.after a bench trial,the bankruptcy court held the state to be the owner of the papers under south carolina law.the district court reversed.
regarding the papers history,the bankruptcy and district courts found,and we adopt,the following facts.the papers seem to have come into willcox family through his,confederate major general evander mciver law,who most likely came into possession of them during the february attack on the south carolina capital by union general william tecumseh sherman.on february,in anticipation of imminent attack,governor magrath declared martial law in columbia and appointed general law the provost marshal of the city.on february,a large number of state archives and records were removed from columbia for safekeeping.on february,general law was relieved of his duties as provost marshal,and general sherman took control of columbia.the parties submit no direct evidence of how general law came into possession of the papers,nor is there any suggestion that he did so illegally.
on february,general law wrote a letter to a new york book dealer regarding the sale of some letters which,both parties agree,appear to belong to the collection at issue here.by the,annie storm,the granddaughter of general law,was in possession of the papers and attempted to sell them to both the university of north carolina at chapel hill unc and the south caroliniana library of the university of south carolina.storm described the documents as original state house papers entrusted to her grandfather at the time of the surrender.no sale resulted,but the papers were placed on microfilm at the southern historical collection at unc.
no evidence has been submitted of the papers movements between the time of the storm correspondence and plaintiff willcox discovery more than fifty years later.the point for present purposes is simply that,while the precise route by which civil gubernatorial papers arrived in a shopping bag in thomas law willcox stepmother closet remains a mystery,it appears that the papers have been in the possession of the law and willcox families for over one hundred and forty years.

the exceptional nature of the papers in early vintage,their unknown issues distinct from those of the typical personal property case.without the benefit of clear chain of title,evidence of original ownership,eyewitness testimony,and any number of documentary aids usually helpful in the determination of ownership,the court must utilize the legal tools that remain at its disposal.in this situation,tenets of the common law that usually remain in the background of ownership determinations come to the forefront,their logic and utility revealed anew.
that possession is of the law is a truism hardly bearing repetition.statements to this effect have existed almost as long as the common law itself.see oxford english dictionary draft citing a collection of adages for possession is nine points in the law.see also frederick pollock robert samuel wright,an essay on possession in the common law i n the eyes of medieval lawyers possession largely usurped not only the substance but the name of property.
the importance of possession gave rise to the principle that p ossession of property is indicia of ownership,and a rebuttable presumption exists that those in possession of property are rightly in possession.property.the common law has long recognized that actual possession is,prima facie,evidence of a legal title in the possessor.william blackstone,commentaries.see,edward coke,commentary upon littleton.ed.strong presumption of ownership created by continuall and quiet possession jeffries great ry.eng.t he presumption of law is that the person who has possession has the property.
this presumption has been a feature of american law almost since its inception.undoubtedly,noted the supreme court,if a person be found in possession it is prima facie evidence of his ownership.ricard williams,wheat.almost eighty years later,the court reaffirmed,if there be no evidence to the contrary,proof of possession,at least under a color of right,is sufficient proof of title.bradshaw ashley.see also,oliver wendell holmes,the common law the consequences attached to possession are substantially those attached to ownership,subject to the question of the continuance of possessory rights.
in south carolina law,too,it is well established that,absent evidence of superior title,t he law ever presumes in favor of possession,for possession alone is prima facie evidence of a good title.gourdin theus,brev.see,stephenson fin.wingard ex parte dort,jackson frier,thompson chapman.in this case,the possession of the law and willcox families triggers the presumption of their ownership of the papers.
the presumption of possession is not confined to the early nineteenth century,nor is it confined to examples of early americana.rather,it applies across the law of personal property.see,nesbitt lewis,ownership of dog hammond halsey,ownership of cannon clanton auto auction sales,harvin,ownership of automobile.the
