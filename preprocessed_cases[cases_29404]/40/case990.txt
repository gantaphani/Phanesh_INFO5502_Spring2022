gregory meditz meditz,an attorney proceeding pro se,appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the city of newark newark on his claim of disparate impact and his motion to an exhibit attached to newark reply brief.meditz alleges that the residency requirement adopted by newark for its work force has a disparate impact on white,because newark population does not reflect the racial of the relevant labor market in the surrounding area.as a result,white,are in newark work force.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the grant of summary judgment on the disparate impact claim was not appropriate based on this record.we will therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
in april,meditz,a white male,applied for the position of housing development analyst in newark.he was rejected in july because,at the time,he lived in rutherford,new jersey newark has a residency requirement for employees in light of the waiver provisions in the ordinance,reside outside of newark,in different municipalities,including some in other states.uniformed employees must reside in newark during their preliminary training,but then can move out of the city.
in support of his prima facie case,meditz provided detailed statistical information in opposition to newark motion for summary judgment.meditz obtained the statistical information from publicly available reports.newark does not dispute the validity of any of the statistics meditz presented.these statistics compared the ethnic distribution of employees to the ethnic makeup of newark meditz argued that the difference between the percentages of white,and uniformed employees was based on the residency requirement for employees.that is,meditz posited that the residency requirement for employees was negatively impacting the hiring of white.
newark argues that the statistics presented by meditz do not support his prima facie case,since the statistical disparities are not sufficiently substantial as to show that the residency ordinance has caused whites of origin to be excluded from jobs with newark because of their race.br.of def appellee city of newark.
alleging that the relevant labor market was the six county area surrounding newark,meditz also provided the ethnic breakdown of the general population in the surrounding counties,all of which included higher percentages of white,than were employed as employees in newark he included more specific data addressing the ethnic composition of government and the private labor in each of the surrounding counties.the percentage of white,in these positions greatly exceeded the number of white,in newark work force.meditz also provided employment statistics for essex county governmental employees.essex county has its county seat in newark,and the composition of the essex county and newark workforces are comparable with regard to skill level and job function.of the county workforce,is white,according to the eeo report.meditz argued that the lower percentage of white,employees in newark was caused by the residency requirement,and that absent a residency requirement,significantly more white,would be employed by newark.as a result,meditz concluded that newark residency requirement disparately impacted him as a white,who was denied a job with newark.
the district court granted newark motion for summary judgment,concluding that meditz failed to prove his prima facie case.that is,based on the statistical evidence meditz presented,the district court concluded that these statistics,standing alone,do not constitute sufficient evidence of a significantly discriminatory hiring pattern.in re meditz city of newark,wl,at.the district court further concluded that there was no need to look beyond newark borders to define the relevant labor market,since newark is new jersey largest city with over residents,of whom are white.given its diversity and large population,there is no need to redefine the relevant labor market past city limits for purposes of title vii analysis.id.at.we disagree with both conclusions of the district court.

iii.analysis 
meditz claims that newark residency requirement for employees has a disparate impact on white,in violation of title vii.in support of his claim,he cites evidence of the relatively low percentage of white,in newark work force.the statistics he provides demonstrate that the percentage of white,in newark work force is lower than the percentage that would be anticipated based on the percentage of white,in the population of the relevant labor market.
title vii makes it unlawful to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.the supreme court has long recognized that title vii plaintiffs can make out a viable employment discrimination claim without alleging or proving discriminatory intent.see griggs duke power.under title vii,practices,procedures,or tests neutral on their face,and even neutral in terms of intent,can not be maintained if they operate to freeze the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices.griggs,at.
the supreme court announced that these disparate impact cases should proceed in two steps the plaintiff must prove that the challenged policy discriminates against members of a protected class,and then the defendant can overcome the showing of disparate impact by proving a manifest relationship between the policy and job performance.this second step came to be known as the business necessity defense,and it serves as an employer only means of defeating a title vii claim when its employment policy has a discriminatory effect.el septa,cir footnotes omitted.t he successful assertion of the business necessity defense is not an ironclad shield rather,the plaintiff can overcome it by showing that an alternative policy exists that would serve the employer legitimate goals as well as the challenged policy with less of a discriminatory effect.id.at.
thus,i n order to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination,a plaintiff is required to demonstrate that application of a facially neutral standard has resulted in a significantly discriminatory hiring pattern.harrison,cir citing dothard rawlinson.the evidence in these disparate impact cases usually focuses on statistical disparities.watson fort worth bank and trust.a comparison between the racial composition of those qualified persons in the relevant labor market and that of those in the jobs at issue typically forms the proper basis for the initial inquiry in a disparate impact case.harrison,at quoting wards cove packing,atonio,superceded by statute on other grounds.
the supreme court has noted in several cases that statistics may serve to establish plaintiff prima facie case.see,watson,at hazelwood school dist.united states.that is,w here gross statistical disparities can be shown,they alone may in a proper case constitute prima facie proof of a pattern or practice of discrimination.hazelwood,at.but,o nce the employment practice at issue has been identified,causation must be proved that is,the plaintiff must offer statistical evidence of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the exclusion of applicants for jobs or promotions because of their membership in a protected group.our formulations,which have never been framed in terms of any rigid mathematical formula,have consistently stressed that statistical disparities must be sufficiently substantial that they raise such an inference of causation.watson.see also green usx,cir observing that t he supreme court held that the plaintiff may not make out a prima facie discrimination case simply by showing a bottom line racial imbalance in the work force,or by identifying a number of allegedly discriminatory employment practices.instead,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the racial disparity is the result of one or more of the employment practices that they are attacking,specifically showing that each challenged practice has a significantly disparate impact on employment opportunities for whites and nonwhites.quoting wards cove,at.
however,a key factor in assessing the statistics is ensuring that the court is using the correct basis for comparison.that is,w hat the hiring figures prove obviously depends upon the figures to which they are compared.hazelwood,at to use the vernacular,we can not compare apples to oranges.in hazelwood,that was essentially what the district court did it compared the percentage of minority teachers to the percentage of minority students,rather than comparing the percentage of minority teachers in the hazelwood school district to the percentage of minority teachers in the relevant labor market.the supreme court directed the district court,on remand,to evaluate the parameters of the appropriate relevant labor market,including whether it should or should not include the city of louis.the court,after discussing statistical methodology,commented that those observations are not intended to suggest that precise calculations of statistical significance are necessary in employing statistical proof,but merely to highlight the importance of the choice of the relevant labor market area.id.at.
similarly,we have addressed the question of what constitutes the relevant labor market.in harrison,the third circuit examined harrison employment related residency requirement,and that policy impact on the city ability to hire minorities.given that the city of harrison had a very small minority population,limiting hiring to city residents almost assured having no minority employees.however,that fact alone was insufficient to establish plaintiff prima facie case.in harrison,we approved the district court methodology for defining the relevant labor market.the factors included geographical location,flow of transportation facilities,locations from which private employers in harrison draw their work force,and commuting patterns.at.
here,in support of his prima facie case,meditz offered statistical evidence showing that the percentage of white,employed by newark was lower than the percentage of white,in the general population of newark.meditz also offered statistics showing the percentage of white,in surrounding areas,both for the general population and for the private and government work forces.finally,meditz offered evidence of the percentage of white,employed by the essex county government in newark.out of all of these percentages,the lowest was the percentage of white,employed by the city of newark.this compilation of statistics supported meditz claim that white,were in newark work force.
the supreme court has set forth standards to be used as a basis for evaluating statistical evidence in disparate impact claims.relying on the statistical standards developed in jury analysis cases,the supreme court suggested that fluctuation of more than two or three standard deviations would undercut the hypothesis that decisions were being made randomly with respect to race.hazelwood,at assuming for the moment that the district court was correct and the relevant labor market is the population of the city of newark,the difference between the two percentages is slightly over six standard deviations,far in excess of the supreme court suggested standard of two or three standard deviations this difference appears to establish a prima facie case 
despite this statistical evidence,the district court concluded that meditz failed to prove his prima facie case because the difference between the percentage of white,employed by the city compared to the percentage of white,living in the city,did not constitute sufficient evidence of a significantly discriminatory hiring pattern.meditz,wl,at.given this bald conclusion,it is not clear what methodology or statistical analysis the district court employed.notably,the district court made no reference to the standard deviation analysis recommended by the supreme court.
before the district court can reach the statistical analysis,it must make a determination as to the parameters of the relevant labor market.see hazelwood,at.in conducting this analysis,the district court should consider the factors set forth in harrison,including geographical location,flow of transportation facilities,locations from which private employers draw their workforce,and commuting patterns harrison,at.
in harrison,this court concluded that the factors considered by the district court in determining what geographical area constituted the relevant labor market were reasonable.at.the district court here focused on the fact that the population of harrison,at the time of this court decision in that case,included few blacks,and harrison employed no blacks.by comparison,according to the district court here,the fact that newark employed white,far more than harrison employment of zero blacks,sufficed to demonstrate a lack of discrimination.
the district court misinterpreted harrison.rather than reading harrison as setting forth appropriate criteria to consider in determining the relevant labor market,the district court read harrison to stand for the proposition that the only reason to look outside the city limits is a lack of minorities within the city.
we will remand so that the district court can determine the relevant labor market,relying on the criteria set forth in harrison,and then conduct a complete and correct statistical analysis comparing the makeup of newark labor force with the similarly skilled labor force in the relevant labor market.
to the extent the district court concluded that,even if meditz established a prima facie claim of disparate impact,newark is still entitled to summary judgment because the city has met the requirements of the business necessity defense,we further reverse the court on this point.we agree with meditz that the district court applied the incorrect standard.
the district court focused only on whether the business justifications offered by newark had any connection to the residency policy even if unrelated to meditz ability to perform the job in question.the district court mistakenly relied on this court opinion in harrison that in turn relied on the supreme court definition of business justification in wards cove.the civil rights act of abrogated the decision in wards cove,and returned the business necessity defense to the standard that existed prior to the date of the decision in wards cove,el,at.
since the enactment of the civil rights act of,we have not had the occasion to consider the business necessity defense in a case involving a challenge to an employment related residency requirement.however,in el,we carefully considered the evolution of the business necessity defense,and concluded that hiring criteria must effectively measure the minimum qualifications for successful performance of the job in question.this holding reflects the rejection of criteria that are overbroad or merely general,unsophisticated measures of a legitima
