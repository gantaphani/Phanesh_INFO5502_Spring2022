opinion of the court 
we decide whether the town of elsmere,delaware,violated elsmere park club procedural due process rights under the fourteenth amendment to our constitution when the town condemned the club apartment complex without offering a predeprivation hearing.we hold that the town did not run afoul of the constitution because postdeprivation process was all that was required given the circumstances of this case.because the town provided adequate postdeprivation process by way of an administrative appeal,and the club failed to avail itself of that process,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment against the club.
the club is the former owner of the elsmere park apartments apartments.the apartments are a complex of buildings,arranged in nine separate groups.they contain a total of apartments,including one basement unit in each of the buildings.after severe flooding from hurricane hugo in,the town prohibited the club from renting out its basement apartments,but allowed continued use of the units.the club then boarded up the basement apartments with plywood.in,after increasing incidents of vandalism,the town instructed the club to brick over the basement windows and seal the basement apartments.
all was relatively quiet between the town and the club between and.then,on tuesday,october,while conducting a routine inspection of the apartments,the town code inspector,ellis blomquist,detected a strong smell of mold.blomquist returned to the apartments on friday,october,with kenneth belmont,a representative from the state of delaware department of public health.they inspected two of the sealed basement units and found mold,water leaks,and raw sewage,amounting to various violations of the elsmere town building code.after observing the mold,blomquist and belmont sought the advice of gerald llewellyn,chief toxicologist for the state of delaware.llewellyn concluded that the conditions in the basements posed a serious health threat to the buildings residents due to what he saw as the likelihood that mold spores were migrating up to the occupied units through openings such as pipe chases and ventilation ducts.together,llewellyn and belmont recommended that the two buildings be condemned and vacated immediately.blomquist agreed,and,after informing the apartment manager darlene groki of his decision,proceeded to condemn the buildings and vacate the residents.
on monday,october,the inspections of the basements resumed blomquist,belmont,llewellyn and george yocher,an environmental epidemiologist for the state of delaware,proceeded to go through the remaining basements,along with several stairways and some unoccupied apartments,condemning each building they inspected.by thursday,october,every building except the one housing the complex rental management office had been condemned.it appears that no time in the town inspection did it examine any occupied apartments,and the record does not note what category of mold was present in the basements.
as the condemnations were occurring,the club filed a motion for a temporary restraining order in the delaware court of chancery,asserting,inter alia,that the town had effected an unconstitutional taking by condemning the buildings without compensating the club.after a hearing,the chancery court denied relief.in so holding,the court found that the town had been justified in invoking its emergency powers to condemn the property 
at the end of october,the club notified the town that it intended to appeal the condemnation of the apartments.it sent a letter to the town asking for a hearing before the board of building appeals,which was listed in the elsmere town code as the appropriate body for hearing such appeals.in correspondence with the town solicitor,the club was told that the town actually referred to its appellate body as the board of adjustment.the town solicitor explained that the board of building appeals reference came from a code section that had been borrowed from the national building code and incorporated into the town code without being adjusted to reflect the town particular usage.in january,the club and the town solicitor executed an agreement to stay the club administrative appeal,and the club,by its own admission,abandoned its administrative appeal.club br.in april,the club sold the apartments at a price.
a year and a half later,the club brought an action under in the united states district court for the district of delaware against the town and several of its agents.in its complaint,the club alleged that the town deprived it of due process when the town condemned and evacuated the apartments without first affording the club the opportunity for a hearing or the chance to cure the alleged code violations.the town later filed a motion for summary judgment,asserting that exigent circumstances justified its failure to give the club a predeprivation hearing and that the club had failed to avail itself of the town postdeprivation procedure.
the district court concluded that the town failed to present sufficient evidence of exigent circumstances to justify the absence of any due process rights.elsmere park club,town of elsmere,d.the court found it significant that blomquist and other town representatives made the decision to condemn the apartments without first inspecting any of the occupied units or taking air samples.id.moreover,it noted that the record contains no evidence that any residents actually complained of,or suffered from,ailments or conditions in their units.id.as such,the court concluded that town had violated the club due process rights in not offering a predeprivation opportunity to oppose the condemnation.id.at.
despite having found a procedural due process violation,the court went on to conclude that the club was ineligible for relief because it had failed to avail itself of the town postdeprivation hearing procedure.id.at citing alvin suzuki,cir,for the proposition that a plaintiff alleging a procedural due process violation must have taken advantage of all available local process in order to claim a constitutional injury.it therefore entered summary judgment in favor of the town.elsmere,d at.the club appeals.

iii.analysis 
the club contends that the town violated its rights to procedural due process in two ways first,in failing to provide a hearing before condemning the apartments,and,second,in offering what the club argues were inadequate means for challenging the condemnations after they occurred.
the fourteenth amendment prohibits a state from depriv ing any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law const.amend.xiv.a fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard.armstrong manzo,d internal quotation marks omitted.that opportunity must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.id.in the typical situation,the hearing should come before the government deprives a person of his property.this makes practical sense,f or when a person has an opportunity to speak up in his own defense,and when the state must listen to what he has to say,substantively unfair and simply mistaken deprivations of property interests can be prevented.fuentes shevin,d.
nonetheless,the supreme court has held that,in special circumstances,a state may satisfy the requirements of procedural due process merely by making available some meaningful means by which to assess the propriety of the state action at some time after the initial taking.parratt taylor,d.where there is the necessity of quick action by the state,or where providing any meaningful predeprivation process would be impractical,the government is relieved of the usual obligation to provide a predeprivation hearing.id.
our first task,then,is to determine whether the town was faced with circumstances in which it was required to provide a predeprivation hearing.if so,then no amount of postdeprivation process could cure the town initial failure to provide a hearing see zinermon burch,d in situations where the state feasibly can provide a predeprivation hearing before taking property,it generally must do so regardless of the adequacy of a postdeprivation tort remedy to compensate for the taking.alvin suzuki,cir i f the constitution requires procedures,the most thorough and fair hearing can not undo the failure to provide such procedures.if,on the other hand,the town was faced with such exceptional circumstances that no predeprivation hearing was required,then the question becomes whether it made adequate postdeprivation procedures available to the club.parratt,at.
was a predeprivation hearing required 
it is beyond question that summary administrative action may be justified in emergency situations.hodel.surface mining recl.ass n,d see also herwins city of revere,cir no one can seriously doubt that emergency conditions may exist,a severe fire hazard that would warrant a peremptory shutdown of a residential building.the club,however,is not disputing that,where there is a threat to public health or safety requiring prompt action,the government may act quickly to eliminate that threat.rather,the club argues that the mold situation did not amount to an emergency,and that,regardless,the town did not conduct a thorough enough investigation at the time to justify its belief that emergency action was warranted.
to assess this argument,we ask what sort of scrutiny we should apply to an official decision that emergency action is required.other courts of appeals have held that such decisions must be analyzed very deferentially.see catanzaro weiden,cir herwins,at harris city of akron,cir.this makes basic sense.as the court of appeals for the second circuit has explained 
the law should not discourage officials from taking prompt action to insure the public safety.by subjecting a decision to invoke an emergency procedure to an exacting hindsight analysis,where every mistake,even if made in good faith,becomes a constitutional violation,we encourage delay and thereby potentially increase the public exposure to dangerous conditions.this quandary is exactly what these emergency procedures are designed to prevent,and is the primary reason they are constitutionally acceptable.
catanzaro,at.
yet,it is important to avoid the opposite trap.that is,we can not apply so much deference as to allow the government to avoid affording due process to citizens by arbitrarily invoking emergency procedures.id.accordingly,we adopt the test laid out by our colleagues in the second circuit where there is competent evidence allowing the official to reasonably believe that an emergency does in fact exist,the discretionary invocation of an emergency procedure results in a constitutional violation only where such invocation is arbitrary or amounts to an abuse of discretion.armendariz penman,cir t he rationale for permitting government officials to act summarily in emergency situations does not apply where the officials know no emergency exists,or where they act with reckless disregard of the actual circumstances,vacated in part on other grounds,cir en banc.
thus,in analyzing the town decision to condemn summarily the apartments,we look to whether there was competent evidence supporting the reasonable belief that the mold situation presented an emergency,and to whether the town actions were otherwise arbitrary or an abuse of discretion.we conclude that,under that standard,the town failure to provide a predeprivation hearing did not amount to a constitutional violation.
it is useful to compare the facts here with those presented in catanzaro.there,the city of middletown,new york,used emergency procedures to demolish two privately owned buildings whose shared foundation had been damaged by a car accident.catanzaro,at.the buildings owners argued,as the club does here,that the city had acted rashly,failing both to determine fully whether the crash had affected the buildings structural integrity and to explore less drastic measures of addressing the problem.id.at.the catanzaro court nonetheless concluded that,even were the buildings structurally sound,no reasonable trier of fact could find that the city acted arbitrarily,or otherwise abused its discretion,in deciding to invoke the emergency procedure.id.at.that is because t he undisputed evidence of the damage to the buildings provides ample support for a conclusion that the city had a reasonable belief that the public was in immediate danger.id.
we believe a similar conclusion is warranted here.it is undisputed that the basement apartments were overrun with mold.it is also undisputed that blomquist consulted several state experts who told him that the mold potentially posed a substantial and immediate threat to the health and welfare of the apartments residents.given that,we can not say that the town acted unreasonably in summarily condemning the apartments.it is true that the investigation of the mold situation was far from perfect.we are particularly troubled,as was the district court,by the failure to inspect any of the occupied units to determine whether toxic mold was in fact spreading up from the basements.nonetheless,we are reluctant to second guess the decision to act on an urgent basis.where government officials are faced with a situation in which a failure to act quickly could have serious health consequences,perfection or near perfection is not the standard.given the mold problem in the sealed basement apartments,and the town reliance on the advice of experts,the town actions can not be characterized as arbitrary or an abuse of its discretion.we therefore hold that due process did not require a predeprivation hearing before the town condemned the apartments.
was an adequate postdeprivation remedy provided 
having concluded that a predeprivation hearing was not required,we must nevertheless determine whether the postdeprivation remedy the town offered was adequate.even where exigent circumstances exist,it is still necessary to make available some meaningful means by which to assess the propriety of the state action at some time after the initial taking in order to satisfy the requirements of procedural due process.parratt,at.if an adequate postdeprivation remedy existed,and the club failed to avail itself of it,then we must affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.alvin,at in order to state a claim for failure to provide due process,a plaintiff must have taken advantage of the processes that are available to him or her,unless those processes are unavailable or patently inadequate.
the club concedes that the regulation under which the apartments were condemned did provide for a postdeprivation appeals process.it further concedes that it did not appeal the condemnation decision.club br.however,it argues that it was not required to avail itself of the appeals process because that process was inadequate.more specifically,the club contends that the body to which appeals were required to be board of building not exist.the town responds that it did have a board of of adjudicating the appeal,and,accordingly,the club should have pursued its appeal with the board before bringing a due process claim in federal court.
understanding the relevant code provisions 
to understand what type of postdeprivation relief was available to the club,we must look to the elsmere town code and its legislative history.in lieu of writing its own building codes,the town adopted,with slight modifications,various model codes published by the association of building officials and code administrators known as boca codes.relevant for our purposes is what the town did in adopting significant provisions of the boca national building code and t
