robert sarvis,a political figure in the libertarian party of virginia,brings a constitutional challenge to virginia ballot ordering law.the district court found no merit in sarvis arguments and accordingly dismissed his challenge for failure to state a claim under fed.civ.b.we now affirm.
sarvis attack focuses chiefly upon the ballot ordering law found in virginia code.that law describes the form of ballot to be used in virginia elections.it provides that for elections to federal,statewide,and general assembly offices a candidate shall be identified by the name of his political party or by the term independent.code ann.of principal concern to this case,the law also orders the ballot for elections to these offices in three tiers.
the first tier includes candidates from parties or political parties,which a related section of the code defines as organizations of citizens that received at least percent of the vote for any statewide office filled in either of the two preceding statewide general elections.code ann.in addition,the code provides that any organization seeking party or political party status must also have had a state central committee and an elected state chairman present in virginia for six months prior to any nominee from that organization filing for office.id.the only organizations currently designated parties or political parties under the code are the republican party and the democratic party 
the second tier includes candidates from recognized political parties.for an organization of citizens to be designated a recognized political party under the code,that organization must have had a state central committee present in virginia for six months prior to any nominee from that party filing for office,and the state central committee must be comprised of voters residing in each virginia congressional district.code ann.the organization must also have a duly elected state chairman and secretary as well as a party plan and bylaws.id.the libertarian party of virginia has been designated a recognized political party under the code.
finally,the third tier of the ballot includes i ndependent candidates not associated with political parties or recognized political parties.id.
in addition to delineating the election ballot three tiers,virginia ballot ordering law also specifies how candidates are ordered within the three tiers.in the first two tiers,candidate order is set by lot.importantly,this order is replicated for each office on the ballot,creating party order symmetry across the ballot as a whole.in the third tier,candidate order is alphabetical by surname.id 
in july,just a few months before the november elections,sarvis and others members of the libertarian party of virginia along with the libertarian party of virginia itself and one independent candidate filed a complaint that named as defendants certain members of the virginia state board of elections.the complaint alleged that the ballot ordering law found in virginia code violated their constitutional rights under the first and fourteenth amendments.sarvis and his sought relief from the law prior to the november elections 
in september,the plaintiffs and the commonwealth both determined that the litigation would not be resolved prior to the november elections.but the parties and the district court agreed that,should sarvis and his intend to seek elected office in the future,their case would remain ripe beyond the november elections under the capable of repetition yet evading review doctrine.the plaintiffs thus amended their complaint to reflect their interest in seeking relief from the ballot ordering law with regard to future elections,and the litigation continued on this basis.sarvis in particular alleged that he would be a candidate for national office in virginia in the election.the amended complaint asked that the district court enjoin the law during the statewide elections and the and beyond general elections and issue an order directing the defendants to assign ballot positions to all candidates and parties on a random basis without regard to party status.
shortly thereafter,virginia filed a motion to dismiss under rule b,claiming that the amended complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.the district court granted virginia motion to dismiss in january.sarvis judd,supp.the district court based its decision primarily on the framework established by the supreme court in burdick takushi,and anderson celebrezze.in those decisions,the supreme court held that courts should review first and fourteenth challenges to state election laws by weighing the severity of the burden the challenged law imposes on a person constitutional rights against the importance of the state interests supporting that law.burdick,at anderson,at.
sarvis and his,the commonwealth of virginia,and the district court all agreed that the burden imposed by the ballot ordering law was not severe enough to warrant strict scrutiny.the district court gave two principal reasons for this conclusion.first,the law is politically neutral in that it does not entrench particular political parties in favorable positions on the election ballot.sarvis,supp.at.second,the law does not exclude any prospective candidate from the ballot altogether.id.at.
turning to the question of virginia interests,the district court noted three justifications offered by virginia for the ballot ordering law avoiding voter confusion,creating symmetry,and favoring parties with demonstrated public support.id.at.before assessing the merits of these justifications,however,the district court determined that virginia had described the nature and purpose of the three justifications with sufficient precision.disagreeing with the plaintiffs,the district court held that neither additional factual development of the case nor more concrete empirical support for virginia justifications was necessary before it could properly rule on virginia motion to dismiss.id.at.the district court then reviewed virginia three justifications and determined that each was important.id.at.
finally,in weighing the plaintiffs burdens against virginia interests,the district court ruled that the interests put forward by virginia outweighed any minor burdens the ballot ordering law imposed on sarvis and his.the district court accordingly granted virginia motion to dismiss the amended complaint.id.at.sarvis alone appeals that order.
sarvis main argument on appeal is that virginia ballot ordering law advantages candidates from what he calls major parties and disadvantages candidates like him that hail from what he calls minor parties.according to sarvis,this conferral of advantages and disadvantages violates expressive and associational rights,the right to cast a vote for a candidate of one choice,and the right to stand for election,all of which are protected by the first amendment.in addition,sarvis contends that the ballot ordering law unequal treatment of candidates runs afoul of the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause.appellant opening br.
sarvis premises his constitutional challenge largely on what the district court termed the windfall vote theory.sarvis,supp.at.according to this theory,in any given election,some voters will vote for candidates appearing at the top of the ballot because of those candidates prominent ballot positions.sarvis argues that virginia ballot ordering law,in conjunction with this capricious voter bias,places an improper burden on candidates from minor parties.before the district court,however,sarvis stated that his expert would not testify about the exact extent of the bias in sarvis specific situation.id.at.
although he concedes that the burden imposed by the ballot ordering law is not subject to strict scrutiny,sarvis contends that the district court analysis nevertheless underestimated the magnitude of the burden imposed by the law.at the same time,he argues that the court analysis the interests virginia offered to support the law.
finally,in addition to disagreeing with the substance of the district court analysis of the burdens imposed and interests furthered by the ballot ordering law,sarvis argues that the district court erred in rejecting his claims at the motion to dismiss stage.he states that the district court should have allowed discovery so as to better ascertain how the ballot ordering law burdens candidates who are not listed in the ballot first tier,and how it does or does not actually further the interests virginia offers in support of the law.
we begin with the uncontroversial proposition that the legislature in each state of our federal system possesses the presumptive authority to regulate elections within that state sovereign territory.this authority stems directly from the constitution.with regard to congressional elections,article i section clause of the constitution provides the times,places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations,except as to the places of chusing senators.article ii section clause accords similar treatment to presidential elections each state shall appoint,in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct,a number of electors,who will then choose the president.and a state authority to regulate elections for its own offices is simply a basic incident of our federal system.the constitution nowhere confers at least not as an initial matter authority on the federal government to regulate elections for state offices.
these constitutional provisions are the product of the framers extensive debate concerning the roles that the state and federal governments would play in regulating elections.see,the federalist alexander hamilton arguing for federal control over congressional elections the cato arguing for state control over congressional elections.it is no surprise that the precise compromise that the framers struck differs for each type of election.for instance,the framers chose to invest the states with responsibility for the mechanics of congressional elections,but only so far as congress declines to state legislative choices.arizona inter tribal council of arizona,quoting foster love.with regard to presidential elections,however,the framers adopted a different approach the electoral college.they then gave state legislatures the authority to decide the manner through which the electors from each state would be appointed.mcpherson blacker.
of course,the reconstruction amendments along with later amendments such as those providing for the election of senators by the people and prohibiting denial of the right to vote on account of sex materially altered the division of labor established by the framers for the regulation of elections.const.amends.xvii,xix.and various federal statutes,most notably the voting rights act of,passed pursuant to those amendments have made still further alterations.most of these steps were deeply necessary and long overdue.through them all,however,the constitution has continued to preserve for state legislatures the presumptive authority to regulate both the larger and smaller aspects of the federal and state elections occurring within that state boundaries.
indeed,the supreme court has consistently recognized this enduring tenet of our constitutional order,noting that the states possess a broad power to prescribe the times,places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,which power is matched by state control over the election process for state offices.clingman beaver,quoting tashjian republican party of,see also bush palm beach cty.canvassing,per curiam noting state legislatures broad power over the appointment of presidential electors.
this arrangement is not only it also makes a certain sense.all other things being equal,it is generally better for states to administer elections.it is true that smaller units of government can act oppressively toward minority citizens within their borders and against unpopular points of view.but local administration also allows for greater individual input and accountability a distant bureaucracy is in danger of appearing out of reach and out of touch.even alexander hamilton,who vigorously supported greater federal control over congressional elections,acknowledged the point allowing local administrations to regulate elections in the first instance may,in ordinary cases,be more convenient and more satisfactory.the federalist.all of this is to say that a lot of thought stretching over centuries has gone into our electoral system as it now generally operates.the text and history of the constitution,well established supreme court precedent,and the structural principles inherent in our federal system counsel respect for the virginia general assembly power to administer elections in virginia.
mindful of state legislatures longstanding authority to regulate elections,we turn first to an examination of the alleged burdens imposed by virginia ballot ordering law.
state election regulations often implicate substantial voting,associational and expressive rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments.pisano strach,cir.citation omitted.the first amendment,as incorporated against the states by the fourteenth amendment,protects the rights of individuals to associate for the advancement of political beliefs and ideas.green party state election comm n,cir.for example,it is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the liberty assured by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,which embraces freedom of speech.anderson,at quoting naacp alabama.i nvidious classifications also violate rights protected by the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.williams rhodes.these rights,however,are not absolute.all election laws,including perfectly valid ones,inevitably affect at least to some degree the individual right to vote and his right to associate with others for political ends.anderson,at.
in order to distinguish those laws whose burdens are uniquely unconstitutional from the majority of laws whose validity is unquestioned,we employ the supreme court decisional framework.we consider the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate identify and evaluate the precise interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed and determine the legitimacy and strength of each of those interests and the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff rights.anderson,at.this balancing test requires hard judgments it does not dictate automatic results.id.at.
the nature of our inquiry is flexible and depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens first and fourteenth amendment rights.burdick,at.laws imposing only modest burdens are usually justified by a state important regulatory interests.green party,at.laws imposing severe burdens,on the other hand,must be narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance.burdick,at citation omitted.they are thus subject to strict scrutiny.mclaughlin bd.of elections,cir.however,the class of laws facing this higher scrutiny is limited.subjecting too many laws to strict scrutiny would unnecessarily tie the hands of states seeking to assure that elections are operated equitably and efficiently.burdick,at.
here,virginia ballot ordering law imposes only the most modest burdens on sarvis free speech,associational,and equal protection rights.the law is facially neutral and nondiscriminatory neither sarvis libertarian party nor any other party faces a disproportionate burden.all parties are subject to the same requirements.none are automatically elevated to the top of the ballot.virginia ballot ordering law thus allows any political organization of any persuasion an evenhanded chance at achieving political party status and a ballot position.code ann.
sarvis complains that the bar for achieving political party status is nonetheless too high,but he exaggerates the difficulty of this goal.an organization may obtain political party status if any of its candidates for any office receives pe
