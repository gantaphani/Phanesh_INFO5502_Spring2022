following her failed efforts to force an agency of the puerto rican government to display the american flag in its central office,miriam ramírez found herself on the wrong end of criminal charges brought pursuant to the riot act,laws ann.tit.claiming that the riot act impermissibly infringed her first amendment right to political expression and that the party in power was using it as a tool to harass political opponents,the plaintiff mounted a constitutional challenge after the criminal charges were dropped,the district court determined that the plaintiff no longer had an adequate stake in the action and dismissed her constitutional claims as moot.ramírez rodríguez,d.this appeal followed.
we conclude that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring a facial challenge to the riot act.while she had standing to mount an challenge,that claim became moot upon the termination of the criminal charges.accordingly,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
the plaintiff is a member of the new progressive party npp and a former legislator.in,the npp main rival,the popular democratic party pdp,controlled the puerto rican government.on june,after learning that a government agency,the office of the women advocate owa,was not displaying the american flag alongside the puerto rican flag,the plaintiff joined a group of npp adherents who marched,flag in hand,to the owa headquarters in an effort to rectify the situation.the marchers were denied entry when they reached their destination.carlos pesquera,then the president of the npp,met with owa representatives to explain the group objective.pesquera entourage waited outside in hopes that they would be allowed to enter the building and hoist the american flag.over the course of the afternoon,the large crowd attracted attention from both the media and the police.
after many hours,the doors to the owa headquarters were finally unlocked.the plaintiff claims that she was swept inside when the crowd rushed to enter the vestibule.the influx did not proceed very far owa personnel used physical force to prevent the marchers from ascending the stairs to the reception area where they wished to place the flag.
throughout,the plaintiff remained on the ground floor,seeking refuge in a side stairwell.while waiting for the frenzy to abate,she grabbed a man to prevent him from climbing over peoples heads as he attempted to ascend the staircase.the man later identified as an owa hierarch turned and struck her.the plaintiff subsequently left the building.
no one was arrested or charged on the date of the incident.in its aftermath,however,the puerto rico department of justice appointed an independent prosecutor the prosecutor.the prosecutor secured affidavits stating that the plaintiff had i directed threatening gestures at owa officials while awaiting ingress to the building and ii used physical force against an owa official once she was inside.armed with these affidavits,the prosecutor filed criminal charges against the plaintiff under the riot act.the prosecutor charged several other prominent npp members for their roles in the incident.no charges were lodged against anyone from the owa.
on february,a local court dismissed the charges against the plaintiff for want of probable cause.later,however,the court agreed to reconsider its decision and scheduled a hearing for march.shortly before the appointed date,the plaintiff filed suit in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.in that action,she sought to enjoin the pending prosecution and to secure a declaration of the riot act unconstitutionality.
at this point,a few words of explanation are in order.the riot act defines the offense with which the plaintiff was charged as a use of force or violence to disturb the public peace,or any threat to use such force or violence,so long as that act is accompanied by immediate power of execution and is carried out by two or more persons,acting together and without authority of law.laws ann.tit.the plaintiff constitutional challenge to this statute has two facets.first,she attacks the riot act on the ground that the government was using it selectively to prosecute npp partisans for their lawful exercise of first amendment freedoms.second,she alleges that the riot act,on its face,is unconstitutionally vague,overly broad,and incompatible with fourteenth amendment protections,due process and equal protection.in this regard,the plaintiff complains that the riot act neither specifies what behavior constitutes a disturbance of the peace nor limits violations to those situations in which the interdicted conduct presents a clear and present danger of actual injury.
the defendants,government officials sued in their representative capacities,moved to dismiss the action based on younger abstention principles.see younger harris,d.the district court prudently stayed proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal prosecution.that case terminated on march,when the local court reaffirmed its earlier dismissal of the charges against the plaintiff for want of probable cause.
in short order,the district court jettisoned the plaintiff claim for injunctive relief as moot.the court simultaneously denied the defendants motion to dismiss the federal action on younger grounds.neither of these determinations is at issue in this appeal.
on april,the plaintiff moved for summary judgment on her declaratory judgment claim.she argued that she retained a personal stake in the matter because,as an active npp member,she intended to continue participating in activities critical of the administration.specifically,she explained that she planned to participate in the npp upcoming march of indignation and to continue exercising her rights of peaceful assembly and vocal protest.she worried that these activities might subject her to selective prosecution under the allegedly vague and overbroad language of the riot act.she also worried that her fear of future prosecution might,in turn,chill the free exercise of her first amendment rights.
in response,the secretary of justice the sole remaining defendant to dismiss the plaintiff complaint on the ground that the entire case had become moot when the criminal charges were squelched.on march,the district court granted the defendant motion.the court cited the following uncontested facts i the criminal charges against the plaintiff had been dismissed ii a general election had intervened and a new administration albeit one headed by a different pdp governor was in power iii the plaintiff term of office had expired and she was no longer an elected official and iv the other npp leaders who had been charged under the riot act in connection with the flag incident had all been acquitted in a highly publicized trial.see ramírez,d at.the court found that these changed circumstances rendered it improbable that the puerto rico department of justice would once again expose itself to public embarrassment and ridicule by selectively prosecuting public officials under the riot act for voicing their differences with the government.id.at.although it dismissed all that remained of the action,the court did not undertake separate analyses of the plaintiff and facial challenges.this timely appeal ensued 
ii.analysis 
we review the district court mootness determination de novo,accepting as true the material factual allegations contained in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff favor.see right to life political action comm.gardner,cir.
it is beyond dispute that when a litigant wishes to pursue a claim in a federal court,justiciability principles require the existence of an actual case or controversy.see const.art.iii,cl.see also allen wright,d osediacz city of cranston,cir.to satisfy the case or controversy criterion,the party alleging the existence of jurisdiction normally,the plaintiff must possess a personal stake in the outcome of the litigation.city of los angeles lyons,d.this requirement subsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings,trial and appellate.lewis cont l bank,d.
the doctrine of standing measures whether a plaintiff has satisfied the personal stake requirement at the commencement of an action.see baker carr,d.thereafter,the doctrine of mootness measures whether the plaintiff interest remains sufficient to justify continuing federal jurisdiction.see parole comm geraghty,d.given that dichotomy,mootness is aptly described as the doctrine of standing set in a time frame.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
in this instance,the plaintiff asserts that she has a personal stake sufficient to support the justiciability of both her selective prosecution claim and her facial challenge to the constitutionality of the riot act.these two claims involve different justiciability standards.for that reason,we analyze them separately.
the difference between standing and mootness necessitates a further segmentation of our analysis.thus,we first consider,as to each claim,whether the plaintiff carried her initial burden of establishing standing.we then proceed to a mootness inquiry only answer is in the affirmative.warth seldin,d explaining that standing is a threshold question in every federal case.
standing involves both constitutional imperatives and prudential considerations.valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d.an inquiry into standing must be based on the facts as they existed when the action was commenced.mangual,cir.
to satisfy article iii personal stake requirement a statutory challenge,the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that i she has suffered an actual or threatened injury in fact,which is ii fairly traceable to the statute,and iii can be redressed by a favorable decision.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d lewis,at.allegations of abstract injury are insufficient to make out an injury in fact.instead,the plaintiff must show that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury.lyons,at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,she must show that the injury or threat of injury is both real and immediate.id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
in addition to these constitutional requirements,prudential considerations must be taken into account.in are exceptions,but we need not discuss them concerns require a plaintiff to show that she is seeking to protect her own legal rights rather than those of a third party,that her complaint does not merely represent a generalized grievance,and that the complaint falls within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.see right to life,at.
against this backdrop,we turn to the two claims at issue here.
the challenge.at the time the plaintiff sued,criminal charges were pending against her under the riot act.because she was in immediate danger of sustaining harm,her claim satisfies the first prong of the constitutional standing inquiry.see lyons,at.this claim also clears the second and third hurdles of the constitutional test her injury was directly traceable to the challenged conduct,and a declaration of the riot act invalidity would eliminate the threatened harm.
by the same token,the claim satisfies prudential prerequisites.the plaintiff is seeking to protect her own first amendment freedoms the allegedly selective prosecution crystallized in a particularized event the institution of criminal charges and aspects of the threatened injury most particularly,the chilling of political expression fall comfortably within the zone of interests that the first amendment protects.
to say more would be to paint the lily.we hold,without serious question,that the plaintiff carried her burden of establishing initial standing to seek a declaratory judgment with respect to her claim.
the facial challenge.although allegations of abstract injury are insufficient to satisfy the first prong of the article iii standing test,a litigant who brings a first amendment challenge to the face of a statute need not actually violate the statute or suffer the prescribed penalty in order to establish an injury in fact.steffel thompson,d.because the conflict between state officials empowered to enforce a law and private parties subject to prosecution under that law is a classic case or controversy within the meaning of art.iii,diamond charles,d,two other types of injury may in some situations constitute valid proxies.
the first occurs when a plaintiff has alleged an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,but proscribed by the statute,and there exists a credible threat of prosecution.babbitt united farm workers union,d.the second occurs when a plaintiff is chilled from exercising her right to free expression or forgoes expression in order to avoid enforcement consequences.right to life,at.the plaintiff seeks to invoke these exceptions here.
however,there is a rub.each of the exceptions requires a credible opposed to a hypothetical the challenged statute will be enforced to the plaintiff detriment if she exercises her first amendment rights.id.at.consequently,a party subjective fear that she may be prosecuted for engaging in expressive activity will not be held to constitute an injury for standing purposes unless that fear is objectively reasonable.id.the evidentiary threshold that must be crossed in order to establish a credible threat is modest,see,virginia am.booksellers ass n,d babbitt,at,but it is real.we turn,then,to the question of whether the plaintiff proffer passes muster.
in her filings,the plaintiff expressed her intention to participate in a march,peacefully assemble,and openly voice her opposition to the pdp regime.she asserted that she feared future prosecutions under the riot act if she followed through on any or all of these intentions and worried that she might be dissuaded from exercising her first amendment freedoms.
because the plaintiff never stated an intention to engage in any activity that could reasonably be construed to fall within the confines of the riot act,she failed to satisfy even the relaxed standing requirements reserved for facial first amendment challenges.see osediacz,at suggesting that a party mounting a facial challenge must at the very least desire or intend to undertake activity within the compass of the challenged statute.read straightforwardly,the riot act only criminalizes the use of force or violence or the threat to use such force or violence.laws ann.tit.none of the activities in which the plaintiff has expressed a desire to,peacefully assembling,and speaking force or violence.therefore,none of them is even arguably within the statute reach.accordingly,the plaintiff lacks standing to pursue a declaration that the riot act is unconstitutional on its face.see osediacz,at right to life,at.
to be sure,the plaintiff maintains that her fear is credible because the prosecutions following the flag incident warrant an inference that the pdp administration is overly eager to employ the riot act against npp leaders.assuming,for argument sake,that such an inference reasonably can be drawn,there is an important distinction between the flag incident and the activities that the plaintiff lists as future pursuits.even though the riot act charges against the plaintiff were ultimately found to be baseless,the prosecutor had obtained evidence suggesting that the plaintiff had used force on that occasion.it is simply too much of a stretch to posit that the government decision to prosecute a riot act charge when some evidence supports a force or violence finding indicates a willingness to prosecute entirely peaceful first amendment expression.see united states armstrong,d explaining that in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary,courts presume that prosecutors will properly discharge their official duties citation and internal quotation marks omitted.while the government decision to prosecute the earlier case is relevant to the plaintiff claim,it does not confer standing to bring a facial challenge where,as here,the plaintiff has stated no intention of engaging in similar conduct.the plaintiff has,therefore,failed to clear the evidentiary bar for establishing a credible threat of future prosecution.see right to life,at see also osediacz,at explaining that although standing concerns are relaxed in c
