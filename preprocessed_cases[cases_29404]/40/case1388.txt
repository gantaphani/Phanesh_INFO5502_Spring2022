in this consolidated appeal,we consider whether the district court erred in holding that an administrator of an employee welfare benefit plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,abused its discretion when the administrator terminated the plaintiff disability benefits.we also consider whether the district court abused its discretion by awarding attorneys fees to the plaintiff.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
gloria williams was employed by cingular wireless as a customer services clerk from september until the middle of.in this capacity,williams daily responsibilities consisted primarily of speaking with customers on the telephone and typing data into a computer.williams enrolled in cingular insurance plan the plan,which was issued by metropolitan life insurance company metlife.the plan includes both disability benefits and disability benefits.metlife,as the claims administrator,serves in the dual role of evaluating benefit claims and paying approved claims.the terms of the plan grant metlife the discretionary authority to interpret the plan and to determine benefit eligibility.
in the middle of the,williams began suffering from medical issues with her hands and wrists,and was diagnosed with trigger finger disorder tendinitis,and carpel tunnel syndrome.williams has had nine medical procedures to treat these conditions,including six operations to treat her trigger finger disorder,one operation to remove infected tissue resulting from the surgeries to relieve her trigger finger condition,and two procedures to address her carpel tunnel syndrome.according to williams and her treating physicians,these conditions made it very difficult for williams to use her hands without experiencing severe pain for work activities such as typing on a computer.
in april,williams left work due to these conditions and filed a claim with metlife for disability benefits.metlife approved disability benefits for a period but then terminated those benefits,at which point williams returned to work.about this time,williams also was being treated for neck and back pain.
after returning to her job,williams worked for about one week before leaving work again.metlife renewed williams disability benefits after her doctor advised her to avoid repetitive computer work and hand use.williams disability benefits lapsed in september,after one of her physicians concluded that she was able to return to her job on a reduced schedule.williams returned to her job for one day,and worked for about four hours before stopping because she was unable to perform her job duties without severe pain.
after leaving work,williams again applied for disability benefits.metlife approved disability benefits for williams through october,which was the maximum period allowable for those benefits under the plan.metlife then referred williams claim for consideration for disability benefits.metlife approved disability benefits for williams in december.
for about the next months,williams continued to experience neck,back,and hand pain.during this period,metlife periodically requested and reviewed williams medical records,informing her in february and march of that her disability benefits would continue.
in august,metlife terminated williams disability benefits.metlife sent williams a letter explaining that it was terminating her disability benefits because medical documents do not substantiate her inability to perform her customary occupation.in support of its decision,metlife appeared to rely on a report from carl smith,one of williams treating physicians,reflecting williams april,visit with smith.smith report related williams statements that she was having good and bad days,and that her pain averaged a three on a scale.smith report did not specifically address williams hand and wrist pain,nor did the report conclude that williams was able to return to work.
after metlife termination of her disability benefits in august,williams exercised her appeal rights under the plan in september and submitted additional medical evaluations in support of her appeal.metlife referred williams file to john thomas ii,an independent certified disability evaluator and physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist,and to lee becker,an independent physician consultant and certified psychiatry specialist.
thomas reviewed the information in williams file at the time of the initial denial of benefits,as well as updated information submitted after that denial.thomas analysis focused on williams medical issues with her neck and back.with regard to williams medical issues with her hands and wrists,thomas concluded that 
certainly there is ample medical record support for inability to use the hands,over time,during the and again in the early,these issues appear to retreat with a mri it is not clear to me how these findings correlate with williams complaints on exam.it does not appear that any of her providers really lined the clinical picture up well.
thomas issued a report on september,agreeing with metlife determination that the medical information in williams file did not show that williams was unable to work after august.similarly,becker concluded on september,that from a psychiatric perspective,the information in williams file did not support an inability to perform her job duties after august.
in october,after thomas and becker concluded that williams file did not substantiate her asserted inability to function at work,metlife upheld its decision terminating williams disability benefits.in its letter to williams informing her of this decision,metlife stated that the information in her claim file did not support the existence of a totally disabling condition severe enough to keep her from performing her customary occupation as of august.as evidenced by this letter,metlife review focused on the medical records relating to williams neck and shoulder trouble,while failing to address in substance williams problems with her hands and wrists.
although this decision exhausted williams appeal rights under the plan,metlife received and reviewed additional medical information that williams submitted in the months that followed.metlife sent this additional information to thomas,who issued a supplemental report on november,restating his previous conclusion.in his supplemental report,thomas expressly recognize d a number of upper extremity surgeries being done over time and noted williams complain ts of neck pain,hand and wrist numbness.nevertheless,thomas concluded that t he interval records reviewed do not clearly explain physical findings which would preclude work activities or function at a level.by letter dated november,metlife informed williams that it was upholding its prior decision to terminate williams disability benefits.
williams later submitted additional information to metlife,including a december report from her physician,gary kaplowitz,in which kaplowitz concluded that williams is significantly disabled,and that i t is impossible for williams to do any kind of repetitive work with the right hand.williams also sent metlife a september report from smith.in this report,smith stated that williams no longer can deal with computers because of her hand pain,and concluded that williams pain continues to bother her significantly.she has limited use of the hands.she is not able to return back to her prior occupation as a customer service rep sic at all.hence,she is totally disabled from her prior occupation.
metlife again sent these additional medical records to thomas,who issued a report on january,restating his prior conclusion that williams medical records did not substantiate an inability to work after august.in this report,thomas dismissed smith september report,finding it without significant objective findings precluding sedentary duty function ability.thomas also summarily dismissed kaplowitz december report,which concluded that williams was significantly disabled and unable to return to work.based on thomas conclusions,metlife informed williams by letter dated january,that metlife was again upholding its decision to terminate williams disability benefits.
williams submitted further medical information to metlife in may.metlife reviewed this additional information but again informed williams,by letter dated september,that metlife decision to terminate williams longterm disability benefits was sustained.
after receiving this letter from metlife,williams filed the present lawsuit against metlife in the eastern district of north carolina.thereafter,williams and metlife each filed motions for summary judgment.upon its review of the administrative record,the district court,in a published opinion,entered final judgment granting williams motion and denying metlife motion.williams metro.life ins,d.
in its opinion,the district court noted that metlife had a conflict of interest with regard to the plan because metlife served in the dual role of evaluating claims for benefits and paying those claims.based on this structural conflict,the district court applied the modified standard that was applicable in this circuit at the time of the district court order.referencing this standard,the district court stated,
in assessing the reasonableness of metlife decision,the court requires that metlife decision be more objectively reasonable and supported by more substantial evidence as compared to when no conflict of interest exists 
id.at emphasis added.
the district court held in williams favor because metlife analysis did not adequately account for the medical evidence regarding williams inability to use her hands in performing her occupation as a customer service clerk.thus,according to the district court,metlife decision was not reasonable and was not supported by substantial evidence.
the district court directed metlife to award williams longterm disability benefits for the period between april,and april,and directed that metlife determine williams eligibility for disability benefits beginning from april,to the present.the district court also invited williams to submit a request for attorneys fees and costs,which she did.after receiving briefing by the parties,the district court awarded williams attorneys fees in the amount of and in costs.metlife timely appealed the district court order granting williams summary judgment motion and the court order awarding attorneys fees and costs.
in an appeal under erisa,we review a district court decision de novo,employing the same standards governing the district court review of the plan administrator decision.champion black decker,cir.when,as here,an erisa benefit plan vests with the plan administrator the discretionary authority to make eligibility determinations for beneficiaries,a reviewing court evaluates the plan administrator decision for abuse of discretion.id.at ellis metro.life ins,cir.
under the standard,we will not disturb a plan administrator decision if the decision is reasonable,even if we would have come to a contrary conclusion independently.ellis,at.thus,we may not substitute our own judgment in place of the judgment of the plan administrator.see berry,cir.to be held reasonable,the administrator decision must result from a deliberate,principled reasoning process and be supported by substantial evidence.guthrie rural coop.disability plan,cir brogan holland,cir.
in our decision in booth stores.associates health welfare plan,cir,we set forth eight nonexclusive factors that courts should consider in reviewing the reasonableness of a plan administrator decision.these factors include 
the language of the plan 
the purposes and goals of the plan 
the adequacy of the materials considered to make the decision and the degree to which they support it 
whether the fiduciary interpretation was consistent with other provisions in the plan and with earlier interpretations of the plan 
whether the decisionmaking process was reasoned and principled 
whether the decision was consistent with the procedural and substantive requirements of erisa 
any external standard relevant to the exercise of discretion and 
the fiduciary motives and any conflict of interest it may have.
id.at.the above factors continue to guide our review under erisa.see carden aetna life ins,cir champion,at.
before the supreme court decision in metropolitan life insurance glenn,courts in this circuit reviewing a plan administrator decision applied a modified standard.see ellis,at.under this prior standard,if a plan administrator had a conflict of interest because the administrator both determined benefit eligibility and paid claims,the administrator decision was given less deference than if the administrator had no conflict of this nature.in applying that prior standard,we noted that such a conflict would modify the standard according to a sliding scale,requiring greater objective reasonableness and more substantial evidence in support of a decision depending on the degree of the administrator financial incentive to benefit itself by reaching a certain outcome.see see also,guthrie,at applying sliding scale modified analysis blackshear reliance standard life ins,cir same stup unum life ins.of,cir same.
this line of cases,however,predated glenn,in which the supreme court established the framework of review for erisa cases in which a plan administrator has a structural conflict of interest.addressing the different standards of review employed by some of the circuit courts,the supreme court clarified that the presence of a plan administrator conflict of interest did not alter the standard of review.instead,the court explained,the presence of such a conflict is but one factor among many that a reviewing judge must take into account.at.at.in particular,the supreme court counseled that the conflict of interest should not itself lead to special rules,or other special procedural or evidentiary rules.id.
although the district court in the present case was aware of the supreme court holding in glenn,the district court did not have the benefit of our opinion in champion,decided two weeks after the district court entered its order.in champion,we first substantively addressed the impact of glenn on our prior modified standard.we observed that the decision in glenn required a change in our prior standard for reviewing discretionary decisions made by erisa administrators operating under a structural conflict of interest.champion,at.
we concluded that,based on the holding in glenn,our prior modified standard no longer was applicable.id.at.we held that,instead,courts should view any such conflict of interest as but one factor among the many identified in booth for reviewing the reasonableness of a plan administrator discretionary decision.id.at.we explained that courts are to apply simply the standard for reviewing discretionary determinations by the administrator,even if the administrator operated under a conflict of interest.id.with this framework in mind,we address the arguments presented in this appeal.
metlife argues that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard,and that application of the correct standard mandates the conclusion that metlife did not abuse its discretion in terminating williams disability benefits.we disagree with the conclusion advanced by metlife.
after citing the decision in glenn,the district court stated that the effect of metlife conflict was reduced because metlife sought review of its decision by two and initially awarded williams disability benefits through august.nevertheless,the district court stated that it was applying the modified standard,and announced that because of the conflict of interest present in this case,metlife decision to terminate williams benefits must be more objectively reasonable and supported by more substantial evidence than if there were no conflict.williams,d at emphasis added.
because the district court applied the modified standard that we abrogated in champion,as required by the decision in glenn,we first must decide whether we should reach the merits of metlife appeal or instead remand the case to the district court for application of the correct legal standard.we conclude that a remand is not necessary in this case.
in the context of erisa,this court and the district court each conduct the same de novo review to determine whether a plan administrator abused its discretion.see champion,at.both this court and the district court conduct these respective reviews based solely on the existing administrative record,rather than on any testimony or other additional evidence obtained outside the administrative record.thus,we are equally situated to the district court in our ability to examine the administrative record and to apply the facts to the proper legal standard 
our decision to proceed directly to review de novo the record before us is further supported by our decisions after champion in which we considered appeals based on erisa.since the decision in champion,in the five erisa cases that have come before us in which the district court applied the standard,we have reached the merits of each such case rather than remanding the matter to the district court.see carden,at affirming district court order upholding plan administrator offset of workers compensation benefits vaughan celanese americas,app x cir.july,unpublished affirming district court decision upholding plan administrator denial of separation pay benefits spry eaton.long term disability plan,app x cir.june,unpublished reversing district court decision in favor of beneficiary lance ret.plan of int l paper,app x cir.may,unpublished affirming district court decision upholding plan administrator denial of benefits white eaton.short term disability plan,app x cir.unpublished affirming district court decision in favor of beneficiary we also note that a review of erisa cases from our sister circuits shows that other courts of appeal often have reached the merits of cases in which a district court initially applied a standard 
we turn now to apply the champion standard to the facts of this case,employing the factors set forth in booth.we hold that because metlife serves in the dual role of evaluating claims for benefits and of paying benefit claims,metlife has a structural conflict of interest.see glenn,at.at.we observe,however,that metlife structural conflict of interest should not have a significant role in the analysis.the district court correctly concluded that metlife initial finding of disability,its payment of longterm disability benefits for almost two years,and its referral of its termination decision to two independent doctors,suggests that metlife was not inherently biased in making its decision.
nevertheless,we agree with williams that metlife decision is not supported by substantial evidence.under the terms of the plan,a person is disabled and eligible for disability benefits if she is unable to earn a certain percentage of her earnings due to an inability to perform all of the duties of her customary occupation.williams c ustomary o ccupation is as a customer service clerk,a position that requires frequent typing on a computer,which in turn requires williams to make frequent use of her hands and wrists.
williams claims file contained overwhelming evidence reflecting significant problems with her hands and wrists,including tendonitis,carpel tunnel syndrome,and trigger finger disorder.we again note that williams has had nine medical procedures to treat these conditions.despite these numerous procedures,the described hand and wrist impairments have continued to cause williams pain and have become a significant impediment to williams ability to type on a computer.
the district court characterized the record reflecting williams issues with her hands and wrists as credible,objective medical evidence.d at.we agree with this conclusion.indeed,williams physicians repeatedly concluded that williams should not return to work,or required a modification of job duties,due in part to the pain in her hands and her inability to type on a computer.metlife itself noted in december that williams is unable to turn her head and use her hands for extend ed periods of time due to the pain.
although williams neck and shoulder pain showed signs of improvement,the evidence in the administrative record does not show that williams medical issues with her hands and wrists subsided.nonetheless,following williams april appointment with smith,in which williams reported generally that her pain recently had improved,metlife terminated williams disability benefits in august.as noted,this termination followed several occasions,as recently as five months prior,in which metlife reviewed and approved williams disability benefits.the report from williams april doctor visit was the only new information since metlife most recent approval of williams disability benefits that metlife could have considered in deciding abruptly to terminate those benefits.
after reviewing the evidence in the administrative record,we conclude that even under the deferential standard of review prescribed by glenn and champion,metlife rationale in terminating williams benefits was not reasoned and principled,and was not supported by substantial evidence.metlife initial termination letter simply does not address evidence from williams treating physicians concerning williams inability to use her hands to conduct the typing and other activities required by her customary occupation.we emphasize that smith april report,on which metlife initially relied in terminating williams benefits,does not explicitly address williams ability to use her hands,nor does that report conclude that williams could return to work.
moreover,we agree with the district court that thomas concluded inaccurately that williams inability to use her hands appear s to retreat with a c spine mri.the record evidences numerous instances in which williams experienced pain and difficulty in attempting to use her hands after may.additionally,we conclude that thomas statement regarding whether williams providers really lined the clinical picture up well,is vague and fails to provide any information of substance regarding williams documented problems with her hands and wrists.
in the face of overwhelming evidence concerning williams continued pain and difficulty in attempting to use her hands and wrists,metlife relied on a scintilla of evidence that did not directly address these problems.metlife appears to have disregarded,without justification,williams treating physicians conclusions regarding her hand and wrist pain and its effect on her ability to type throughout the day.as the supreme court has held,p lan administrators,of course,may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant reliable evidence,including the opinions of a treating physician.black decker disability plan nord.for these reasons,we agree with the district court that metlife decision to terminate williams disability benefits for the applicable period was an abuse of discretion.
