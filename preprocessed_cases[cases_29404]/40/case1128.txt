opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on appeal from an order entered in the district court on june,dismissing this case with prejudice for lack of standing of each of the and for failure to state a federal claim on which the court could grant relief.the case concerns the legality of a settlement agreement agreement which the philadelphia city solicitor solicitor,acting on behalf of the city of philadelphia city,entered into with certain philadelphia billboard operators concerning the regulation of billboards in philadelphia.appellants claim that in entering into the agreement the solicitor exceeded his executive authority,usurped the city council lawmaking powers,and violated philadelphia zoning ordinances.the district court dismissed the action because it concluded that none of the appellants had standing to pursue the claims.the court further held that no federal claims of any sort can be discerned from appellants complaint.app.at.
appellants then appealed.the primary issue on this appeal is whether appellants have standing to bring this action.for the reasons that we will explain,we hold that the district court correctly concluded that appellants do not have standing.accordingly,we will affirm its order of june,except that inasmuch as the district court by reason of appellants want of standing did not have subject matter jurisdiction,see pennsylvania prison soc y cortes,cir,and we do not pass on the merits of the complaint,we will modify the order to the end that it will be without prejudice to appellants instituting a similar action in the state courts.
ii.background 
this case is an outgrowth of an action that several philadelphia billboard operators filed in november in the eastern district of pennsylvania against the city challenging certain of its regulations of billboard advertisements.free speech,llc city of philadelphia,civ.filed.the plaintiffs in free speech were three outdoor advertising companies,specifically cbs outdoor,clear channel outdoor,and steen industries,as well as free speech,llc,an association which included other plaintiffs as its members collectively billboard operators.in the free speech action the billboard operators questioned the legality of the philadelphia city council june amendments to the philadelphia code regulation of outdoor advertising signs within the city.the billboard operators claimed that the new regulations imposed fees and certain other requirements on outdoor advertising signs based on their content and that the regulations therefore violated the billboard operators first amendment right to free speech.
in august,following long negotiations,the solicitor on behalf of the city entered into the agreement with the billboard operators to resolve the free speech action the agreement,however,was not a federal consent judgment reviewed or issued by the free speech court and was what the parties have called a private agreement.the agreement provides that 
a certified billboard identified and described on a certified inventory shall be deemed to be a lawful outdoor advertising sign under the philadelphia code,and at all times shall retain that lawful status,and the city shall issue an annual license for individual outdoor advertising sign for each such certified billboard 
app.at agreement.in addition to providing that the city would issue licenses for the specified billboards,the agreement specifies comprehensive procedures for resolving any disputes that may arise from its implementation.thus,the agreement provides that 
u nder this consent agreement,all parties hereto have agreed to forego their statutory rights under the philadelphia code for recourse to the administrative agencies and the courts,and have agreed to the final determinations of a special master with respect to certain disputes arising under this consent agreement regarding the lawful status of certain outdoor advertising signs.
app.at agreement.in addition,the agreement provides that 
all disputes with respect to the regulation of a certified billboard arising under the provisions of the philadelphia code as further specified and provided by this agreement,shall be resolved in the following manner 
in the event that a settling party or the city believes there is such a dispute,it shall provide written notice of such dispute to the other party.within business days after receipt of such notice,unless another time is mutually agreed upon,the concerned parties shall meet and exchange all documents and other information and make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute at that time.
in the event that the parties are unable to resolve the dispute they shall immediately submit the matter to the special master for final and binding decision.
the special master shall receive information from the parties and conduct all arbitrations in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association,or pursuant to such procedures as the special master may propose and to which the parties agree.
app.at agreement.the agreement also provides that 
this agreement shall be effective and binding on the parties,their successors and assigns for the effective period and shall supersede conflicting provisions of law.this agreement shall become effective upon the effective date.
app.at agreement.
the parties in their briefs do not suggest that the city council approved or authorized the solicitor to enter into the agreement and we are satisfied that it did not do so.the appellees indicate,however,in their brief,without citation to the record,that 
the solicitor internal evaluation of the merits of the litigation and consideration of the issues raised and his views and goals for settlement were made known publicly throughout the negotiations on multiple occasions,including in testimony to city council on the law department budget in april,and in an april meeting with the mayor and representatives of community organizations,some of whom are plaintiffs in this matter.
appellees br.at appellants in their reply brief do not challenge this statement.
on march,appellants filed this action claiming that the agreement should not be enforced.appellants are five members of the philadelphia city council a numerical minority of that body,five community organizations,and a philadelphia resident.the city council itself,however,was not a plaintiff in the action and the council as a body did not authorize its five members to bring the case even though they purport to sue in their official capacities as council members.in their complaint appellants advanced five challenges to the agreement predicated on their belief that the agreement is unlawful because of its usurpation of their legislative powers in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments its deprivation of their access to the courts in violation of the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendments and its deprivation of their privileges and immunities secured by article iv of the constitution its deprivation of their right to petition the legislature in violation of the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendments its violation of the pennsylvania sunshine act.ann,et west and the circumstance that it provides for zoning by contract.app.the defendants,now the appellees,are the city and the solicitor in his official capacity as a matter of convenience we sometimes refer to the council members as legislators,ordinances as legislation,and the council as the legislature because precedents germane to the case often involve use of those terms.
the appellees moved to dismiss the complaint.as we indicated at the outset,in a memorandum entered on june,the district court granted appellees motion and dismissed the case with prejudice for two reasons.first it held that no appellant had standing to bring the action.then it held that it could not discern a federal claim in the complaint.see.b.appellants appeal from the district court order dismissing their action with prejudice.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
appellants pled that the district court had federal jurisdiction pursuant to,and and and and supplemental jurisdiction over their state law claims pursuant to.we have jurisdiction on appellants appeal pursuant to.we exercise plenary review of standing issues,but review the factual elements underlying the district court determination of standing on a clear error standard.see instrument,cir.
iv.discussion 
our principal concern on this appeal is to determine whether any appellant has standing to bring this action.we start this inquiry by quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d,in which the supreme court described the elements necessary for establishing the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing under article iii of the constitution as follows 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
id.at.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in determining whether appellants have standing,we must consider their specific allegations and the relief which they seek.see city of los angeles lyons,d.
whether the city council appellants have standing as legislators 
appellants argue that t he city solicitor,by signing a settlement agreement that claims to supersede all contrary provisions of law,seeks to usurp the city council exclusive power to repeal or amend existing ordinances,and each individual council member right to consider and vote on any such proposed changes.appellants br.at.indeed,the complaint correctly alleges that the agreement provides that it shall supersede conflicting provisions of law.app.at.appellants characterize the agreement as an attempt to evade the city council exclusive power to consider and enact ordinances.appellants br.at.according to appellants 
if the city council plaintiffs lack standing here,then any executive official may supersede any law he or she chooses,simply by inserting the desired provisions in a private litigation settlement agreement.as the free speech,llc case demonstrates,government officials would privately contract to supersede laws that have no bearing on the ostensible issues in the litigation they purport to settle.such sweeping changes would be enacted through a settlement that,in its formation and execution,is deliberately hidden from the cleansing gaze of public or legislative scrutiny.
id.at.moreover,appellants argue that the political process is insufficient to deter the solicitor abuse of his powers because r efusing standing on this basis would empower the executive branch to legislate as it saw fit,constrained only by the prospect of a supermajority of the legislature statutes that were already on the books.id.at.appellants standing argument,however,clearly is overstated,as we are addressing only appellants standing and not the standing of any other putative plaintiff and are addressing appellants standing only in the district court and not in a state court if they refile this case in that forum.
we start our standing inquiry by building on the proposition that l egislators,like other litigants in federal court,must satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisites of article iii standing russell dejongh,cir.in russell,we discussed the doctrine of standing in the context of cases where a legislator brings suit against another government official 
concerns for separation of powers and the limited role of the judiciary are at the core of article iii standing doctrine and the requirement that a plaintiff allege an injury in fact.those concerns are particularly acute in legislator standing cases,and they inform the analysis of whether a legislator plaintiff has asserted an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing to sue the supreme court,this court,and others have held that legislators have a legally protected interest in their right to vote on legislation and other matters committed to the legislature,which is sometimes phrased as an interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes.not every affront to a legislator interest in the effectiveness of his vote,however,is an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing to sue.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in russell we observed that i n particular,the authorities appear to hold uniformly that an official mere disobedience or flawed execution of a law for which a legislator voted is not an injury in fact for standing purposes.id.at citing chiles thornburgh,cir goldwater carter.en banc,vacated on other grounds,d daughtrey carter,harrington bush,harrington schlesinger,cir.see also chenoweth clinton,holding that members of house of representatives did not have standing to sue president for issuing an executive order on the basis that it had denied them their proper role in the legislative process united presbyterian church in the reagan,holding that member of house of representatives did not have standing to sue president for issuing an executive order that allegedly exceeded authority that congress granted intelligence agencies and violated limitations imposed by congress.
we went on in russell to explain that t he principal reason for this limitation of the definition of injury for standing purposes is that once a bill has become law,a legislator interest in seeing that the law is followed is no different from a private citizen general interest in proper government.at.the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit stated the principle similarly in chiles when it held that a senator did not have standing to sue the defendants for failing to comply with a statute for which he voted because s uch a claim of injury is nothing more than a generalized grievance about the conduct of government and therefore is insufficient to confer standing.at quoting flast cohen,d.see also mountain states legal found.costle,cir a private litigant,whether he be a legislator,a citizen or a taxpayer must,in order to have standing to sue,demonstrate a personal stake in the outcome,and demonstrate that he is the proper party to request adjudication of the particular issue.
appellants cite a number of cases to support their contention that the city council members have standing to bring this action.to begin,they rely heavily on dennis luis,cir,and silver pataki,both of which concerned legislators standing to challenge actions by the governors of their jurisdictions.in dennis we held that a group of legislators had standing to challenge the appointment by the governor of the virgin islands of an acting commissioner of commerce because the commissioner appointment required the legislature advice and consent pursuant to section c of the virgin islands revised organic act of,c,and the virgin islands code,ann.tit,b.at.in silver the new york court of appeals held that the speaker of the new york state assembly had standing to challenge the governor veto of portions of bills which the legislature passed,at.
clearly dennis and silver are distinguishable from this case.in dennis the legislator plaintiffs claimed that the governor actions infringed on their unique statutory right to advise the governor on executive appointments and to confer their approval or disapproval in this regard.at.in finding that the plaintiffs had standing we emphasized that t he interest asserted is simply not a generalized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance id.quoting valley forge christian coll.americans united for separation of church and state,d internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,we explained that s ince the right to advise and consent has been vested only in members of the legislature,and since only members of the legislature are bringing this action,the allegation that this right has been usurped is sufficiently personal to constitute an injury in fact,thus satisfying the minimum constitutional requirements of standing.id.
in a case of the same genre as dennis,silver concerned an allegedly unlawful veto by the governor of provisions of bills that the legislature passed with the plaintiff support,leading the court to describe the legislator plaintiff lawsuit as an attempt to uphold that legislative victory against a claimed unconstitutional use of the veto power nullifying his vote,at.thus,silver involved an alleged unlawful interference with the legislative process,not,as here,an allegedly unlawful interference with the operation of municipal ordinances which have the force of laws.the silver court was concerned that if it refused to review the governor veto the absence of judicial review could render a legislator vote meaningless and unnecessarily dilute one legislative responsibilities.id.at.thus,even laying to one side the circumstance that silver was a case in a state court not limited by the exacting federal standing requirements,silver is distinguishable from this case.
here,in contrast to dennis and silver,the city council appellants do not claim that they have been deprived of meaningful participation in the legislative process,or that they have been unable to exercise their rights as legislators.instead,the allegations in their complaint concern the city enforcement,or rather lack of enforcement,of the local ordinances that the council already had enacted and thus this case involves only generalized complaints about the functioning of government so that appellants have no different legally cognizable interest in the subject matter of the action than anyone else in philadelphia.
we have not overlooked appellants contention advanced during oral argument that the agreement,by exempting approximately of the billboards in philadelphia from the requirements of otherwise applicable local ordinances,renders it the functional equivalent of an amendment to or a repeal of sections of the philadelphia code but even if we were to agree with this disturbing characterization,which we acknowledge is not without force,there is no dispute that the ordinances which appellants claim have been amended or repealed constitute properly enacted legislation.indeed,appellants seek to enforce those ordinances as laws with which the billboard operators must comply and appellees do not claim that the council has repealed them.
in considering appellants standing problem we come back to the point that we emphasized in russell that once a bill has become law,a legislator interest in seeing that the law is followed is no different from a private citizen general interest in proper government.at.appellants allege facts in the complaint that concern the city alleged disobedience or flawed execution of the zoning ordinances for which city council members voted,and,as we held in russell,legislators lack standing to assert such claims.id.at.
appellants also refer to cohen rendell,and morris goode,but neither case is helpful in deciding the present appeal.first,we are concerned,of course,with whether the city council appellants,indeed all appellants,satisfy federal standing requirements,an issue that cohen and morris,like silver,which concerned standing in state court,could not address.second,though in cohen and morris the court found that the city council member plaintiffs had standing,in those cases the plaintiffs,unlike appellants here,challenged actions that affected the voting process by which ordinances are enacted.see cohen,at because cohen,as an elected,voting member of council,has a legal and direct interest in ensuring that council follows the voting procedures set forth by the charter,we hold that he does possess standing to bring his case against the city.morris,at w e note that the members,as council members,have a legal interest,granted by the home rule charter,in having a quorum present to vote on council resolutions,and that b ecause,on preliminary objections,we must assume that a quorum of council members were not present to ratify the negotiated contract,the conclusion must be that the members are aggrieved and have standing to vindicate their legal interests in this action.emphasis in original.
but in this case the city council appellants do not seek to enforce voting procedures by which the council enacts ordinances.instead,they seek to compel the enforcement of ordinances that the council has enacted.as we have explained,however,individual legislators do not have standing to assert claims based solely on the alleged disobedience or flawed execution of enacted legislation.see russell,at 
we have not overlooked the allegations of the complaint that go beyond seeking redress to the city council appellants on account of the alleged infringement of their function.the basis for relief is predicated on the provisions of the agreement providing that any disputes arising from the agreement are to be resolved through arbitration between the city and the billboard operators before a special master rather than through the usual prescribed process of being resolved in hearings before the philadelphia zoning board of adjustment zba.by reason of this procedure appellants claim to be deprived of the right to participate in hearings in which they otherwise could participate.appellants thus argue that the agreement removes the zba and the courts from any proceedings concerning the legality of the three billboard companies existing billboards.appellants br.at.appellants also argue that the agreement provides that adjudicating the legality of most public and intentionally conspicuous of land a private matter between the billboard companies and the law department,to be heard by a private arbitrator with no public participation or public notice.id.
these allegations concerning the elimination of the normal zba procedures for resolution of disputes arising from the agreement,like appellants arguments based on the city council appellants legislative function,fail to support the argument for the city council appellants having standing.no differently from the allegations concerning the alleged noncompliance with the applicable billboard use,size,and maintenance requirements,this aspect of the complaint fails to demonstrate how the alleged exception of the particular billboards covered by the agreement from the applicable zoning ordinances is causing appellants injury beyond that suffered by a private citizen or taxpayer seeking the proper functioning of the government.absent particularized injury resulting from the billboards and their alleged noncompliance with the applicable ordinances,we fail to see how the inability of the city council appellants and,for that matter,the other appellants to participate in disputes concerning those billboards causes them injury in fact sufficient to confer standing.
for these reasons,we conclude that the city council appellants lack standing to assert their claims in their capacity as legislators.see lujan,at.at.
whether appellants have standing as taxpayers 
appellants also argue that they have standing as taxpayers to bring the present action.though the taxpayer standing argument primarily includes lynn mcconville,the sole individual appellant in this case,we note that it probably extends to city council appellants as they likely are taxpayers.we question,however,whether appellants reliance on the taxpayer standing argument is only an afterthought,as their complaint does not allege that any appellant is a taxpayer in philadelphia or,for the matter,anywhere else.
in arguing that as taxpayers they have standing to sue,appellants refer to the philadelphia zoning code,which they cite for establishing the right for any aggrieved person to appear before the zba.appellants claim that t his statute confers individual rights on each plaintiff,including city council members,taxpayers,or community groups composed of taxpayers.appellants br.at.in making their argument,appellants mainly rely on society created to reduce urban blight scrub zoning board of adjustment of the city of philadelphia,in which the state court explained that the provision confer s standing to any taxpayer in philadelphia to challenge a decision of the board.id.at.
in considering appellants claim that they have standing as taxpayers,we reiterate that a party seeking to invoke the judicial power of the federal courts is subject to the standing requirements of article iii.see asarco kadish,d see also cantrell city of long beach,cir applying federal standing requirements to taxpayers lawsuit even though california state law permitted standing because california lenient taxpayer standing requirements do not relieve the plaintiffs of the obligation to establish a direct injury under the more stringent federal requirements for state and municipal taxpayer standing.thus,even if pennsylvania state law would have afforded appellants standing if they had brought this action in state court,we must ensure that they satisfy the federal requirements for standing as well 
the complaint alleges that mcconville is a resident of philadelphia,o ne of the billboards implicated in this action,located at woodland avenue,is directly visible from her property,and she has appeared as an objector at zba hearings at which the billboard company operating the billboards withdrew its appeal of the city denial of a zoning permit for those billboards.app.at.the complaint,however,does not include allegations adequately explaining how implementation of the terms of the agreement injures mcconville.thus,though the complaint alleges that pursuant to the agreement the listed billboards are freed from the use,size,and maintenance requirements of the zoning ordinances,it does not explain how these particular exclusions from the zoning ordinances constitute an injury in fact,an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,with respect to mcconville.lujan,at.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the complaint failure to allege that the agreement and its implementation injured mcconville beyond the generalized injury that all persons in philadelphia suffered by reason of it is critical,for,as we explained in russell,t he supreme court has consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about only harm to his and every citizen interest in proper application of the constitution and laws,and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at not state an article iii case or controversy.at quoting lujan,at.at.thus,mcconville does not have standing as a taxpayer and for the same reason the city council appellants as taxpayers do not have standing 
in addition to arguing that as taxpayers they are entitled to appear before the zba,appellants argue that the council plaintiffs were deprived of their legal right to petition city council concerning the amendments to zoning ordinances sought via the settlement agreement,referring to philadelphia home rule charter.appellants br.at.appellants again characterize the agreement as new legislation and claim that d efendants stripped plaintiffs of their right of access to the courts,to debate and vote on laws,and to comment on proposed laws,without any notice or opportunity to be heard.id.at.but the problem with appellants argument is that,as is true with respect to their contention that they have standing based on the elimination of zba proceedings,they fail to identify sufficient injury from the alleged noncompliance of the billboards with the applicable ordinances to give them standing.thus,even if we characterized the agreement as appellants do,as legislation,without sufficient allegations concerning the injury they suffer from the noncompliance of the noncomplying billboards with the duly enacted ordinances,we do not see how their inability to participate in the negotiation of the agreement injured them.
appellants argue that the mere circumstance that their injury is of a general nature should not lead to a dismissal of their claims.in this regard they cite clinton city of new york,d,which states 
it is a proposition that more than one party may have standing to challenge a particular action or inaction.once it is determined that a particular plaintiff is harmed by the defendant,and that the harm will likely be redressed by a favorable decision,that plaintiff has of whether there are others who would also have standing to sue.
id.at.at.appellants lack standing,however,not because the alleged injuries they suffer are widely felt,but because their injuries are no different in nature from the general interest in enforcing compliance with the law which the public shares.see russell,at.
we note appellants argument that n umerous courts have held that governmental defendants may not settle litigation by agreeing to terms that exceed their authority or invade the rights of third parties,and that they cite to a number of cases to support that proposition.appellants br.at citing cleveland county ass for gov t by the people cleveland county bd.of comm rs,executive bus.media,dep t of defense,cir people who care rockford bd.of educ.sch.dist,cir kasper bd.of election comm rs of the city of chicago,cir dunn carey,cir united states brown sons,in re prudential ins.of am.sales practices.
in each of these cases,however,the court either did not address the issue of standing or found that the plaintiffs had standing to assert their claims based on circumstances inapplicable here so that the cases are distinguishable from this case and are not guides to us here.see cleveland county ass for gov t by the people,at holding unincorporated association of voters within county had standing to challenge consent degree concerning method for electing county commissioners because its members have been denied the opportunity to vote for a full slate of the elected officials of their choice which the court described as members protected voting rights executive bus.media,at discussing challenge brought by company competing for government contract against settlement agreement between government and competitor in which competitor was awarded contract people who care,at discussing challenge brought by unions against consent degree that would undo certain provisions in applicable collective bargaining agreements kasper,at discussing challenge brought by parties who submitted proposed consent decree to district court for voter registration procedures after district court declined to enter proposed consent decree dunn,at affirming district court decision not to join to federal case individuals who were parties in separate state action challenging federal consent decree entered as part of federal case brown sons.at,discussing challenge which intervening parties in related action brought against proposed consent decree proposed by the parties in the case in re prudential.at,discussing challenge by party in action consolidated in mdl case to proposed settlement agreement.
appellants also refer to league of residential neighborhood advocates city of los angeles,cir.there,the city of los angeles entered a settlement agreement with an orthodox jewish congregation granting the congregation a conditional use permit subject to numerous restrictive conditions to operate a synagogue in a residential use zone.id.at.in an action that neighbors of the synagogue brought challenging the settlement,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that the agreement violated municipal zoning laws and therefore was unenforceable.id.at.in doing so,however,the court of appeals did not address the question of whether the plaintiffs had standing to assert their claims.see id.at.this omission seems understandable,as the neighbors surely would be impacted directly by a large public facility located near them and accordingly would suffer a particularized injury from the operation of the facility very different from that of the general public.in the circumstances we do not consider that case to be useful in determining whether appellants have standing in the present action.
in addition,appellants argue that keith volpe,cir,a case like league of residential advocates from the court of appeals of the ninth circuit,should guide our analysis.in keith an advertising billboard developer who was not a party in a case leading to entry of a federal consent decree involving a freeway appealed from the
