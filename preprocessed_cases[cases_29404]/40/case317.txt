plaintiffs were employees of a government agency in puerto rico.after being dismissed,they brought suit for political discrimination in violation of the first amendment.they sought,among other things,reinstatement to their former positions.by the time plaintiffs obtained a jury verdict in their favor,their former employer no longer existed,and its assets had been transferred by the legislature to another entity,the puerto rico trade and export company comex.comex moved to intervene,but the district court denied the motion while still ordering the remedy of reinstatement.in an earlier appeal,we vacated the district court denial of comex motion for intervention and reversed the judgment of the district court awarding the plaintiffs reinstatement.on remand,the district court permitted comex to intervene,but again imposed the reinstatement remedy against it.
on appeal,comex argues that the district court should not have enforced the reinstatement remedy against it for two reasons.first,comex argues that reinstatement was not available as a remedy,because the district court previously dismissed the claims against the defendants and is barred from revisiting that order by the law of the case doctrine.second,comex argues that reinstatement could not be ordered against it because it was not a party to the litigation and can not be substituted for a party under federal rule of civil procedure c or d.
finding no error in the district court rejection of these claims,we affirm.
because we have stated the facts of this case in our previous decisions this is the third appeal in this case,we only briefly recapitulate them here.see santiago,cir santiago,cir discussing evidence presented in first trial.plaintiffs maribel,aracelis,and nilda collectively plaintiffs were career employees of puerto rico commercial development administration cda.after general elections in produced a change in political leadership,carlos gabriel santiago santiago was appointed as director of the cda.santiago and a subordinate,susana hernandez,dismissed the plaintiffs from their jobs.
in april,plaintiffs brought suit against santiago in his official and personal capacities and susana hernandez in her personal capacity collectively defendants the complaint asserted,inter alia,that the defendants had violated by terminating the plaintiffs from their positions at cda on the basis of their membership in an opposition political party,in violation of the first amendment.discovery was conducted and both sides moved for summary judgment.on march,the district court entered summary judgment the march,order dismissing the section claim brought against santiago in his official capacity,concluding that sovereign immunity precluded the claim 
the remaining claims went to trial,and the district court twice granted motions for judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants.see.a.plaintiffs appealed,and we affirmed in part and reversed in part,concluding that the evidence was sufficient for several of the plaintiffs claims to go to the jury.see,at.notably,plaintiffs did not appeal the district court earlier entry of summary judgment in favor of santiago on the section claim brought against him in his official capacity.
the case was retried,and the jury found for the plaintiffs on the section claim,awarding them both compensatory and punitive damages.plaintiffs then moved the district court to award the equitable relief sought in the complaint,including reinstatement to career positions equal or similar to positions they would have occupied if they had not been unlawfully terminated.defendants opposed the request for equitable relief,arguing that reinstatement was inappropriate because no public officer remained in the case.defendants also pointed out that during the pendency of the litigation,cda had been dissolved and replaced with a new public corporation,comex,which had eliminated plaintiffs former positions.the court denied the defendants motion and,on april,entered judgment ordering the plaintiffs reinstatement the april,judgment.
defendants subsequently moved to clarify the april,judgment,again drawing the district court attention to the fact that it had previously dismissed the claims from the case,and the remedy of reinstatement was unavailable against the individual defendants.comex moved to intervene as of right,see.a,arguing that it had only recently learned of the suit,that cda had not adequately represented its interests in the litigation,and that it had an interest in the action and would suffer undue prejudice if forced to reinstate plaintiffs.simultaneously,comex filed a provisional motion with the district court to alter or amend the april,judgment,or in the alternative to vacate it see.e,b.comex argued that judgment could not be enforced against it,see,and that the controversy was moot in light of the dissolution of the cda.the district court dismissed comex motion to intervene as untimely,ruling that its march,order,see supra note,had left reinstatement within the realm of remedial possibilities,and concluding that the order should have apprised comex that its interests might be affected.
on appeal,we vacated the district court denial of intervention.see,at.we noted that the march,order had unambiguously dismissed the claim against santiago and removed the reinstatement remedy from the case.thus,comex had no reason to believe that its interests,as opposed to the interests of the individual defendants,were implicated in the ongoing litigation.id.at.we remanded the matter to the district court,and expressly left open the possibility that 
the plaintiffs,on remand,may seek to vacate or amend the pertinent provision of the march order so as to revive the issue of reinstatement.should such a motion be made,the district court shall first reconsider comex motion for intervention.thereafter,it shall afford the intervenor and the defendants an opportunity to be heard on the motion to vacate amend.
in that regard,the court shall consider,among other things,that in their earlier appeal to this court the plaintiffs could have,but did not,mount a challenge to the march,order.thus,the court will have to determine whether that foregone opportunity precludes it from revisiting the march,order.
id.at internal citations omitted.
on remand,comex again moved to intervene and to alter or amend the april,judgment.in the latter motion,comex argued that the district court could not revisit its march,order because the order now constituted the law of the case.even if the district court could revisit the order,comex argued,the district court could not enforce reinstatement against comex.in response,plaintiffs asked the court to revisit the march,order,permit them to reintroduce the claim for reinstatement into the case,and enforce a judgment against comex under federal rule of civil procedure c,which governs substitution of parties in cases where a party transfers an interest during litigation.
the district court granted comex motion to intervene and denied its motion to alter or amend the april,judgment ordering reinstatement of the plaintiffs.the district court agreed that the march,order constituted the law of the case,but concluded that it could nonetheless revisit the order under the manifest injustice exception to that doctrine.the court then determined that reinstatement was an appropriate equitable remedy for the plaintiffs section claim,and that judgment could be enforced against comex pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.
comex appeals.it argues that the law of the case doctrine barred the district court from revisiting the march,order,and that the reinstatement remedy could not be enforced against it under rules c or d.
we turn first to comex contention that the district court erred in revisiting the march,order.we then address comex argument that the reinstatement remedy can not be enforced against it.
