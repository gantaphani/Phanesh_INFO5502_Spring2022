opinion of the court 
on july,sharpe james,newly as mayor of newark,new jersey,issued a mandate in his inaugural speech that,to improve morale,all fire companies in the newark fire department would be eliminated the racial composition of each of the fire companies was thereafter examined,and dozens of firefighters were involuntarily transferred to different companies solely on the basis of their race.in january,mayor james announced that w e have created a rainbow at each firehouse.at.the firefighters sued,and lost.
it is important at the outset to note what this case is not about.this case is not about whether diverse workplaces are desirable.it is not disputed that they are.neither is this case about a remedy for unlawful past discrimination because,again,it is not disputed that there was no unlawful discrimination in the past.and this case is not about whether the numbers of minority firefighters being hired are satisfying hiring goals.rather,this case is about whether the city of newark may employ a transfer and assignment policy when any racial imbalance in the fire companies is not the result of past intentional discrimination by the city.we hold that it may not and,accordingly,will reverse the district court entry of judgment for the defendants.
background and procedural history 
in,the united states filed a complaint against the state of new jersey,several new jersey officials,the city of newark,and eleven other new jersey cities alleging a pattern or practice of discrimination in the hiring and promotion of minority firefighters.a consent decree resolving the united states claims was approved and entered by the district court in.the consent decree did not contain a finding that any unlawful discrimination had occurred,but did require the various defendants to undertake affirmative action to increase substantially the proportion of black and hispanic personnel on their respective fire departments.with respect to the newark fire department,the decree called for an interim goal of at least of all vacancies to be filled with qualified minority candidates.
fifteen years passed,and in,the newark city council hired samuel rosenfarb,a certified public accountant,to determine statistical compliance with the consent decree.at.rosenfarb reported his findings to the council in a december report,which indicated that of the fire department uniformed employees were white,were black,and were hispanic.he also reported that of promotions granted between and,were given to white employees,to black employees and three to hispanic employees.in conducting his analysis,rosenfarb noticed that the companies were significantly homogenous either black or white.id.his report noted that of the companies had a majority of white personnel with being comprised entirely of white personnel.fifteen of the companies were predominantly black only one had a majority of hispanics.the remaining eleven companies did not contain a majority of any one group.at.
the city took no action with respect to the existence of fire companies for another seven years.then,in july,mayor james,apparently out of the blue,ordered that all fire houses,companies,in the newark fire department be integrated to improve morale and to honor a court order to make our fire department the mirror of the city of newark id.at.with reference to the former,we note,there is no evidence that morale needed improving with reference to the latter,the year old consent decree required no such thing.
the mayor appointed the department former affirmative action specialist,edward dunham,as the new director of the fire department,and charged him with implementing this diversification order.id.at.dunham,in turn,directed fire chief lowell jones to diversify the fire companies.in a november,letter to chief jones,dunham directed jones to formulate a mass departmental transfer list.id.at.jones did so,and in so doing,tried to achieve an element of diversity as well as assign department personnel as per their specialized training.id.at.he also considered the need to maintain a high degree of readiness in the face of world domestic terrorist threats.id.in his memorandum to dunham,he noted that u nits that have been training together and that have achieved a high level of efficiency were maintained and where we could comply with diversity we did so.id.
dunham asked battalion chief raymond wallace to review jones list,and wallace determined that the list would not achieve the mandated diversity.he noted in a memorandum to dunham that i f chief jones transfer list were to be used,there would be companies all caucasian and companies african american.this list does not meet the directive and is unsatisfactory.id.at emphasis in original.accordingly,wallace proposed an alternative transfer list that would achieve diversity.dunham accepted wallace proposal.on january,dunham issued executive order assignments,in which he announced a list of transfers effective at hours on friday,january,and stated that f uture transfer requests will not be accepted until further notice.id.at.
firefighters who were involuntarily transferred or denied requests to transfer due to the new policy,together with the newark firefighters union and the newark fire officers union,brought this action against the city of newark,mayor james,and three officials of the newark fire department,challenging the constitutionality of the policy under the equal protection clause title vii of the civil rights act of,et and the new jersey civil rights act.following a bench trial,the district court dismissed their claims and entered judgment for defendants.this timely appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.because the diversity policy is a classification,it must pass strict scrutiny it must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest.see johnson california,d explaining that racial classifications receive close scrutiny even when they may be said to burden or benefit the races equally.quoting shaw reno,d.the district court found that the policy satisfied both prongs of this test.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.contractors ass of eastern city of philadelphia,cir.the existence of a compelling state interest,however,is a question of law that is subject to plenary review.id.
iii.analysis 
the city argues that it has three somewhat interwoven compelling interests in implementing the diversity policy.first,it argues that it has a compelling interest in eliminating de facto segregation in the fire department.second,it contends that there is a compelling interest in securing the educational,sociological and job performance benefits of diverse fire companies.finally,it argues that the policy is required by the consent decree,compliance with which constitutes a compelling interest.as we have already suggested,we are not persuaded by these arguments.we will address each in turn.
remedying past discrimination 
it is well settled that a government has a compelling interest in remedying its own past discrimination.see,united states paradise,d.accordingly,it may employ racial classifications to cure racial only if it can prove that it engaged in prior intentional discrimination or was a passive participant in a third party discrimination.richmond croson,d.r preferences can not be justified by reference to past societal discrimination in which the municipality played no material role.contractors ass n,at see also shaw hunt,d rejecting racial classifications to alleviate the effects of societal discrimination in the absence of findings of past discrimination,and to promote minority representation in congress richmond,at,d wygant jackson bd.of,d rejecting racial classifications in a teacher layoff policy aimed at providing minority role models for students and alleviating past societal discrimination.
the city does not even suggest that it participated,directly or passively,in any form of discrimination indeed,it concedes that it neither intentionally discriminated against minority firefighters with respect to assignments or transfers,nor intentionally segregated firefighters i
