opinion of the court 
the controversy now before this court presents aspects of litigation that has,over the past decade,engaged both the united states bankruptcy court for new jersey and,in two different law suits,the united states district court for new jersey.the current appeal by filomena peloro seeks review of the district court decision in the second of the two suits brought before that court.in that suit,filed on september,peloro sought to recover certain securities in accounts that had been maintained by first interregional equity corporation fiec,a registered securities brokerage firm which was the subject of liquidation proceedings initiated in by the securities and exchange commission sec,pursuant to the securities investor protection act sipa,et.
peloro suit alleged that the united states and the federal bureau of investigation federal defendants had improperly seized and retained custody of several securities.she also alleged that richard hill trustee,the trustee in the fiec liquidation proceedings,and research,had,in contravention of state law,converted the securities.peloro sought return of the securities and associated relief.
the district court granted the federal defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and granted summary judgment in favor of the trustee and on the basis of claim and issue preclusion.it is from these rulings that peloro appeals.
to put this appeal in understandable context,we begin by outlining the underlying facts and next we describe the somewhat tortuous course of the litigation.we then turn to an analysis of the issues posed by the appeal.
filomena peloro maintained both an individual account and a joint account in her name and the name of her father,donato peloro,who is now deceased,at fiec.on or about october,peloro mailed four securities to her sales representative at fiec millburn,new jersey,office.
in march,the sec commenced an action against fiec in the united states district court for the district of new jersey,alleging fiec participation in a fraudulent scheme and seeking protection for fiec customers under sipa.as part of the government investigation,the fbi seized the four securities peloro had mailed to fiec millburn branch.the securities were contained in a single envelope and had not been allocated to any fiec customer account when the fbi seized them.
the four securities are described in the record as follows ashland ga urfa due,registered to donato peloro filomena peloro for customer name security ashland cty ohio due,registered to bearer for ashland brevard cty due,registered to bearer for brevard coleman hsg dev due,registered to bearer for coleman the first of these is a customer name security under security that is held for a customer account on the date that the sipa action is filed,is registered in the customer name,and is only negotiable by the customer.see.the other three are bearer bonds or certificated securities which are negotiable by any bearer.
on march,in response to a filing by the securities investor protection corporation sipc,the district court decreed that fiec customers were in need of protection under sipa,see b,appointed richard hill,as trustee for the liquidation of fiec business,see id.b,and removed the case to the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey.see id.b upon the issuance of a protective decree and appointment of a trustee,the court shall forthwith order the removal of the entire liquidation proceeding to the court of the united states in the same judicial district having jurisdiction over cases under title.see also in re first interreg l equity,recounting procedural history of fiec case.
after removal to the bankruptcy court,the trustee published notice of the liquidation of fiec business on may,and mailed the appropriate notice and claim forms in accordance with a.the may liquidation notice advised that,in accordance with a and a may order of the bankruptcy court,no claims would be allowed unless filed within six months of the date of the is,no later than november,the bar date.the customer claim form specified that a separate claim form should be filed for each account.
the parties agree that peloro received actual notice with respect to her individual account.on july,she filed a timely customer claim for her individual account the trustee valued the individual account at and satisfied it in full.however,peloro did not receive actual notice of the liquidation or the bar date in regard to her joint account,because that account was empty at the time the notice and claim forms were sent.see,app.b ecause there were no positions or activity in peloro joint account,the joint account did not satisfy the criteria for being mailed a claim package.a.
as noted above,none of the four disputed securities had been deposited into either of peloro accounts prior to the institution of the sipa liquidation proceedings.on or about july,than two months after the notice and claim forms had been mailed to fiec fbi returned peloro seized securities to the trustee by forwarding them to,a firm which the trustee had retained to assist with the liquidation of fiec.all four three bearer bonds and the one customer name then allocated by appellees and the trustee to peloro joint account because all were contained in the same envelope and the customer name security was registered jointly to peloro and her father,donato peloro peloro was advised by the letter dated november,file any outstanding claims by the november bar date.the letter did not,however,refer specifically to the joint account.see app.peloro did not submit any claims for the four securities,or for her joint account more generally,before the bar date.she contends that,as an elderly woman without technical training,she did not know anything about the location or disposition of the securities until july.
on july,as required by c,peloro customer name security was returned to her.peloro claims that it was on receipt of the accompanying letter that she realized for the first time that the trustee or the fbi was in possession of the remaining securities,the three bearer bonds.by letter dated october,two years after the bar.peloro filed an informal proof of claim for two bonds totalling,face value.the trustee assumed this referred to the ashland and coleman securities two of the certificated securities,with a face value totaling,see supra text at note 
on february,the trustee issued a notice informing peloro that the two ashland and coleman been deposited into her joint account,but that her claim for these bonds was disallowed as untimely.peloro never received correspondence regarding the third bearer bond,but states that she learned in june that it had also been deposited in her joint account.
subsequent to her discovery of the location of her securities and the trustee rejection of her claim for those securities as untimely,peloro engaged in litigation in two fora,seeking the return of her securities.first,she appeared in the ongoing sipa liquidation proceedings in the bankruptcy court,seeking to have the trustee decision denying her claim overturned.second,she filed an independent lawsuit in the district court,seeking to establish her ownership interest in the securities and to have the securities returned.
litigation over the bearer bonds in the bankruptcy court 
on june,the trustee filed a motion asking the bankruptcy court to affirm his rejection of peloro claim for the ashland and coleman securities as untimely.peloro filed an objection to the trustee motion.
following a hearing on october,the bankruptcy court affirmed the trustee disposition of peloro claim in an order dated december.in its companion oral opinion,the bankruptcy court found that the ashland and coleman bonds at issue were customer property held by fiec for peloro account.the court noted that customer property,as defined by sipa,includes not only securities actually allocated to customer accounts,but any cash and securities at any time received,acquired,or held for the securities account of a customer,app.a quoting.finding that the ashland and coleman securities were sent to fiec by peloro and received and held there for her account,although not allocated to the joint account until a later date in time,the court held that they were properly customer property under sipa,app.
the bankruptcy court observed that this finding was critical,since securities properly designated as customer property were subject to sipa mandatory and absolute bar date.because peloro did not file a claim as to the joint account on or before the bar date of november,the court found that her claim for the ashland and coleman securities was untimely.the court further held that it lacked equitable authority to allow a claim,and that peloro claim for the joint account could not be considered an amendment to her individual account claim.
finally,noting that peloro had asked the bankruptcy court to preserve her rights to pursue her claims on the joint account in her district court action,app,the bankruptcy court concluded 
as to issues of preservation of her claims,the court notes that for purposes of this decision the limited issue before the court is whether or not to affirm the sipa trustee determination of claim and the objections filed thereto.by this decision the court has determined to affirm the trustee determination.
as to peloro request regarding the district court action,that request is not properly before this court.the court declines to assert jurisdiction over claims that are before another court of competent jurisdiction.
app.while the bankruptcy court did not assert jurisdiction over the unlawful conversion claims presented in the district court action or conduct the evidentiary proceeding peloro had requested,it did address the status of the securities in them to be customer property subject to a predicate to affirming the trustee determination that peloro claim was untimely.see discussion supra.peloro did not appeal the bankruptcy court determination.
litigation over the bearer bonds in district court 
as noted above,while her objection to the trustee disposition of her claim was pending in the fiec liquidation proceedings in bankruptcy court,peloro also commenced an action in the district court.after the bankruptcy court affirmed the trustee determination that peloro claim was untimely,peloro continued to press her district court claim seeking return of the certificated securities the ashland,brevard and coleman bonds and other relief.as amended october,her district court complaint named the trustee,and also the united states and the fbi as defendants.as to the federal defendants,peloro sought the return of the securities seized by the fbi a on a theory of unlawful conversion and b pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure g,which states that one aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure or by the deprivation of property may move for the property return.g.peloro also asserted a claim for unlawful conversion against the trustee and,based on their allegedly unauthorized transfer of her personal property the certificated securities into the bankruptcy estate of fiec,which action allegedly deprived her of the ability to bring a timely sipa claim for the certificated securities.
on october,the district court dismissed peloro complaint with prejudice.as to the defendants,the court granted summary judgment on the grounds that,based on the prior proceedings in the bankruptcy court,both claim preclusion and issue preclusion barred peloro conversion claim against the trustee,while issue preclusion barred her claim against.as to the federal defendants,the court granted a b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,concluding that no relief could be granted because the federal defendants could not return the securities which they no longer possessed,and sovereign immunity barred any award of money damages against the federal defendants.
peloro filed a timely appeal of the district court october,final order.
sipa vests exclusive jurisdiction over any suit against the sipa trustee with respect to a liquidation proceeding in the federal court in which the sipc filed its application for a protective this case,the new jersey district court.b a.however,the trustee and,contended in the district court that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over peloro claim against the trustee instead,they argued,the exclusive jurisdiction conferred by b a was transferred to the new jersey bankruptcy court by virtue of the district court order removing the sipa liquidation proceedings to the bankruptcy court.although appellees do not press this argument on appeal,every federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the district court in a cause under review,even though the parties are prepared to concede it.bender williamsport area sch,d internal quotation marks omitted.we need not linger over the issue,however,as we are persuaded by the district court thorough jurisdictional analysis.see,app.concluding that,b y referring the sipa matter to a bankruptcy court,the district court does not divest itself of jurisdiction,but rather confers concurrent jurisdiction on the bankruptcy court see also trefny bear stearns sec,because congress could not have intended to extend a bankruptcy court jurisdictional reach beyond permissible bounds,congress did not intend the exclusive jurisdiction provision in b to preclude the litigation of every case involving the sipa in a forum other than a bankruptcy court.
as to the federal defendants,the district court had subject matter jurisdiction because peloro claims were filed in part under rule g of the federal rules of criminal procedure.such an action is treated as a civil proceeding for equitable relief,united states bein,cir,and the district court has jurisdiction over the action under.see also united states martinson,cir a district court has jurisdiction to entertain rule g motions to return property seized by the government even when there are no criminal proceedings pending against the movant.

peloro raises two claims on appeal.first,she challenges the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the trustee and second,she challenges the district court dismissal of her amended complaint as to the federal defendants.for the reasons stated below,we will affirm the district court rulings.
we begin with peloro challenge to the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of and the trustee on the unlawful conversion claim.peloro amended complaint alleges that 
t he unauthorized deposit of her securities into an account without notice to plaintiff and without authorization from the plaintiff which action resulted in plaintiff being unable to bring a timely sipa claim for return of the certificated securities constituted an unlawful conversion of her property into property of the bankruptcy estate,
am.compl,and that,a s a result of the continued deprivation of plaintiff property by defendants,she has suffered damages.am.compl.
the district court held that the findings of the bankruptcy court in the prior proceeding precluded a district court finding in peloro favor,and hence granted the motion of the trustee and for summary judgment.the district court based its holding on both claim and issue preclusion.we find that issue preclusion suffices to bar peloro claim for unlawful conversion.we do not,therefore,address questions of claim preclusion.
summary judgment is required where the pleadings and evidence in the record show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.however,in considering such a motion,the court must neither resolve factual disputes nor make judgme
