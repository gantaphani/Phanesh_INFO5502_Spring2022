robert dwan joined the boston police department in as an officer he has been a sergeant since.on the evening of january,dwan was on patrol with his partner kenneth conley.a broadcast over the police radio reported a robbery at a boston nightclub and,mistakenly,that a police officer had been shot.several police cars pursued the suspects.the chase ended at a cul de sac where the suspects ran from their car and were chased on foot.one of the first officers on the scene was michael cox,an undercover officer dressed in plainclothes.dwan and conley arrived in the fifth car on the scene.cox pursued one of the suspects to a fence at one end of the cul de sac.the suspect climbed over the fence,but as cox started to climb after him,he was pulled down by unidentified police officers and beaten severely.
the department immediately launched an investigation into the cox beating.dwan initially cooperated,filing a report in march,describing his actions on the night in question and claiming that he did not see which officers assaulted michael cox because he dwan was at the other end of the cul de sac assisting in the arrest of another suspect.officer joseph horton corroborated dwan story,stating that he horton assisted in the arrest and saw dwan assisting as well.an internal affairs officer expressed himself satisfied.
nevertheless,the department continued to question dwan.this was partly because no officer ever admitted to beating cox or seeing anyone else do so,but also because dwan version of events was at odds with other evidence.a security guard who was in michael cox car stated that he was present when the second suspect was arrested and that no one fitting dwan description assisted in the arrest.in addition,officer richard walker testified that he saw two officers matching conley and dwan descriptions not far from where cox was beaten.
in may,dwan was called before a federal grand jury investigating the cox beating as a potential civil rights violation.dwan was not given immunity in this proceeding and refused to testify,invoking his fifth amendment right against.he was again subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury in october.his attorney told the prosecutor that dwan would again invoke the fifth amendment if he was not given immunity,and the prosecutor withdrew the subpoena.
eight days later,on october,dwan was placed on administrative leave with pay.police commissioner paul evans said in a letter that the decision had been made for the efficiency of the department and should not be considered disciplinary action.in january,the department charged dwan with violating regulations in numerous respects,filing a false report in regard to the cox beating.the department scheduled four hearings over the next year regarding these charges,but cancelled all of them,and the complaint was ultimately abandoned.
dwan remained on administrative leave for eighteen months october.while on leave,he was paid his regular salary but could not work overtime or special assignments dwan claims that the forgone income totaled between and percent of his base salary.he was reinstated in march after passing the second of two polygraph examinations indicating that he did not participate in the cox beating and did not see who did participate.since his reinstatement,dwan alleges that the department has denied his requests to work special assignments and to be transferred to another district.
on march,dwan brought suit for damages in federal court against the department,police commissioner evans,and deputy superintendent thomas dowd who oversaw the cox investigation in pertinent part,dwan complaint alleged that the defendants violated,his first,fifth,and fourteenth amendment rights,which are subject to redress under,and the massachusetts civil rights act.laws ch.his wife and children also sued the defendants for loss of consortium.laws ch.
the defendants moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted on all counts except dwan fifth amendment claim and the claim under the massachusetts civil rights act,which depends on the fifth amendment claim.as to this claim,the district court held that taking all factual inferences in favor of dwan,a reasonable jury could conclude that his right against was wrongfully burdened by the defendants actions which could constitute a scheme of harassment designed to chill his fifth amendment rights and to coerce dwan into incriminating himself.the court also held that dwan fifth amendment rights were clearly established so qualified immunity was unavailable.
the individual defendants have appealed from the order denying qualified immunity.an interlocutory appeal lies from such a denial,mitchell forsyth,d,at least to the extent that the qualified immunity defense turns upon a purely legal question.fletcher town of clinton,cir.in such an instance,our review is,of course,de novo.suboh dist.attorney office,cir.if qualified immunity is denied because the district court finds a disputed issue of fact reserved for trial,interlocutory review as to that ruling is not available.diaz martinez,cir.
under law,the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity for official action unless their conduct violated dwan constitutional rights and,in addition,the law to this effect was clearly established under law so that a reasonable police officer would have known that his behavior was unlawful.saucier katz,d.saucier contemplates,although with possible exceptions not pertinent here,see dirrane brookline police dep t,cir,that the reviewing court should begin with the former question.
the inquiry is simplified,but only partly,by the defendants concession for purposes of this appeal that dwan was placed on administrative leave because he pleaded or threatened to plead the fifth amendment before the federal grand jury.this concession confirms what would otherwise have been a plausible but not inevitable inference from the timing of events that the administrative leave decision was prompted at least in part by dwan action in taking the fifth amendment and not solely by an unrelated determination that he should be investigated internally for misconduct.
in a set of decisions in the late and in the,the supreme court held that public employees could not be coerced into waiving their fifth amendment rights most of the cases involved public employees who were fired or otherwise penalized for pleading the fifth amendment after being advised that this action would automatically result in such penalty.although the supreme court has not recently revisited the garrity line of cases,a number of the circuits including this one have focused on the coercion issue emphasized by the court in those cases,making it a claim dependent on such a showing 
further,this circuit has held that coercion is lacking so long as the employee was never threatened or forewarned of any sanction for refusing to testify,even though the employee suffers adverse action as a result of refusing to cooperate.see singer,at cir indorato,at.here,no one told dwan that if he pled the fifth amendment before the grand jury,he would be placed on administrative leave.nor does he allege any regulation or settled practice to that effect.united states friedrick.
there are perhaps no a few circuits that assume that official retaliation against someone for pleading the fifth amendment could be a violation eve
