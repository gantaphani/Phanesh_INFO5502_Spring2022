a federal statute bars employment in the executive branch of citizens and resident aliens who were required to register for the draft with the selective service system and who knowingly and willfully did not do so before age.in the district court,four plaintiffs,who are male united states citizens over age,sought to challenge this statutory bar on constitutional grounds,failed on the merits,and now appeal.
the statutory bar reads as follows 
an individual 
who was born after december,and is or was required to register under section of the military selective service act.and 
who is not so registered or knowingly and willfully did not so register before the requirement terminated or became inapplicable to the individual,
shall be ineligible for appointment to a position in an executive agency.
a section of the military selective service act,stat,as amended,app,empowers the president to require every male citizen and male resident alien between the ages of eighteen and to register for the draft.in,president carter reinstituted the registration requirements for young men.proclamation,reprinted as amended in app.app.at.
the office of personnel management opm,which manages civil service employment in the executive branch,has adopted corresponding regulations.these regulations provide that a civil service employee who was required to register 
will be terminated by his agency under the authority of the statute and these regulations if he has not registered as required,unless he registers or unless,if no longer eligible to register,opm determines in response to his explanation that his failure to register was neither knowing nor willful.
three of the plaintiffs in this case were discharged by their federal agencies when it was discovered that they had not registered although required to do so the fourth resigned when confronted with his failure to register and says that his resignation was forced by the statutory bar.none of the four presently challenges the premise that his failure to register was knowing or willful,and none sought to pursue to the end the statutory remedies prescribed for civil service employees who dispute their removals.
instead,the plaintiffs brought an original action in the district court seeking reinstatement and claiming that the statutory bar is unconstitutional the grounds asserted are that it is both a forbidden bill of attainder under article i,section,clause of the constitution and,because it applies to men but not women,an unlawful discrimination under the equal protection component of the fifth amendment.the latter claim has already been rejected by the supreme court,rostker goldberg,but the plaintiffs may intend to ask the court to revisit the ruling.
in the district court,the government asserted that the claims were barred because the plaintiffs had a statutory route to dispute their removals or forced resignation and that this route was intended by congress to be exclusive for cases covered by the statutory remedy.this statutory remedy,which will be described in more detail hereafter,ordinarily leads through the merit systems protection board mspb or board and,on judicial review,to the court of appeals for the federal circuit.three of the four plaintiffs did not pursue this avenue one did but abandoned it after an adverse decision by the mspb administrative law judge.
the district court declined to dismiss the action on jurisdictional grounds,initially sided with the plaintiffs on the bill of attainder issue,and ultimately reversed ground and decided against the plaintiffs on their constitutional claims.elgin united states,d,vacated,d.the plaintiffs now seek review in this court the government continues to argue both that the district court had no jurisdiction and that,if it did,the statutory bar is constitutional.an objection to subject matter jurisdiction takes priority,and we begin and end with that issue.
ordinarily,and as a default remedy,a district court has authority as a federal court of general to various limitations to consider claims against federal government officials that they are acting unconstitutionally and should be enjoined.see larson domestic foreign commerce.suits against the federal government itself or its departments the plaintiffs target here are complicated by sovereign immunity considerations,see,fdic meyer,but the government has invoked no such defense in this case,see edelman jordan.
instead,the government argues the exclusive remedy for the removal or forced resignation of the four plaintiffs is provided by the civil service reform act csra,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of.the csra scheme,set forth in title,chapter,subchapter ii and augmented by regulations,allows certain employees in the civil service including those such as the plaintiffs in the competitive service to seek review if they are removed for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,a the route prescribed is by appeal to the mspb and,if dissatisfied with the result,appeal to the federal circuit,whose decisions in turn are reviewable by the supreme court 
although the csra does not in terms describe this scheme as exclusive of other remedies,congress intended the scheme at least where it applies and provides a mechanism for administrative and judicial review and relief to be exclusive of ordinary district court actions to challenge a removal.the supreme court has suggested that this is so,united states fausto,see also bush lucas,we have recognized it to be so,berrios dep t of the army,cir and the legislative history bears out this intention,at,reprinted in.
the plaintiffs do not contest the view that the statutory route,where it applies,is the exclusive remedy for an employee challenging removal but they argue that the government has taken inconsistent positions and that,in any event,for various reasons the statutory remedy is not available to them.however,the statutory route does in fact give the plaintiffs a route to direct review of their constitutional claims by an article iii court congress intended that route to be exclusive in removal cases and,despite some confusion in the precedents,both literal language and congress policy require that result.
first,the plaintiffs suggest that the government objection is foreclosed because a it resisted efforts by one of the plaintiffs to raise this very kind of claim through the mspb route,and b it has raised the subject matter jurisdiction claim only on reconsideration in the district court.but,as it turns out,the government is within its rights to raise the objection subject matter jurisdiction claims are not waivable and may be raised for the first time even on direct appeal.h united states cotton.
failure to exhaust administrative remedies is a waivable objection.global naps,verizon new eng,cir.but,if the csra remedy is available and intended to be exclusive,it does not prescribe some administrative step required before resorting to district court,woodford.ngo,rather,the remedy displaces the plenary district court action entirely,just as a statute channeling agency review to a circuit court displaces a direct review action in the district court.see whitman dep t of,per curiam.
second,the remedy in chapter,subchapter ii applies to removals for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,a,and the question arises whether removal on account of the statutory bar falls in that category.arguing that section a is limited to misconduct,the plaintiffs cite supreme court language stating that chapter of the act governs adverse action taken against employees for the efficiency of the service,which includes action of the type taken here,based on misconduct,fausto,at.however,includes does not mean limited to.
the csra is a successor to earlier civil service statutes,including the lloyd la follette act,which created the first general statutory protection for civil servants,see arnett kennedy,and used the same efficiency of the service phrase as the substantive standard for removal,see act of,ch,stat,repealed.that standard was understood to include removals that were based on disqualifying conditions that existed before the employees were hired,and congress was aware of and intended to adopt this interpretation.
thus,prior to the csra enactment,the senate committee on governmental affairs noted that for covered civil service employees,existing law provides that an individual may be removed only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,at,reprinted in.the committee reported that in,federal employees had been dismissed under that standard,and it listed eight different categories,including r emoved because of some condition that existed before they were hired.id.in recommending section,the committee said that it did not intend any substantive change to the existing law permitting removals only for efficiency of the service.id.at,reprinted in at.
opm shares this view of the efficiency of the service standard.in a related part,pt,opm regulations discuss the standard for a suitability action,including a removal,the regulations state that a suitability action may be taken only to protect the integrity or promote the efficiency of the service,id,which includes a ny statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the lawful employment of the person involved in the position in question,id.b.see also id.a right to appeal suitability action to the mspb.
third,the plaintiffs question whether the removals in this case were intended as removals for the efficiency of the service.the removal notices,it appears,cited the statutory bar,not chapter,subchapter ii and the efficiency of the service phrase but the legislative history and regulations make clear that a removal because of a statutory bar is one for the efficiency of the service,thereby triggering the opportunity and obligation to use the mspb procedures and to seek judicial review in the federal circuit.
the plaintiffs contrary suggestion rests on a misreading of department of the navy egan.there,the court relied on the ground given in a removal notice to conclude that the action was taken under the efficiency of the service standard and not on grounds of national security.id.at.a national security removal is explicitly exempted from all other statutes and review is narrowly limited.see id.a exempting a section removal egan,at.here,no such statutory exemption applies,and the notice merely particularizes the efficiency of the service basis for the removal.
fourth,the mspb has suggested that a person who was wrongly hired in the face of an absolute statutory bar was never an employee at all because the appointment was void ab initio,and therefore,when the error is discovered,the person removed is not a former employee who can invoke the csra,hope dep t of the army,citing cases.this reasoning,see travaglini dep t of,aff as modified,underlies statements by the board,occasionally noted but not endorsed by the federal circuit that a removal because of an absolute statutory bar is outside the board authority under the csra because the employee should not have been hired in the first place.
this is not the approach taken by modern courts in construing remedial statutes,and the government should be embarrassed ever to have taken advantage of such question begging rhetoric.the plaintiffs in this case were hired by the federal government,served in some cases for many years as its employees,exercised official authority,and were then terminated.the idea that congress would implicitly exclude them from the category of former employees entitled to seek redress under the and to the extent that their removal was outside a statutory bar or that the bar was itself unconstitutional beggars belief.
the csra governs removals nothing in its language suggests that a case involving a statutory bar follows a different route and the legislative history already described refutes any such suggestion.of course,if the employee comes within the statutory bar and the statutory bar is constitutional,the discharged employee will not get reinstated but the proper outcome should be a decision denying reinstatement on the merits.thus,the statutory route gives the plaintiff a full opportunity to present both questions to the federal circuit,which is an article iii court.
fifth,this brings us at last to the question whether there is some implied exception to the exclusive csra remedy because the challenge in this case is a constitutional one sounding in equity or because it is a facial constitutional attack rather than an challenge.the supreme court has already ruled that constitutional claims for damages can not bypass csra limitations,lucas,at and as to equitable constitutional claims,there is something of a circuit split but this circuit has been firm in treating the csra remedy as exclusive as to equitable constitutional claims as well.
thus,this court held in berrios that an employee fired by the government could not bring a due process claim and other facial and constitutional claims by an original action in the district court but had to follow the csra scheme through the mspb into the federal circuit.at.another decision in this circuit reaffirmed the general rule but found it inapplicable because the employee classification excluded him from the csra remedy.pathak dep t of veterans affairs,cir see also irizarry united states,cir.none of our cases has adopted the distinction urged nor does it have any obvious basis in policy.
constitutional claims are common in administrative proceedings especially equal protection and procedural due process claims and are part of the ordinary fodder of review in discharge cases.often such claims are made along with factual claims denying the conduct alleged against the employee and statutory or claims as well.congress desire to consolidate employee removal in a single forum was based on the action taken against the employee rather than the precise arguments made in contesting that action.
what matters in the end is whether the csra process can afford relief.the plaintiffs argue that a facial claim attacking the underlying statute is one for which the mspb can not grant relief to them and therefore the premise that the csra remedy is exclusive where it applies does not itself apply.and to show that there is no mspb remedy,the plaintiffs point to statements by the mspb itself that it,as an administrative agency,is without authority to determine the constitutionality of federal statutes.bayly.opm,
but while the board may be powerless to strike down the statute,the federal circuit on review of the board may do so,c,and,if it agreed with the plaintiffs on the merits,remand to the board to grant relief.see shalala.council on long term care,thunder basin coal co,at.accordingly,the csra regime does provide an opportunity for the plaintiffs to obtain a full determination of their facial constitutional challenge.indeed,even if the mspb had the first word on the constitutional issue,it certainly would not have the last.
plaintiffs object that the federal circuit has regularly said that its jurisdiction is coextensive with that of the mspb as to the categories of cases that fall within the csra,rosano dep t of the navy.that proposition happens to be true as a general statement,but it was not made by the federal circuit in our context and would make no sense if it were for in such cases the mspb is limited only because of a doctrine that uniquely applies to administrative agencies and not to the federal circuit or any other article iii court.
the federal circuit has never said that it was powerless to act where a removal occurred and the underlying statute that prompted the removal was itself unconstitutional.on the contrary,that court has said that if a colorable constitutional claim were presented,it would have to address the issue.see riggin office of senate fair emp t practices,discussing webster doe,brockmann dep t of the air force,same.and if it mistakenly held otherwise,the remedy would be on certiorari to the supreme court.
the substantive constitutional claims in this case are unpromising,given that one conflicts with governing supreme court precedent and the other ignores the fact that the plaintiffs were free to avoid the bar by timely registration.but the csra channels removals covered by the csra and thus the plaintiffs claims to the federal circuit,see hall united states,that principle serves an important purpose the csra provides a remedy for a meritorious facial challenge and plaintiffs were obliged to use it.
the judgment of the district court is vacated and the case remanded for entry of a new judgment denying relief for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and without prejudice to the pursuit of remedies under the csra to the extent that they may be available at this late date.each side shall bear its owns costs on this appeal.
it is so ordered.
i concur in the ultimate result of this case,but not in the route taken in reaching it.i would find jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs claims,but hold that they fail as a matter of law.
jurisdiction 
the majority reaches a reasoned conclusion,but i believe it falls short in considering fully the question of whether there is an applicable exception to the csra preclusive effect.to be sure,the majority disposes of the plaintiffs arguments regarding constitutional challenges generally and facial attacks specifically.it does not,however,take the issue of whether federal district court jurisdiction remains intact if the csra does not afford meaningful review to the plaintiffs colorable constitutional claims that sound in equity because i find that the plaintiffs claims would be unreviewable under the csra remedial scheme,i would hold that federal district court jurisdiction exists,just as our sister circuits have done in comparable cases.see am.fed of gov t emps.local stone,cir mitchum hurt,cir hubbard epa,vacated in part on other grounds,spagnola mathis,en banc per curiam.
as set forth in,district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.the plaintiffs claims arise under the constitution,namely,the bill of attainder clause in article i,section,and the due process clause of the fifth amendment,which implicitly guarantees equal protection.see bolling sharpe.the question,then,is whether the csra divested the federal district court of its jurisdiction conferred by.see whitman dep t of.
as explained by the majority,congress enacted the csra in as a means to comprehensively overhaul the civil service system.united states fausto,quoting lindahl opm.prior to the csra,different employees were afforded different processes of review upon an adverse employment action,resulting in both federal court and administrative appeals with wide variations among decisions.id.at.congress sought to streamline these varied decisions by funneling federal employee personnel actions through the csra administrative process.id.at.
although the csra does not explicitly prohibit plenary actions in federal district court,the supreme court has interpreted the statute to have preclusive effect.in bush lucas,it held that a plaintiff whose demotion allegedly violated the constitution could not sue for damages,even though,assuming the violation occurred,his remedies under the csra would not fully compensate him for the harm he suffered.five years later,in united states fausto,it found that the csra prevented a plaintiff from initiating suit in federal court for statutory and regulatory violations,even though the plaintiff was afforded no administrative review under the statute.
despite this line of precedent,the supreme court has consistently found exceptions to the foreclosure of judicial review for colorable constitutional claims sounding in equity,absent clear congressional intent to the contrary.the same year it decided fausto,it also decided webster doe,in which a plaintiff sought equitable relief when challenging on both statutory and constitutional grounds his termination from the cia due to his homosexuality.the court found the statutory claims unreviewable,but it rejected the government argument that the constitutional claims were as well,holding 
w here congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to do so must be clear we require this heightened showing in part to avoid the serious constitutional question that would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim.
at quoting bowen.acad.of family physicians,see also mcnary haitian refugee,finding federal question jurisdiction for plaintiffs constitutional challenges despite comprehensive immigration statute due to lack of meaningful judicial review under statute and absence of clear congressional language mandating preclusion johnson robison,holding that statute prohibiting judicial review of decisions by the administrator of veterans affairs did not provide the clear and convincing evidence of congressional intent required by this court before a statute will be construed to restrict access to judicial review of constitutional claims quoting abbott labs.gardner.
because i find that the csra remedial scheme does not afford the plaintiffs meaningful review of their colorable constitutional claims for equitable relief,i would hold that the statute does not bar the present action and the plaintiffs may seek relief in federal district court.
the mspb is a creation of statute,and its jurisdiction is limited.see a.notwithstanding the question of whether the mspb has the power to rule on constitutional issues,see thunder basin coal reich,it is undisputed by the parties that the mspb can not adjudicate claims premised on removals due to an absolute statutory prohibition to appointment.see,hope dep t of the army,lovoy dep t of health human,daneshpayeh dep t of the air force,aff.lexis,wl,unpublished per curiam travaglini dep t of,aff as modified.
section is an absolute prohibition to appointment because an individual who knowingly and willfully fails to register with the selective service system is barred from all executive agency employment,and he must be terminated if currently employed.see.the mspb consistently dismisses appeals related to terminations pursuant to on these grounds,a position the government regularly advances before the board and on which it succeeded in the mspb appeal by elgin,a plaintiff in this matter,charner opm,no.ph i,lexis,at,unpublished whitfield dep t of interior,no.dc i,lexis,at,unpublished rivera dep t of veterans affairs,no.ny i,lexis,at,unpublished elgin dep t of treasury,no.ph i,lexis,at,unpublished.
indeed,the mspb has often deemed frivolous the assertion that it has jurisdiction over cases contesting removals pursuant to.see,whitfield,lexis,at clarke opm,no.da i,lexis,at n,unpublished belmares avalos opm,no.ch i,lexis,at may,unpublished.moreover,the regulations promulgated by opm are entitled statutory bar to appointment of persons who fail to register under selective service law,and they state that administrative review beyond opm determination is prohibited.id.at c 
because the mspb has routinely stated that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs claims on the merits,it appears to me that the federal circuit is without jurisdiction to do so as well.the federal circuit jurisdiction is derivative of the mspb jurisdiction,and it is problematic whether the federal circuit has the ability to decide matters beyond that of the board.see perez merit.prot,since the mspb had no jurisdiction,the merits of perez challenge were not before the mspb for decision nor are they before us.carroll dep t of health human,w ith respect to cases brought under,the scope of the subject matter jurisdiction of this court is identical to the scope of the jurisdiction of the board.quoting rosano dep t of the navy.
the majority places great faith in its presumption that the federal circuit would either find the mspb competent to review the plaintiffs claims and remand for a decision on the merits,or that it would look beyond its own jurisdictional constraints to reach the constitutional issues itself.the evidence to support these assertions,however,is elusive.first,although no plaintiff,in this suit or others,who was removed under has ever sought federal circuit review of the mspb decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,the case law and regulations cited above suggest that such efforts would be futile.time and again the mspb has dismissed these cases,claiming that it is unable to grant relief,and an appeal to the federal circuit seems almost certain to result in a simple affirmance.see daneshpayeh.lexis.
second,the federal circuit has never reached beyond the limits of the mspb to hear the merits of a claim otherwise barred from review.in only one instance has it hypothesized the possibility,and never before has it acted on the idea.see brockmann dep t of the air force,acknowledging supreme court precedent supporting review of colorable constitutional claims otherwise barred,but finding precedent inapplicable because plaintiffs claims unreviewable by the mspb were not colorable.indeed,when the federal circuit did confront a plaintiff covered by the csra who asserted constitutional claims that were beyond mspb review,it affirmed the dismissal of his suit for lack of jurisdiction,rather than providing a forum for his constitutional claims.hubbard merit.prot,fed.appx.unpublished.such case law provides little comfort that the plaintiffs in this matter would fare any better 
to be sure,administrative boards have been declared competent to review constitutional issues otherwise perhaps beyond their scope.see shalala.council on long term care,interpreting medicare statute to provide administrative review of constitutional claims riggin office of senate fair emp t practices,finding administrative board competent to review constitutional due process claim.in these instances,however,the administrative schemes at issue expressly precluded federal district court jurisdiction,and,therefore,would leave the constitutional claims without any forum were the boards unable to review them.see shalala,at,finding medicare act to prohibit expressly jurisdiction riggin,at finding government employee rights act to prohibit expressly the commencement of judicial proceedings.
the csra contains no such clear prohibition of original federal court actions.chapter of the csra allows an agency to remove an employee only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,and upon such action,the employee is entitled to appeal to the merit systems protection board.a,d.nowhere does the statute indicate explicitly that a plaintiff may not challenge his termination by raising colorable constitutional claims in federal court 
our sister courts in the ninth,third,and circuits have held similarly and allowed federal employees to bring constitutional claims in district court actions seeking equitable relief.see stone,at holding csra did not preclude judicial review of plaintiffs first amendment constitutional claims for equitable relief when plaintiffs had no remedy under the statute mitchum,at finding csra and comparable statutes did not preclude federal district court review of plaintiffs constitutional claims for injunctive and declaratory relief because csra not sufficiently clear to restrict federal power to grant equitable relief for constitutional violations hubbard,at holding federal district court had jurisdiction over first amendment claim because the csra does not preclude federal employees from seeking equitable relief against agencies for allegedly unconstitutional personnel actions spagnola,at t ime and again this court has affirmed the right of civil servants to seek equitable relief against their supervisors,and the agency itself,in vindication of their constitutional rights.
the eleventh,seventh,and fourth circuits have expressly avoided the question of whether the csra forecloses equitable relief for colorable constitutional claims indeed,the eleventh and fourth circuits have distinguished or questioned their prior precedent that suggests preclusion.see hardison cohen,cir acknowledging serious question left unresolved as to whether the csra precludes equitable relief for constitutional challenges to terminations and distinguishing prior precedent in stephens dep t of health human,cir,based on availability of review and type of remedy sought paige cisneros,cir avoiding issue of whether csra precludes equitable relief for colorable constitutional claims because claim was not colorable bryant cheney,cir declining to address continued vitality of pinar dole,cir,in light of webster and circuit split on issue.indeed,the supreme court indicated the significance of this issue in whitman department of transportation,remanding for a determination as to whether the csra removed federal question jurisdiction over constitutional challenges.
i acknowledge that some of our own precedent and unpublished decisions along with decisions in the second and tenth suggest that the csra bars all federal actions related to civil service employment,but those cases are distinguishable.they did not involve the absence of meaningful administrative remedies,dotson griesa,cir noting lack of csra remedies but available relief through comparable statutory scheme harvey postal.lexis cir,unpublished csra remedies available berrios dep t of the army,cir csra remedies available equitable claims,harvey.lexis,at roth united states,cir or colorable constitutional challenges,pathak dep t of veterans affairs,cir harvey.lexis,at desmond dep t of defense.lexis,at cir,unpublished or they lacked meaningful analysis,lombardi small bus,cir.
consistent with stone,mitchum,and hubbard,and the shift within the circuits,i would hold that for an administrative scheme to foreclose a plenary federal district court action seeking equitable relief and involving colorable constitutional claims,congressional intent must be clear.the csra does not meet this standard.i would then find that the plaintiffs claims are afforded no meaningful review under the csra and,therefore,their claims are reviewable in federal district court.
ii.the merits 
having found jurisdiction,i would dismiss the plaintiffs claims on the merits.
bill of attainder 
the plaintiffs assert that is an unconstitutional bill of attainder since it legislatively punishes men age and older who failed to and can no longer register with the selective service system because it prohibits their employment with an executive agency.they assert that the statute satisfies the requirements of a bill of attainder by identifying a class of men based on immutable past conduct and operating as a punishment without trial.i disagree.
article i,section,clause of the united states constitution reads no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.with this clause the framers sought to prohibit the ancient practice of the parliament in england of punishing without trial specifically designated persons or groups.selective serv.pub.interest research,quoting united states brown.the constitutional provision safeguards the notion of separation of powers by protecting against trial by legislature.brown,at.historically,bills of attainder were acts sentencing to death one or more specific persons,although the supreme court has read the clause to also outlaw what were known as bills of pains and penalties,which imposed less severe punishments.id.at cummings missouri,wall.targeted parties were typically those who had attempted,or threatened to attempt,to overthrow the government.brown,at.
the supreme court has struck down statutes on bill of attainder grounds only five times in the nation history.see cummings,targeting confederate sympathizers ex parte garland,wall.same pierce carskadon,wall.same united states.lovett,targeting subversives brown,targeting communist party members.for a statute to qualify as a bill of attainder it must specify the affected person or group,impose punishment by legislative decree,and dispense with a judicial trial.see selective serv,at.because i would find that does not specify an identifiable group or impose punishment,i would hold that the statute is not a bill of attainder.
specification 
typical bills of attainder evince specification by naming the person to be punished.the supreme court has also recognized specification when legislation describes individuals in terms of conduct which,because it is past conduct,operates only as a designation of particular persons.communist party of the subversive activities control,see also cummings,identifying individuals by past affiliation with confederacy ex parte garland,same.in contrast,statutes of general applicability that focus on prospective conduct have withstood challenges on bill of attainder grounds.see brown,at,see,selective serv,at finding statute prospective and therefore not bill of attainder communist party,at finding statute not bill of attainder because it did not attach to past and ineradicable actions,but rather turn ed upon continuingly contemporaneous fact.
section does not meet the specification requirement to constitute a bill of attainder because it does not identify individuals for legislatively imposed punishment based on irreversible past acts.rather,the statute is entirely prospective in nature.president carter proclamation issued on july,dictated that men born on or after january,are required to register with the selective service system.those born in the years,and had six specified days to register.all men born during or after have thirty days both before and after their eighteenth birthdays to comply.proclamation.
section became effective on november.on this date,the oldest person subject to its provisions would have been.thus,even if an individual had failed to satisfy timely the dictates of president carter proclamation,under,he still had the opportunity to register with the selective service system and avoid disqualification from federal employment.see b,c selective serv,at.as such,does not identify any individuals ineluctably designated by the legislature for punishment because all men can comply prospectively.see selective serv,at quoting communist party,at.
the supreme court found similarly in selective service system minnesota public interest research group,at,when it held that f of the military selective service act,which denies federal financial assistance to male students who fail to register for the draft,did not meet the specification requirement to constitute a bill of attainder similar to,f was enacted before any men subject to it would have been too old to register with the selective service system.because f implementing regulations permitted nonregistrants to register late,meaning,after the timeline delineated in proclamation,f was not retrospective.
the plaintiffs counter that is nevertheless a bill of attainder because it penalizes an easily identifiable group of men age and older who are no longer eligible to register for the draft.they argue that supreme court precedent and historical parliamentary acts demonstrate that legislation qualifies as a bill of attainder even when punishment occurs and is conditioned on future behavior.they advance that is such a bill because it makes termination contingent upon the subsequent act of failing to register for the draft before turning.relatedly,they also assert that should be evaluated as a bill of attainder at the time of enforcement rather than the time of enactment,and that under such analysis,the statute meets the specification element because men currently age and older who did not register for the draft represent an easily ascertainable group.
the plaintiffs arguments miss the mark.to be sure,the supreme court has held that a statute conditioning punishment on future behavior may still constitute a bill of attainder,but this assertion is irrelevant.such statutes have met the specificity requirement because they have identified specific individuals or groups based on prior acts,irrespective of also providing these individuals with a means to escape punishment through some future performance.see brown,at highlighting that statutes meet specification by designation of affected individuals,even if they provide escape clauses.
for example,in cummings missouri,the supreme court found invalid a missouri constitutional amendment that prohibited people from engaging in certain professions unless they stated under oath that they had not given aid or comfort to the confederacy although individuals could arguably escape punishment by performing the oath the statute was still a bill of attainder because it identified the affected group based on immutable past conduct,prior sympathy and aid to the confederate army.id.at in the first place,the amendment is retrospective it embraces all the past from this day.see also ex parte garland,at involving federal statute directed at confederates that contained an escape clause and was ultimately found to be a bill of attainder.section,however,does not identify individuals in this manner because it is not directed at people who committed prior acts.rather,it is a broadly drawn statute of general applicability directed at prospective conduct and affecting all men regardless of their past actions,political affiliations,or ideological beliefs.
with respect to the plaintiffs insistence that the court evaluate at the time of enforcement rather than at the time of enactment,i would reject it.a statute meets the specification element if it identifies individuals by name or by description of prior conduct so that it operates only as a designation of particular persons.communist party,at.a statute of general applicability that affects individuals only upon enforcement is not a bill of attainder it is simply an example of the quintessential legislation that the constitution tasks congress with creating.see brown,at.
punishment 
even if fulfilled the specificity element,i would still find that it does not constitute a bill of attainder because it does not inflict punishment.courts evaluate whether a statute satisfies the punishment element for bill of attainder purposes by considering whether the statute falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment whether,in view of the type and severity of the burdens imposed,the statute reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes and whether the legislative record demonstrates a congressional intent to punish.selective serv,at citing nixon admin.of.o nly the clearest proof could suffice to establish the unconstitutionality of a statute based on impermissible congressional motive.flemming nestor.further,e ach case turns on its own highly particularized context.id.at.
section does not satisfy any of these punishment queries.it is true that a legislative decree of perpetual exclusion from specific types of employment meets the historical understanding of a bill of attainder.ex parte garland,at barring types of employment for confederate sympathizers see cummings,same lovett,barring named individuals from federal employment brown,barring community party members from positions within labor unions.but does not act as a perpetual exclusion to employment because all men have an opportunity to register for the draft.a statute that allows men to carry the keys of their prison in their own pockets does not fall within the historical meaning of forbidden legislative punishment.selective serv,at quoting shillitani united states.
also,it is reasonable to understand as a means to further the nonpunitive goal of encouraging selective service system registration.the statute was enacted in conjunction with findings that detailed the importance of the draft registration program and an urging from congress that the president recognize the contribution of our young men to the success of the peacetime registration program.see,a,stat.it also complements president carter directive to executive agencies to cooperate and assist in the draft registration requirements.proclamation.the conditioning of civil service employment on draft registration,then,acts as a rational means to improve compliance,which is a legitimate nonpunitive objective.see selective serv,at.
finally,i would not find the clearest proof from the congressional record that congress intended to act as a form of punishment.admittedly,senator strom thurmond,the statute sponsor,deemed it unpatriotic to permit nonregistrants to enjoy the privileges and benefits of civil service positions.cong.rec.these comments alone,however,do not suffice as unmistakable evidence of punitive intent which is required before a congressional enactment of this kind may be struck down.selective serv,at alteratio
