this is a diversity case involving rhode island dealer act,laws,which regulates the business relationship between car manufacturers and dealers.the is a dealer located in rhode island,saccucci auto group saccucci.the,american honda motor.and american honda finance,are entities of honda,a car manufacturer.we refer to the collectively as honda.
the central issue in this case is whether honda decision to prohibit its dealers from selling honda vehicle servicing contracts vscs over the internet violates the dealer act.vscs are extended warranties,more or less.honda had allowed its dealers to sell honda vscs over the internet for a number of years but put an end to the practice in.this prompted saccucci,a dealer which sold honda vscs over the internet,to sue honda in federal court,claiming,inter alia,that honda prohibition violated the dealer act.
the district court granted summary judgment to honda.it held that saccucci claims were not cognizable under the dealer act and that even if they were,no reasonable jury could find in saccucci favor on the claims.we agree with the second of these conclusions and affirm.
background 
concerned that car manufacturers had more bargaining power than car dealers,congress and a number of states enacted legislation to protect car dealers from perceived abusive and oppressive acts by the manufacturers.new motor vehicle bd.orrin fox.rhode island dealer act is an example of such legislation.id.at.
saccucci claims that honda decision to temporarily prohibit its dealers from selling honda vscs over the internet violated three of the dealer act provisions one prohibiting manufacturers from coerc ing a dealer to enter into an agreement,laws b,one prohibiting manufacturers from engaging in arbitrary action that causes damage to a dealer,id.a,and one prohibiting manufacturers from engaging in any predatory practice against a dealer.id.c.
a vsc is a vehicle protection package similar to an extended warranty.generally speaking,it covers the cost of repairing certain mechanical breakdowns and provides other,ancillary benefits such as roadside assistance.vscs are sold by a number of companies,including honda.honda brand is known as honda care.
honda does not sell its vscs directly to customers.rather,it provides its dealers with honda vscs,and the dealers make the sale.although honda dealers must pay honda a fee for every honda vsc they sell these fees range from per vsc,dealers are free to charge their customers whatever price they wish for a honda vsc,retaining the difference between price and fee as profit.although the dealer is the one making the sale to the customer,the honda vsc contract is ultimately between the customer and honda,not between the customer and the dealer.
honda dealers may promote and sell different brands of vscs,a toyota or general electric vsc.but if one of the dealer customers requests a honda vsc,the dealer is contractually obligated to make one available for purchase.and honda dealers have other reasons to offer honda vscs.their customers,honda owners,generally prefer honda vscs over competing brands because honda vscs guarantee that all repairs will be made by honda technicians at authorized honda dealerships using only genuine honda or american honda authorized parts.also,honda pays its dealers a performance based allowance for each vsc sold.the amount of this allowance depends on a quotient keyed to vehicle sales.for example,if a honda dealer honda vsc sales are of his total car sales,the dealer sells seven honda vscs for every ten cars he sells,that dealer will receive more money than if its honda vsc sales were of its total car sales.a dealer,then,has a financial incentive to increase its honda vsc sales percentage.
c.the internet sale of honda vscs 
because honda vscs are typically sold in connection with the purchase of a honda car,honda vscs were initially sold only at honda dealerships.beginning sometime in,however,a number of honda dealers began to sell honda vscs over the internet.other dealers began to follow suit,and,by,there were approximately twelve honda dealers selling honda vscs over the internet.saccucci began selling honda vscs over the internet in.the dealers that sell honda vscs over the internet sell them at or near cost,relying on the allowance supplied by honda for their profits.
honda reaction to the internet sale of honda vscs 
beginning sometime in,honda dealers who did not sell honda vscs over the internet began to complain to honda about the practice,focusing their complaints on the lower prices charged by the internet dealers.despite these complaints,honda did not attempt to curb internet sales and actually appeared supportive of such sales,which it believed reflected capitalism at its best.
in,however,honda position began to change.in january,honda dealer advisory board dab,a body composed of honda dealers who are elected to represent dealer interests recommended that honda stop the internet sale of honda vscs.the dab told honda that such sales impacted customer satisfaction and were resulting in strained relations between the dealers who were selling the honda vscs locally at the dealership and their customers.honda told the dab that it would further study the issue.both the dab recommendation to honda and honda response were published in a dealer direct newsletter sent to all honda dealers,including saccucci.
later that year,individual dealers complained to honda that the internet sale of honda vscs was undermining customer satisfaction with both the dealers and honda.when deposed,dan spafford,honda manager of consumer assurance products and services,testified about these complaints.one came from a honda dealer in illinois.the dealer told spafford that he had sold a customer both a honda and a honda vsc at his dealership,charging the customer a traditional price for the vsc.the customer later found a honda vsc being offered on the internet for a significantly lower price.the customer returned to the dealership,called the dealer a thief,and told him that he would never go back to his dealership again.the customer also told the dealer that because honda had condoned such practices,he would never buy another honda.following this interaction,the dealer stopped promoting honda vscs and began offering a competing vsc.spafford testified further about a similar conversation he had with a honda dealer from california.the dealer told spafford that the internet sale of honda vscs was endangering the dealer reputation in the community.this dealer also told spafford that he was considering promoting a competing vsc.
in response to these individual dealer complaints and the dab earlier recommendation,honda formed a committee to consider the issues posed by the internet sale of honda vscs.the committee consisted of members of honda management,honda counsel,and outside counsel.for three months,the committee met on a weekly basis,considering the positives and negatives of allowing its dealers to sell honda vscs over the internet.ultimately,the committee decided it was necessary to impose restrictions on such sales.the committee based this decision on a number of considerations,including the dab recommendation that honda prohibit the practice,complaints from individual dealers,and concerns that customer dissatisfaction with honda dealers would harm brand loyalty and brand image.the committee also took into account factors not directly related to customer satisfaction.among other things,the committee expressed concerns that dealers who were unhappy with the internet sale of honda vscs would begin to push the vscs offered by competitors and that the internet sale of honda vscs might violate state laws.with respect to the latter,honda learned that the california code only allows sellers licensed by the state to sell vscs and also limits such sales to sales incidental to the sale of a vehicle.
based on the committee findings,honda announced a temporary prohibition on the internet sale of honda vscs in february.to enforce this prohibition,honda set up a scheme of graduated penalties for dealers.violators are temporarily suspended from selling honda vscs,violators are permanently deactiva ted from selling honda vscs,and violators must forfeit any payments they have received under honda allowance program.
procedural history 
shortly after honda imposed the temporary prohibition on the internet sale of honda vscs,saccucci filed a complaint against honda in rhode island superior court.in this complaint,saccucci claimed that honda had violated three provisions of the dealer act and breached rhode island implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.honda removed the case to federal district court.after discovery and an evidentiary hearing,saccucci sought to amend its complaint to add a claim of equitable estoppel.the district court denied this motion as futile.honda then moved for summary judgment on saccucci claims,which was granted.saccucci appeals 
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.lockridge of me,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c 
saccucci claims that the district court erred when it granted honda summary judgment on its dealer act claims granted honda summary judgment on its claim that honda breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and denied its motion to amend its complaint to add a claim of equitable estoppel.we take up the claims in that order.in this diversity case,the substantive law of rhode island governs.gibson city of cranston,cir.
dealer act claims 
although the district court first held that the dealer act did not apply to this case,we harbor some doubt about that conclusion.in any event,we may bypass the question because,assuming the act applies,no reasonable jury could find in saccucci favor on its dealer act claims.
coercion claim 
the dealer act makes it unlawful for a manufacturer to coerce,or attempt to coerce,any motor vehicle dealer t o enter into any agreement with the manufacturer or to do any other act prejudicial to the motor vehicle dealer by threatening to terminate or cancel a franchise or any contractual agreement existing between the dealer and the manufacturer.laws b.for purposes of the dealer act,coercion is defined as a wrongful demand which will result in sanctions if not complied with.dunne leases cars trucks kenworth truck.the focus here is on whether honda prohibition of the internet sale of honda vscs,which it enforced by setting up a scheme of graduated penalties for dealers,constitutes a wrongful demand 
one way that a manufacturer may make a wrongful demand is by insisting that the dealer relinquish a contractual right.see,motors new chevrolet,cir a demand is wrongful if it impels the dealer into forfeiting its rights under the dealer agreement.northview motors,chrysler motors,cir.by contrast,a manufacturer demand will not be wrongful if the manufacturer is insisting that a dealer comply with the reasonable terms of a contract.laws b t his subdivision is not intended to preclude the manufacturer from insisting on compliance with the reasonable terms or provisions of the franchise or other contractual agreement,and notice in good faith to any new motor vehicle dealer of the new motor vehicle dealer violation of those terms or provisions shall not constitute a violation of the chapter.see also new chevrolet,at a manufacturer does not make a wrongful demand if it merely insists that the dealer comply with a reasonable obligation imposed by the franchise agreement.
for our purposes,then,it makes sense to start with the contracts between the parties.the honda care dealer enrollment and participation agreement vsc contract is the contract of primary interest here,as it directly covers the terms,conditions,and procedures of the honda care vsc program.but a few provisions of the automobile dealer sales and service agreement dealer contract are also relevant,as the vsc contract incorporates them by reference 
neither contract explicitly addresses the internet sale of honda vscs.this is likely because both contracts were entered into before the internet was a widespread commercial medium.nevertheless,each party argues that the contracts require us to find in their favor on the coercion claim.as we will explain,neither argument is persuasive.
in arguing that the contracts give it the right to prohibit the internet sale of honda vscs,honda cites three provisions from the relevant contracts.two of these provisions,one from the vsc contract and another from the dealer contract,establish honda right to control the advertising of its products,including honda vscs.neither of these provisions,however,addresses whether honda has the right to control where honda vscs may be sold.while the line between advertising a product over the internet and selling a product over the internet may be thin in some cases,there are surely methods of internet sale that could not be characterized as advertising.
the third provision honda cites is from the dealer contract and is listed under the heading,sale of honda products to dealer.honda argues that this provision permits it to revise the terms under which it sells honda products to a dealer and thus permits it to condition its sale of honda vscs to a dealer on the dealer agreement to refrain from selling honda vscs over the internet.this provision reads as follows 
american honda will have the right at any time and from time to time to establish and revise terms for its sales of honda products to dealer.revised prices,terms or provisions will apply to the sale of any honda products as of the effective date of the revised prices,terms or provisions,even though a different price or different terms may have been in effect at the time such honda products were allocated to or ordered by dealer.
but,as noted above,a manufacturer may only insist that its dealers comply with the reasonable terms or provisions of a contractual agreement.see laws b emphasis added.honda reads the reasonableness out of this provision by construing it so broadly.indeed,honda could seemingly commit a paradigmatic dealer act violation,threatening not to sell any cars to the dealer unless the dealer agrees to purchase large stocks of undesirable vehicles and still defend its actions by reference to this provision.
saccucci argument,although equally ambitious,is no more persuasive.it says that the silence of the contracts with respect to the internet sale of honda vscs creates an ambiguity and requires us to consider extrinsic evidence to interpret the contracts.and,in saccucci view,this extrinsic evidence makes clear that the intent of the parties at the time of contracting was to allow saccucci to sell honda vscs over the internet.
this argument must be rejected,as there is no ambiguity in the contracts.under rhode island law,a contract is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible of different constructions.ins.point judith marina,llc,cir irene realty travelers prop.cas.of.here,the contracts simply do not address the internet sale of honda vscs,much less the internet sale of honda vscs in a manner reasonably susceptible to different interpretations.
to be sure,some courts have said that silence creates ambiguity when it involves a matter naturally within the scope of the contract.water rights of pub.serv.meadow island ditch,azat farruggio,trs.of southampton jessup,see also moncrief williston basin interstate pipeline,cir citing colorado law consolidated bearings,cir citing illinois law richard lord,williston on contracts ed.assuming that the rhode island supreme court would endorse this principle of contract interpretation,it would be unhelpful to saccucci here.it can not reasonably be argued that the internet sale of honda vscs was a matter naturally within the scope of the contracts.at the time the parties entered into the most recent of the contracts in,the internet was not a widespread commercial medium.as saccucci itself observes,the honda care vsc agreement was drafted in at a time when use of the internet was still predominantly restricted to research and education,and commercial use of the internet was largely theoretical.as the seventh circuit has said,a contract is not ambiguous merely because it fails to address some contingency the general presumption is that the rights of the parties are limited by the terms expressed in the contract.see consolidated bearings,at quoting in re estate morrow.
under other circumstances,the next question might have been whether,in the absence of an contract governing the internet sale of honda care vscs,honda demand that its dealers cease such sales was wrongful.here,though,there is no need to consider the question.saccucci coercion argument proceeds on one premise alone that it had a contractual right to sell honda vscs over the internet.saccucci fails to argue that honda demand is wrongful even in the absence of such a contractual right 
but even if saccucci had made such an argument,there are several reasons to doubt that it would have been a winning one.in george lussier enterprises,we explained that a manufacturer demand will be wrongful if it imposes unfair or inequitable conditions upon a dealer.at.here,the temporary prohibition on the internet sale of honda vscs seems fair and equitable,given that honda imposed the prohibition on all of its dealers equally and that the dealers themselves,through the dab,sought the prohibition.moreover,we have said that a distributor acting honestly is entitled to latitude in making commercial judgments.coady toyota motor,cir.honda decision here was,at bottom,a commercial judgment.honda was concerned not only that the internet sale of honda vscs was harming brand image and loyalty but that a failure to stop internet sales would result in its dealers promoting competing products 
arbitrary action claim 
the dealer act makes it unlawful for a manufacturer to engage in arbitrary action that causes damage to the dealer.laws a.the dealer act does not define arbitrary nor has any rhode island court expressly defined the term for purposes of the statute.that said,the rhode island supreme court has suggested that a manufacturer action will not be arbitrary if it is based on due cause,dunne leases cars trucks,at,and,when considering an arbitrary action claim under maine dealer act,we defined arbitrary as selected at random and without reason.schott motorcycle supply,am.honda motor,cir citing the dictionary definition of the term.
regardless of which definition is applied here,no reasonable jury could have concluded that honda decision to temporarily prohibit the internet sale of honda vscs was arbitrary.honda process was thorough.after receiving complaints about the internet sale of honda vscs,honda formed a committee to study the issue.this committee met regularly for several months and considered both the positives and negatives of the current system which allowed dealers to sell honda vscs over the internet and various alternatives to restrictions on internet sales.ultimately,based on the committee findings,honda decided to temporarily prohibit internet sales.it based this decision on a number of factors,including the dab recommendation that honda prohibit the practice complaints from individual dealers that the internet sale of honda vscs was harming the reputation of the honda dealers concerns that customer dissatisfaction with honda dealers would harm brand loyalty and brand image concerns that dealers who were unhappy with the internet sale of honda vscs would begin to push the vscs offered by competitors and concerns that dealers selling honda vscs over the internet might be violating state laws,including the law of california.
claiming that honda decision was nevertheless arbitrary,saccucci advances several arguments.first,saccucci complains about the process employed by honda.it says that honda should have consulted the customer and sales satisfaction surveys of both it and its dealers before concluding that a prohibition on the internet sale of honda vscs was needed to protect brand loyalty or brand image.
because these surveys are not part of the record,it is impossible to tell whether they provide a useful metric for assessing customer satisfaction with the internet sale of honda vscs as opposed to other honda products and,if they do,whether they show that customers were satisfied with the internet sale of honda vscs.
but even assuming that the surveys were relevant,and that they reflected customer satisfaction with the internet sale of honda vscs,that does not mean that honda failure to consult them would allow a reasonable jury to find its decision was arbitrary.first,honda had other evidence on which to base a judgment on customer satisfaction.it is undisputed that it had received reports from dealers that the internet sale of honda vscs was undermining the reputation of honda dealers.therefore,although it might be debatable whether honda exercised the best judgment in failing to consult the customer surveys in addition to this evidence,its decision was nevertheless based on due cause and was not selected at random and without reason.second,and perhaps more importantly,honda decision to temporarily ban the internet sale of honda vscs was not solely based on concerns that the internet sale of honda vscs was resulting in customer dissatisfaction with honda and its dealers.among other things,honda was concerned that the internet sale of honda vscs might violate the laws of certain states and was leading dealers to promote competing products.nowhere in its brief does saccucci argue that these were not independently valid reasons for imposing the prohibition.
next,saccucci argues that honda decision to temporarily ban the internet sale of honda vscs was arbitrary because it was in tension with honda policy regarding the internet sale of cars honda allows dealers to make such sales and in harmony with honda policy regarding the internet sale of its power equipment honda controls such sales.saccucci argues,t he district court should have recognized that honda decision to align the rules for internet sales of honda care vscs with those applicable to lawnmowers and snowblowers,rather than new and used automobiles,supports saccucci claim that honda ban on internet vsc sales is arbitrary.
but saccucci overlooks the fact that honda had a good reason for aligning its honda vsc policy with its power equipment policy instead of its car policy.honda power equipment policy was enacted because of concerns that the uncontrolled internet sale of power equipment was having a negative impact on honda brand image and the honda dealer network.honda had the same concerns about the internet sale of honda vscs.in contrast,there is nothing in the record indicating that the internet sale of cars raised brand or dealer network concerns for honda.in light of these considerations,honda decision to align its vsc policy with its power equipment policy actually undercuts a finding of arbitrariness.
finally,saccucci argues that the decision was arbitrary because it was motivated by honda desire to appease a powerful dealer in california,dave conant.in support of this claim,saccucci points to the following an email from dean hardesty,a honda executive,to robert wilkinson,another honda executive,in which hardesty tells wilkinson that conant had joined the dab,that he was apparently against the internet sale of honda vscs,and that his opposition was helping the topic get escalated a follow up email from wilkinson to hardesty in which wilkinson writes that he needs to know,if honda interest in prohibiting internet sales is a politically motivated decision by someone of authority.just kidding testimony from wilkinson that conant was connected and pretty tight with the vice president of honda motor company and that wilkinson had heard rumors that conant was one of the individuals who was complaining about the internet sale of honda vscs and the fact that honda implemented its policy shortly after conant was appointed to the chair of the dab.
at least part of wilkinson testimony is inadmissible hearsay that can not be considered on a motion for summary judgment sec ficken,cir.and we fail to see how the rest of the evidence could allow a reasonable jury to infer that honda decision was geared towards pleasing
