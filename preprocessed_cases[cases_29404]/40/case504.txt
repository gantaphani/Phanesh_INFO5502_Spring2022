on february,jos√© sued his employer,the puerto rico police department,and several ranking police officers in federal district court he sought compensatory and punitive damages,as well as equitable relief,for persecution and a hostile work environment,allegedly motivated by political discrimination.the complaint raised a salmagundi of claims under the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution,and,and puerto rico law.the defendants vigorously denied the plaintiff allegations.
the case traveled along a bumpy road from the beginning.the plaintiff who claimed that he never received the initial summons requested and received numerous extensions of time for service of process he did not actually serve the defendants until september,more than seven months after the commencement of the action.one defendant,rivera the police superintendent,moved to dismiss the complaint based on eleventh amendment grounds.after obtaining another extension of time,the plaintiff opposed the motion.
on march,the police department also moved to dismiss on eleventh amendment grounds.the plaintiff again obtained an extension of time and eventually opposed that motion.the district court ultimately granted the police superintendent and police department motions to dismiss in part as to the plaintiff claims for pecuniary damages and denied them in part as to the plaintiff claim for prospective injunctive relief.all claims remained intact as to the remaining defendants 
on august,the district court held a scheduling conference the second in the case.at that session,it set a december,trial date.that date was later pushed back to june,at the plaintiff request.
on august day of the aforementioned scheduling defendants served their first discovery requests.over the following days,the plaintiff neither answered the defendants interrogatories nor produced the designated documents.the defendants faxed a reminder to the plaintiff attorney,noting that the civil rules allowed only thirty days for responding to such discovery requests.see.b,b.
at that juncture,the plaintiff asked for,and received,an extension of the due date until october.when no discovery was forthcoming from the plaintiff camp,the defendants,at the plaintiff beseechment,granted yet another extension to november.that deadline also passed without service of either the answers to interrogatories or the designated documents.
on december,the defendants moved to dismiss the action for both want of prosecution,see.b,and failure to comply with discovery deadlines,see.b c.shortly thereafter,the plaintiff transmitted answers to interrogatories by facsimile.he simultaneously informed the court that he had fully satisfied his outstanding discovery obligations.
the defendants disputed this claim of compliance,pointing out that the plaintiff,inter alia,had yet to provide them with certified copies of his income tax returns as previously requested.in light of this apparent omission,the district court,on december,ordered the plaintiff to satisfy all outstanding discovery requests by january.the court warned the plaintiff that failure to comply with its order would result in the dismissal with prejudice of his action.
despite this explicit admonition,the plaintiff failed either to produce the designated documents by the appointed date or to seek an extension of the deadline.the district court,true to its word,entered an order dismissing the case with prejudice pursuant to rule b c because of the plaintiff ongoing failure to prosecute this case and his failure to obey this court order.
the following day,the plaintiff again asserted that he had fully complied with the defendants demand for document production.he made this assertion despite the fact that certain of the documents most notably,the tax returns were still missing.based on the same assertion,he filed successive motions for reconsideration of the dismissal order.the district court denied both motions.this timely appeal followed.
our analysis begins with bedrock a federal district court venerable power to sanction a party who repeatedly fails to comply with deadlines can not be doubted.see,hockey league metro.hockey club,d link wabash,d.because the appropriateness of sanctions depends on the facts of the particular case,we review the use of dismissal as a sanction for abuse of discretion.see hockey league,at.tower ventures,city of westfield,cir.this standard is not.see tower ventures,at.in applying it,a reviewing court must consider the chronology of the case and the totality of the attendant circumstances.young gordon,cir.in that process,the court must construct a balance of the relevant factors,including but not limited to the trial court need to manage its docket,the potential prejudice to the parties,and the policy of the law favoring disposition on the merits.id.
in this appeal,the plaintiff makes three basic points.first,he argues that his failure to comply with discovery obligations was excusable because the defendants themselves caused his inability to comply.second,he asseverates that he responded to the defendants initiatives in due time,thereby evincing an active interest in the prosecution of the case.third,he maintains that dismissal was because he answered the interrogatories and made a effort to produce the designated documents.we consider each of these points in turn.
the premise behind the plaintiff first contention is sound noncompliance caused by an opposing party actions sometimes can excuse delay in discovery responses.see,cir.the plaintiff attempt to slide his case within this integument is,however,unavailing.
the gist of the plaintiff contention is that the defendants themselves created a stressful work environment that caused him great anxiety and made it difficult for him to meet discovery.the main problem with this contention is that it is unsupported the record is devoid of anything of evidentiary quality that might give substance to the claim.to cinch matters,the plaintiff never voiced this plaint in the district court.consequently,he can not rewardingly surface it for the first time on appeal.teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen helpers union superline transp,cir explaining that legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court can not be broached for the first time on appeal.
relatedly,the plaintiff tells us that his unwarranted transfer caused him to lose contact with his counsel.from aught that appears in the record,however,there is nothing about that personnel move that cut the plaintiff off from normal channels of communication.in the absence of extraordinary present is certainly not a defendant responsibility to provide the plaintiff lawyer with the plaintiff contact information when the plaintiff moves.see spiller,cir.
this brings us to the plaintiff second contention that he took an active interest in the case.in this regard,he posits that the docket of the case speaks for itself.we agree with this emphasis on the docket,but we read the docket differently.
the docket reflects that,from the very commencement of the action,the plaintiff dragged his heels and the district court generously granted him extensions of divers kinds.the docket also shows that when the case entered discovery,the plaintiff,for no apparent reason,failed to comply with deadlines mandated by the civil rules,even after those deadlines were voluntarily extended by the defendants.to make matters worse,the plaintiff,on december,actively misrepresented to the court that he had fully complied with all outstanding discovery requests.the district court response was crystal clear comply in full by january,or face dismissal.the plaintiff previous display of interest in the case,erratic at best,can not excuse his noncompliance with this clear and aposematic mandate.
this leaves the plaintiff third contention that the lower court should not have issued its most draconian sanction because he complied with the court order,if not by the stated deadline,then by the next day.this brief delay,he says,was neither willful nor in bad faith.
the plaintiff claim of compliance is little more than an attempt to rewrite the facts of the case.while the plaintiff eventual
