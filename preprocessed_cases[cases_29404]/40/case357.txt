in this case,maribel appeals the award of summary judgment to her former employer,the secretary of veterans affairs,anthony principi,in his official capacity,on her claims for disability discrimination,failure to accommodate,and hostile work environment,pursuant to the rehabilitation act,et.we conclude that summary judgment was properly granted as to each of claims and affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
we first sketch with some necessary detail the undisputed facts,as outlined by the district court.was employed at the san juan veterans administration va medical center as a medical technician in the va nursing service.in,she applied for and received a temporary promotion to health technician with the va research and development service r d service.in her new position,was assigned as study coordinator for a diabetes study.her duties and responsibilities included screening potential patients for eligibility,developing the initial database of patient information,conducting visits with patients according to a scheduling protocol,collecting data and completing study forms,recording and reporting adverse patient experiences,and performing other related duties as required by the needs of the study.was directly supervised by julio benabé,the associate chief of staff for research and development and the study principal investigator,and was required to work in cooperation with a study monitor and additional staff within the va cooperative studies program coordinating center cspcc.
by may,had accumulated several absences for which she had not requested sick leave or compensatory time blanca lebrón,the administrative officer for the r d service,questioned about her failure to comply with attendance and timekeeping requirements,and requested that submit an ex post accounting of her absences.submitted two forms.the first detailed the times,dates,and justifications for hours of absence the second accounted for hours of absence without explanation of dates,times,or justifications.both forms were signed by benabé,who was supervisor at the time.although benabé approved both forms,lebrón did not accept accounting for the hours because it failed to provide details regarding the dates,times,and justifications for the absences.after being credited all her properly documented time,was left with hours of unexplained absence.
subsequently,two other employees in the study group complained that they had encountered difficulties in reaching.madeline mccarren,the cspcc biostatistician,complained that was not responsive to telephone calls,emails,or faxes,that she exhibited poor attendance on required conference calls,that she continued to make repetitive errors,and that the cspcc staff was burdened with additional work as a result.benabé also received an email from carlos abraira,of the diabetes study,in which abraira described his recurring inability to contact and the issue of missing or incorrect data stemming from failure to competently perform her duties.based on these complaints,as well as failure to comply with timekeeping requirements,lebrón contacted the human resources department to inquire about terminating temporary promotion.on september,lebrón,benabé,and edwin mejías met with.at the meeting,produced two medical certificates documenting her treatment that month for anxiety,depression,and related disorders.she also produced a note from her psychiatrist stating that she was unable to work due to an emotional condition.as a result of this meeting,lebrón informed the human resources department that it was not the right time to issue a termination letter to.
about a week after this meeting,submitted another medical certificate stating that she could continue to work provided that she was allowed a schedule.although she did begin to work,her attendance continued to be erratic.lebrón began to perform some of duties,and discovered that she had a substantial amount of unfinished work stretching back over several months consequently,on october,benabé asked mejías to terminate temporary promotion.that same day,mejías sent a memorandum to helen nunci,the human resources manager,requesting that temporary promotion be terminated.two days later,a second meeting between,lebrón,benabé,and mejías was held in which benabé informed of the decision to transfer her back to the nursing service.
on november,was inadvertently issued a proposed termination letter.the letter was rescinded on november and replaced with a memorandum that informed that her temporary promotion had been terminated and that she would be returned to her former position.on november,the human resources department sent a memorandum explaining that a temporarily promoted employee could be returned to his or her former position at any time and that the employee has no right to appeal such a decision.also on that day,was informed that the termination of her temporary promotion had been pushed back until november,and that she was expected to report to the nursing service effective december.
on november,the day after was given the proposed termination letter but before it was rescinded,she sent a letter to mejías in which she requested that she be accommodated in a reasonable manner within her position given the circumstances of her emotional state.she did not attach any medical documentation to her request or specify what she believed to be a reasonable accommodation.on november,wrote to the human resources department,complaining that she had been subjected to disability discrimination.on december,in response to complaint,lebrón wrote to nunci,the human resources manager,to make the following points that she believed was not disabled that she repeatedly had to ask to comply with timekeeping requirements that she never threatened and specifically told her that any communications regarding termination of her temporary position would be made by the human resources department that she told that she had undertaken some of duties in an attempt to keep the diabetes study on track and that she informed benabé she would cease performing duties if was kept on the project,since claimed to not need lebrón assistance and was unable to work with or communicate with lebrón.
on january,nunci notified that her request for an accommodation did not meet the criteria for a reasonable accommodation because it was based only on her assertion that she suffered from an unspecified emotional condition.then submitted a second request for an accommodation,this time accompanied by a medical certificate from a psychiatrist recommending that her work schedule be changed to a morning schedule for at least three to six months.that same day,nunci informed that the information provided by her psychiatrist did not meet the criteria for reasonable accommodation.was subsequently returned to her former position and lower pay grade in the nursing service.to challenge the revocation of her temporary promotion,filed this action.the defendants moved for summary judgment on all of claims,and the district court granted the motions across the board.now appeals.
the district court also dismissed claims against blanca lebrón and julio benabé,both of whom she had sued in their individual capacity,as well as her claims under the americans with disabilities act ada,et,the latter on the ground that the ada does not provide for suits against the federal government.see castro ortiz fajardo,d,see also principi,cir.since has chosen not to contest these portions of the district court decision,we need not address them.
ii.discussion 
a.the summary judgment record on review 
as always,we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,cabán hernández philip morris usa,cir,and construe the record in the light most favorable to the.calvi knox county,cir.
at the threshold,we must deal with a procedural decision of some import rendered by the district court.in deciding the appellee motion to dismiss for summary judgment,the district court deemed admitted the appellee statement of undisputed facts because opposing statement of facts did not comply with the local rules.those rules require a party opposing a motion for summary judgment to admit,deny,or qualify each entry in the movant statement of material facts paragraph by paragraph and to support any denials,qualifications,or assertions of new facts by particularized citations to the record.see c.argues that the district court rejection of her opposing statement of facts was error 
the district court properly excluded opposing statement of facts and deemed admitted the appellee version.failed to admit,deny,or qualify the appellee proffered facts,choosing instead to assert that she was both denying qualifying the vast majority.as the district court noted,in at least two instances admitted a fact,without qualification,only to subsequently deny qualify that same fact.
to make matters more difficult for the district court,failed to use a separate paragraph to address each fact proffered by the appellee,as required by the local rule,and instead denied qualified several facts at once.also denied qualified several of the appellee facts across several different paragraphs,the same fact may have been denied qualified in more than one paragraph.lastly,and importantly,she failed to include particularized citations to the record,and instead offered meandering fragments of evidence copied directly into her opposing statement.thus ignored the requirement of the local rule that a n assertion of fact shall be followed by a citation to the specific page or paragraph of identified record material supporting the assertion.e emphasis added.
recently,in cabán hernández,we reiterated the importance of local rules similar to local rule,explaining that 
s uch rules were inaugurated in response to this court abiding concern that,without them,summary judgment practice could too easily become a game of.ruiz rivera riley,cir.such rules are designed to function as a means of focusing a district court attention on what what is controverted.calvi knox county,cir.when complied with,they serve to dispel the smokescreen behind which litigants with marginal or unwinnable cases often seek to hide and greatly reduce the possibility that the district court will fall victim to an ambush.id.
given the vital purpose that such rules serve,litigants ignore them at their peril.in the event that a party opposing summary judgment fails to act in accordance with the rigors that such a rule imposes,a district court is free,in the exercise of its sound discretion,to accept the moving party facts as stated.see,cir ruiz rivera,at.
at.we can hardly add to this admonishment but,at the risk of being redundant,we say again that parties are required to straightforwardly comply with the dictates of local rules such as local rule,and to state clearly and concisely the facts claimed to be undisputed or disputed,or qualified,and the record evidence supporting those claims.the rule does not leave room for the kind of internal contradictions,the dodging and weaving,and the that characterizes filing.local rule is intended to prevent parties from shifting to the district court the burden of sifting through the inevitable mountain of information generated by discovery in search of relevant material.substantial noncompliance,if allowed,would do just that.should the court excuse this blatant,the district court would be forced to grope unaided for factual needles in a documentary haystack.cabán hernández,at.consequently,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in deeming the appellee statement of undisputed facts admitted.since our review is confined to the record that was properly before the district court when it made its decision,mandel boston phoenix,cir,the question for us is whether the district court appropriately granted summary judgment based on the facts set forth in the appellee moving papers,as well as separate statement of additional facts 
b.the claims of discrimination and failure to accommodate 
in response to the defendants motion for summary judgment,argued unsuccessfully to the district court alternative theories first,she contended that she had proffered direct evidence of discrimination,see patten stores east,cir,and was therefore entitled to a mixed motive analysis second,she alternatively argued that she had established a prima facie case of discrimination based on the analysis articulated in mcdonnell douglas green,d.she presses both on appeal and so we will consider these contentions in turn.
a analysis is appropriate where direct evidence exists that an employer,in making an adverse employment decision,considered a proscribed factor,race or disability,as well as one or more legitimate factors,competence or performance.price waterhouse hopkins,d fernandes costa.masonry,cir.
appears to argue that direct evidence of discriminatory motives was established by an august review of by benabé in which he commented positively on her an email sent by lebrón to the human resources department after the september,meeting,referencing a previous communication in which lebrón had requested that be terminated from her temporary promotion,and stating that because of emotional problems,it was not the best time to send a termination letter to her,and that lebrón was unsure whether would be able to continue working a statement by benabé to at the september,meeting that he thought would not be returning to work because of her depression and the forensic psychiatrist reports regarding emotional difficulties.
we agree with the district court that these occurrences do not amount to direct evidence of a discriminatory motive on the part of employer.direct evidence of discrimination does not include stray remarks in the workplace,particularly those made by nondecisionmakers or statements made by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself.bristol,cir citing price waterhouse,at.it also does not include statements capable of being interpreted as both discriminatory and benign.patten,at.
the review by benabé covered the period spanning from april,to march,which predated the problems arising from irregular attendance and questionable work product.further,by own admission,her disability did not develop until september,well after benabé completed his review.with respect to lebrón email,contrary to establishing a discriminatory intent,the communication actually negates contention that her promotion was terminated because of her disability.in relevant part,the message read 
alida benabé,mejias and myself met today with maribel rios and decided that it is not the best moment for the letter.she is under a severe depression and some terrible family problems that would devatate sic her.she is seeing a psychiatrist and we want to know if still we have the employee assistance program that used to help this type of troubled employees sic 
i will keep you informed of this situation as we do not know if maribel will be able to return to work.
thank you for your continued support.if you know anything about the assistance program,please let me know.
first,the email reference to the letter implies that a discussion had already occurred regarding the termination of temporary promotion and that,as the district court reasoned,all that remained was the decision of when to notify.second,even if the message could be spun as an expression of discriminatory animus,it can just as easily be read as an expression of a desire to accommodate.lebrón inquiry into the employee assistance program indicates that she was interested in providing some help to.as for benabé statement that might not return to work,the statement can fairly be construed as a benign expression of benabé opinion that might voluntarily resign.lastly,the psychiatric reports may be evidence of mental or emotional state,but they do not evidence discriminatory animus on the part of employer.
in light of the foregoing,we conclude that the district court correctly found that was not entitled to a mixed motive analysis because she failed to present direct evidence of discrimination based on her disability.
in evaluating whether has put forth a prima facie disability discrimination claim under the rehabilitation act,we use the framework delineated by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas,at.see tobin liberty mut.ins,cir citing higgins new balance athletic shoe,cir under this approach,a plaintiff in a disability discrimination action must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she was disabled within the meaning of the statute she was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job,either with or without a reasonable accommodation and the employer took adverse action against her because of the disability.bailey,cir see also mcdonnell douglas,at.to make out a reasonable accommodation claim,a plaintiff must prove the first two of the above three factors and further that the employer,despite knowing about the disability,did not acquiesce to a request for a reasonable accommodation by the employee.united states dep t of justice,cir.
if,under the mcdonnell douglas approach,can establish a prima facie disability discrimination or reasonable accommodation claim by making a sufficient showing as to each of the above three factors,the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,reason for the employment decision and to produce credible evidence to show that the reason advanced was the real reason.mcdonnell douglas,at.if the defendant is able to offer such a reason,the burden then shifts back to to establish that the proffered reason is pretext intended to conceal discriminatory intent.id.at.the ultimate burden of proving unlawful action rests at all times with.reeves sanderson plumbing,d.
to some degree,there is an overlap between the first two prongs in a disability discrimination claim such as this one.in the plaintiff prima facie showing,she must show that she is qualified to perform the job if the claim is a failure to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff disability,it falls to the plaintiff to show that the accommodation would have enabled her to perform the essential functions of the that the accommodation would have been reasonable in light of relevant factors such as expense,size of the employer.in some respects,this part of the plaintiff prima facie burden blends into the legitimate reason proffered by the employer for the adverse job action.so,for example,the may claim that she was performing the essential functions of the job or could,with an accommodation,while the may claim she was not or could not,even with an accommodation.it matters less at precisely what stage of the rubric the issues get tackled more important is that they are here they were.
it is uncontested that met her initial burden of showing that she suffered from a disability.however,the district court concluded that was unable to establish the second prong of the mcdonnell douglas prima facie analysis,she was unable to establish that she was a qualified individual able to perform the essential functions of her job,either with or without a reasonable accommodation.as an initial matter,did not even argue in opposition to the appellee motion to dismiss for summary judgment that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job with or without reasonable accommodation however,even if we give her the benefit of the doubt,the uncontested evidence in the record establishes that she was unable to perform the essential functions of her job.at the risk of stating the obvious,attendance is an essential function of any job.see,waggoner olin,cir an employee who does not come to work can not perform the essential functions of his job quoting nowak rita high,cir see also rogers int l marine terminals,cir.frequently missed work and failed on numerous occasions to respond to attempts by the cspcc to contact her.and,importantly,she had a spotty attendance record even after she was permitted to work as recommended by her psychiatrist lastly,whether from the aforementioned deficiencies in communication and attendance,or for unrelated reasons,was unable to manage her workload,with the result being that the diabetes study was in a state of chaos that risked the study future.in sum,simply could not establish that she was a qualified individual able to perform the essential functions of her job,either with or without a reasonable accommodation 
to seal the conclusion here,the district court found,and we agree,that even if it assumed that could establish a prima facie case of discrimination,the defendant articulated a legitimate,reason for terminating the temporary promotion,which went unrebutted by.her substandard performance,as described by the uncontested evidence put forward by the defendant,clearly justified the grant of summary judgment.see,tobin,at performance deficiencies,including failure to meet minimum standards,poor attendance record,and substandard performance evaluations,were basis of legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for adverse employment decision argo blue cross blue shield of kansas,cir employee decline in performance and persistence in arriving late,misusing his time,and failing to follow directions in spite of repeated warnings about his tardiness and attitude problems,were legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons for termination oates discovery zone,cir evidence of repeated absenteeism and failure to follow attendance reporting procedures was fatal to employee prima facie case of race discrimination.
hostile work environment 
the district court found that had not put forth sufficient evidence to support a hostile work environment claim and consequently dismissed this claim.although claims error,she does not provide any substantiation for her contention.instead,she factual allegations contained in her brief and simply asserts in conclusory fashion that these allegations,as well as general statements of the law,are enough to keep her claim afloat.
to succeed on a hostile work environment claim,a plaintiff must show that her workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment.henderson,cir quoting harris forklift,d.among the factors relevant to this inquiry are the severity of the conduct,its frequency,and whether it unreasonably interfered with the victim work performance.see also harris,at.
points to three incidents to support her claim that she was subjected to a hostile work environment a comment by benabé during the september,meeting that he did not think was returning because of her depression benabé privately told,on two occasions,that,if he were her,he would leave the r d service and when returned to work,lebrón ignored her and told benabé that she lebrón would no longer assist the diabetes study because other studies needed her attention.
these incidents were at best isolated and offhanded,and clearly insufficient to establish a contested material issue of fact as to claim of hostile work environment.even if benabé commented to that,if he were her,he would leave the r d service,there is nothing particularly offensive about the statement,and there is no evidence that he uttered it publicly or in concert with others,or that his manner of communicating was in any way hostile.additionally,benabé made the suggestion to on only two occasions.such offhand comments,uttered no more than twice,simply are not sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment,at see also faragher city of boca raton,d citing oncale sundowner offshore,d offhand comments and isolated incidents,unless extremely serious,will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment.
similarly,did not put forward any evidence regarding lebrón allegedly hostile attitude,beyond the fact that lebrón ignored her for a period of time.even assuming lebrón behaved as alleged,the federal employment discrimination laws do not establish a general civility code for the workplace,at quoting oncale,at.furthermore,returned to work on september,and was notified at the october,meeting that she would be transferred back to her former position at the nursing service,meaning any incivility on the part of lebrón lasted less than one month.as for lebrón threat to benabé,has made no showing that the threat was related to her al
