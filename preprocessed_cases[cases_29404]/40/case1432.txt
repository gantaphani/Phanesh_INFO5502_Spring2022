in,the city of charlotte city enacted an adult zoning ordinance azo to protect certain sensitive uses from the secondary effects associated with adult establishments.the ordinance contains an amortization provision that required covered adult establishments to close or relocate to a conforming location by january.independence news,independence news and polo south,polo south collectively,appellants,which own and operate sexually oriented adult establishments subject to the azo,filed this lawsuit in the district court for the western district of north carolina seeking to avoid enforcement of the amortization provision against their establishments.appellants claimed,inter alia,that enforcement of the azo would strip them of their first amendment protections because their adult establishments had not produced any unwanted secondary effects in the years since the azo enactment.
the district court dismissed the appellants challenge to the secondary effects rationale of the azo,and it also granted summary judgment in favor of the city on appellants facial challenge to the azo variance provision,which does not require the charlotte zoning board of adjustment zba to consider the absence of secondary effects when deciding whether to grant a variance.
on appeal,appellants challenge both of these rulings.for the following reasons,we affirm.
on january,the city adopted the azo,a text amendment to the charlotte zoning ordinance.charlotte,ordinance,current version codified at charlotte,code,app.a,and.the azo defined the term adult establishment and limited the location of adult establishments to several zoning districts business,umud uptown mixed use district,and and industrial.id.it also included a section,section,which required,and continues to require,that adult establishments be located at certain distances from any protected is,any residential district,school,church,child care center,park or playground.id.specifically,section a provides that adult bookstores and adult picture theaters must be at least feet from any protected use,and section b requires that adult live entertainment establishments be at least feet from any protected use.id.also,section c provides that adult bookstores and adult picture theaters must be at least feet from any other adult establishment,and section d provides that adult live entertainment establishments be at least feet from any other adult establishment.id.no more than one adult establishment may be located in the same building.id.
section was added in an effort to establish reasonable regulations to prevent a concentration of adult establishments within the city of charlotte and to separate adult establishments from sensitive uses because s tudies show that lowered property values and increased crime rates tend to accompany and are brought about by the concentration of adult establishments.id.in the city view,such r egulation wa s necessary to insure that the effects from adult establishments do not contribute to the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods and to protect the integrity of the city schools,churches,child care centers,parks and playgrounds which are typically areas in which juveniles congregate.id.
through the amortization provision,the azo gave preexisting adult establishments not in compliance with the protected use separation requirements of sections a and b until january,years from the date of the azo either close or relocate to a conforming location.id.
initially,section did not allow the zba to authorize a variance from the protected use separation requirements,but on march,the city granted the zba that authority by adding section g,which provides 
b efore granting a variance from the separation requirements,the board of adjustment shall find that thoroughfares,traffic circulation patterns,structures or other natural or geographic or topographic features are likely to provide an adequate measure of protection for the protected zoning or use from any secondary effects of the adult establishment.
charlotte,ordinance,codified at charlotte,code,app.a g.
independence news has operated an adult bookstore at its present location in the city since in october of,the zoning administrator sent independence news a notice,advising that independence news adult uses were in violation of the protected use separation requirements of section a and reminding independence news that the azo amortization provision required independence news to close or relocate to a conforming location by january.
similarly,polo south has operated a live adult entertainment establishment known as the carousel club at its present location in the city since.in october of,the zoning administrator likewise sent polo south a notice,advising that polo south adult uses were in violation of the protected use separation requirements of section b and reminding polo south that the azo amortization provision required polo south to close or relocate to a conforming location by january.
one week before the amortization deadline,independence news and another affected business filed this action in federal district court,challenging certain provisions of the city zoning ordinance.a few days later,in another case challenging the azo,the district court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the city from enforcing the amortization provision against any affected business pending final resolution.see queen city video news,city of charlotte,wl,order granting motion for preliminary injunction.the district court held this case in abeyance pending the disposition of the queen city case.
ultimately,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city in queen city on all claims except one,and the parties in queen city entered into a stipulation of voluntary dismissal with prejudice.the district court then activated this case,and the city consented to the intervention of polo south and two other affected businesses,agreeing that it would not enforce the amortization provision until the matters before the court were resolved.
the amended complaints filed by independence news and polo south demanded a permanent injunction prohibiting the city from enforcing the amortization provision against the appellants,a declaratory judgment that section of the city zoning ordinance violated their first amendment rights both facially and,and an order directing the zba to consider whether the appellants establishments actually generate adverse secondary effects against protected uses when determining whether or not to grant a variance.
relevant to this appeal,independence news and polo south claimed that section of the azo is unconstitutional as applied against appellant s based upon the evidence concerning the history of appellant s businesses over a nine year period which clearly shows that no adverse secondary effects to protected zoning and uses can be attributed to appellant s constitutionally protected adult business uses.at.in particular,independence news and polo south alleged that,during the nine year period following the azo enactment,property values had held steady or generally increased in the area surrounding their establishments no sex related crimes had occurred in the area,and crime in general had not increased in the area as of result of their adult establishments a number of businesses had located within the area surrounding the appellants adult establishments and residential construction was currently taking place within the area surrounding appellants establishments.
on june,the district court granted the city motion for partial judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the challenge to the secondary effects rationale of the azo,concluding that it is settled that appellants can not maintain an challenge to the secondary effects rationale of the azo time,place,and manner restrictions.at.then,on september,the district court granted in part and denied in part the city motion for partial summary judgment.as part of that order,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city on the appellants allegation that the azo is unconstitutional because its variance provision does not allow the zba to consider factual evidence concerning the secondary effects of a particular adult business.
on may,appellants filed an amended stipulation of dismissal as to all outstanding claims and preserved those resolved issues for this appeal.after a final judgment in favor of the city on the remaining claims asserted by other affected businesses,appellants timely noticed an appeal,and we possess jurisdiction under west 
before us,appellants contest only two of the district court rulings.first,they contend that,in granting partial judgment on the pleadings in favor of the city,the district court incorrectly concluded that appellants did not have the right to maintain an challenge to the application and enforcement of the azo protected use separation requirements and amortization provision to appellants adult establishments.second,appellants contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the city on appellants facial challenge to section g.on this claim,the appellants take issue with the fact that section g does not require the zba to consider evidence that appellants particular adult establishments do not generate adverse secondary effects in deciding whether to grant appellants variances should they ultimately seek them.
we review de novo the district court decision to grant partial judgment on the pleadings in favor of the city,applying the same standard for federal rule of civil procedure c motions as for motions made pursuant to rule b.edwards city of goldsboro,cir.and,we also review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the city,applying the same rule standard as the district court was required to apply.bb t united states,cir.
we first turn to the district court grant of partial judgment on the pleadings in favor of the city on appellants challenge to the azo protected use separation requirements and amortization provision.
in ward rock against racism,d,a case involving a facial challenge to a time,place,and manner restriction,the united states supreme court stated that the validity of the time,place and manner restriction depends on the relation it bears to the overall problem the government seeks to correct,not on the extent to which it furthers the government interests in an individual case the restriction is valid so long as the city could reasonably have determined that its interests overall would be served less effectively without the restriction than with it.at.emphasis added.based on this statement,the district court concluded that appellants could not maintain an challenge to the secondary effects rationale of the azo and granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of the city.
we agree with the district court that judgment in favor of the city was proper on this claim.like the ordinance in city of renton playtime theatres,d,which prohibited any adult movie theater from locating within feet of any residential zone,dwelling,church,park,or school,the azo is properly analyzed as a time,place,and manner regulation because it does not ban adult establishments altogether but merely requires that such establishments be located certain distances from protected uses.see id.at.analyzing renton ordinance as a time,place,and manner restriction.and,just as the renton ordinance was aimed at the secondary effects of the adult is,increasing crime rates,decreasing property values,and the decreasing quality of renton than at the content of the films shown at the theaters,the azo is aimed at the secondary effects of adult establishments,not the content of regulated speech,and is thus properly deemed.see id.at.analyzing the renton ordinance as.
under renton,time,place,and manner restrictions such as the azo are acceptable as long as they are designed to serve a substantial governmental interest and do not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.id.at.such regulations must also be narrowly tailored to achieve the substantial governmental interest.ward,at.w e reaffirm today that a regulation of the time,place,or manner of protected speech must be narrowly tailored to serve the government legitimate,interests but that it need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of doing so.see also renton,at.emphasizing that the renton ordinance was narrowly tailored to affect only that category of theaters shown to produce the unwanted secondary effects.
moreover,when enacting an ordinance aimed at secondary effects,a city must rely on evidence of incidental adverse social effect that provides the important governmental interest justifying reasonable time,place and manner restrictions on speech or expressive conduct.mitchell comm on adult entm t establishments,cir.in enacting adult zoning ordinances,the city,however,is entitled to rely heavily on the experience of,and studies produced by,other cities and states,as well as on court opinions from other jurisdictions,id.at,and need not,before enacting such ordinances,conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other cities,so long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the city addresses.city of renton,at.
in this appeal,appellants do not argue that the city ordinance was not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest,that the city lacked an adequate evidentiary basis for adopting the proposed legislation,or that the ordinance did not provide for reasonable alternative avenues of communication in fact,appellants concede that the azo as adopted was facially valid.rather,appellants seek to escape the azo amortization provision by arguing that,although a city must have latitude to experiment,at least at the outset,city of los angeles alameda books,d kennedy,concurring in the judgment,once the data from the experiment has been collected,the appellants must have an opportunity to show that the data does not support the city original adult establishments generate adverse secondary effects.thus,according to appellants,the time,place,and manner restriction like the one at issue in unconstitutional to their establishments because empirical data gathered in the years after the passage of the ordinance in demonstrates that their particular adult establishments have not generated adverse secondary effects and therefore does not support the original theoretical justification for passing the ordinance.
appellants are quite right that the supreme court has indicated that cities must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to experiment with solutions to admittedly serious problems.city of renton,at.quoting young american mini theatres,d plurality opinion see also alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment w e have consistently held that a city must have latitude to experiment,at least at the outset,and that very little evidence is required.although these statements conceivably could be read,as appellants read them,to imply that a city secondary effects rationale for enacting a zoning ordinance like the azo or the renton ordinance may be subject to a challenge based on data,we are not aware appellants do not point us supreme court or federal appellate court opinion allowing such a challenge moreover,in the absence of any clearly defined standards for judging such a first amendment appellants provide none are disinclined to grant appellants relief on this basis.
as discussed above,the applicable standard as it relates to the secondary effects rationale requires only that a city show that,in enacting its adult establishment zoning ordinance,the city relied on evidence that is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem of secondary effects that the city addresses.city of renton,at.emphasis added.thus,when cities exercise their power to zone the location of adult establishments,they need not show that each individual adult establishment actually generates the undesired secondary effects.see ward,at.t he validity of an ordinance depends on the relation it bears to the overall problem the government seeks to correct,not on the extent to which it furthers the government interests in an individual case.emphasis added.and,it follows that the city of charlotte does not have to show th
