child evangelism fellowship of maryland,cef,which describes itself as a nonprofit,organization composed of believers whose purpose is to evangelize boys and girls with the gospel of the lord jesus christ,appeals to this court a second time.cef once again seeks injunctive relief to obtain access to the forum established for flyers in montgomery county public elementary schools.in the first appeal,the district court denied cef request for injunctive relief we reversed and remanded for further proceedings.see child evangelism fellowship of,montgomery county pub,cir cef i.
after that decision,montgomery county public schools mcps enacted a new policy governing access to the flyer forum.considering this new policy on remand,the district court again refused to issue an injunction requiring mcps to permit cef access to this forum in order to distribute its good news club flyers.child evangelism fellowship of,montgomery county pub,d cef ii.the district court held that mcps flyer forum is a nonpublic forum subject only to a test of reasonableness.id.at.the court then concluded that the restrictions mcps imposed on access to the forum were reasonable and did not violate cef free speech rights.id.at.
although we affirm some of the district court subsidiary rulings,because the unfettered discretion retained by mcps to control access to the flyer forum in its new policy does not provide adequate protection for viewpoint neutrality,we must reverse the judgment of the district court with respect to that forum.
beginning in,cef attempted to inform parents of elementary school children in montgomery county,maryland,about its good news club meetings.at these meetings,held on school property after school hours,children recite bible verses,sing songs,play games,learn bible stories,and pray under the leadership of trained staff who primarily are volunteers.see cef i,at.cef sought to communicate information about the good news club meetings through several forums in the county elementary schools,including nights,open houses,community bulletin boards and display tables,and each school flyer forum.see id.describing content of flyers and method of distribution via the flyer forums.
when mcps denied it access to all of these various forums,cef filed this action challenging the constitutionality of that denial and seeking injunctive relief.the district court did grant cef some injunctive relief.the court required mcps to provide cef access on the same terms that apply to other community groups to nights,open houses,community bulletin boards,and display tables.however,the court denied cef request for a preliminary injunction providing it access to the flyer forum.id.although the district court recognized that controlling precedent likely compelled the conclusion that denying cef access to this forum infringed the group first amendment free speech rights,it concluded that the asserted establishment clause problem caused by allowing distribution of the good news club flyers might ultimately trump cef free speech rights.weighing these competing interests,the court found that cef had not established a likelihood of success on the merits as to its claim to access the flyer forum.
in cef i,we initially noted that,like the district court,mcps now recognized that excluding cef from the flyer forum infringed the group free speech rights.although mcps had contended in its appellate brief that excluding cef because of its proselytizing religious viewpoint did not constitute viewpoint discrimination,at oral argument mcps changed its position,conced ing that under controlling precedent,the exclusion was unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination violating cef first amendment free speech rights.id.at.we found this concession.id.at holding that good news club milford cent,d,directly controls.moreover,unlike the district court,we concluded that distribution of cef flyers would not violate the establishment clause.id.at.accordingly,we reversed the district court denial of preliminary injunctive relief with respect to the flyer forum and remanded for further proceedings.
shortly after our decision in cef i,mcps enacted a new policy regarding distribution of materials in public elementary schools.mcps instituted the policy for the stated purpose of distributing informational materials and announcements while maintaining a learning environment free from disruption.the policy provides that the intent of the board of education is to designate appropriate materials for display and distribution and maintain a limited nonpublic forum.
the policy provides mcps with broad discretion over flyer distribution at three different points in the endorsement stage,the approval stage,and the withdrawal stage.five categories of groups may submit flyers to mcps concerning activities that these groups sponsor or endorse mcps itself a within the county,state,or federal government parent teacher licensed daycare providers operating on school campuses and n onprofit organized youth sports leagues.because o nly information concerning activities sponsored or endorsed by the listed organizations will be approved by mcps,any group that is not obtain an endorsement if it wishes to distribute its flyers.
in addition to being one of the groups with endorsement power,mcps is the sole entity with the authority to approve flyers for distribution.a regulation implementing the new policy requires any organization seeking to distribute a flyer to provide the appropriate mcps official a copy of the material at least school days prior to distribution.all flyers must identify on the document the name of the listed group endorsing its distribution.the policy provides that mcps may approve any flyer submitted or endorsed by a listed group for distribution emphasis added.
finally,even after approving a flyer,mcps retains the right to withdraw approval of material from any source if it is determined that distribution would undermine the intent of this policy.the regulation elaborates on the meaning of this withdrawal power,clarifying that mcps officials may withdraw approval of any flyer whose distribution would undermine the intent of the policy or could reasonably be predicted to cause substantial disruption of,or material interference with,school activities.
mcps moved to dismiss cef complaint as moot in light of this new policy.cef responded by moving for summary judgment.it sought a declaration that mcps violated the first amendment by excluding it from,and a permanent injunction requiring its admission to,the flyer forum.cef also sought a permanent injunction regarding the forums to which the district court previously had granted it preliminary injunctive nights,open houses,community bulletin boards,and display tables.additionally,cef requested costs,attorneys fees,and nominal damages.
after hearing argument,the district court entered an order denying cef request for a permanent injunction and dissolving as moot,in light of the new policy,the existing preliminary injunction as to the various forums.the court also denied cef motion for summary judgment,and granted mcps motion to dismiss as moot the remainder of the case,with the exception of cef request to recoup fees and costs for litigation up to the time of our previous decision.in the opinion accompanying this order,the district court explained its reasoning in its view,the flyer forum was a nonpublic forum subject only to a test of reasonableness,and mcps had reasonably limited access to this forum.cef ii,d at.
cef noted a timely appeal in which it contends that the district court erred in denying injunctive relief and in holding that mcps new policy regulating access to the flyer forum did not violate cef first amendment rights 
no party disputes that the good news club flyers constitute a form of speech protected by the first amendment.however,the government need not permit all forms of speech on property that it owns and controls.int l soc y for krishna consciousness,lee,d iskcon.rather,t he existence of a right of access to public property and the standard by which limitations upon such a right must be evaluated differ depending on the character of the property at issue.perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.the supreme court has adopted a forum analysis as a means of determining when the government interest in limiting the use of its property to its intended purpose outweighs the interest of those wishing to use the property for other purposes.cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d.therefore,we begin by briefly setting forth this forum analysis and the principles applicable to the flyer forum at issue here.
the supreme court has recognized several types of forums.the first is the traditional public forum places which by long tradition or by government fiat have been devoted to assembly and debate,such as streets and parks.perry,at.in the traditional public forum,the rights of the state to limit expressive activity are sharply circumscribed the state may only enact time,place,and manner restrictions or rules that are necessary to serve a compelling state interest and narrowly drawn to achieve that end.id.
a second type of nonpublic of p ublic property which is not by tradition or designation a forum for public communication.id.at.to maintain a nonpublic forum,the government must employ selective access policies,whereby forum participation is governed by individual,judgments.educ.television comm forbes,d see also cornelius,at.the government may be more restrictive in its regulation of speech in a nonpublic forum than in a traditional public one.in addition to the ability to enact time,place,and manner restrictions,the government may also reserve the nonpublic forum for its intended purposes,communicative or otherwise,as long as the regulation on speech is reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker view.perry,at.
a third category lies in between,and is a hybrid of,the other two forums.this type of forum is created by government designation of a place or channel of communication for use by the public at large for assembly and speech,for use by certain speakers,or for the discussion of certain subjects.cornelius,at.it may be of either a limited or unlimited character.iskcon,at.the government can not create such a forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse,but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse.cornelius,at.the supreme court has sometimes referred to these intermediate forums as designated public forums,see,united states am.library ass n,d forbes,at.lamb chapel center moriches union free sch,d iskcon,at,but at other times the court has used the phrase limited public forum to describe this category,see,am.library ass n,at.good news club,at.santa fe indep.sch.dist.doe,d rosenberger rector visitors of of,d cornelius,at.perry,at.widmar vincent,d heffron int l soc y for krishna consciousness,d.
although the court has never squarely addressed the difference between a designated public forum and a limited public forum,its most recent opinions suggest that there indeed is a distinction.in a limited public forum,the government creates a channel for a specific or limited type of expression where one did not previously exist.in such a forum,the state may be justified in reserving its forum for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics,subject only to the limitation that its actions must be viewpoint neutral and reasonable.good news club,at.quoting rosenberger,at.internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.in a designated public forum,by contrast,the government makes public property that would not otherwise qualify as a traditional public forum generally accessible to all speakers.in such a forum,regulations on speech are subject to the same limitations as that governing a traditional public forum namely,strict scrutiny.iskcon,at.
to recapitulate,in a traditional public forum the government may only establish time,place,and manner restrictions or rules that are necessary to achieve a compelling state interest and are narrowly drawn to achieve that interest.perry,at.a designated public forum is subject to the same limitations as that governing a traditional public forum.iskcon,at.in a limited public forum,however,the government may restrict access to certain groups or to discussion of certain topics,subject to two limitations the government restrictions must be both reasonable and viewpoint neutral.good news club,at.finally,in a nonpublic forum the government may employ a selective access policy in which individual judgments govern forum participation,again subject to the same two limitations the policy must be reasonable and viewpoint neutral.forbes,at.see also perry,at.
thus,while the constitution imposes more severe restrictions on government regulation of private speech in a traditional public forum or a designated public forum than in a limited public forum or a forum,even in the last two categories,government restrictions on private speech must be both reasonable and viewpoint neutral.
the district court held that the flyer forum was a forum subject only to a test of reasonableness and that mcps new policy reasonably limited access to this forum to groups whose announcements relate to themes of traditional educational relevance.cef ii,d at.
cef vehemently contends that the court erred in characterizing the flyer forum as a nonpublic forum.as the supreme court opined in response to a similar contention in lamb chapel,at,there is considerable force to this argument.although the mcps policy states that it intends to create a nonpublic forum,it is what the government does,and the nature of the governmental property and its compatibility with expressive activity,rather than statements,that a court examines in determining the nature of a forum.cornelius,at.mcps created the new policy and has used the flyer forum to provide a method to facilitate,without disruption,communication of informational material or announcements from certain governmental speakers and community groups to parents of elementary school children.thus,the flyer forum would seem to be a limited public forum,a public forum created by government designation of a place or channel of communication for use by certain speakers,or for the discussion of certain topics.cornelius,at.see also good news club,at.
however,like the supreme court in lamb chapel,at,we need not rule on this issue.this is so because,even if the district court accurately characterized the flyer forum as nonpublic and the record supported its finding that mcps reasonably limited the forum to groups whose announcements involve themes of traditional educational relevance,cef ii,d at,the district court clearly erred in in its forum analysis.the district court held that as a nonpublic forum,the flyer forum was subject only to the test of reasonableness.cef ii,d at.actually,as mcps expressly concedes,even in a nonpublic forum,government regulation must be not only reasonable but also viewpoint neutral.
the district court relied on perry and cornelius in concluding that the policy need only be reasonable.however,rather than emphasiz ing that the standard for exclusion from the nonpublic forum was merely that of reasonableness,as the district court believed,cef ii,d at,those cases make clear that viewpoint neutrality is required even in a nonpublic forum.see cornelius,at.control over access to a nonpublic forum can be based on subject matter and speaker identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral.emphasis added perry,at.holding that in a nonpublic forum the regulation on speech must be reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker view emphasis added see also endowment for the arts finley,d souter,dissenting like this case,rosenberger involved viewpoint discrimination,and we have made it clear that such discrimination is impermissible in all forums,even nonpublic ones emphasis added.
moreover,viewpoint neutrality requires not just that a government refrain from explicit viewpoint discrimination,but also that it provide adequate safeguards to protect against the improper exclusion of viewpoints.see bd.of regents southworth,d directing remand as to one portion of a forum access policy the student referendum for funding because it was unclear what protection,if any,there is for viewpoint neutrality santa fe indep.sch,at.holding that l ike the student referendum for funding in southworth the student election system at issue provided insufficient safeguards for diverse student speech see also forsyth county nationalist movement,d lewis wilson,cir 
with these principles in mind,we turn to the central question in this cef policy regulating access to the flyer forum protect against viewpoint discrimination 
in support of its contention that the mcps policy is not viewpoint neutral,cef offers two arguments.the first is unconvincing,but the second has merit.
initially,pointing to its continued exclusion from the flyer forum despite the access afforded to other assertedly similar groups,cef contends that nothing has really changed since the time of the prior appeal.at the time of that first appeal,mcps concededly engaged in viewpoint discrimination,thereby violating cef free speech rights,when it excluded cef from the forum.cef now argues that its present exclusion from the forum necessarily means that mcps must still be engaged in viewpoint discrimination.
the basic difficulty with this argument is that circumstances have changed since the time of the prior appeal.at that time,mcps had no discernible policy governing access to the flyer forum.see cef i,at.at that time,mcps admitted that it refused to distribute cef flyers because of the group evangelical proselytizing mission.and,at that time,mcps even acknowledged that its exclusion of the good news club flyers constituted viewpoint discrimination violating cef free speech rights.id.at.in the prior appeal,mcps simply argued that the establishment clause justified this viewpoint argument that we rejected.id.at.the present appeal arises in a very different context.mcps has now instituted a written policy regulating access to the flyer forum.mcps acknowledges that it will not endorse cef or another religious group but represents that if a listed organization sponsors or endorses flyers from any religious group,then it will distribute those flyers via the forum mcps contends that this commitment demonstrates that it no longer engages in viewpoint discrimination.
nevertheless,cef maintains that precedent requires that we hold that the policy permits viewpoint discrimination because 
the supreme court employs an objective,direct analysis to determine whether a religious speaker has been unconstitutionally excluded.in lamb chapel,rosenberger,and good news club,the supreme court simply examined whether any other group permitted access to the forum was similar to the religious group or addressed a similar topic.a match triggered access for the religious group.
reply brief at.we are not persuaded that precedent requires such a conclusion.
in lamb chapel,rosenberger,and good news club,the supreme court did not rely solely on an objective comparison of included and excluded groups in determining whether a governmental forum access policy was viewpoint neutral.the history of the forum and a comparison of the characteristics of the included and excluded groups were,of course,relevant to the court in these cases,but they were not determinative.rather,in each case the court found that the challenged governmental policies violated the first amendment free speech clause because the policies permitted viewpoint discrimination.
thus,if mcps established an access policy that was reasonable and eliminated viewpoint discrimination,we would hold that it did not violate cef free speech rights whether or not cef thereby gained admission to the flyer forum.it is entirely proper for a governmental entity to attempt to conform its policies to the demands of the first amendment.even when litigation prompts the change,if a revised policy passes constitutional muster,a court will not penalize the government for transgressions under an earlier policy.see,diloreto downey unified sch.dist.bd.of,cir.
but to withstand constitutional scrutiny under the free speech clause,the government access policy also must provide safeguards sufficient to ensure viewpoint neutrality.that is the rub in this case.
cef contends that the new policy does not provide such safeguards because it gives mcps unfettered discretion to deny access to the flyer forum for any reason at viewpoint discrimination.we find this argument compelling.
the supreme court has long held that the government violates the first amendment when it gives a public official unbounded discretion to decide which speakers may access a traditional public forum.see,forsyth county,at.city of lakewood plain dealer pub,d shuttlesworth city of birmingham,d.such unbridled discretion threatens two specific harms in the first amendment context.first,its existence,coupled with the power of prior restraint,intimidates parties into censoring their own speech,even if the discretion and power are never actually abused.lakewood,at.second,the absence of express standards renders it difficult to differentiate between a legitimate denial of access and an illegitimate abuse of censorial power.id.at.
the danger of such boundless discretion,therefore,is that the government may succeed in unconstitutionally suppressing particular protected speech by hiding the suppression from public scrutiny.as the supreme court has explained,a government regulation that allows arbitrary application has the potential for becoming a means of suppressing a particular point of view.forsyth county,at.internal quotation marks omitted see also se.promotions,conrad,d t he danger of censorship and of abridgment of our precious first amendment freedoms is too great where officials have unbridled discretion over a forum use.
although the supreme court has not yet had occasion to apply the unbridled discretion doctrine outside the context of a traditional public forum,the dangers posed by unbridled the ability to hide unconstitutional viewpoint just as present in other forums.thus,there is broad agreement that,even in limited public and nonpublic forums,investing governmental officials with boundless discretion over access to the forum violates the first amendment.see,atlanta journal constitution city of atlanta dep t of aviation,cir deboer village of oak park,cir lewis wilson,cir summum callaghan,cir sentinel commc ns watts,cir.see also southworth bd.of regents,cir holding that unbridled discretion inquiry is a component of viewpoint discrimination analysis,which applies in all forums.
this does not mean that the unbridled discretion analysis is precisely the same when a limited public or nonpublic forum,rather than a traditional public forum,is involved.the unbridled discretion inquiry is not a static inquir y,impervious to context rather,a court will review a grant of discretion in light of the characteristic nature and function of that forum.ridley.bay transp,cir.t hat discretionary access is a defining characteristic of the nonpublic forum suggests that more official discretion is permissible in a nonpublic forum than would be acceptable in a public forum,but even so,this does not insulate restrictions on nonpublic or limited public forums from an unbridled discretion challenge.griffin sec y of veterans affairs.for this reason,even in cases involving nonpublic or limited public forums,a policy like the one at issue here that permits officials to deny access for any reason,or that does not provide sufficient criteria to prevent viewpoint discrimination,generally will not survive constitutional scrutiny.see,atlanta journal constitution,at southworth,at lewis,at summum,at sentinel,at 
mcps does not argue to the contrary.it does not assert that the unbridled discretion doctrine is for some reason inapplicable here.nor does it argue that limitations on official discretion are unnecessary to safeguard against viewpoint discrimination.what mcps does instead is somewhat mystifyingly contend that its policy involves the complete absence of discretion and that now unlike before,mcps does not include or exclude flyers based on its assessment of
