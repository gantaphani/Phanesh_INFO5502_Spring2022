background 
plaintiff jorge ruiz is a hispanic man of puerto rican origin.he was hired as a mental health aide with the rockland county department of mental health in february.in january,he was promoted to the position of mental health worker i and in november,he was promoted to mental health worker ii,a low level supervisory position.all parties agree that as a mental health worker ii,ruiz had an obligation to report allegations of patient abuse and employee misconduct to his supervisors.defendant mary ann was the commissioner of mental health for rockland county,new york at all times relevant to this appeal.
from his hire until november,ruiz received satisfactory performance evaluations.however,on november,shortly after his promotion to mental health worker ii,a patient accused ruiz of sexual assault.he was suspended with pay pending an investigation,but returned to work after kayton kurowski,an assistant to commissioner,recommended that no administrative action be taken because the patient allegations could not be substantiated.
in june,two of ruiz female,and,accused him of sexual harassment.margot vasquez,of the rockland county office of employee rights and equity compliance,conducted an investigation into the complaints.during his interview with vasquez on july,ruiz admitted to hugging and kissing and when he greeted them in the morning and said goodbye in the evening,but claimed that they had sometimes initiated the contact and that he was not aware that it made them uncomfortable.he denied the more serious allegations of sexual harassment.
in a submitted statement,ruiz also made several allegations of his own.he claimed that he had witnessed many instances of inappropriate behavior by staff members,including and,that had taken place in front of other supervisors and patients.ruiz also accused of having sexual relations with a patient,e.h.as support for this accusation,he recounted that had told him that nancy panicucci,director of acute services,had met with her about a rumor that she was dating a patient.explained to panicucci that she and had been friends prior to his admission and that their relationship had been strictly professional since he had been admitted.panicucci accepted her explanation and the matter was dropped.however,ruiz stated that he subsequently heard from several other sources that was having a sexual relationship with 
on july,while vasquez was in the process of conducting her investigation,reported to department of mental health personnel that he was having a sexual relationship with on the same day that made the accusation,submitted a letter of resignation effective august.on july,m.was suspended pending an investigation into the allegations.the investigation never occurred because resigned before she could be interviewed and never returned to work.
in a report dated october,vasquez concluded that and allegations of sexual harassment could not be substantiated.the other employees whom vasquez interviewed as part of the investigation did not confirm and allegations of sexual harassment.however,one interviewee thought that ruiz was spending too much time with female staff members.because ruiz behavior gave the appearance of impropriety,vasquez recommended that he be moved to another position within the department and closely supervised.
in november,commissioner asked kurowski to review vasquez report,at which point ruiz knowledge about and affair,as well as his observation of other employees inappropriate behavior,came to light.kurowski interviewed ruiz and he reaffirmed the statements he made to vasquez.kurowski recommended administrative action be taken on the grounds that ruiz had failed to report allegations of patient abuse and employee misconduct.as a result,commissioner preferred two charges against ruiz gross misconduct for failure to report allegations of patient abuse relationship with and gross misconduct for failure to report inappropriate behavior of in the presence of patients.ruiz had the option to choose either binding arbitration or a disciplinary hearing under of the civil service law.ruiz chose to have a disciplinary hearing and,through counsel,denied the charges.
the same day that kurowski made his recommendation that administrative action should be taken against ruiz,a patient,j,reported to department of mental health personnel that ruiz had raped her in november.in addition to informing the rockland country sheriff department,commissioner amended the charges to include two new charges rape of a patient and sexual abuse of a patient.the county sought ruiz termination on the basis of the four charges against him.
commissioner designated ira lobel as the hearing officer for the disciplinary hearing.after four days of hearings,in which ruiz,and many of ruiz coworkers testified,lobel issued his recommendations,noting that neither side objected to the fairness of the proceedings.in his recommendations,lobel exonerated ruiz of the rape and sexual assault charges,finding that was not credible and the county had not sustained its burden of proof.however,he found ruiz guilty of failing to report his knowledge of sexual relationship with,for which he recommended a suspension.he did not recommend termination because i t appears that other supervisors and employees knew parts of these specifications and failed to act,concluding that w hile this alone can not obviate ruiz from his responsibility,it can be taken into account to assess the appropriate discipline.finally,he found ruiz guilty of failing to report inappropriate behavior of his coworkers,but also found that the inappropriate behavior was both commonplace and common knowledge among employees.because ruiz had been singled out for punishment on this charge,lobel concluded that ruiz should be punished by a written warning only.
after reviewing lobel findings and recommendations,commission adopted lobel findings of fact except as to the charge of failing to report inappropriate behavior of coworkers.on that charge,commissioner stated that 
i find as fact based upon the record that the misconduct you failed to report was not common knowledge and that you were not singled out for discipline i find as fact that your knowledge of the extent and depth of the misconduct was unique and that,as a supervisor,your failure to report perpetrated misconduct you knew to be wrong and potentially injurious to both staff and patients.
on the charge of failing to report sexual relationship with a patient,commissioner found that 
y ou were aware first hand of a relationship which you knew constituted patient abuse between employee and patient your knowledge and deliberate failure to report constituted,in my opinion,a most serious breach of your duty to protect the and safety of patients,particularly those suffering from mental illness.you intentionally permitted a patient to continue to be abused by an employee.such conduct is inexcusable.
commission determined that termination was appropriate for both charges.ruiz did not appeal commissioner decision.
subsequently,ruiz brought suit against the county of rockland and commissioner in the southern district of new york alleging race and national orig
