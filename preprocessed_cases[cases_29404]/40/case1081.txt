opinion of the court 
hospital appeals from the order of the district court for the western district of pennsylvania granting summary judgment in favor of appellee kathleen sebelius,secretary of the united states department of health and human services secretary,denying a reimbursement claim for loss on depreciable assets resulting from the merger between braddock medical center bmc and university of pittsburgh medical center system upmcs.a statutory merger may result in a depreciation reassessment of the value of medicare regulations,but only if the merger was between unrelated parties and constituted a bona fide sale.the district court here determined that the merger between bmc and upmcs was not a bona fide sale,but did not reach the issue of whether the merger was between unrelated parties.we conclude that the district court determination that the merger was not a bona fide sale was not based on substantial evidence,in light of errors made in determining the value of certain assets.thus,remand is required in order for the agency to consider the bona fide sale issue anew.however,we will also address the issue of whether the parties were related because,if they were,the merger can not satisfy the two prong test and remand would be a useless act.
we find that the secretary interpretation of the related party examination of whether the parties were related pre and contrary to the plain language of the regulations,and we conclude that,under the proper,test,the parties were not related at the time of the transaction.we will therefore vacate the district court order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
we recently confronted one of the issues raised in this appeal,regarding whether the transaction was a bona fide sale,in a similar context.see albert einstein med.ctr.sebelius,cir.while einstein informs our analysis as to that aspect of the case,the facts here are markedly different.
on november,heritage health systems heritage and its subsidiaries,bmc and the heritage health foundation foundation,entered into an agreement to merge and affiliate with upmcs.bmc was a nonprofit corporation located in pittsburgh,pennsylvania,with heritage as its sole corporate member.upmcs is a nonprofit corporation also based in pittsburgh.the foundation is a pennsylvania nonprofit corporation with a purpose of providing support of a charitable nature to bmc through and other similar activities.as part of the agreement,bmc transferred its assets and liabilities to upmcs pursuant to a merger of bmc into a subsidiary of upmcs that was named.the agreement also provided for the structure of the governing board of and for various other rights and responsibilities pertaining to the governance of the newly created.specifically,of the voting directors of the board of were to be appointed by upmcs,and not less than of the voting directors were to be appointed by the foundation.at the same time,the foundation entered into a separate agreement with upmcs setting up a fund consisting of million dollars that was subject to exclusive supervision and control of the foundation,but which was to be used to support various activities of.app.following the merger,acting as bmc successor,filed a claim with medicare for reimbursement of losses related to the transfer of depreciable medical equipment through the merger pursuant to f and l as is discussed more fully below,the regulations permit the loss adjustment only if the transaction was a bona fide sale between unrelated parties.the claim was denied by medicare fiscal intermediary,veritus medicare services intermediary.subsequently appealed the intermediary denial of its claim to the provider reimbursement review board prrb.
the prrb ruled in favor of,disagreeing with the intermediary conclusion and determining that the statutory merger between bmc and upmcs was not between related parties.in particular,the prrb rejected the intermediary argument that the phrase between related parties in the regulations applies not only to the relationship between the entities,but also to the relationship that exists between the entities and the entity that results this case,the relationship between bmc and.the prrb concluded that the intermediary reading of the related parties requirement was contrary to the plain language of the regulation,which was unambiguous in its meaning that the related party concept will be applied to the entities that are merging as they existed prior to the transaction.app.emphasis in original.the prrb dealt with the bona fide sale requirement in conclusory terms,stating that the merger is not required to meet the bona fides of sales transactions addressed in f.app.the prrb remanded several issues regarding consideration to the intermediary,but only for purposes of computing the reimbursable loss.
the prrb ruling was then reversed by the deputy administrator administrator of centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,who denied claim for reimbursement,disagreeing with the prrb on both the related parties issue and the bona fide sale issue.the administrator found that the bona fide sale requirement did apply to the merger,and that the difference between the value of the transferred assets and the consideration received for them in the course of the merger indicated the absence of a bona fide sale.app.additionally,the administrator found that the transaction was not consummated at arm length,as required by the bona fide sale provision.app.the administrator further concluded that the prrb interpretation of the related parties provision was incorrect and adopted the intermediary position that the related parties inquiry should properly consider the relationship between both the pre and entities.app.using this interpretation of the related parties provision,the administrator concluded that bmc and were related parties,and disallowed the loss claim.app.the administrator decision became the final decision of the secretary.
appealed the administrator decision to the district court pursuant to the administrative procedures act apa,and the parties consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by the magistrate judge pursuant to c and.and the secretary each filed motions for summary judgment.the district court denied motion for summary judgment and granted the secretary motion for summary judgment,affirming the decision of the administrator.timely appealed 
our review of agency action is governed by the apa.we may only set aside agency actions,findings,and conclusions that are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law or unsupported by substantial evidence.a,e.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.mercy home health leavitt,cir quoting richardson perales,d.
under the medicare act the act,et,medicare service providers such as are entitled to claim the depreciation of property and equipment used to provide health care to medicare patients as a reimbursable cost b.an asset depreciable value is initially set at its historical cost,generally equal to the purchase price,which is then prorated over its estimated useful life.a and b.however,the calculated annual depreciation is only an estimate of the asset declining value.when an asset is ultimately sold or disposed of by the provider for less than its undepreciated basis a depreciation adjustment is made,measured by the difference between the sales price and the estimated remaining value.the healthcare provider can submit a claim for additional reimbursement from the medicare program on the basis of such a depreciation adjustment 
in,cms adopted regulations whereby transfers in statutory mergers qualified for such depreciation adjustment,subject to certain requirements.l the transfer of assets in a statutory merger can give rise to a depreciation adjustment only if the merger was between unrelated parties as defined by,and,if the merged corporation was a health care provider before the merger,only if the merger was a bona fide sale.l i and f einstein,at.crucially,both of these requirements must be satisfied for there to be a depreciation adjustment entitling a provider to reimbursement for losses.
bona fide sale 
in addition to promulgating regulations,the secretary issues manuals to assist healthcare providers and fiscal intermediaries in administering the system of reimbursement and in interpreting the promulgated regulations.in einstein,at,we noted that two of these manuals are particularly relevant for determining the standards relevant to whether a bona fide sale has taken place the provider reimbursement manual prm and the program memorandum pm,which was issued on october,and entitled clarification of the application of the regulations at cfr l to mergers and consolidations involving providers.
the pm provides that no gain or loss may be recognized for medicare payment purposes unless the transfer of the assets resulted from a bona fide sale as required by regulation f and as defined in the prm at.the cited regulation,f,introduces the bona fide sale language at subsection f,but does not define it.the referenced passage in the prm clarifies the meaning 
a bona fide sale contemplates an arm length transaction between a willing and well informed buyer and seller,neither being under coercion,for reasonable consideration.an arm length transaction is a transaction negotiated by unrelated parties,each acting in its own self interest.
prm,ch,app.thus,a bona fide sale in this context is a transaction that has been negotiated at arm length and results in exchange of reasonable consideration.einstein,at.
the district court granted the secretary motion for summary judgment on the ground that the merger between bmc and upmcs that gave rise to did not constitute a bona fide sale.this conclusion was based on the district court finding that there was substantial evidence to support the secretary conclusion that reasonable consideration was not exchanged.the district court did not discuss the issue of whether the transaction was negotiated at arm length.we review de novo the district court conclusion that substantial evidence supported the secretary position.mercy home health,at.
in assessing whether reasonable consideration was exchanged,a determination must be made as to whether the exchange of value for value was close enough to qualify as reasonable consideration.relevant questions include is there a disparity how large is it both the administrator and the district court concluded that the instant transaction did not result in the exchange of reasonable consideration based on the following assessments of the value of the assets and liabilities involved 
assets transferred from to 
in land,land improvements,buildings,and equipment from bmc 
in assets from bmc 
obligation from the foundation 
liabilities assumed by 
assumption of bmc debts by 
the administrator had little difficulty concluding that,given the difference between million and million,reasonable consideration was not exchanged.app.after detailing the above figures,the district court concluded,with no additional discussion,that t he secretary conclusion that the transaction was not a bona fide sale is supported by substantial evidence in the record,including appraisals.dist.
it is clear,however,that the figure of as the value of the land,land improvements,buildings,and equipment from bmc is not accurate,and that the correct figure is closer to the mistake is explained in opening brief,and the secretary concedes the point in her supplemental brief.once this error is taken into account,the reasonable consideration question becomes much closer,with receiving million in assets while assuming million in liabilities.under this recalculation,the assets given are no longer double what was received,but exceeded what was received by only million.we will accordingly vacate the district court order and remand for further consideration of the bona fide sale issue.we note that there are two additional issues which may make the consideration question even closer.
first,it is not obvious that the million from the foundation is,as the administrator describes it,a million dollar cash asset.app.argues that this million number is not cash or a cash asset,and is instead a fund that the foundation can distribute to at the foundation discretion.the relevant agreement between the foundation and upmcs states that during the term of the fund comprised of the million,the foundation shall apply so much of the fund as the foundation shall,in its discretion,deem adequate and appropriate.app.the issue,then,is whether this asset should be valued at million,or something less.neither the administrator nor the district court focused on this issue,no doubt because it was unnecessary to reach it due to the disparity in the consideration when the inaccurate tangible asset value was used.however,the district court should focus on the question of the proper valuation of the foundation commitment for purposes of assessing reasonable consideration on remand.
second,the million dollar assets figure included only in actual cash.app.the rest of that figure includes,among other things,in accounts receivable,the details of which such as aging and collectability were not addressed,and a variety of other assets that may not be available for immediate use in einstein we intimated that it may be appropriate to discount fair market value of assets to adjust for the fact that they are.at.this is an issue that the district court should consider on remand.resolution of these two issues could affect the apparent million discrepancy that still exists,possibly making the reasonable consideration issue a very close call.
given the significant difference between the correct value and the figure the administrator and district court used as the value of the land,land improvements,buildings,and equipment from bmc,we find that the conclusion that the transaction between bmc and upmcs did not result in an exchange of reasonable consideration was not supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,we will remand so that the district court may consider the question of the reasonableness of the consideration in light of the correct figure and after taking into account these two issues.
as noted above,the district court did not reach the issue of whether the transaction between bmc and upmcs was conducted at arm length,since the district court decided that reasonable consideration was not exchanged and so there was no bona fide sale.whether the agreement to merge and affiliate was arrived at through arm length negotiations is a inquiry,and we will not attempt to resolve that question for the first time here on remand,the district court should consider whether the merger was negotiated at arm length as part of determining whether the merger was a bona fide sale,unless its decision regarding the question of the reasonableness of the consideration exchanged again renders this unnecessary.
related parties 
the second prong of the test for allowance of a depreciation adjustment requires the merger to have been between unrelated parties as defined by.einstein.the relevant regulation states that i f the statutory merger is between two or more related corporations as specified in,no revaluation of assets is permitted for those assets acquired by the surviving corporation.l.the referenced provision,defines related to the provider as follows 
related to the provider means that the provider to a significant extent is associated or affiliated with or has control of or is controlled by the organization furnishing the services,facilities,or supplies.
b.the secretary urges an interpretation of these two provisions whereby the relationship of the parties must be assessed both pre and.this interpretation would require us,in this case,to examine the association,affiliation,and control not only of bmc and upmcs,but also the relationship of bmc and.this interpretation is set out in the secretary pm.with respect to related organizations the pm specifies 
in applying the related organizations principle at,consideration must be given to whether the composition of the new board of directors,or other governing body or management team,includes significant representation from the previous board s or management team s.if that is the case,no real change of control of the assets has occurred and no gain or loss may be recognized as a result of the transaction.the fact that the parties are unrelated before the transaction does not bar a related organizations finding as a result of the transaction.that is,it is appropriate to compare the governing team composition before the transaction with the governing team composition after the transaction,even though there was no contemporaneous coexistence of those.
although the related parties issue was briefed and presented,the district court did not rule on it,finding it unnecessary to reach that issue given its ruling on the bona fide sale prong.however,both the prrb and the administrator had ruled on the related parties issue,with the prrb concluding that the merger was not between related parties,and the administrator reversing.a review of their respective positions provides a roadmap for our discussion.
the prrb considered the related parties question in depth.the intermediary had argued that the merger was a related party transaction pursuant to,because bmc has the power to significantly influence or direct the actions and policies of.relying on the pm,it urged that the fact that the parties were unrelated prior to the transaction is not controlling if there is the requisite association or control between the parties.in particular,the intermediary argued that the composition of governing board,which consisted of a total of members from the board of bmc and members from enough to establish that the merger was between related parties,because there was continuity of control between bmc and.
on the other hand,argued that pursuant to the language of l and,a statutory merger is between unrelated corporations if the parties are unrelated prior to the transaction,and that bmc and upmcs were unrelated prior to the transaction they argued that an interpretation that also considered the relationship would be contrary to the plain language of the regulations.additionally,argued that even if the intermediary interpretation governed,the fact that six board members from bmc are on the board is not enough to establish the control necessary for a finding that bmc and were related.urged that to be related,one entity must control the this case,bmc must control that under b,c ontrol exists if an individual or an organization has the power,directly or indirectly,significantly to influence or direct the actions or policies of an organization or institution.it argued that no individual or corporation had such power over,since bmc no longer existed.
the prrb adopted the position advocated by upmcbraddock.it found the plain language of the statutory merger regulation dispositive,stating that the text of the relevant regulation is unambiguous in its meaning that the related party concept will be applied to the entities that are merging as they existed prior to the transaction.app.emphasis in original.the prrb categorically rejected the secretary position the plain language of the regulation bars the application of the related party principle to the merging parties relationship to the surviving entity.app.in coming to this conclusion,the prrb reasoned that the very nature of a statutory merger as a combination of entities would likely result in some overlap of membership on the board of directors of the merging corporation and the surviving entity,as well as a continuation of other operations and personnel of the merging organization.the fact that this occurs does not disqualify a statutory merger from revaluation and recognition of any gain or loss under l.app.
the administrator reversed the prrb decision and denied claim for reimbursement.it did so in reliance on the interpretation of the related party regulations adopted by the secretary in the pm,holding as follows 
in applying the related party principles at consideration must be given as to whether the composition of the new board of directors of the surviving corporation included significant representation by bmc its parent corporation heritage health services or its subsidiary heritage foundation,and in that way shows a continuity of control over the surviving entity.
the administrator also set a low bar for establishing control,noting that the term control includes any kind of control,whether or not it is legally enforceable and however it is exercisable or exercised.app.the administrator concluded that bmc had control over based primarily on three facts that the governing board of would consist of individuals out of total board members who would be appointed by the foundation the foundation and bmc were both subsidiaries of heritage health systems that bmc existing management and medical staff were retained to help manage and that continued with the same mission as bmc.
a reviewing court must defer to the agency interpretation unless an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language or by other indications of the secretary intent at the time of the regulation promulgation.thomas jefferson shalala,d citation and internal quotation mark omitted.as noted above,the district court did not reach the related parties issue.the question of whether the merger here was between related parties turns on whether we accept the secretary interpretation of the pure question of law.if we do not accept the secretary interpretation,it is clear that the merger was not between related parties,since both parties agree that bmc and upmcs were unrelated prior to the transaction on november.given this,and given that there is no need to remand the issue of whether the transaction was a bona fide sale unless we find that the transaction was between unrelated parties,we will address this issue.
the sole issue before us is whether the relationship between bmc and is relevant to the related parties inquiry.as our review of the agency ruling above makes clear,the resolution of the issue will turn on our interpretation of the regulations referenced above,l and,and our view as to whether the secretary interpretation of those set out in the pm and the contrary to their plain meaning.
as noted above,the relevant regulation states that i f the statutory merger is between two or more corporations that are unrelated as specified in,the assets of the merged corporation s acquired by the surviving corporation may be revalued.l i.we conclude,as did the prrb,that the only permissible reading of this regulation is that between means.our conclusion is supported by a recent opinion from the tenth circuit court of appeals concluding that the plain language of the regulations precludes the secretary interpretation.via christi reg l med,leavitt,cir.it is worth quoting from the opinion at length 
the plain language of this provision l ii,as well as the plain language of l i,indicates that the related parties inquiry of l focuses solely on whether the parties to the consolidation were related prior to the on whether they were related to the newly created entity.where the plain language of a regulation is clear,we can not torture the language to reach the result the agency wishes.the agency,after all,could easily have drafted language to achieve the result which it now advocates but did not do so.if the secretary wants to take a position that is inconsistent with existing regulations,then the secretary must promulgate new regulations under the provisions of the apa.shalala guernsey mem l,d.
via christi reg l med,leavitt,cir some citations and internal quotation marks omitted.no other court of appeals has discussed the secretary interpretation of these related party regulations 
the language of the regulation,as well as common sense,compels this reading of the regulation.the regulation states that i f the statutory merger is between two or more corporations that are unrelated as specified in section,the assets of the merged corporation s acquired by the surviving corporation may be revalued.l i emphasis added.the language about relatedness only refers to the parties to the corporations that the merger is between not to the corporation that results from the merger.this
