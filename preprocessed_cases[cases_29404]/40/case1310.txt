on december,army specialist aaron pernell unlawfully entered the home of maria durden while inebriated and raped durden in front of her children.durden subsequently sued the government pursuant to the federal tort claims act ftca,b,alleging that the army was negligent and therefore is liable for the sexual assault against her.the government moved to dismiss durden complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and,alternatively,for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the district court granted the government motion with respect to subject matter jurisdiction,and durden appealed.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
pernell joined the army at age eighteen and was deployed to iraq after he completed his initial training in georgia and a stay at fort bragg,north carolina.upon returning to fort bragg subsequent to his deployment,pernell struggled emotionally and began using drugs and abusing alcohol.in march and august of,pernell told his staff sergeant that he desired to kill himself and eleven current and former members of his unit.after each instance,the sergeant discouraged pernell from seeking treatment and cautioned pernell that receiving such treatment could blemish pernell military record.in september,pernell confided in a fellow soldier that he was unable to sleep due to his drug and alcohol use the solider also advised pernell not to seek treatment because it could mess up pernell career.
on september,pernell burglarized a home in fayetteville,north carolina which is adjacent to fort bragg and assaulted the home occupants with a pellet gun.civilian law enforcement arrested pernell and charged him with burglary and assault.pernell was then detained at a civilian jail from september to october,at which time his parents posted bail on his behalf and his platoon leader retrieved him and returned him to fort bragg.during the transport back to fort bragg,pernell again expressed a desire to kill himself and eleven members of his unit.
immediately upon pernell return to fort bragg,the army began the process of administratively separating him.according to durden,pernell commanding officer issued orders on october,that pernell was to have a noncommissioned officer escort at all times both off and on fort bragg and was to be checked on hourly to ensure that he remained in his barracks.durden alleges that the orders were given to prevent harm to innocent base residents.durden also claims that these orders were not enforced.specifically,durden claims that pernell was permitted to leave his barracks at night to use drugs and consume alcohol and,further,that pernell superior officers knew that pernell violated the orders but did not act to ensure that the orders were followed.
the government paints a somewhat different picture of the restrictions placed on pernell following his release from civilian jail and the reasons for the restrictions.according to the government,pernell was not required to have an escort while on fort bragg,was not confined to his barracks,and was not required to be checked on hourly rather,pernell was required to have an escort only when he left fort bragg,which he could not do without first obtaining permission.through an affidavit,the government asserts that revoking a soldier privilege off fort bragg is common while the soldier undergoes the process of being administratively separated,or subsequent to being in civilian confinement,to ensure that the soldier is available for administrative proceedings and does not go absent without leave.the government also notes that pernell received counseling on october,at which time pernell commanding officer first learned of pernell desires to harm himself and others.the government claims that pernell recanted these desires at that time however,out of an abundance of caution,the army ordered that pernell be checked on every two hours during the evening while in his barracks to ensure that he did not harm himself.pernell then underwent a scheduled evaluation on october,after which it was determined that,inter alia,pernell exhibited a low potential for and harm to others.as a result of this assessment,pernell commanding officer lifted the bihourly evening checks.
pernell raped durden on december,at durden residence on fort bragg.in january,pernell became a suspect in durden rape and consented to giving a dna sample that was used to identify him as durden assailant.pernell was also identified at that time as being involved in burglaries and sexual assaults that occurred in and in fayetteville.pernell subsequently requested treatment,and it was then determined that pernell posed a medium risk of harm to himself and others.following this evaluation,the army for the first time,according to the government placed pernell on barracks restriction and ordered that he be monitored at all times.
on december,a general convicted pernell of raping durden.as a result,pernell was sentenced to fifty years imprisonment,had his military rank reduced,and was dishonorably discharged from the army.on august,durden sued the government.durden alleged that the army was aware that pernell posed a safety risk to others,had a duty to protect her from pernell,and breached that duty by failing to execute the october,orders that,according to durden,required that pernell be escorted at all times while on fort bragg and be checked on hourly when in his barracks.
the government moved to dismiss durden complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and,alternatively,for failure to state a claim.specifically,the government asserted that the army did not breach any duty owed to durden under north carolina law and that durden complaint is barred by the ftca exception,h.the district court granted the government motion,and durden appealed.this court has jurisdiction over durden appeal pursuant to.
this court reviews de novo a district court decision on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.cooksey futrell,cir.a defendant may contest subject matter jurisdiction in one of two ways by attacking the veracity of the allegations contained in the complaint or by contending that,even assuming that the allegations are true,the complaint fails to set forth facts upon which jurisdiction is proper.kerns united states,cir.here,despite presenting a version of the facts that differs from durden version with respect to the restrictions placed on pernell,the government challenges to jurisdiction arise under the latter framework.specifically,the government contends that durden allegations,even if true,do not establish that the army acted negligently.additionally and alternatively,the government argues that durden complaint is barred by the ftca exception.because these are facial as opposed to factual challenges to the complaint,durden is afforded the same procedural protection as s he would receive under a rule b consideration,kerns,at,we assume the truthfulness of the facts alleged,id.at.
on appeal,durden opposes each of the government bases for dismissal.we address these bases in turn.
as a sovereign,the united states is immune from all suits against it absent an express waiver of its immunity.welch united states,cir.the ftca provides for one such waiver,wherein 
the district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the united states,for money damages,for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
an action for negligence under the ftca may only be maintained if the government would be liable as an individual under the law of the state where the negligent act occurred.kerns,at citing b.in north carolina where the army alleged negligent act or omission occurred a defendant can not be held liable for negligence absent a duty owed to the plaintiff and breach of that duty.stein asheville city bd.of.accordingly,dismissal of durden complaint on the theory that the allegations are insufficient to give rise to a negligence claim requires us to look beyond the four corners of the complaint and to assess whether,under north carolina law,the army owed any duty to durden and,if it did,whether it breached that duty.
this court considered appeals arising under the same procedural posture as durden appeal in kerns and rivanna trawlers unlimited thompson trawlers,cir,but resolved those cases differently.in kerns,this court vacated the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,stating that where the jurisdictional facts and the facts central to a tort claim are inextricably intertwined,the trial court should ordinarily assume jurisdiction and proceed to the intertwined merits issues.at.notably,the government in kerns challenged the truthfulness of the allegations in the plaintiff complaint not merely their legal sufficiency,see id.and this court concluded that discovery could reveal information that might assist the plaintiff on the intertwined merits issue,id.at.by contrast,this court in rivanna,despite recognizing that the issue at hand was both a question of subject matter jurisdiction and an element of appellants asserted claims,treated the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction as one for failure to state a claim that had been converted into a motion for summary judgment.at.
this case is more akin to rivanna than kerns insofar as the government argued and the district court held that,even assuming that durden allegations are true,the complaint still fails to establish that the army breached a duty to her under north carolina law.see durden united states,cv d,wl,at,durden satisfies the subject matter jurisdiction requirement that the government owed her a duty before the intentional tort was committed durden alleged facts do not establish that the government breached a duty that it owed to her.citation omitted id.at even accepting as true durden allegations regarding the ways that the government restricted pernell after pernell returned to fort bragg following his september,arrest,pernell tendency to commit violent acts did not cause pernell to be in the government custody.id.at a ccepting as true durden allegations regarding the government efforts to restrain pernell,these allegations do not establish the existence of a duty owed by the government to durden under north carolina version of the good samaritan doctrine.moreover,as we explain in greater detail below,durden discovery requests,even if granted,would not assist her on the merits of the underlying negligence issue.thus,despite the district court technically incorrect statement purporting to dismiss durden complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,the court considered the negligence issue as though it were the basis of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim that had been converted into a motion for summary judgment.rivanna,at powell,ret,sitting by designation.
we turn now to whether the district court correctly determined that the government is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.a standard for granting summary judgment.in doing so,we examine in turn durden three theories of a duty that the army owed to her under north carolina law and allegedly breached.
in north carolina,a landlord has a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect his tenants from criminal acts that occur on the premises if such acts are foreseeable.davenport rental.durden first theory of negligence,then,is that the army,as landlord of fort bragg,breached a duty to protect her from pernell reasonably foreseeable attack.
the most probative evidence on the question of whether a criminal act was foreseeable is evidence of prior criminal activity committed.however,certain considerations restrict courts as to which evidence of prior criminal activity is properly considered.general considerations are the location where the prior crimes occurred,the type of prior crimes committed,and the amount of prior criminal activity.
connelly family inns of,citations omitted.foreseeability may also be established by a landlord knowledge of a specific threat against individuals.see davenport,at.durden identifies two incidents that she believes render pernell rape of her foreseeable pernell repeated expressed desires to kill himself and members of his unit viewed collectively and pernell september,burglary and assault in fayetteville for the reasons set forth below,however,we hold that these incidents are not sufficient to render pernell rape of durden foreseeable under north carolina law.
as an initial matter,we reject for two reasons durden argument that pernell prior expressed desires to kill himself and members of his unit established foreseeability of the rape.first,even assuming that pernell desires tend to show that he had a propensity for violence,durden has still failed to demonstrate how such desires fall within the purview of prior criminal activity.see connelly,at emphasis added.to wit,durden has not alleged what crime the mere desire to harm or kill another person,without more,constitutes and north carolina courts require more than the mere wishing of harm upon another person to establish criminal liability.see,state merrill,evidence of defendant expressions of her desire that the victim be dead,absent assent to the murder plan,insufficient to support a charge see also state miller,crime of attempt requires an overt act that must reach far enough towards the accomplishment of the desired result to amount to the commencement of the consummation.second,setting aside the criminality or not of pernell desires,durden has not demonstrated that the army should have gleaned from those desires the notion that pernell would sexually assault any tenant on fort bragg,let alone durden specifically.see davenport,at citing anderson green street llc,h,wl,at,a duty to evict may arise where the landlord knows of a specific threat that one tenant poses to another.
turning now to the september,burglary and assault indeed,a prior criminal activity we are satisfied that it meets the second of connelly three foreseeability criteria insofar as it qualifies as the same type of prior crime as pernell subsequent rape of durden.see,murrow daniels,prior crimes of armed robbery,kidnapping,assault,vehicle theft,and larceny deemed relevant for determining whether sexual assault against plaintiff was foreseeable.with respect to the first prong the location where the prior crimes occurred the north carolina supreme court has been clear that evidence pertaining to the foreseeability of a criminal attack shall not be limited to prior criminal acts occurring on the premises,and criminal acts occurring near the premises in question may be relevant to the question of foreseeability.id.at citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.however,decisions subsequent to murrow have fashioned murrow language as an exception limited to criminal activity in the area immediately surrounding the defendant premises.purvis bryson jewelers,considering only prior criminal activity that occurred within three blocks of defendant property see bennett equity residential,unpublished table decision considering only prior criminal activity that occurred within the defendant apartment complex where plaintiff resided.
here,there is no indication in the record regarding the physical distance between the site of the september,burglary and assault in fayetteville and the site of pernell rape of durden on fort bragg.although one incident occurred off the military installation and the other on the military installation,north carolina courts do not appear to be concerned with such formal.see connelly,at considering,for a crime that occurred in north carolina,prior criminal activity that occurred at the same intersection but on the south carolina side of the intersection.nevertheless,it is possible that if the september,burglary and assault was sufficiently far away from pernell rape of durden,then it is too remote to guide the determination of foreseeability.id.at excluding from a foreseeability analysis prior crimes that occurred in a neighboring town twenty miles away.absent additional information about the distance between the locations of the incidents,however,we are unable to determine how relevant if at all the september,incident is in a foreseeability calculus with respect to pernell rape of durden.
regardless,even assuming that pernell september,burglary and assault is sufficiently near in proximity to the rape,durden argument that the rape was foreseeable fails on connelly third criterion the amount of prior criminal activity.durden does not identify any additional criminal activity other than pernell expressed desires to kill himself and others,which we have already excluded categorically that occurred prior to the rape and that should have alerted the army that it was foreseeable that she would be attacked.murrow,at the plaintiff presented evidence that one hundred incidents of criminal activity at the relevant intersection area had been reported to the sheriff department during the four and a half years leading up to the crime.connelly,at the evidence in this case.indicates that in the five years preceding the armed robbery,one hundred instances of criminal activity bearing on the issue of foreseeability occurred at the relevant intersection.urbano days inn of,denying summary judgment on negligence claim where defendant knew of at least episodes of criminal activity taking place on its motel premises during a period of three years preceding the date of plaintiff injury,and a t least of the episodes occurred during the three and one half months preceding plaintiff injury.rather,durden points to a single incident pernell september,burglary and assault which is not sufficient in hindsight to render a future attack foreseeable for purposes of landlord liability.see davenport,at citing anderson,wl,at a duty to evict may arise.where there is a history of violence by one tenant against other tenants.emphasis added.
accordingly,durden has failed to establish that pernell rape of her was foreseeable under north carolina law,and thus the army did not breach a duty owed to her as landlord of fort bragg.
in general,there is neither a duty to control the actions of a third party,nor to protect another from a third party.scadden holt.however,certain s pecial relationships create a responsibility to take affirmative action for the aid or protection of another,and they arise only in narrow circumstances.bridges parrish,citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.a special relationship can arise between the defendant and the plaintiff,or between the defendant and a tortfeasor.scadden,at.when the latter type of special relationship exists,there is a duty upon the actor to control the tortfeasor conduct and to guard other persons against his dangerous propensities.king durham cnty.mental health developmental disabilities substance abuse,citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.durden second theory of negligence,then,is that the army had a special relationship with pernell,owed to her a duty to protect her from pernell pursuant to that relationship,and breached that duty when pernell raped her.
durden claims that the army had a special relationship with pernell insofar as the army knew or should have know n of pernell s violent propensities and ha d the ability and opportunity to control pernell at the time that he raped durden.stein,at setting forth the test for a special relationship.even assuming,arguendo,that durden can satisfy both prongs of the test and,moreover,that the government was negligent in failing to control pernell,durden claim that the government is liable pursuant to the ftca still fails.that is because t he ability and opportunity to control a third party must be more than mere physical ability to control.rather,it must rise to the level of custody,or legal right to control.scadden,at.the ftca is clear,however,that the government is liable only under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.b emphasis added.thus,setting aside the army ability to control pernell that attached solely pursuant to his employment status as a soldier,the army must have had some other legal authority to control him.but durden can not demonstrate nor has she alleged that the army had the ability to control pernell pursuant to some legal authority independent of pernell employment status and,accordingly,the army can not be said to have a special relationship with him for purposes of an ftca claim.see stein,at.durden second theory of negligence therefore also fails.
u nder certain circumstances,one who undertakes to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of a third person,or his property,is subject to liability to the third person for injuries resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care in such undertaking.quail hollow condo.ass donald scholz.durden final theory of negligence,then,is that by undertaking the task of monitoring and controlling pernell following his release from civilian confinement,the army voluntarily assumed a duty to protect her from pernell and breached that duty when pernell raped her.however,this theory of a duty fails for two reasons.
first,durden can not demonstrate that the army should have recognized that enforcing the october,orders,as durden alleges,was necessary for the protection of others.on this issue,lumsden united states,d,is instructive.in lumsden,marine corpsmen returned to the tortfeasor also a corpsman his vehicle after the vehicle was impounded when it was discovered that he was inhaling ether.id.at.upon the return of his vehicle,the corpsman became intoxicated on ether that remained in his vehicle and,as a result,he injured the plaintiffs and killed one other person.id.the court denied the government motion to dismiss the plaintiffs ftca claim and allowed the lawsuit to proceed on a general negligence theory.see id.at.specifically,the court noted that,
if the plaintiffs can show that the government agents knew or had reason to know that upon being provided the keys to his car and a canister of ether,the corpsman would become intoxicated at his first opportunity and immediately would attempt to drive on a public street while so intoxicated,then the agents behavior thus triggers duty because the risk is both unreasonable and foreseeable.
id.at second alteration in original quoting mullis.monroe oil.
in contrast to the tortfeasor in lumsden,pernell had been released from civilian confinement for more than six weeks prior to raping durden,and there is nothing in the record to indicate that the army should have known that pernell was a threat to durden safety based solely on the september,incident or his prior expressed desires to kill himself and members of his unit.at the time that pernell raped durden,the army had no reason to suspect that pernell committed the burglaries and sexual assaults that occurred in and in fayetteville indeed,it was only after pernell raped durden and became a suspect in that rape that authorities also identified him as being involved in the prior incidents.it might be a different case if the army knew that it was one of its own soldiers,and pernell specifically,that committed the and sexual assaults in fayetteville.under those circumstances,the army may have had reason to know that pernell was a serial offender and thus owed to durden a duty to control pernell upon his release from civilian confinement.id.at t he marine corps,through its agents or officers,were aware that the tortfeasor had,on several occasions,acquired and inhaled the chemical compound,ether,belonging to the government.emphasis added.durden does not dispute,however,that the army did not become aware that pernell was involved with the and crimes until after pernell raped her.
second,durden has not presented any authority suggesting that,under similar circumstances,a private person in north carolina would be found to have owed a duty of ordinary care to persons in durden s position.id.at see b holding the government liable only under circumstances where the united states
