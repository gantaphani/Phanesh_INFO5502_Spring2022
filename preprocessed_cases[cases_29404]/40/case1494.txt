mozafar davani was employed by the virginia department of transportation department where he was supervised by steven welch and william johnson.over the course of several years,davani received three disciplinary warnings for failure to follow welch and johnson instructions.after receiving the third warning,davani was terminated.he grieved the third warning and his termination with the department,but a hearing officer upheld the termination.davani appealed to the virginia circuit court,which dismissed the appeal.
davani subsequently filed suit in federal district court alleging that the department,welch,and johnson collectively appellees discriminated against him on the basis of his race middle eastern,national origin iran,and religion muslim retaliated against him for filing prior equal employment opportunity eeo complaints and violated state law by conspiring to injure his reputation.appellees moved to dismiss,arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction over davani suit under the doctrine and,in the alternative,that the suit was precluded by res judicata and collateral estoppel.the district court granted the motion,concluding that it lacked jurisdiction under the doctrine.the district court therefore did not address appellees preclusion arguments.
before appellate briefing was due,the supreme court decided exxon mobile saudi basic indus,d,which significantly altered this circuit interpretation of the doctrine.under our prior cases,the doctrine had been interpreted broadly to provide that the loser in a adjudication was barred from bringing suit in federal court alleging the same claim or a claim that could have been brought in the state proceedings.exxon teaches,however,that the doctrine applies only when the loser in state court files suit in federal district court seeking redress for an injury allegedly caused by the state court decision itself.because davani suit does not challenge the state court decision,and it instead seeks redress for an injury allegedly caused by appellees,the doctrine does not apply,and the district court dismissal of davani complaint was in error 
for the reasons discussed herein,we reverse the district court dismissal under the doctrine and remand for the district court to allow the parties to supplement the record so that it may give full consideration to appellees preclusion arguments.
the department employed davani as a and utilities project administrator.he was directly supervised by johnson,and welch was in the line of supervision over davani.davani alleges that starting in the year,johnson began to treat him differently from other employees because of his race and national origin,culminating in johnson denying him a promotion.on december,davani filed an internal grievance with the department,and on march,he filed a formal eeo complaint with the virginia department of human resources management dhrm alleging that johnson failure to promote him was discriminatory.davani and the department,acting through welch,arrived at a settlement whereby davani received,inter alia,a promotion to the position of insurance and property management practitioner.
welch later claimed that davani discussed the settlement with department employees in violation of welch instructions,and on may,he gave davani a group ii written notice for discussing the terms of the settlement davani alleges that he did not impermissibly discuss the settlement,and that this written notice was discriminatory and given in retaliation for his success on his prior eeo complaint.davani grieved the written notice with the department,but for reasons that are unclear from davani complaint,the department took no action on the grievance.davani contends that after may,johnson continued to treat him differently from others based on his national origin and race,and that after september,johnson mistreatment escalated to the point of giving him bad work evaluations,making degrading comments to him,and even threatening violence against him.on november,and february,davani filed,respectively,a second and third eeo complaint with the dhrm,complaining of discrimination and retaliation.for reasons that are not clear from davani complaint,the dhrm did not take action on these eeo complaints.
on february,welch gave davani a second group ii written notice for failing to follow johnson instructions by,inter alia,failing to submit a required accident report.davani alleges that he followed the correct procedures and that the second written notice was also discriminatory and retaliatory.although the department could have terminated davani at that time based on the second group ii written notice,it only suspended him for thirty days.on april,after his suspension,davani filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,provid ing detailed allegations of the full range of unlawful discriminatory based on race and national origin and retaliation based on protected eeo activities.at.the eeoc subsequently made a no violation finding on davani charge and issued a letter to him.at.
on or about april,welch gave davani a third group ii written notice for failing to follow johnson instructions,this time for davani purported failure to investigate certain issues relevant to the utilities present at a project site.on april,the department terminated davani because of the three group ii written notices.
davani challenged his termination by filing a grievance with the department,arguing that the third group ii written notice was unjustified on the facts and that it was retaliatory.the department refused to reinstate him,and he requested a hearing before a hearing officer in the department of employment dispute resolution.on august,the hearing officer held an evidentiary hearing on the grievance.although the record is unclear on this point,it appears that davani attempted to challenge his first two written notices,but the hearing officer limited the issue before him to the propriety of the third written notice.on august,the hearing officer issued a written decision reducing davani third group ii written notice to a group i notice because davani did not fail to follow his supervisor instructions but simply did a poor job.despite this fact,the alj nevertheless rejected davani challenge to his termination because he still had two group ii notices,which were sufficient to sustain davani termination.the hearing officer also stated davani contends the department disciplinary action raises from sic improper retaliation against him.no credible evidence was presented suggesting the department disciplined him for any impermissible reason.at.
davani filed an appeal in the circuit court of fairfax county.on october,that court dismissed the appeal,holding that the hearing officer ruling was not contradictory to law pursuant to ann.bender.at.davani did not further appeal the circuit court decision.
on november,davani filed a civil action in the district court alleging six causes of action against the department for discrimination on the basis of race,national origin and religion in violation of federal law against the department for retaliation in violation of federal law against welch for retaliation in violation of federal law against johnson for retaliation in violation of federal law against appellees for conspiracy to retaliate in violation of federal law,and against welch and johnson for conspiracy to injure his reputation and professional standing in violation of virginia law.
on january,appellees filed a motion to dismiss under.b,arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction by virtue of the doctrine,and under.b,arguing that davani complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted by virtue of res judicata and collateral estoppel preclusion doctrines.the district court granted the rule b motion,concluding that it lacked jurisdiction under the doctrine,and it therefore did not address appellees rule b res judicata and collateral estoppel arguments.
davani appeals,arguing that the doctrine does not extend to his claims.we review de novo the district court grant of appellees motion to dismiss.see veney wyche,cir.
davani argues that exxon makes clear that the doctrine is inapplicable here because he does not challenge the state circuit court decision itself,but rather seeks redress for appellees alleged discrimination and retaliation.appellees argue that the district court correctly dismissed davani case under the doctrine because,even after exxon,davani federal claims are inextricably intertwined with the circuit court decision.
the doctrine is the namesake of rooker fidelity trust.and district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d.in rooker,the plaintiffs brought suit in federal district court seeking a declaration that a judgment against them was null and void because,they alleged,it was in violation of the constitution.id.at.the supreme court concluded that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the claim because u nder the legislation of congress,no court of the united states other than this court could entertain a proceeding to reverse or modify a judgment for errors of constitutional character.id.at.
in feldman,the plaintiffs brought suit in federal district court against the district of columbia court of appeals alleging the district of columbia court rule prohibiting those who had not graduated from law school from becoming members of the bar violated federal constitutional and statutory law and the district of columbia court denial of their petitions for a waiver from the rule also violated federal constitutional and statutory law.id.at.the supreme court held that the district court had jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs first claim because the facial challenge to the rule was like any other challenge of any legislative enactment.id.at.the second claim,however,was different.there,in ruling on the plaintiffs application for a waiver,the district of columbia court had acted in a judicial,rather than a legislative,capacity.id.at.the plaintiffs second claim challenged that judicial determination and therefore effectively sought appellate review of the district of columbia court ruling in the district court.id.because only the supreme court has appellate jurisdiction to review a state court order,see a west the supreme court held that the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs second claim.id.at.in a cryptic footnote,the supreme court rejected the argument that the district court would have had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs second claim if the plaintiffs had failed to make their arguments to the state court,instead holding that i f the constitutional claims presented to the district court are inextricably intertwined with the state court ruling in a judicial proceeding,then the district court is in essence being called upon to review the state court decision.id.at.emphasis added.
our cases have given the doctrine an expansive reading.in barefoot city of wilmington,cir,for example,the city enacted an ordinance that allowed it to annex the plaintiffs land.id.at.the plaintiffs opposed the annexation,and filed suit in state court alleging that the ordinance violated state law.id.at.the state court disagreed and upheld the ordinance.id.the plaintiffs then filed suit in the federal district court alleging that the ordinance violated several federal constitutional provisions.id.the district court denied the plaintiffs request for a temporary restraining order and an injunction,and the plaintiffs appealed.id.
on appeal,we held that the doctrine barred the suit,stating 
the doctrine generally bars district courts from sitting in direct review of state court decisions.the prohibition extends not only to issues actually decided by a state court but also to those that are inextricably intertwined with questions ruled upon by a state court.a federal claim is inextricably intertwined with a state court decision if success on the federal claim depends upon a determination that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.because the plaintiffs had the opportunity to raise their constitutional claims before the state courts,we held that their federal suit was inextricably intertwined with the state proceedings.id.at.
barefoot and numerous similar cases both from within and outside of our circuit represent a broad interpretation of the doctrine the plaintiffs in rooker and feldman sought redress for an injury allegedly caused by the decision rooker,the plaintiff sought to overturn a judgment in federal district court,and in feldman,the plaintiffs sought to overturn a judgment rendered by the district of columbia court in federal district court.in barefoot,by contrast,we extended the doctrine to apply in situations where the plaintiff,after losing in state court,seeks redress for an injury allegedly caused by the defendant actions.what is more,this expansive view of the doctrine carried with it implications for feldman inextricably intertwined language.to wit,by shifting the focus from an examination of whether the plaintiff challenges the decision itself to whether the plaintiff challenges the defendant actions,our interpretation of the doctrine became,in essence,a jurisdictional doctrine of res judicata losers became precluded from raising claims in federal district court that they had either already raised before the state court or that were so inextricably intertwined with the claims they presented to the state court that the federal claims could have been raised in the state proceedings.
last term,the supreme court reined in the expansive interpretation of the doctrine exemplified in cases such as barefoot.in exxon,exxon and saudi had formed a joint venture to produce polyethylene in saudi arabia.id.at.exxon contended that saudi had overcharged the venture for certain licenses.id.saudi sued exxon in state court,seeking a declaratory judgment that the charges were proper.id.exxon then sued in federal court for damages and asserted as counterclaims in the state action the same claims it had made in the federal action.id.saudi moved to dismiss the federal court action.id.the district court denied the motion and saudi took an interlocutory appeal.id.while the federal appeal was pending,the state case went to trial,and the jury awarded exxon significant damages.id.on appeal of the federal court denial of the motion to dismiss,the third circuit held that the state court entry of judgment divested the federal court of jurisdiction over the suit under the doctrine.id.at.
the supreme court reversed,holding that application of the doctrine was inappropriate because exxon had merely filed parallel litigation against saudi but did not seek redress from an injury that the order itself caused 
the doctrine is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name cases brought by state court losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments in cases of parallel litigation,d isposition of the federal action,once the adjudication is complete,would be governed by preclusion law 
moreover,the doctrine does not stop a district court from exercising jurisdiction simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.if a federal plaintiff presents some independent claim,albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party,then there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion.
id.at,internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added.
this language undercuts the broad interpretation of the doctrine we applied in cases like barefoot.whereas in barefoot we examined whether the loser who files suit in federal court is attempting to litigate claims he either litigated or could have litigated before the state court,exxon requires us to examine whether the loser who files suit in federal district court seeks redress for an injury caused by the decision itself if he is not challenging the decision,the doctrine does not apply.see,washington wilmore,cir holding,that the doctrine did not apply because the plaintiff claim of
