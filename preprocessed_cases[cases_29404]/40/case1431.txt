a state agency known as the virginia office for protection and advocacy,or vopa,brought this action in federal court against three virginia officials in their official capacities.vopa claims that the defendant state officials are violating federal law and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.we hold that sovereign immunity bars vopa suit.while congress could seek to provide a federal forum for this action through its abrogation power or by requiring a waiver of the states sovereign immunity in exchange for federal funds,congress has attempted neither of those options here.and we decline to expand the doctrine of ex parte young,to lift the bar of sovereign immunity in federal court when the plaintiff is a state agency.vopa may pursue its claims in state court,but it would be inconsistent with our system of dual sovereignty for a federal court to rely on ex parte young to adjudicate an intramural state dispute like this one.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand this case with directions to dismiss it.
vopa is an independent state agency in virginia that protects and advocates for the rights of persons with mental illnesses and developmental disabilities.see ann.a.office for prot.advocacy reinhard,cir.congress encourages the states to create entities like vopa by providing federal funding to protection and advocacy systems that meet the requirements of two federal statutes the developmental disabilities assistance and bill of rights act of,dd act,and the protection and advocacy for individuals with mental illness act,paimi act.under those acts,states may choose to make their protection and advocacy systems either public agencies or private,nonprofit entities.see a,c b.virginia chose the public option.
in accordance with the requirements for receiving federal funds,virginia law authorizes vopa to engage in various pursuits on behalf of the mentally ill and the disabled,such as investigating complaints of discrimination,abuse,and neglect.see ann.a.two features of vopa authority under virginia law are particularly relevant in this case.first,vopa operates independently of the office of the attorney general in virginia and employs its own legal counsel.ann,a.second,vopa has the authority,consistent with the requirements of the dd and paimi acts,to access the records of an individual with a disability in certain circumstances,including the situation in which vopa has probable cause to believe that a person has been abused or neglected.ann.see a i j,a.
vopa claims in this action that virginia is denying vopa access to certain records in violation of the dd and paimi acts.in particular,vopa seeks declaratory and injunctive relief providing it access to peer review records relating to three persons who died or were injured in facilities for the mentally ill.the facilities in question are operated by another state agency in virginia,the department of mental health,mental retardation and substance abuse services.the defendants are three officials in that department,named in their official capacities the state officials.
before the district court,the state officials moved to dismiss vopa complaint on two grounds.first,they argued that vopa had failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted because the state officials were not violating federal law.specifically,the state officials argued that peer review records were privileged under virginia law and that federal regulations under the dd act and the paimi act left that privilege intact.see c c.second,the state officials argued that virginia sovereign immunity barred vopa suit in any event.
the district court denied the state officials motion to dismiss on both grounds.first,the court held that vopa had stated a claim that the state officials were violating federal law and that the state officials argument based on the peer review privilege was inappropriate for resolution on a rule b motion because it was an affirmative defense to the merits.and second,the court held that sovereign immunity did not bar vopa suit.the district court agreed with the state officials that congress had not abrogated virginia sovereign immunity,nor had virginia waived its sovereign immunity against this action.however,the court agreed with vopa that this suit satisfied the sovereign immunity exception of ex parte young,because vopa had sued the state officials for prospective relief from an ongoing violation of federal law.in reaching that conclusion,the district court rejected the state officials argument that the doctrine of ex parte young did not permit a suit in federal court by one state agency against officials of another agency of the same state.
the state officials immediately appealed the district court sovereign immunity decision and only that decision under the collateral order doctrine our review is de novo.antrican odom,cir.
state sovereign immunity is a bedrock principle of our federalism.younger harris,d.indeed,the central purpose of the sovereign immunity doctrine is to accord the states the respect owed them as joint sovereigns.fed.comm state ports,d quoting aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d.when the constitution split the atom of sovereignty,term limits,thornton,d kennedy,concurring,the states did not consent to become mere appendages of the federal government,fed.comm n,at.rather,they consented to a system of dual sovereignty,and the states therefore entered the union with their sovereignty intact.id.quoting blatchford native vill.of noatak,d.
along with their status as sovereigns,the states retained the dignity and essential attributes inhering in that status.alden maine,d.and one of those essential attributes of sovereignty retained by the states is immunity from suit absent their consent.see fed.comm n,at.alden,at.seminole tribe of florida,d.while the eleventh amendment reflects this foundational principle of sovereign immunity,the amendment does not define the immunity scope.see,alden,at.
exceptions to the states sovereign immunity do exist,however.see,bragg.coal ass n,cir.three of those exceptions are pertinent here.first,congress may abrogate a state immunity pursuant to its enforcement power under of the fourteenth amendment.id.at citing seminole tribe,at.second,a state may waive its sovereign immunity if it consents to suit in federal court.id.at.third,the states sovereign immunity does not preclude private individuals from bringing suit against state officials for prospective injunctive or declaratory relief designed to remedy ongoing violations of federal law.id.citing ex parte young.
the parties correctly agree that virginia sovereign immunity bars vopa suit against the state officials in their official capacities unless one of these exceptions to sovereign immunity applies.see,edelman jordan,d bragg,at.we therefore examine each of the three relevant exceptions in turn.
we begin with abrogation.to abrogate the states sovereign immunity,congress must both unequivocally express its intent to abrogate and act pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.kimel.bd.of regents,d.we agree with the state officials and the district court that congress has not unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate virginia sovereign immunity in this case.indeed,vopa does not argue that congress has made any effort,much less a clear one,to abrogate the states immunity in the dd act or the paimi act.thus,the abrogation exception does not permit vopa suit against state officials.
we do not hold,however,that congress is powerless to abrogate in the circumstances presented by this case.indeed,the supreme court and this court have upheld congress authority to abrogate sovereign immunity under section of the fourteenth amendment in certain actions involving the rights of disabled persons under title ii of the americans with disabilities act.see united states georgia,d tennessee lane,d constantine rectors visitors of george mason,cir.moreover,the lane decision specifically referenced unconstitutional treatment of disabled persons by state agencies in a variety of settings,including the abuse and neglect of persons committed to state mental health hospitals.lane,at.citing youngberg romeo,d.that sort of unconstitutional treatment would be relevant to an effort by congress to abrogate the states immunity against a suit by an entity like vopa.
of course,congress power to abrogate sovereign immunity is not unlimited.see bd.of trs.of of garrett,d invalidating congress attempt to abrogate in actions under title i of the ada.but congress could at least attempt to exercise its abrogation authority under the dd act or the paimi act if it believed that suits like this one belong in federal court.as of now,however,congress has not even tried.
we turn next to the issue of waiver.vopa claims that virginia waived its sovereign immunity against this action by choosing to receive federal funding under the dd act and the paimi act because congress conditioned that funding on the commonwealth consent to be sued in federal court.in particular,vopa argues that the following provision of the dd act placed virginia on notice that it was waiving its sovereign immunity nothing in this subchapter shall preclude a system from bringing a suit on behalf of individuals with developmental disabilities against a state,or an agency or instrumentality of a state.b.
vopa waiver argument is not persuasive.the supreme court has held repeatedly that the waiver of a state sovereign immunity requires an explicit,emphatic statement.that is,a state waives its immunity from suit in federal court only where that waiver is stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as will leave no room for any other reasonable construction.edelman jordan,d internal quotations and alteration omitted.the purpose of this stringent test is to be certain that the state in fact consents to suit.coll.sav.bank.prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d.thus,we will not find consent by implication or by use of ambiguous language.library of cong.shaw,d quoting united states rayon importing.
a state does not waive its sovereign immunity through its mere receipt of federal funds or participation in a federal program.atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d.instead,congress must also express a clear intent to condition participation on a state consent to waive its constitutional immunity.id.at.litman george mason,cir recognizing that congress must codify a clear,unambiguous,and unequivocal condition of waiver.these strict requirements reflect both the importance of sovereign immunity in our federal system and the fact that a waiver of sovereign immunity is an exercise,rather than a limitation of,state sovereignty.madison virginia,cir litman,at.
applying these principles,we agree with the district court that the provision of the dd act cited by vopa is not sufficiently explicit to waive virginia sovereign immunity.indeed,the language in that provision is far from the emphatic,express,and unequivocal statement that is necessary to constitute a waiver.the district court correctly observed that section b simply indicates an intent not to abrogate any preexisting rights to sue.that section does not,however,provide states with the necessary notice that they are consenting to suits in federal court that their sovereign immunity would otherwise bar.
the insufficiency of section b as a waiver provision is particularly apparent in comparison to other provisions in which we have found a valid waiver of sovereign immunity.in constantine,for example,we held that a state had consented to suit under the rehabilitation act based on an unambiguous and unequivocal condition requiring waiver of eleventh amendment immunity.constantine rectors visitors of george mason,cir.the waiver section in that case provided 
a state shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment of the constitution of the united states from suit in federal court for a violation of section of the rehabilitation act of,title ix of the education amendments of,the age discrimination act of,title vi of the civil rights act of,or the provisions of any other federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of federal financial assistance.
citations omitted see also litman,at holding that section also constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity for suits under title ix.unlike section,the provision of the dd act cited by vopa does not refer to immunity,does not refer to the eleventh amendment,and does not even refer to suit in federal court.finding a waiver of sovereign immunity in these circumstances would only dilute the clear statement requirement for waiver and would do away with the established rule against consent through ambiguous language.
we note again,however,that we do not question congress in decisions like extract a waiver of the states sovereign immunity in a case like this one.we hold only that congress has not provided a sufficiently explicit statement to produce a waiver here.
we turn finally to the doctrine of ex parte young.vopa argues,and the district court held,that the ex parte young exception to sovereign immunity permits vopa suit against the state officials in federal court.to support that argument,vopa points to verizon maryland,public service commission of maryland,d.there,the supreme court held that i n determining whether the doctrine of ex parte young avoids an eleventh amendment bar to suit against state officials in their official capacities,a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into whether the complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.id.at.alteration in original quoting idaho coeur tribe of idaho,d,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.vopa argues that this action satisfies ex parte young under verizon maryland straightforward inquiry because vopa,in seeking access to peer review records to which it is allegedly entitled under the dd and paimi acts,is pursuing injunctive relief from an ongoing violation of federal law by state officials.and,vopa contends,that should be the end of the matter.
but it is hardly so simple.while vopa reliance on a straightforward application of ex parte young may have superficial appeal,this case differs from ex parte young in a critical respect the plaintiff there was not a state agency.instead,the plaintiffs in ex parte young were private parties.see at.and while no subsequent decision has expressly limited the application of ex parte young to suit by a private plaintiff,many decisions have recognized this basic element of the doctrine.see,seminole tribe of florida,d a n individual can bring suit against a state officer in order to ensure that the officer conduct is in compliance with federal law emphasis added citing ex parte young.bd.of trs.of of garrett,d referring to ex parte young suits by private individuals antrican odom,cir suits by private citizens.
moreover,vopa has cited no case,nor have we found any,holding even analyzing ex parte young doctrine applies equally when the plaintiff is a state agency.verizon,at.suit by a private corporation.this lack of historical support for vopa suit is important in light of the supreme court presumption that the states are immune from proceedings that were anomalous and unheard of when the constitution was adopted.alden maine,d quoting hans louisiana.
vopa argues,however,that its status as a state agency should not affect our ex parte young analysis.indeed,vopa claims that the identity of the plaintiff is wholly irrelevant to the doctrine of ex parte young.but vopa cites no authority for that proposition because vopa argument for an indiscriminate application of ex parte young can not be reconciled with the guidance of the supreme court in idaho coeur tribe of idaho,d.in that case,the court held that the ex parte young exception did not permit a suit that was equivalent to a quiet title action and thereby implicated special sovereignty interests even though the suit otherwise satisfied the requirements of ex parte young.at.the court warned against a reflexive reliance on ex parte young and the empty formalism of allowing any and all federal claims for injunctive relief against state officials to proceed in federal court.id.at.and the court held that a pplication of the young exception must reflect a proper understanding of its role in our federal system,as well as a recognition that sovereign immunity represents a real limitation on a federal court jurisdiction.id.
vopa is therefore incorrect to argue for what amounts to a reflexive reliance on ex parte young.instead,we confront a novel question whether to expand the ex parte young exception to allow a suit,in federal court,by a state agency against officials of the same state.see coeur tribe,at,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment i would not narrow our young doctrine,but i would not extend it to reach this case.the state officials concede that ex parte young would permit this action if the plaintiff were a private person,or even a private protection and advocacy system.the limited question we face,therefore,is whether the eleventh amendment bar should be lifted,as it was in ex parte young,when the plaintiff is a state agency.seminole tribe,at.
when we consider the sovereign interests and federalism concerns at stake,we are convinced that the ex parte young exception should not be expanded beyond its traditional scope to permit a suit by a state agency against state officials in federal court.the preeminent purpose of state sovereign immunity is to accord states the dignity that is consistent with their status as sovereign entities.fed.comm state ports,d.and federal court adjudication of an intramural contest between a state agency and state officials encroaches more severely on the dignity and sovereignty of the states than an ex parte young action brought by a private plaintiff.office for prot.advocacy reinhard,cir wilson,concurring 
the ex parte young doctrine rests on the fiction that a private party suit to enjoin state officials from violating federal law is not a suit against the state.see antrican,at.an action by a state agency against state officials in federal court,by contrast,has no similar historical pedigree,and it would be a more obvious affront to a state sovereign interests.indeed,the infringement on a state sovereign dignity would be substantial if a state agency,acting unilaterally,could force other state officials to appear before a federal tribunal.we therefore see no reason to extend the ex parte young doctrine to allow such a suit.splintering a state internal authority in this manner would be antithetical to our system of dual sovereignty.after all,t he framers split the atom of sovereignty they did not shatter it.term limits,thornton,d kennedy,concurring.
in contrast to the expansion of ex parte young proposed by vopa,the interest of the states in avoiding excessive federal meddling with their internal authority is well recognized in the supreme court sovereign immunity jurisprudence.in alden maine,for example,the supreme court held that congress did not have the power under article i to abrogate the states sovereign immunity in their own courts.at.the court recognized that if congress had such a power,the federal government would be able to turn the state against itself and ultimately to commandeer the entire political machinery of the state against its will.id.at.the court renounced s uch plenary federal control of state governmental processes because it would denigrate the separate sovereignty of the states.id.moreover,alden recognized that for the federal government to assert authority over a state most fundamental political processes would strike at the heart of the political accountability so essential to our liberty and republican form of government.id.at.
for similar reasons,the supreme court held in pennhurst state school hospital halderman,d,that ex parte young did not permit suits in federal court to enjoin state officials from violating state law.the supreme court in pennhurst sought to avoid the significant intrusion on state sovereignty that would result when a federal court instructs state officials on how to conform their conduct to state law.id.at.that is,the court recognized that federal court resolution of internal state disputes would conflict directly with the principles of federalism that underlie the eleventh amendment.id.
the reasoning of alden and pennhurst is persuasive here.vopa seeks to expand ex parte young to allow a federal court,without the imprimatur of congress or the consent of the state,to resolve a dispute between a state agency and state officials.recognizing an inherent power in the federal courts to settle this sort of internecine feud to turn the state against itself would disparage the status of the states as sovereigns.alden,at.moreover,just as pennhurst observed that states and their officials have an interest against appearing in federal court over issues of state law,states have a similar interest in not having a federal court referee contests between their agencies.further,allowing a state agency to decide on its own accord to sue officials of another state agency and to obtain relief from an article iii judge would create difficult questions of political accountability.alden,at.where exactly could citizens dissatisfied with the outcome of such a federal court case turn for political redress the answer is not obvious.for these reasons,granting a federal forum to a state warring factions based on alleged violations of federal law would be an unwarranted extension of ex parte young.vopa,at wilson,concurring.
the matter would be different,on the other hand,if congress sanctioned this sort of suit.if congress validly exercised its power under section of the fourteenth amendment to authorize an action like this one,the states would have no proper basis for complaint about the infringement on their sovereign dignity.nor would states have a rightful grievance if congress required the states informed consent to this type of action in exchange for federal funds.and in those cases,citizens could hold congress or the states politically accountable for the results.but based on the concerns expressed in the supreme court sovereign immunity well as the evident historical paucity of this sort of action and the supreme court presumption against permitting anomalous and proceedings against the states,alden,at.allow this suit to proceed under ex parte young would go too far.
vopa insists,however,that this action does not actually implicate any special sovereign interests on the part of virginia.instead,vopa argues that this suit,like all ex parte young actions,is primarily about enforcing federal law.vopa points out that virginia accepted federal funds under the dd act and the paimi act and created vopa to enforce the accompanying requirements of those statutes.and vopa argues that virginia and its officials therefore have no sovereign interest in avoiding vopa use of ex parte young.in other words this is not,as the state officials mischaracterize it,simply an intramural contest between state agencies t he question is whether the state officials are required to comply with federal law.brief for appellee at.
these arguments are unpersuasive as well.as an initial matter,vopa emphasis on the enforcement of federal law proves too much.the supreme court in alden specifically rejected the contention that substantive federal law by its own force necessarily overrides the sovereign immunity of the states.at.instead,the court held that even federal law must be applied in a manner consistent with the constitutional sovereignty of the states.id.indeed,if a federal claim alone were enough to invoke ex parte young,many of the supreme court cases,including coeur tribe,would have been wrongly decided.
moreover,the supreme court has recognized in cases related to the political subdivisions of the states that alleging a violation of federal law does not itself override the states interest in maintaining their sovereignty with respect to internal state conflicts.these cases demonstrate that the parties to a dispute matter in deciding whether a federal forum is available.
to be specific,the supreme court has held repeatedly that political subdivisions of states could not obtain relief under federal law against the application of state statutes,even where the political subdivisions claimed that the state laws in question violat
