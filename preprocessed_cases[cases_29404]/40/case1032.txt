opinion of the court 
plaintiffs are a class of former residents of third east hills park third east hills park or the property,an apartment development in pittsburgh,pennsylvania,who formed a known as third east hills park,the the entered into a section housing assistance payments hap contract with the united states department of housing and urban development hud pursuant to the hap contract,hud would pay a portion of the monthly rent on behalf of eligible tenants.plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit seeking to compel action that they claim was unlawfully withheld by hud.first,they seek an order compelling hud to maintain the hap contract at the property following foreclosure and purchase and rehabilitation by a new owner.they argue that this course of action is required by.no,stat.section second,plaintiffs seek an order compelling hud to provide class members with relocation assistance at uniform relocation act ura levels,pursuant to d,rather than the lesser amount that hud provided under c.
our analysis begins with a threshold issue of the scope of this appeal.we find that the appeal of all class members is properly before us.turning to the substantive issues,we hold that section did apply to hud management and disposition of the property at issue in this case.hud failed to make a determination that the property was not feasible for continued assistance and therefore failed to comply with the terms of section.accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and hold that hud must reinstate the hap contract at the property.we also conclude that the grant of summary judgment on the issue of relocation assistance was improper and remand for additional on the issues of whether the tenants were displaced due to a federally financed project and,if so,whether the tenants who were entitled to relocation assistance at ura levels received such assistance.
hud inspections and foreclosure recommendation 
each resident of third east hills park had an opportunity to become a shareholder in the by paying a membership fee.when the was established in,the fee was this amount has varied over the years.in,the entered into a section hap contract with hud.the contract was renewed in for a term.under the hap contract,hud pays a portion of each eligible tenant monthly rent,so long as the meets certain contractual obligations.among these,the hap contract requires the to lease units on the property to eligible families and to maintain and operate the housing units and related facilities to provide decent,safe,and sanitary housing.app.at.
the contract also provides that,if hud determines that the has failed to comply with the contract,
hud shall notify the of the nature of the,the actions required to be taken and the remedies to be applied on account of the including actions by the owner to cure the and,where appropriate,abatement of housing assistance payments in whole or in part and recovery of overpayments,and the time within which the shall respond with a showing that it has taken all the actions required of it.if the fails to respond or take action to the satisfaction of hud,hud shall have the right to terminate the contract in whole or in part or take other corrective action to achieve compliance.
hud inspected the property,to ensure compliance,through its real estate assessment center reac.annual inspections,with the purpose of ensuring that units were in a decent,safe,and sanitary condition,were performed in accordance with hud regulations.the regulations provide for use of a scale.they also allow for inspection of a statistically valid sample of the units in a public housing authority public housing portfolio.b.although the property at issue here was not owned by a public housing authority,this same sampling process was applied.
reac inspected third east hills park on october,december,and september.the october inspection resulted in a score of.a may letter identified the deficiencies and gave the sixty days to correct them.the december inspection resulted in a score of.a june by hud departmental enforcement center noted numerous deficiencies,many of which had been found in prior inspections.hud issued a written notice on july,giving the thirty days to correct deficiencies and certify compliance and stating that failure to do so would cause hud to pursue any and all remedies,including abatement or suspension of the hap contract and possibly foreclosure.the september reinspection resulted in a score of points.plaintiffs contended before the district court that all exigent deficiencies were corrected within three business days of the inspection and that they disputed many of the deficiencies.
hud sent a notice of abatement to the president on november,explaining that the had failed to address the deficiencies outlined in prior letters and was therefore in default on the hap contract.app.at.the notice stated that hud would abate payments on all of the units in the property and forbid the from accepting new section tenants.on the same day,hud sent a separate letter to the president.it stated that hud would initiate foreclosure proceedings on the property mortgage,which was in technical default due to the failure to correct the physical deficiencies.hud would provide an opportunity to show legal reasons why a foreclosure should not occur and allow twenty days for the to submit its position in writing.the letter also stated that,at the request within seven days,a meeting would be the atlanta,georgia office of hear any legal reasons why hud should not foreclose upon the property.id.at.
the local hud office sent a memorandum,also on november,to hud atlanta multifamily property distribution center,recommending foreclosure on the property.the memo included the prior inspection reports and other documentation.it also included a document entitled field office foreclosure recommendation,which described the property.the recommendation noted that the property adjoined two other affordable housing developments,which had both been sold to developers,who were awarded tax credits and would be improving those properties.according to the recommendation,third east hills park,in its current condition,would negatively affect the success of the other properties.the area was described in the recommendation as heavily impacted with subsidized housing.id.at.the recommendation also noted many units at the property,meaning that the occupants were living in larger units than necessary for their household size.it concluded that the property should be sold to the city of pittsburgh and the number of units reduced.
in response,the atlanta office requested additional information regarding the property fiscal condition.on february,an architecture firm retained by hud issued a comprehensive repair survey and estimated the total cost of repairs at the property to be.id.at.hud determined that the repair costs and operating expenses at the property exceeded the potential property income and value.plaintiffs dispute this analysis.as they note,a question at the bottom of hud sales analysis analyzed repair costs,operating expenses,and potential asks whether the project is financially viable after repairs,and the answer given is yes.id.at.the form also states that the project would produce an annual net operating income of.id.
displacement of residents 
in november,during the same period that it sent the a notice of abatement and recommended foreclosure on the property,hud also sent a notice of displacement to residents informing them of its intent to relocate them for health,safety,and security reasons.id.at.residents with executed leases would receive moving expenses,and tenants would receive a voucher for section rental assistance.the letter also announced a december,meeting to discuss relocation benefits hud sent another letter on february,to all residents,advising them of hud intent to foreclose on the property within the next few months.id.at.it stated that tenants receiving rental assistance would receive section voucher assistance if such assistance was available and the tenant was eligible.it also provided some of the tentative terms and conditions of the foreclosure sale and gave residents a number to call with questions or to offer input regarding the process.
on june,hud issued a notice to residents,informing them that relocation assistance would end at the close of business on july.residents were required to have moved out by that date in order to receive assistance.those who moved out after that date and were certified as eligible for a section voucher could still receive one,but would not obtain relocation assistance.hud terminated the hap contract on march.the majority of residents moved out with relocation assistance,but the parties agree that as of at least october,fourteen residents remained.
sale and purchase of the property 
in march,shortly after hud had informed residents of its intent to foreclose,the urban redevelopment authority of pittsburgh urap informed hud that it might be interested in purchasing the property.at.it requested that hud consider maintaining section assistance for residents who had not moved at the time of foreclosure.in an april response,hud said it would consider selling the property to urap,but that the hap contract would not be renewed,as such continuation is contrary to current hud policy.id.at.
on june,hud authorized payment to urap of a grant contingent on hud acquiring the property through the foreclosure sale.hud notified remaining residents on june,that it intended to sell the property to urap immediately if it acquired it at auction.app.at.this june notice included a copy of hud disposition plan,with details regarding the transfer of title.id.at.it asked for written comments within thirty days.the disposition plan provided that urap would,within twelve months of taking title,relocate any remaining residents,either on or off site,in order to facilitate redevelopment.urap would also reimburse residents for moving expenses and endeavor to provide an opportunity to apply for readmission to the redeveloped property to all current and relocated residents who desire to return.id.at.hud received no comments on this initial disposition plan within the period.it finalized and approved the plan on july.at.
hud and urap entered into a contract for sale of the property,conditioned on hud obtaining title at the foreclosure sale.app.at.the contract included a rider requiring urap to relocate remaining residents within twelve months,comply with relevant statutes and regulations,reimburse residents for moving expenses,and provide notice of any expected displacement.id.at.hud purchased the property at foreclosure on october,and immediately transferred it to urap through a deed that included this rider.
urap subsequently entered into a memorandum of understanding with third east hills limited partnership tehlp and sold the property to tehlp,which was to demolish existing units and renovate the property.approximately thirty units were to be created,with special mortgages and subsidies to make them affordable to most former residents of the property.first priority was to be given to those residing on the property on or after october.second priority would be given to members living at the property on or after november.anyone else living at the property on or after november,would receive third priority.
procedural history 
plaintiffs filed an emergency complaint in this matter and sought a temporary restraining order tro on july.the district court granted the tro on july.after receiving written submissions and holding a hearing on the matter,the court denied a preliminary injunction request on august.on january,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss,dismissing all but one claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the remaining the violation of section failing to state a claim.the case was closed.
plaintiffs promptly filed a motion for reconsideration,which the court granted,reopening the case.the district court found that its prior opinion was based in part on the defendants misstatement of hud position regarding the applicability of to the disposition of hud held mortgages.massie dep t of hous.and urban,wl,at.hud counsel acknowledged that,at the time its prior brief was drafted,counsel did not know that hud office of multifamily housing programs had determined that it would comply with in its disposition of both multifamily properties that the secretary owns and multifamily mortgages that the secretary holds.id.the district court also found,contrary to its prior ruling,that it did have jurisdiction to review a claim that hud failed to comply with its own regulations as well as the plaintiffs due process claims.the court issued an order clarifying that three claims remained the alleged violation of section hud alleged violation of plaintiffs procedural due process rights,for failing to provide plaintiffs with an opportunity at the foreclosure hearing to present factual and not just legal objections to the foreclosure and hud failure to comply with its own regulations for management and disposition of the mortgage at third east hill park.
thereafter,the court denied plaintiffs request for merits discovery under the administrative procedures act apa.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court granted defendants summary judgment motion on all claims.we discuss the district court reasoning in detail infra.the court then denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration,which it found merely rehashed prior arguments.this appeal,from the denial of reconsideration,followed 
plaintiffs raise three issues in their brief on appeal.first,they contend that hud violated section and accordingly they seek an order compelling hud to maintain the section rental assistance at the property.second,they claim that the district court erred in finding that hud was not required to provide a higher level of relocation assistance,in accordance with d.third,in response to our request for supplemental briefing,they argue that the entire plaintiff class,and not jean massie alone,filed a proper notice of appeal from the district court decision.because this final issue shapes the scope of our review,we will address it first.

plaintiffs bring claims pursuant to the administrative procedure act apa,seeking to compel agency action unlawfully withheld.as one of our sister circuits has held,this provision does not give us license to compel agency action whenever the agency is withholding or delaying an action we think it should take.instead,our ability to compel agency action is carefully circumscribed to situations where an agency has ignored a specific legislative command.hells canyon council forest,cir.
in norton southern utah wilderness alliance,the supreme court reviewed the scope of judicial review of agency inaction.it held that review of an agency failure to act is limited to a discrete action.id.at.the court reviewed five categories of agency actions,with the category of relief including,inter alia,a grant of money or assistance,which would encompass the hap contract at issue in this case.id.at.t he only agency action that can be compelled under the apa is action legally required,as authorizes courts to compel agency action that is unlawfully withheld.id.at.the supreme court concluded in norton that a claim under can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.id.at see also oil,chem.atomic workers union occupational safety health,cir describing our review under to include inaction that is contrary to a specific congressional mandate.hence,we review hud actions in this case to determine if it failed to take a discrete action that it is required to take.norton,at.
we directed the parties to brief the issue of who is,or are,the proper appellant or appellants in this case.the initial notice of appeal filed in the case listed jean massie as the named party appealing the district court order.the notice also included a caption of jean massie,et.department of housing and urban development,et.app.at.an amended notice of appeal was subsequently filed and separately docketed under a distinct case number it included as the named parties five plaintiffs,followed by the phrase on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated certified class.id.at.since this second appeal was untimely,the parties were directed by the clerk to address the attempt to add additional appellants to this case.plaintiffs stated in response that,because the only claims were those asserted by the class as a whole and the class had been certified under rule b,they did not realize that each nominal plaintiff needed to be listed on the notice.hud argued that we are without jurisdiction to add parties to the notice of appeal because federal rule of appellate procedure,which outlines the requirements for a notice of appeal,is jurisdictional and,according to hud,the original notice failed to satisfy rule c 
the supreme court has held that rule c is jurisdictional in nature and that a court may not waive its jurisdictional requirements,even for good cause,if it finds that they have not been satisfied.torres oakland scavenger.we conclude that massie complied with rule c by using the district court caption which included et.and naming the lead plaintiff in the blank on the notice of appeal form.rule c a permits specifying the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice.the caption on the notice of appeal included jean massie et.
we also find that the notice of appeal satisfied rule c,which states that the notice of appeal in a class action is sufficient if it names one person qualified to bring the appeal as representative of the class.hud relies on the seventh circuit decision in marrs motorola,cir per curiam,which held that rule c requires the notice of appeal to specify that the class representative is appealing in a representative capacity.the marrs opinion does not provide detail regarding the nature of the notice filed in the case,but states that the notice contained no indication that the appeal was intended to be in a representative capacity and does not mention other claimants or a class.id.although the notice specified the judgment being appealed,there is no discussion in marrs of the application of rule c and whether a caption with et.was included in the notice,as is the case here.regardless of these potential factual distinctions,we disagree with the seventh circuit interpretation of rule c and find that it merely requires that a person who is qualified to bring the appeal as representative of the class be named in the notice of appeal and not that the notice expressly state that the individual is in fact appealing in a representative capacity.as noted,we also find that the class was named in the caption of the notice of appeal,satisfying rule c a.
our decision accords with those of circuit courts that have faced similar situations.in olenhouse commodity credit,the tenth circuit stated that w hile we discourage use of the phrase et to identify any group of appellants,we agree where a class has been certified,the phrase provides sufficient notice of who is taking the appeal to satisfy the requirements of fed.c,cir.here,the phrase et had been used in the caption of the notice of appeal,and the singular plaintiff appeared in the body.in ford elsbury,cir,the fifth circuit found that rule c,which had just been amended in with the intent of liberaliz ing the pleading requirements for a notice of appeal,was satisfied.the style of the notice identified the plaintiffs as undray ford,et,and the body of the notice identified the appealing parties as the ford plaintiffs.id.at.the court deemed this sufficient as to all the plaintiffs in the uncertified class action on appeal.
accordingly,we find that an appeal on behalf of all class members is properly before us.
plaintiffs argue that hud failed to comply with section when it terminated the hap contract at third east hills park.they contend that the district court erred when it deferred to hud interpretation of the applicability of section.
section provides 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,in fiscal year in managing and disposing of any multifamily property that is owned or held by the secretary of housing and urban development,the secretary shall maintain any rental assistance payments under section of the united states housing act of that are attached to any dwelling units in the property.to the extent the secretary determines that such a multifamily property owned or held by the secretary is not feasible for continued rental assistance payments under such section,based on consideration of the costs of maintaining such payments for that property or other factors,the secretary may,in consultation with the tenants of that property,contract for rental assistance payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing properties,or provide other rental assistance.
the text of this provision presents three questions that will structure our analysis what does it mean for a rental assistance payment to be attached to any dwelling units in the property what is the test for whether continued rental assistance is feasible and what is the nature of the consultation required between hud and the tenants this property clearly satisfied the owned or held element of section,as hud held the mortgage,a point that the parties do not dispute.
in order for section to apply to hud disposition of the property,the rental assistance payments must have been attached to dwelling units in the property during fiscal year.noting that the statute does not define the term attached,nor did the parties provide any case law interpreting the term,the district court drew on a dictionary definition,to fast or affix join connect.app.at.the court concluded that,since all rental assistance payments on the units were abated as of november,rental assistance payments were attached to any of the units in fiscal year and hence section did not apply.plaintiffs and their amicus argue that instead the crucial date is march,when the hap contract was terminated.on this argument,the housing assistance payments,which were only suspended during the abatement period,remained attached to the property,for the purposes of section,so long as the hap contract had not been terminated.
hud contends that the crucial date is the date of foreclosure,october,which came after the end of fiscal year,rendering section inapplicable.hud claims this date is important as the statute refers to managing and disposing of property.the foreclosure,according to hud,is the act of disposing.plaintiffs reject this and contend that managing and disposing must be read to include activities in furtherance of disposing of the property that began long before the foreclosure sale itself.the act of terminating the hap contract,they contend,is part of this process of managing and disposing of the property.we agree with plaintiffs and find the natural reading of managing and disposing is that this phrase refers to a process,which would include,among other steps,the termination of the hap contract.managing and disposing does not,as hud argues,refer solely to the precise moment of foreclosure.see outlining manner in which hud is to manage and dispose of a multifamily housing project.moreover,hud adopted this same interpretation in its own memorandum entitled fiscal year property disposition program hud memorandum,which was issued by the deputy assistant secretary for multifamily housing programs to provide instructions regarding property disposition requirements for the fiscal year.app.at.the memorandum expressly states that section applies to properties for which the secretary holds the mortgage and is in the process of disposing of the property at foreclosure.id.at emphasis added 
having rejected hud contention that it did not manage or dispose of the property during the relevant period,we return to the issue of whether housing assistance payments were attached to any dwelling units in the property during fiscal year.the district court concluded that due to the abatement of housing assistance payments,according to which hud suspended making payments,the payments were no longer attached to any dwelling units.plaintiffs emphasize that the hap contract remained in place at the property until it was terminated in march,within fiscal year.this distinction has practical importance,because so long as the hap contract was not terminated,payments that had been abated or suspended could be restored if the deficient conditions were remedied,nullifying the reason or reasons for the abatement.according to plaintiffs,so long as the hap contract was not terminated,payments remained attached to dwelling units in the property for the purposes of section.
on this reading,the phrase attached to any dwelling units serves primarily to indicate that section applies to section rental assistance,like that at issue in this case,rather than assistance.hence the issue is not whether units were still receiving payments at the time in question,which the district court focused on,but whether a valid hap contract existed at,or was attached to,the property.this interpretation accords with the use of the term attached in related portions of section of the housing act.specifically,the act provides that the term assistance means rental assistance under subsection b of this section that is attached to the structure pursuant to subsection d or o of this section.f emphasis added see also truesdell,at assistance differs from assistance in that the former is tied to a particular unit,whereas the latter entails a voucher entitling the participant to select a unit anywhere in the relevant jurisdiction.section o a states that a public housing agency may use amounts provided under an annual contributions contract under this subsection to enter into a housing assistance payment contract with respect to an existing,newly constructed,or rehabilitated structure,that is attached to the structure,subject to the limitations and requirements of this paragraph.emphasis added.
although the text of section uses the phrase rental assistance payments and does not include the word contract,we find,in light of the nature of section housing,that the statute should be read to refer to any dwelling units for which a hap contract remains in effect.therefore,the important issue is whether there was an existing hap contract at the property,not whether payments were actually being made on individual units.in addition,we note that hud endorsed this interpretation in its memorandum regarding the fiscal year property disposition program,which interprets section.the hud memorandum states that i n accordance with section the secretary is required to maintain the section hap contract in any multifamily property that the secretary owns or for which the secretary holds the mortgage and is in the process of disposing of the property at foreclosure.app.at.the hud memorandum expressly references the hap contract and not individual payments.it is perhaps for this reason that hud,in its brief on appeal,focuses on the foreclosure date and not the district court analysis of the phrase attached to any dwelling units.
we find the district court interpretation problematic for another reason.if section only requires hud to maintain the rental assistance payment amounts that are actively being made at the time in question,rather than the payments attached to the property through the hap contract,then much would depend on the determination of a precise moment of managing and disposing.the hap contract provides for fluctuations in the payments being made based on vacant units,changes in family income or composition,and other factors.app.at.it can not be that congress intended for hud to maintain only the precise payments being made at a moment in time,without regard for the contract terms that determine and adjust the amount of housing assistance payments to be made to an owner.nor do we find it reasonable to conclude that congress would want the determination of whether an entire hap contract should be maintained at a property to potentially hinge on whether,at a moment in time or even during a period of managing and disposing of the property,a single unit is or is not actively receiving payments.although such a situation may seem,it gives us further reason to reject this reading of the statute,particularly when another interpretation is reasonable,is clearly supported by the use of similar statutory language in related provisions,and,as discussed below,accords with the legislative intent.see united states turkette,a bsurd results are to be avoided.
the conclusion that section does not apply to a property when rental assistance payments have been abated would also effectively render section inoperative in certain cases in which,by its terms,it is clearly intended to apply.this would violate a core tenet of statutory interpretation,that no provision shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.in re phila.newspapers,llc,cir citation omitted see also mountain states.pueblo of santa ana,u,discussing elementary canon of construction that a statute should be interpreted so as not to render one part inoperative citation omitted.whenever hud is in the process of managing and disposing of a multifamily property it abates housing assistance payments.this process is outlined in hud agency handbook entitled multifamily property.hud handbook.the handbook expressly provides that when hud takes ownership of a multifamily project with a hap contract,the hap contract must not be canceled.id.at the same time,the handbook appendix includes a form for notifying hud regional accounting division of hud acquisition of a property.id.at appendix.this form notifies the regional accounting division that,since hud has assumed ownership of the subject project,section payments to the former owner should be abated,but the section contract and budget authority remaining on this project must not be recaptured.id.hence,abatement always occurs when hud assumes ownership during the process of managing and disposing of a multifamily property.to find that this abatement process renders section inapplicable would cause section to not apply in situations when the statute text specifically states that it does apply,when the property is owned or held by hud and hud is in the process of managing and disposing of the property 
the legislative history of section also supports our reading of the statute.it reveals strong support for section housing and statements of concern regarding hud commitment to maintaining assistance.in the senate report,the senate appropriations committee expressed concern 
that hud is not committed to maintaining section housing and may be encouraging owners to opt out of the program.this would be a tremendous mistake since affordable housing needs are growing while the stock of affordable housing is shrinking.hud is directed to report no later than june,on the status of hud efforts to retain section housing,including a analysis of units lost and retained,by year,state,and locality.hud is also directed to provide an analysis of all efforts made by hud to preserve section units.the committee also directs gao to assess hud efforts and success in preserving housing,especially section housing,including recommendations on how better to preserve this housing.
at,reprinted in emphasis added.the district court,in its own analysis,relied substantially upon a misreading of the legislative history.the court analyzed the relevant legislative history and concluded that both houses of congress intended for hud to shift from a to a program.the court interpreted as a reference to project based section assistance and as a reference to tenant based section assistance.
these terms appear in sections of the congressional report entitled tenant based rental assistance,at,at,wl.in this context,the phrases refer to two different ways of funding the,or voucher,section program,either a method funding a certain number of vouchers,equivalent to a certain number of units,and adjusting accordingly each year for changes in rent and other variables,or a method which would focus on the total budget.the house report makes this clear,as it notes that in the prior year congress estimated the costs of the program based on units under lease during the period that immediately preceded passage of the act,at.similarly,in the senate report the committee directs hud to report no later than june,on the effectiveness of this approach to vouchers,at emphasis added.accordingly,we believe that the district court erred when it interpreted section as an attempt to complete the of a program,which it deemed the overall point behind.massie,wl,at.instead,the legislative history reveals congress concern with maintaining section housing,at.clear statements of the intent behind section reinforce our interpretation of the statutory language and our conclusion that section applied to hud management and disposition of third east hills park.
having concluded that section did apply to hud disposition of the property,we must determine whether hud complied with the requirements outlined in the second sentence of section this provision permits hud to contract for rental assistance payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing properties,or provide other rental assistance,provided that it has determined that the property is not feasible for continued rental assistance payments.hence,hud must first make this infeasibility determination before deciding to provide either rental assistance at another location or some other form of rental assistance section further requires that hud consult with the tenants before providing another form of rental assistance.plaintiffs argue that hud neither determined that the property was not feasible for continued assistance nor did it properly consult with tenants before deciding to provide voucher assistance for use at other properties.we address each of these contentions in turn.
in support of their contention that hud did not determine that the property at issue was not feasible for continued rental assistance payments,plaintiffs cite hud own economic feasibility analysis,including a survey of needed repairs and a sales analysis,which assessed whether the project would be financially viable after the repairs were made.the sales analysis,which considered repair costs,annual expenses,and rental income,among other factors,concluded that the property would produce an annual net operating income of.app.at.at the bottom of the analysis,a section entitled project viability after repairs asked whether the project was financially viable and the answer given was yes.id.at.
hud failed in its briefing and at oral argument to address the import of the determination,in its own sales analysis,that the project was financially viable.this determination would appear to foreclose a conclusion that continued rental assistance is not feasible.hud contends,however,that the repair survey it commissioned demonstrated that needed repairs would cost almost twice the amount of the current mortgage on the property.appellee br.at.it also notes that the sales analysis,which it also refers to as a peer analysis,demonstrated that repair costs and operating expenses for the project far exceeded potential property income and value.id.absent,however,from both hud analyses during the period in which it managed and disposed of the property and its briefs on appeal is any explanation of why these assertions indicate that the property is not feasible for continued rental assistance payments.repairs may well have cost more than the current mortgage,but this does not indicate that once repairs are made that it is not feasible to continue to provide rental assistance payments.this is particularly true where,as here,the analysis expressly concludes that the property will produce a net operating income.
hud further contends that section does not specify the standards for a feasibility determination.section allows hud to make a feasibility determination based on consideration of maintaining such payments for that property or other factors,stat.at.hud claims,relying on chevron,at,that it possesses discretion regarding the form of the feasibility determination.accordingly,it argues that it conformed with the standards outlined in its memorandum on the fiscal year property disposition program,which includes a section entitled feasibility analysis.app.at.the memorandum states that hud property disposition center must make a recommendation regarding the feasibility of continuing with the section contract and must conduct a peer analysis and comprehensive repair survey as part of this process.
the hud memorandum also provides a list of criteria,one of which must be satisfied to warrant a determination of.the economic criteria requires a showing that t he costs to rehabilitate the property make it economically infeasible to pay the monthly debt service needed to amortize the cost of rehabilitation and pay the expenses of operating the property on a monthly basis at current section hap contract rents.id.at.the rehabilitation costs are to be determined by the comprehensive repair survey,and the operating costs are drawn from the peer analysis.as noted,the peer analysis,which considered both the rehabilitation and the operating costs,concluded that an annual net operating income of would be produced and expressly stated that the project was financially viable after repairs.id.at.as previously noted,hud memorandum is not entitled to chevron deference.however,even if we accept and apply the standard espoused by hud for making the feasibility determination,we find no basis to accept hud position that the property was not feasible for continued rental assistance.in fact,hud own analysis clearly indicates the contrary.having found that hud did not make a proper determination that the property was not feasible for continued assistance,we necessarily conclude that hud failed to comply with the terms of section and therefore must reinstate the hap contract at the property.
even if hud had properly made a determination that the property was not feasible for continued rental assistance,the record indicates that hud failed to consult with tenants in the course of providing other rental assistance.according to section,if a determination is made that a property is not feasible for continued rental assistance,the secretary may,in consultation with the tenants of that property,contract for rental assistance payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing properties,or provide other rental assistance,stat.at.this provision requires hud to consult with tenants regarding what form of rental assistance it will provide following termination of a hap contract.hud argues that it satisfied this consultation requirement through the notice it provided to tenants of the foreclosure.the notice included a copy of the initial disposition plan for the property and gave tenants thirty days to offer written comments regarding the plan.app.at.hud emphasizes that it even waited until after this comment period,during which no comments were received,before finalizing the disposition plan.appellee br.at.
according to hud,its consultation process conformed with the procedure outlined in the hud memorandum.specifically,the memorandum provides i f a determination is made to offer the property for sale without the current section hap contract,the property disposition center will request through the appropriate program center director,section tenant protection vouchers to assist all eligible current residents of the property.app.at.hence,according to the process outlined in the memorandum,hud makes a determination of what form of future assistance to provide prior to any actual consultation with the tenants.
section does not outline the form this consultation must take nor does it define the term.we therefore turn to a dictionary,the proper starting place for ascertaining the plain meaning of words.the term consultation is defined as a council or conference as between two or more persons usually to consider a special matter or deliberation of two or more persons on some matter.webster third new international dictionary.in light of this definition,we find that mere notice of a foreclosure,accompanied by a copy of the initial disposition plan and a request for comments,does not constitute consultation.moreover,the letter providing notice did not make any reference to the possibility of contracting for continued assistance.hud process of developing an initial disposition plan,without any input from the tenants,and then providing that plan to the tenants with a request for written comments simply fails to satisfy the plain meaning of the term consultation.accordingly,we conclude that hud also failed to comply with section by not consulting with the tenants at the property when deciding what form of assistance to offer.this failure to consult constitutes a separate basis for our conclusion that hud violated section and therefore must reinstate the hap contract at the property.
plaintiffs raise a second issue on appeal,contending that the district court erred when it concluded that c governs the provision of relocation assistance in this case,rather than d.section provides for relocation assistance when tenants are displaced from either multifamily properties or such properties that are subject to mortgages.the district court rejected plaintiffs argument that hud was required,pursuant to d,to provide relocation assistance at uniform relocation act ura levels the court found that the case clearly fell within subsection c,and not d,and therefore plaintiffs were only entitled to relocation assistance at the lower levels provided for in subsection c.specifically,the court held that plaintiffs did not satisfy the definition of displaced person in subsection d,that is,any person family,individual,business,or nonprofit organization that moves from the real property,or moves personal property from the real property,permanently,as a direct result of acquisition,rehabilitation or demolition for a federally assisted project.the court found that hud november and,notices to plaintiffs were issued because of indecent conditions at the property,and not to further a federally assisted project the court also emphasized that hud abated rental payments and terminated the contract before hud published its disposition plan and entered into any contract with urap.plaintiffs,in their reply brief,identify record evidence indicating that hud had developed its redevelopment plan before it declared the conditions default or began relocating residents.reply br.at.
plaintiffs argue that,because hud conveyed the property at foreclosure to the urap and provided a grant of for demolition and development,this case falls within the parameters of d,since federal financial assistance was provided we agree that the rehabilitation of the property was a federally assisted project.the question that remains,however,is whether the tenants were displaced due to this project or instead,as the district court found,due to conditions at the property.we understand plaintiffs argument,at its core,to be that hud was driven by its intent to redevelop the property and only used deficient conditions,which it could feasibly have repaired,as an excuse to foreclose on the property.without foreclosing,it would have been unable to transfer ownership.hud does concede that it has additional regulatory obligations under d with regard to those residents that declined to exercise their right to relocate as a result of hud abatement of the hap contract.appellee br.at.hence,hud appears to acknowledge that the project was federally financed and that these final fourteen residents were displaced due to the project rather than the conditions that hud claims precipitated abatement and notice to tenants in november 
we find that there is evidence that supports plaintiffs position that all of the displacements were due to a program involving federal financial assistance.this evidence includes the east hills visioning plan of june,which recommended a reconfiguring and rebuilding of third east hills park.app.at.the plan was commissioned by urap,but the task force included members of the local hud office.a sworn affidavit from an architect who participated in the task force stated that the group,which included a hud representative,was working on creating the visioning plan from august through july.id.at.according to the affidavit,the task force reached a consensus decision that foreclosure was necessary in order to redevelop the property.id.given the contract in place at the building,foreclosure was necessary to eliminate restrictions on the property,which allowed it to be used only as affordable rental housing for twenty years and did not permit a reduction in the number of units during that period.
in addition,the field office foreclosure recommendation sent by the local hud office on november,to the atlanta multifamily property disposition center stated that the property current physical condition will negatively impact the success of the redevelopment of adjoining properties if ownership is not changed to an entity that will work positively with management.id.at.the foreclosure recommendation also stated that most residents were and recommended sale of the property with the intent of downsizing units.this recommendation preceded the repair survey and the termination of the hud contract based on a technical default.
we agree with plaintiffs that this and other evidence in the record demonstrate a disputed issue of material fact as to the cause of the displacement of tenants at third east hills park.the record contains evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that hud sought to foreclose upon the property and refused to make feasible repairs in order to facilitate a redevelopment project that it financed.
hud has contended that,to the extent that the ura does apply,plaintiffs claims still must fail as they have not exhausted their administrative remedies to challenge hud determination of their eligibility for relocation assistance.the relevant regulation related to the relocation act merely allows for an administrative appeal,which a party may file,but does not require this.c.f.in darby cisneros,the supreme court held that where the apa applies,an appeal to superior agency authority is a prerequisite to judicial review only when expressly required by statute or when an agency rule requires appeal before review and the administrative action is made inoperative pending that review.here such review is not expressly required,but merely permitted,and hence exhaustion of the administrative appeal process was not necessary.
accordingly,we find the grant of summary judgment on this issue improper and remand for additional on the issues of whether the tenants were displaced due to a federally financed project and,if so,whether the tenants who were entitled to relocation assistance at ura levels received such assistance.
for the foregoing reasons,we will reverse the district court decision granting summary judgment in favor of defendants,direct hud to reinstate the hap contract at third east hills park,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
