opinion of the court 
the county of lebanon county and the greater lebanon refuse authority glra appeal the district court july,decision granting plaintiff lebanon farms disposal,lebanon farms motion for partial summary judgment.applying a strict scrutiny standard,the district court held that the county municipal waste management ordinance and sections v and x of the glra july,regulations collectively,flow control ordinances that benefitted the glra public waste disposal site violated the dormant commerce clause of the united states constitution.the district court therefore permanently enjoined the county and the glra from enforcing the flow control ordinances.while the county and the glra appeal of that decision was pending,the supreme court decided united haulers ass solid waste management authority,d.in part of united haulers,a majority of the court held that the virtually per se rule of invalidity that applies to flow control ordinances that benefit private entities and that can only be overcome by a showing that the state has no other means to advance a legitimate local purpose does not apply to challenges of nondiscriminatory flow control ordinances that benefit public waste disposal facilities.id.at.in part,a plurality of the court instructed lower federal courts to perform the balancing test set forth in pike bruce church,d,when considering dormant commerce clause challenges to nondiscriminatory flow control ordinances that benefit public facilities with only incidental effects on interstate commerce.united haulers.at.united haulers controls this case and requires us to vacate the district court grant of partial summary judgment and the resulting permanent injunction.because the district court should make necessary findings of fact and conclusions of law and perform the pike balancing test in the first instance,we will remand.
in,the pennsylvania general assembly adopted the municipal waste planning,recycling and waste reduction act.et act.act charges counties with the responsibility for planning and coordinating municipal waste disposal and ensuring adequate landfill capacity through recurring planning processes.the county complied with act by adopting the municipal waste management plan plan.as a result of a detailed study,the plan recommended that the county continue municipal waste disposal at a and landfill,various portions of which had been used by the glra since its formation in.the plan also recommended that the county enact a waste management ordinance,including a waste flow control plan 
the county adopted ordinance on june.ordinance implements the plan and grants the glra authority to control the county waste management.sections and of ordinance establish a licensing and waste flow control scheme regulating the collection and transport of all municipal waste generated within the county.section a requires that any waste collectors within the county obtain a license from the glra.both and private haulers may obtain a license and collect waste in the county,subject to a uniform tipping fee.the waste flow control provisions of section require the licensed collectors to deliver the waste to a designated facility unless permitted by rule,regulation,ordinance,or order duly issued by the glra.various provisions of ordinance authorize the glra to adopt rules and regulations,to issue and revoke licenses and collect license fees,to identify designated facilities,to set system tipping fees,to establish penalties for violations,to enforce penalties,and to perform other governing and administrative tasks.
pursuant to act protocol,the county amended the plan with the lebanon county municipal waste management plan plan.both the plan and the plan were submitted to and approved by the county advisory committee,subjected to public review,ratified by the municipalities in the county,and submitted to and approved by the pennsylvania department of environment protection dep the plan discusses the desirability of continued waste flow control to ensure adequate processing and disposal capacity to maintain sufficient revenue to cover the costs of planning,implementation,administration,recycling support,landfill monitoring,and enforcement and to ensure proper disposal of municipal waste,including recycling mandates.the plan also permits the glra to approve interstate waste shipments after it reviews the receiving facilities 
pursuant to the authority granted to it by ordinance the glra adopted regulations governing waste disposal in the county,most recently amending them on july.section v of the july,regulations designates one facility for municipal waste landfill the regulations allow a collector to deliver waste to another point of delivery with the glra prior written approval.under section x of the regulations,the glra can impose penalties for noncompliant transport of municipal waste to another site,including a fine of per occurrence 
in,under a license,lebanon farms hauled waste generated in the county.twice,on march,and april,the glra fined lebanon farms for transporting county municipal waste out of the county to the pine grove landfill in schuylkill county.at the pine grove landfill,lebanon farms drivers misrepresented the origin of the waste loads as berks county.lebanon farms did not request approval to haul waste to a site other than the glra landfill 
on april,lebanon farms brought this suit to challenge the flow control ordinances.the complaint alleged,inter alia,that the ordinances violate the dormant commerce clause.in count i,lebanon farms sought an injunction prohibiting the county and the glra from enforcing the ordinances,and it sought damages in count ii.counts iii,iv,v,and vi alleged,respectively,a violation of procedural due process retaliation a pendant state law claim for violation of act of.et and a pendant state law claim for an invalid monetary penalty assessment on july,the glra counterclaimed for breach of the licensing agreement and associated damages.
on july,the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of lebanon farms and against the county and the glra on count in light of c a carbone town of clarkstown,d and harvey harvey,county of chester,cir,the district court held that waste disposal is part of interstate commerce,that the flow control ordinances discriminated against interstate commerce,and that the ordinances failed the strict scrutiny standard for constitutionality.
in carbone,the supreme court considered a flow control ordinance that directed all of a town nonhazardous solid waste to a privately owned waste transfer station.at.the court stated that d iscrimination against interstate commerce in favor of local business or investment is per se invalid,save in a narrow class of cases in which the municipality can demonstrate,under rigorous scrutiny,that it has no other means to advance a legitimate local interest.id.at.emphasis added.under that standard,the court held that the ordinance discriminated against interstate commerce by hoard ing solid waste,and the demand to get rid of it,for the benefit of the preferred processing facility.id.
this court applied carbone in harvey by focus ing on the process of selecting waste service providers rather than on the effect of the regulation once a provider or providers have been chosen.at citing atl.coast demolition recycling,bd.of chosen freeholders of atl.county,cir.the court considered the flow control regulations of chester and mercer counties,pennsylvania.id.at.the chester county regulations designated and privately owned waste disposal facilities,although they capped waste flows to the private landfill.id.at.the mercer county regulations designated a single,private,waste disposal facility for all waste flows.id.at.we instructed 
to determine whether these flow control schemes actually discriminate against interstate commerce triggering strict scrutiny analysis the court must closely examine,for signs that bidders do not in practice enjoy equal access to the local market,the following the designation process the duration of the designation and the likelihood of an amendment to add alternative sites.
id.at.applying these criteria to the chester county regulations,the court noted that it appears that chester county designation process for the planning period did not afford other sites,including sites,a level playing field,but remanded to allow the district court to apply the principles in the first instance.id.at.the court in particular focused on the protectionist impact of the county financial interests because of its ownership of one of the waste disposal sites and its guarantee of debt secured by the waste authority on another site.id.at.with regard to the mercer county regulations,the court held that the facts certainly suggest that the process was fair,open,and competitive for the planning period,but that on remand the district court should consider if the specifications of the bid or decisional criteria had a discriminatory effect.id.at.
the district court in the case below applied harvey test to conclude that the county and the glra discriminated against interstate commerce.it found that the closed designation process,the long duration of the designation,and the unlikelihood of amendment all evidenced discrimination against interstate commerce.based on these determinations and pursuant to the authority of harvey,the district court applied a strict scrutiny standard of review to the flow control ordinances and rejected the county and the glra request that the court apply the alternative,pike balancing test reserved for nondiscriminatory laws directed at local concerns with incidental effects on interstate commerce.as a result,the district court declared the flow control ordinances unconstitutional because they violated the dormant commerce clause and permanently enjoined the county and the glra from enforcing those ordinances.the district court refrained from entering a final judgment,however,because genuine issues of material fact remained regarding the imposition of the monetary damages requested in count ii.the county and the glra appealed the entry of partial summary judgment on july,and on september,the district court stayed the request for monetary damages pending the outcome of defendants appeal.
on september,a separate panel of this court ordered briefing regarding the impact of the supreme court intervening decision in united haulers and,in particular,the significance,if any,of the plurality application of the balancing test set forth in pike 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and.we have jurisdiction under,which provides for review of the district court interlocutory order granting an injunction.we engage in plenary review of the district court grant of summary judgment.see,doe abington friends,cir.when reviewing final injunction orders,we must accept the trial court findings of historical or narrative fact unless they are clearly erroneous,but we must exercise a plenary review of the trial court choice and interpretation of legal precepts and its application of those precepts to the historical facts.int l union,united,aerospace agr.implement workers mack trucks,cir quoting universal minerals,hughes,cir.in contrast,we apply an abuse of discretion standard to the district court decision to grant an injunction.see id.at.because the issue before us is whether an intervening decision of the supreme court superceded the district court application of law,not the district court findings of facts,plenary review is appropriate here.
the intervening supreme court decision in united haulers controls the resolution of this appeal.for parts i and of united haulers,chief justice roberts authored a majority opinion joined by justices scalia,souter,ginsburg,and breyer.at.part of chief justice roberts opinion was joined by justices souter,ginsburg,and breyer,making it a plurality opinion.id.the plurality held that the pike balancing test applies to waste flow regulations benefitting public entities with incidental effects on interstate commerce.id.at.justice scalia did not join part,but concurred in the judgment.id.at.justice thomas also concurred in judgment,but did not join any part of chief justice roberts opinion.id.at.both justices scalia and thomas issued concurring opinions,concluding for differing reasons that the dormant commerce clause did not apply to the case,so the flow control ordinances should be beyond the scrutiny of the courts altogether.id.at scalia,concurring in part concurring that the dormant commerce clause does not apply to a flow control ordinance that benefits a public entity performing a traditional function and treats all private entities precisely the same way,but refusing to join the plurality application of pike because the balancing of various values is left to congress id.at thomas,concurring in judgment concurring in judgment only because the dormant commerce clause has no basis in the constitution and has proved unworkable in practice.because under the reasoning of their concurring opinions justices scalia and thomas would agree that a flow control ordinance that passes the pike balancing test is constitutional,the plurality conclusion in part is both the narrowest of the opinions and the common denominator of the court resulting decision,thus representing the holding of the court.see marks united states,d anker energy consolidation coal,cir rappa new castle county,cir planned parenthood of se.casey,cir holding that w hen six or more justices join in the judgment and they issue three or more opinions,the holding of the court is the opinion of the justice or justices who concurred on the narrowest grounds necessary to secure a majority,modified on other grounds,d king palmer,holding that the determinative question is whether the other concurring justices would subscribe to or agree with the reasoning of the narrower concurring opinion citing gregg georgia,d marks,at.the parties do not dispute that the plurality opinion in part is the holding of the court for that part 
united haulers recognized that there are two ways to violate the dormant commerce clause facial discrimination against interstate commerce,see united haulers.at holding that i n this context,discrimination simply means differential treatment of and economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter internal quotation marks omitted and where the burden imposed on interstate commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits,id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also raymond motor,rice,d pike,at.see generally or.waste,dep t of envtl.quality of,d explaining the two ways to identify a violation of the dormant commerce clause.
the court majority opinion in part of united haulers removes this case from the facial discrimination category of dormant commerce clause violations.united haulers held that flow control ordinances that benefit a clearly public facility and which treat private business interests exactly the same as ones,do not discriminate against interstate commerce for purposes of the dormant commerce clause.at.the united haulers majority distinguished carbone rigorous scrutiny analysis as applying only to regulations that favor private waste disposal sites,see.at,thus overruling harvey to the extent it supports the application of strict scrutiny to publicly operated waste disposal sites like the glra site,see at the court in united haulers explained that c ompelling reasons justify treating these laws differently from laws favoring particular private businesses over their competitors.at lebanon farms concedes that the flow control ordinances in this case benefit a public waste disposal site and treat private businesses exactly the same as ones.thus,in light of united haulers part we must vacate the district court grant of partial summary judgment,declaration that the ordinances were unconstitutional,and issuance of a permanent injunction against their enforcement,which were based on our harvey precedent our analysis does not end there,however.
concluding that a state law does not amount to forbidden discrimination against interstate commerce is not the death knell of all dormant commerce clause challenges,for we generally leave the courtroom door open to plaintiffs invoking the rule in pike,that even nondiscriminatory burdens on commerce may be struck down on a showing that those burdens clearly outweigh the benefits of a state or local practice.dep t of revenue of davis,d.the united haulers plurality in part concluded that nondiscriminatory flow control ordinances are properly analyzed under the test set forth in pike,which is reserved for laws directed to legitimate local concerns,with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.using the pike test,a court will uphold a nondiscriminatory statute like this one unless the burden imposed on interstate commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the flexible pike balancing test thus weighs the extent of the incidental burden on interstate commerce against the putative local benefits 
if a legitimate local purpose is found,then the question becomes one of degree.and the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved,and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.
pike,at.the pike balancing is carried out in light of our hesitation to interfere in internal policy decisions traditionally vested with local governments.for example,federal courts hold sacrosanct state legislation in the field of safety where the propriety of local regulation has long been recognized.pike,at.
in this case,although the parties agree that united haulers controls the outcome of this appeal,they disagree about the appropriate disposition.the county and the glra argue that united haulers mandates a per se finding that the flow control ordinances do not violate the dormant commerce clause,and the ordinances pass the pike balancing test because they are indistinguishable from the ordinances considered in united haulers lebanon farms argues that applying the pike balancing test instead of strict scrutiny yields the same result as the district court strict scrutiny ordinances still violate the dormant commerce clause thus,both parties ask us to apply the pike balancing test.
considering the strong language of the supreme court holding in united haulers,which found it unnecessary to decide whether the ordinances impose any incidental burden on interstate commerce because any arguable burden does not exceed the public benefits of the ordinances.at,we perhaps could conduct the balancing test on the record as it exists and even conclude that any incidental burden on interstate commerce does or does not exceed the public benefits of the presently considered ordinances.we will not do so,however.we find the second circuit opinion in united haulers ass solid waste management,cir,to be particularly instructive.the second circuit correctly predicted the supreme court eventual holding that f low control regulations like the ordinances,which negatively impact all private businesses alike,regardless of whether or,in favor of a publicly owned facility,are not discriminatory under the dormant commerce clause.id.at.it then admit ted a temptation to undertake the pike balancing test in the first instance,a temptation,which arises from the principle that waste disposal is a traditional local government function.id.at.the court nonetheless decided to resist the temptation to rule as a matter of law prior to adequate discovery and further argument by the parties,which will undoubtedly assist the district court in this determination.id.at.it concluded 
we hold that although it does not,in and of itself,give a municipality free reign to place burdens on the free flow of commerce between the states,the fact that a municipality is acting within its traditional purview must factor into the district court determination of whether the local interests are substantially outweighed by the burdens on interstate commerce.with that understanding,we reverse and remand for a determination of whether the counties flow control laws pass constitutional muster under the pike balancing test.
id.at.only after the district court conducted the pike balancing test and the second circuit affirmed did the supreme court plurality in part affirm the application of the test.see united haulers.at.
we will follow the approach of the second circuit.we will remand to the district court to conduct the pike balancing test and make findings of fact and conclusions of law for the record.in its present form,the record is incomplete regarding the burden on interstate commerce and,more importantly,the putative local benefits.because the district court did not have the benefit of the supreme court decision in united haulers and because we do not have the benefit of the district court findings of fact and conclusions of law under the now relevant standard,we will remand with instructions to apply the pike balancing test in accordance with part of united haulers.after development of a proper factual record,this court will be in a better position to review the district court factual and legal conclusions,if asked.
under the majority holding in part of united haulers,we will vacate the district court judgment in favor of appellee on count i of the complaint,the declaration that the flow control ordinances are unconstitutional,and the grant of a permanent injunction against their enforcement.we will remand to the district court with instructions to apply the pike balancing test in light of the plurality opinion in part of united haulers.the district court should make the findings of fact and conclusions of law necessary to consider count i under the pike standard and,if necessary,any other remaining issues in the action.
the glra is a municipal authority created under and authorized by the pennsylvania municipalities act.et.it is comprised of representatives of municipalities in the county.
throughout this opinion,we employ the term waste to refer to the municipal waste covered by the relevant plans and ordinances and as defined in act,pa.
tipping fees are disposal charges levied against collectors who drop off waste at a processing facility.they are called tipping fees because garbage trucks literally tip their back end to dump out the carried waste.united haulers.at.during the period relevant to this case,the glra set the tipping fee at per ton,including a per ton surcharge covering recycling programs,administration and enforcement costs,and costs for maintaining environmentally safe closed landfills.

section of ordinance,titled waste flow control,provides a delivery to designated facility.except as provided in b and c below,all regulated municipal waste shall be delivered to a designated facility.b delivery to other sites.delivery of regulated municipal waste to other sites pursuant to the plan may occur only as permitted by rule,regulation,ordinance,or order duly issued by the glra.c recycling.nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit source separation or recycling or to affect any sites at which source separation or recycling may take place.

under the new waste flow control system,a ny disposal facility,or hauler,applying for contractual approval to dispose of lebanon county municipal waste at an facility will be required to provide the same capacity assurance to the county which the glra has provided and thereby reduce the capacity assurance which the glra has provided the county for the remainder of the assured term.the facility will also be required to pay their sic fair share of recycling,enforcement,administrative,and environmental mitigation costs which would o
