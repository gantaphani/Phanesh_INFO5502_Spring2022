plaintiff ana obtained a favorable jury verdict on her claims of national origin and gender discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act.defendant department of health of the commonwealth of puerto rico department of health,her former employer,appeals from the judgment.the department of health contends that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,to a new trial on the grounds that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support the verdict,that plaintiff counsel made improper and prejudicial comments in closing argument,and that the award of in compensatory damages was grossly excessive,arguing that she was entitled to an award of front pay in addition to compensatory damages and back pay.
after careful consideration,we conclude that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding of national origin or gender discrimination.accordingly,we reverse and enter judgment for the department of health.
factual background 
we recite the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.visible.unisys,cir.
a native of puerto rico,is a physician specializing in family medicine.after working as the medical director of a treatment center for adolescents for some time,she applied for a job with the correctional health services program of the department of health.on april,entered into a professional services contract with the correctional health services program to work as an admissions director at the rio piedras correctional complex in that position,she supervised a team of medical and support staff and oversaw the medical screening and evaluation of inmates admitted to the correctional complex.initial contract with the department of health extended through june.her contract was renewed for the year beginning july,and was again renewed for the year beginning july.
in the fall of,the admissions center where worked in rio piedras was closed and the health services that had been offered there were moved to the bayamón correctional complex.all of the personnel who had worked at the rio piedras admissions center,including,were transferred to bayamón.on october,contract was amended to reflect her transfer.
after the transfer of the rio piedras health services and personnel to bayamón,the bayamón correctional complex had two admissions centers for inmate health services admissions center and admissions center directed the provision of health services at admissions center,while marcos devarie,a male physician originally from puerto rico,directed admissions center.devarie had first begun working for the correctional health services program in and had been the director of admissions center in bayamón since.
doctor francisco,the director of clinical services at the bayamón correctional complex and a native of the dominican republic,was immediate supervisor in bayamón.some time after october,an office clerk who worked at admissions center overheard saying that dominican doctors were better than the other physicians who were there,who were puerto rican.one physician working at admissions center described as a hard and aggressive person.
when first began working in bayamón in october,admissions center did not yet have certain equipment,such as an machine and phone service.the center received an machine and phone service in january.in the months before admissions center was fully equipped,physicians working at the center were given mobile phones for emergency calls and inmates in need of were transported to admissions center.admissions center also did not have a medical cadre,a group of custody officials assigned by the corrections administration to monitor inmates,although the center did have some security officials assigned by the corrections administration during this period,admissions center had a working machine,phone service,and a medical cadre.
following the transfer to bayamón,had a series of difficulties with her supervisor.prior to the october,transfer,the october medical shift schedule for admissions center had already been prepared by gualberto guerrero,a physician originally from the dominican republic who had been preparing the shift schedule for years.after the transfer,modified the october shift schedule,redistributing the medical shifts.for example,she removed several shifts from guerrero and two other physicians,bernarda cuevas and juan velez.she instead increased the number of shifts assigned to a male physician,ortiz,and gave shifts to two female physicians,diaz and pagan,who had not had any shifts in the original schedule prepared by guerrero.
as a result of the altered shift schedule,guerrero,velez and cuevas complained to that had taken away some of their regular shifts without notice.after comparing the october shift schedule with previous schedules,confirmed that had taken away regular shifts from the physicians who had lodged complaints.without discussing the matter with,returned several shifts to the complaining physicians and removed the additional shifts had given to ortiz,diaz and pagan,so that the distribution of shifts resembled the original schedule prepared by guerrero also ordered guerrero to continue preparing the shift schedule for admissions center,instead of.devarie,director of admissions center,prepared the medical shift schedule for his center.
also ordered some personnel working in admissions centers and to report to a centralized supervisor rather than their respective admissions directors.for example,he ordered all nursing personnel to report to the director of nursing,medical records personnel to report to the director of medical records,and radiology technicians to report to the health services administrator.
at some time after the transfer,complained to that two physicians,guerrero and patricia lópez,both from the dominican republic,were falsifying their time entries for payroll purposes.after investigating the complaint,concluded that there was no falsification or alteration in the time records and,without talking to,he dismissed her complaint.although guerrero ordinarily submitted his time records to for approval,after this incident directed guerrero to submit his time records directly to the human resources employee in charge of payroll,thereby bypassing.did not order any of the physicians supervised by devarie to submit their time records directly to human resources instead,those physicians continued to submit their time records to devarie for approval.
in march,was told by a correctional health services program staff person that she had been chosen to go to a medical training program in new york.she never attended the training,however,because informed her that he preferred to send devarie.also did not invite her to attend all monthly staff meetings.
on may,received a letter from hector,the executive director for the correctional health services program and a native of the dominican republic,stating that her contract expired on june,and would not be renewed for the year.after requested further explanation of the reasons for the nonrenewal,responded as follows 
during the current fiscal year the rio piedras correctional complex admissions center,where you were providing services as a director,was closed.it should be pointed out that the program had no say in the decision on this matter.for that reason it was necessary to amend the contract between the parties to state for the record that the services would be provided in the bayamón correctional complex,and the effective term thereof remained unaltered.
in view of the restructuring of the bayamón correctional complex,we have found it necessary to integrate the admissions service to create consistency with the operating structure in all the correctional complexes.every correctional complex has a single director for services since we can not justify the duplication of services,and this violates compliance and uniformity.
at trial,explained that he made the final decision not to renew contract upon the recommendation of.and both testified that they decided not to renew her contract based on a combination of two factors.first,after the transfer of services from rio piedras,they needed to restructure the bayamón correctional complex so that both admissions centers were under the authority of one admissions director.second,according to monthly reports over the period from october,admission center routinely had much lower compliance rates in treating inmates according to certain time tables and standards than devarie admission center.these compliance reports reflected how well the admissions center met established goals related to the provision of health services to inmates.
after contract was not renewed,both admissions centers at the bayamón correctional complex were placed under the supervision of devarie.
proceedings in the district court 
in september,filed suit against the department of health and several individual defendants,including and.her complaint alleged that the defendants chose not to renew her contract on the basis of her gender and national origin in violation of title vii,and related provisions of puerto rico law.following the dismissal of her puerto rico law claims and her title vii claims against the individual defendants,proceeded to trial on her title vii gender and national origin discrimination claims against the department of health.by the consent of the parties,a magistrate judge presided over the jury trial.see c.
at the close of a jury trial,plaintiff counsel made several comments in closing argument about the relationship in puerto rico between puerto ricans and dominicans that the department of health contends on appeal were improper and prejudicial.the department did not lodge a contemporaneous objection to the comments.the department of health did lodge an objection after plaintiff counsel stated that the jury should issue a verdict of at least million,which the court overruled.
the jury found the department of health liable for gender national origin discrimination and awarded million in compensatory damages.the jury verdict form asked whether the jury found that the department of health did not renew ana alvarado santos contract due to her gender or national origin,and the jury answered in the affirmative.thus we can not be certain whether the jury verdict rested on a finding of national origin discrimination,gender discrimination,or both.
both parties filed motions.moved to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to.b,requesting that the million compensatory damages award be reduced to in accordance with the applicable statutory cap.b d.she requested an additional award of in back pay and in front pay.the department of health filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under.b,arguing,inter alia,that no reasonable jury,on the evidence presented,could conclude that contract was not renewed based on her sex or national origin.it also moved for a new trial or remittitur under,contending that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence,the damages award was grossly excessive,and a new trial was required due to plaintiff counsel inflammatory remarks during closing argument.finally,in response to plaintiff motion to amend the judgment,the department of health agreed that the compensatory damages award should be reduced to no more than based on the statutory cap,but opposed her request for additional awards of back and front pay.
the district court denied the department of health motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial or remittitur.it granted in part motion to amend the verdict,reducing the compensatory damages award to in 
accordance with the statutory cap,awarding the requested in back pay,but denying the requested award of front pay.the court therefore entered judgment in favor of and awarded damages in the amount of.
this timely appeal and followed.
the department of health raises several contentions on appeal.it argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury determination that contract was not renewed based on her gender national origin,that the evidence was insufficient to support a jury finding that was an employee of the department of health,as opposed to an independent contractor,that plaintiff counsel made inflammatory and prejudicial comments in closing argument that require a new trial,and that the compensatory damages award was grossly excessive.we agree that,based on the evidence presented at trial,no reasonable jury could find that the nonrenewal of contract was based on her gender national origin.we therefore conclude that the department of health is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.in light of this conclusion,we need not reach the department of health remaining contentions.
we review the court denial of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.municipality of aguadilla,cir.we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and may reverse only if no reasonable person could have reached the conclusion arrived at by the jury.id.at.
the jury was instructed to evaluate claims of gender and national origin discrimination under the mcdonnell douglas framework.mcdonnell douglas green.under this framework,the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination.see lockridge of me,cir.the prima facie case varies according to the nature of the plaintiff claim but it requires,among other things,a showing of an adverse employment action.id.after the plaintiff has made this prima facie showing,the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.id.if the employer meets its burden,the focus then shifts back to the plaintiff to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the employer articulated reason for the adverse employment action is pretextual and that the true reason for the adverse action is discriminatory.id.
as to both the gender and national origin discrimination claims,we assume arguendo that met her burden to establish a prima facie case.at trial,the department of health,in turn,met its burden to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the contract nonrenewal.the department of health offered evidence that it needed to place both admissions centers in bayamón under the authority of one admissions director to achieve greater uniformity and efficiency,and it chose devarie for that position over due to the better compliance record at the center run by devarie.our focus is therefore on the ultimate question whether the evidence set forth at trial would enable a reasonable jury to find that the department of health proffered nondiscriminatory reasons are pretextual and contract was in fact not renewed because of her gender national origin.see id.
national origin discrimination 
as we described above,the department of health offered testimony from both and that they needed to consolidate the two admissions centers in bayamón under the leadership of one admissions director,and that they chose devarie to fill that role rather than because his admission center had a better compliance record.in an effort to meet her burden to show that,in fact,discriminatory animus based on her national origin motivated the employment decision,relied entirely on evidence of two facts the supervisors who participated in the decision to not renew her contract,and,are both originally from the dominican republic,whereas she was born in puerto rico,and at some point after the october,transfer to bayamón,commented that dominican doctors are better than puerto rican doctors.importantly,however,conceded at trial that devarie,the person that mena and chose to direct both admissions centers in bayamón,was puerto rican,not dominican.
in addition,offered no evidence that isolated remark about dominican doctors was close in time to the decision not to renew her employment contract was related to her,or was otherwise related to the employment decision.see straughn delta air lines,cir reasoning that although stray remarks may be material to the pretext inquiry,their probativeness is circumscribed if they were made in a situation temporally remote from the date of the employment decision,or were not related to the employment decision in question quoting mcmillan.soc y for the prevention of cruelty to animals,cir.based on this evidence,no reasonable jury could conclude that met her burden to show that the decision to not renew her contract was motivated by national origin discrimination rather than by legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons.
gender discrimination 
in support of her argument that her contract renewal was in fact motivated by gender bias rather than the legitimate reasons proffered by the department of health,relied primarily on evidence that on several occasions prior to her contract nonrenewal,she was treated differently than devarie.offered evidence of the following disparities in treatment in the first few months after the transfer of health services from rio piedras,admissions center did not yet have certain equipment that devarie admission center had,such as an machine and phone service after altered the october shift schedule and several physicians complained,directed guerrero to continue preparing the admission center shift schedule rather than,but permitted devarie to continue preparing his own shift schedule for admission center after complained that guerrero was falsifying his time records,investigated,found her complaint unfounded,and directed guerrero to submit his time records directly to human resources thereafter,but did not issue a similar order to any employees supervised by devarie and invited devarie to attend a training in new york,but did not invite 
characterizes these instances as differential treatment based on gender.however,in each case,beyond the mere fact that is a woman and devarie is a man,there is no evidence that any difference in how she was treated was based on gender,and ample evidence of legitimate reasons for her differential treatment.
for example,her first point of discrimination relates to the differences in equipment between center and center in the first few months after the transfer of health services from rio piedras.yet,there is no evidence that this difference had anything to do with her gender.rather,the testimony showed that center was a medical center,whereas center was a brand new facility created to receive the patients from the rio piedras facility that had to close.as such,it did not yet have all of its equipment.
similarly,on second point,that devarie was permitted to continue preparing his own shift schedule even after her scheduling duties were transferred to guerrero,there was no evidence that this difference in treatment had anything to do with her gender.rather,the testimony showed that gave guerrero the responsibility after altered the october shift schedule in a way that drew complaints from several doctors and that found unsuitable.there was no evidence that there had been any complaints about devarie assignment of shifts 
for her third point of differential treatment,says that guerrero was told to submit his time records directly to human resources,rather than to,whereas no such order was issued to any employees supervised by devarie.once again,there is no evidence that this change had anything to do with gender.instead,it was explained by determination that had made an unsubstantiated claim that guerrero was falsifying his time records.there was no evidence of a similar unsubstantiated complaint being made by devarie 
in summary,the record contains abundant evidence that and devarie were not similarly situated and that the differential treatments cited by were rationally based on differences between them.as noted,and testified that they decided not to renew contract because of the need to place the two admissions centers in bayamón under the leadership of one admissions director in order to achieve greater uniformity and efficiency.they further testified that they chose devarie for this position over based on their evaluation of the two admission centers and their review of monthly compliance reports,which indicated that devarie admission center had a significantly better compliance record than from october to may in addition,devarie had five more years of experience as an admissions director than.offered no evidence to rebut the showing that devarie admissions center had consistently higher levels of compliance or that devarie had more years of experience as an admissions director.
the evidence presented at trial was thus insufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that met her burden to show that her contract nonrenewal was motivated by gender discrimination rather than by legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons.
comments during closing argument 
the department of health also claims that it is entitled to a new trial based on the improper remarks of plaintiff counsel during closing arguments.because judgment is being entered for the department of health,there is no need to resolve that question.nevertheless,if we had to reach the closing argument issue on the merits,the department would have a good argument that it was entitled to a new trial.it may well be that the jury was influenced by the entirely improper and inflammatory closing argument by plaintiff counsel,pitting people from puerto rico against people from the dominican republic.
counsel made the following comments during closing argument 
all these people care is about their cronies from the dominican republic.they do care about puerto ricans,except that they want to take their money.that all they care about.
they came to this service with one specific purpose it was to take care of the inmates it was to profit,and not let others,such as women,and,to work with your money.
later in closing,plaintiff counsel stated 
your verdict has to be sufficient to show these individuals that in puerto rico we do not discriminate the number i submit to you should be herein no less than million.that is an amount that is gon na give them respect,it gon na show them what ball game we are about 
you have to send a message to pichardo and his cronies that this does happen in puerto rico what amount,if any,do you adequately say i submit to you that the number here is million.nothing less will clear this event.
ladies and gentlemen,do let it happen in puerto rico.you opened your arms to these people.they came in.you treated them fairly.and what do they do they stab you in the back.they stabbed her in the back because she a woman.they stabbed her in the back because she puerto rican.
that is not what martin luther king convinced a nation to do.
we are dismayed that,even while calling on the jury to uphold principles of equality and antidiscrimination,plaintiff counsel made inflammatory arguments to the jury based on the dominican nationality of some individual defendants.such arguments are clearly prohibited conduct and have no place in a court of law.smith kmart,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the judgment of the district court and order the entry of judgment in favor of the department of health.the parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.
so ordered.
during the period relevant to this case,the united states district court for the district of puerto rico was exercising supervisory authority over the correctional health services program as well as other aspects of the puerto rican correctional system.this supervision is the result of a inmate class action commonly known as the morales feliciano case,which dates back to.rullan,cir citing district court and first circuit opinions addressing the class action.during the period relevant to this case,the united states district court for the district of puerto rico was exercising supervisory authority over the correctional health services program as well as other aspects of the puerto rican correctional system.this supervision is the result of a inmate class action commonly known as the morales feliciano case,which dates back to.rullan,cir citing district court and first circuit opinions addressing the class action.
