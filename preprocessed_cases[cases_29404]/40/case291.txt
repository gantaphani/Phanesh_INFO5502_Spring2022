two issues are presented in the aftermath of a prior appeal in a civil rights case that has become moot due to legislative action.the first is whether the underlying injunctive order the plaintiffs obtained in the district court should be vacated on remand,given the reason for mootness of the appeal.the second is whether plaintiffs would,under these circumstances,remain entitled to the award of attorney fees in the now moot case and,if so,whether the fees the district court awarded were reasonable.we vacate the judgment and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss the action,and we affirm the district court award of attorney fees.
plaintiffs,a class of puerto rican residents who only speak english,sued members of the state electoral commission of puerto rico commission under,challenging the commission decision to print ballots in the november elections solely in spanish.the federal district court of puerto rico found for the plaintiffs on the merits and granted them a permanent injunction in august,which compelled the commission to print bilingual ballots in the november election.the district court later awarded plaintiffs attorney fees under in the sum of,less than the amount requested of.defendant ramon,who was president of the commission at the time,appealed from both the underlying judgment and the award of attorney fees.plaintiffs have from the diminution of their requested award,and the appeals were consolidated.
while these cases were pending on appeal,puerto rico passed legislation requiring the use of bilingual ballots in all future elections,and the governor signed the legislation,which is in effect.both parties agree this has mooted the underlying judgment.
plaintiffs and appellees,sylvia diffenderfer and robert mccarroll,are longtime puerto rico residents and registered voters who speak and read only english.on august,plaintiffs filed a putative class action suit under in the federal district court of puerto rico.they sued the president of the commission and the four commissioners in their individual and official capacities,arguing that the commission administrative decision to issue ballots for the november puerto rican elections only in spanish discriminated against and effectively disenfranchised voters who only speak english.
on august,the district court granted plaintiffs a permanent injunction directing the commission to immediately begin printing bilingual ballots for use in the november elections.in a written opinion issued september,the district court held that this relief was warranted on the grounds that the commission balloting policy violated the voting rights act,the first amendment,and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.see diffenderfer,d.on september,ramon,the president of the commission,filed a notice of appeal in the meantime,the commission complied with the injunction and used bilingual ballots in the november elections.
in april,the district court awarded diffenderfer and mccarroll attorney fees under because they had prevailed before the district court on the merits of the action.based on the lodestar method,the district court awarded a total of in attorney fees and litigation costs.the plaintiffs had requested.this amount was reduced by the court to account for duplicative and excessive hours and to adjust for plaintiffs practice of billing by the,which the district court found had produced an inflated number of billable hours.this fee was awarded only against in his official capacity as the president of the commission.see diffenderfer,d,initial order and judgment d,wl at,revised order and judgment appealed this award on april,and diffenderfer and mccarroll on may.
while these appeals were pending before this court,puerto rico enacted law,which mandates that bilingual ballots will be used in all future puerto rican elections.both parties agree that law mooted the appeal of the district court judgment on the merits.
the parties disagree,however,as to the proper disposition of that appeal and the effect this would have upon the appeal of the attorney fees award.diffenderfer and mccarroll argue that we should leave the district court judgment on the merits intact because voluntary actions in not seeking a stay pending appeal had rendered the case moot even before puerto rico passed law.they further argue that they are still entitled to attorney fees for costs incurred in the district court litigation,even if we were to vacate the district court judgment,because,inter alia,they obtained a favorable,material alteration in the legal relationship between the parties before the case became moot.finally,they argue that the district court abused its discretion in reducing plaintiffs award of attorney fees because of plaintiffs practice of billing in increments and request that the award of attorney fees be adjusted upwards to.their claim for attorney fees is limited to their work before the district court.
instead urges us to vacate the district court judgment on the grounds that vacatur is the general rule when a case becomes moot on appeal through happenstance,for instance due to intervening legislation like law.further argues that vacation of the underlying judgment would necessarily require reversal of the district court disposition of attorney fees.plaintiffs,he asserts,can not be considered prevailing parties in the district court if the district court judgment is vacated,and the district court award of attorney fees should therefore be reversed.he does not argue that plaintiffs were not otherwise prevailing parties before the district court or that the fees awarded were not reasonable.
also filed motions to substitute his successor as the president of the commission as the appellant and to consolidate the appeals of the district court judgment on the merits and its award of attorney fees.we granted the motion to consolidate but reserved judgment on the question of substitution of parties.
the first issue is the appropriate disposition of the appeal of the district court judgment on the merits of plaintiffs action.both parties contend,and we agree,that law mooted that appeal.under that statute,the commission must use bilingual ballots now that puerto rico has made bilingual ballots mandatory.because we can no longer issue any judicial remedy capable of affecting the parties rights,the case no longer presents a live case or controversy under article iii,and we lack jurisdiction to decide its merits.see city of erie pap,d horizon bank trust massachusetts,cir.we hold that the district court judgment should be vacated because it was rendered moot by an independent,intervening act of legislation.
as a general rule,federal courts of appeals vacate the judgment below when a civil case becomes moot during the pendency of an appeal.arizonans for official english arizona,d see also rusco steel,cir per curiam.vacatur,an equitable remedy,is ordinarily granted unless the losing party appealing the judgment was responsible for making the case unreviewable,for instance by failing to appeal or by entering into a settlement.see bancorp mortg.bonner mall,d shelby superformance int l,cir.in such cases,vacatur is inappropriate because it was within that party power to keep the controversy live and the judgment is therefore unreviewable only by choice.bancorp,at.when the losing party voluntary action causes the case to become moot,a presumption against vacatur applies,and vacatur is appropriate only when it would serve the public interest.id.at.
in contrast,v acatur is in order when mootness occurs through not attributable to the parties.arizonans for official english,at.vacatur,unlike a reversal of the district court judgment on the merits,does not reflect upon the underlying merits of the parties claims,which the court no longer has jurisdiction to determine.it is instead a remedy designed to prevent unfairness to the losing party,who would otherwise have to continue complying with an adverse judgment.bancorp at.see also kerkhof mci worldcom,cir explaining that vacatur is generally appropriate when mootness results from intervening events outside the losing party control.
