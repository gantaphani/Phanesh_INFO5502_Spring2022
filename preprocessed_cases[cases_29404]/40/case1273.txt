in december,qui tam relators hunter laboratories,and chris riedel the relators filed this civil action in the circuit court of fairfax county against multiple medical laboratory businesses.the complaint alleged that the medical laboratories had submitted false claims to the commonwealth of virginia for medicaid reimbursement,in contravention of the virginia fraud against taxpayers act the vfata.the defendants removed the action to the eastern district of virginia,and the relators the appellants here and the commonwealth the appellee here thereafter entered into a settlement agreement with certain of the defendants.in april,the district court awarded the relators a share of the settlement proceeds.on appeal,the relators contend that the court award was insufficient under the vfata.we are unable to reach that issue,however,because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the qui tam action.as explained below,we vacate and remand for a remand to the state court.
before turning to the facts of this case,we explain some pertinent aspects of the medicaid program.established in,the medicaid program provides joint federal and state funding of medical care for individuals who can not afford to pay their own medical costs.see.dep t of health human servs.ahlborn.although state participation in medicaid is voluntary,a state seeking federal funds for medicaid must first submit a plan for medical assistance to the secretary of health and human services the secretary.see.
the commonwealth of virginia participates in the medicaid program,and virginia law authorizes the commonwealth aptly named department of medical assistance services the dmas to submit to the secretary a state plan for medical assistance services.see.code ann.a.pursuant thereto,dmas is obliged to m ake,adopt,promulgate and enforce such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the commonwealth plan for medicaid services.id.b.dmas also receives and processes medicaid reimbursement claims submitted by healthcare service providers.see,dep t of med.assistance servs.beverly healthcare of fredericksburg,explaining that dmas determines reimbursement rates for providers of nursing home services to medicaid recipients.
under virginia law a relator may institute for the person and for the commonwealth a qui tam civil action alleging violations of the vfata.see.code ann.a on december,the relators filed the qui tam complaint in this case under seal in the circuit court of fairfax county.see virginia ex rel.hunter,quest diagnostics,ecf the complaint.the complaint alleged that the defendant medical laboratories violated the vfata in two ways by presenting false claims,in contravention of.code ann.a and by making or using false records or statements to obtain payment or approval of false claims,in violation of.code ann.a.as relief,the complaint sought damages,civil penalties,costs,and other appropriate relief as provided by virginia law.
in support of the vfata claims,the complaint alleged that the defendants made false claims for payment of laboratory tests by falsely representing that the fees being charged were no greater than the maximum fees payable pursuant to virginia regulations.see complaint relying on.admin.code.more specifically,the relators alleged that,d espite commonwealth regulations,the various defendants offered deep discounts for certain services to induce physicians,hospitals,and other healthcare providers to rely on one of the defendants facilities for most or all of their testing needs.see id.the relationships thereby established would generate pull through referrals of testing for patients covered by medicaid,see,for which the defendants would substantially overbill dmas when submitting their reimbursement claims,see id.in so doing,the complaint maintained,the defendants falsely represented that their fees complied with commonwealth medicaid regulations.id.
in addition to alleging that the defendants pull through practices violated the commonwealth medicaid regulations,the complaint maintained that those practices were independently unlawful as kickback schemes,strictly prohibited by federal health care programs pursuant to b a.see complaint.the relators emphasized that the discounts and overcharges described in the complaint are all the more egregious,because the defendant medical laboratories knew that federal law prohibits such kickbacks.id.the complaint failed to allege,however,that any violations of the federal statute rendered the reimbursement claims false under the vfata.indeed,the relators did not seek relief predicated on violations of federal law.
about five years after the qui tam complaint was filed,the commonwealth declined to intervene in the matter in august,the fairfax county court unsealed the complaint,and the relators proceeded to litigate their claims.in september,the defendants removed the action from the state court in fairfax county to the federal court in the eastern district of virginia,asserting that the vfata claims arose under federal law,pursuant to.
in support of removal to the district court,the defendants insisted that the complaint alleged a federal pull through theory of liability that hinges entirely on the interpretation and application of federal law.see more specifically,the defendants suggested that the relators had alleged practices that,if proven,constituted independently unlawful violations of the federal statute,which rendered subsequent claims for payment submitted to virginia false,and thus actionable under the vfata.id.citation omitted.in other words,the defendants maintained that,because the relators were obliged to show violations of federal law under the pull through theory to prove all required elements of the corresponding vfata claims,those claims arose under federal law.id.at footnote omitted.the relators did not challenge the removal to federal court or seek to remand the proceeding to state court,and the issue of subject matter jurisdiction was never litigated in the district court 
in may,the district court dismissed with prejudice all claims against defendants laboratory corporation of america and laboratory corporation of america holdings.on september,the relators,the commonwealth,and the remaining four defendants quest diagnostics incorporated quest diagnostics nichols institute,quest diagnostics,quest diagnostics clinical laboratories,and specialty laboratories,the settling defendants finalized a settlement agreement in this case the agreement pursuant thereto,the parties agreed that in exchange for,inter alia,dismissal with prejudice of the claims against the settling defendants those defendants would pay to the commonwealth,and that the commonwealth would then pay the relators a percentage of the applicable proceeds in an amount to be negotiated.see the agreement provides that it is governed by virginia law and that venue for addressing and resolving any and all disputes relating to th e agreement shall be the state courts of appropriate jurisdiction of virginia.id.at.
shortly after the parties finalized the agreement,the attorney general of virginia requested the district court to approve the sum of as the relators share of the settlement proceeds the relators opposed the commonwealth motion concerning their share of the settlement proceeds,insisting that the share proposed by the attorney general was not sufficient and that they were entitled to.in april,the district court entered an order approving the commonwealth proposal,awarding the relators as their share of the settlement proceeds.see virginia ex rel.hunter,quest diagnostics,ecf.
the relators have timely noted this appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to on april,prior to oral argument of the appeal,we sought supplemental briefing on whether the district court had possessed subject matter jurisdiction.by their supplemental briefs,the relators and the commonwealth assert that subject matter jurisdiction was proper in the district court.
the recognized limits on jurisdiction in the federal courts define the very foundation of judicial authority.see united states wilson,cir.as such,e very federal appellate court has a special obliga
